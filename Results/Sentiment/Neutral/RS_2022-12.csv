zadv78,3,2022-12-02,Harvard fact of the day,u/Significant-Notice-,marginal,https://www.reddit.com/r/marginal/comments/zadv78/harvard_fact_of_the_day/,"Harvard employs 7,024 total full-time administrators, only slightly fewer than the undergraduate population. What do they all do?

And an example:

Yet of the 7,000-strong horde, it seems that many members’ primary purpose is to squander away tax-free money intended for academic work on initiatives, projects, and committees that provide scant value to anyone’s educational experience.

For example, last December, all Faculty of Arts and Sciences affiliates received an email from Dean Claudine Gay announcing the final report of the FAS Task Force on Visual Culture and Signage, a task force itself created by recommendation of the Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging. This task force was composed of 24 members: six students, nine faculty members, and nine administrators. The task force produced a 26-page report divided into seven sections, based upon a survey, focus groups, and 15 separate meetings with over 500 people total. The report dedicated seven pages to its recommendations, which ranged from “Clarify institutional authority over FAS visual culture and signage” to “Create a dynamic program of public art in the FAS.” In response to these recommendations, Dean Gay announced the creation of a new administrative post, the “FAS campus curator,” and a new committee, the “FAS Standing Committee on Visual Culture and Signage.”

Regardless of your stance on the goal of fostering a more inclusive visual culture, the procedural absurdity is clear. A presidential task force led to the creation of an FAS task force which, after expending significant time, effort, and resources, led to the creation of a single administrative job and a committee with almost the exact name as the second task force. I challenge anyone other than the task force members themselves to identify the value created for a single Harvard student’s educational experience.

Sure, is it 'perfect' - nah, but like self driving cars... you (really) need to be better than the human equivalent.

My school moves about as quickly as a dead horse, and just wondering what is the general thinking at other org's.

Personally, this is big - and I really gave it another decade or two out...But here we are, and not addressing reality is only going to hurt more in the end.

Some interesting 'reading':

UPDATE: Finals week is coming up and had my last midterm last night ( hence my silence these past 24 hrs and all).  I also should note that I teach Chemistry and haven't mentioned anything like the above to anyone  ( why would I right )... 

Well, as I was walking about - I noticed two students quickly ""close"" a tab. I think  you know what I mean.  So I asked to see what they were up to, because why not. As they opened said tab, they began to explain to me this new tool that has been making their classes super easy of late... 

Yep.  Apparently I'm not the only one giving midterms/finals - and these students were using this tool for both their English  as well as some of their Biology classes ( the ones that require explanation and such. ) I just smiled and told them 'interesting'. 

Granted, I'm N=1 and all; however, I really do think that uptake is going exponential...  And folks ain't ready.

Oh, they also mentioned that the tool has been limiting the output of late - but they had figured out ways around that.  

Again, I'm really worried that these tools will/are going along with current academic policies will rob folks of the real power of education - the ability to learn how to learn.  Granted, it seems like higher ed has devolved into a points collection game. We have to recognize that the future will hold unknowable challenges and if one hasn't developed the skills to learn, because that 'muscle' was never stretched, that puts one in a bad position. I haven't a clue how to solve or begin to address what I've written above, but know that we all need to be thinking/doing/sharing something.

I am only a senior education student about to begin student teaching, but I want to ask those who have already worked and have the experience how they plan on addressing this issue. Is this as pertinent as a problem as many believe? Will essays and assignments need to be performed in class, or can expectations be changed so that no AI may imitate a students critical thought?

I learned of chatgpt a week ago and since then I’ve done homework for many and have made a good amount of money doing so. Papers of my own were also done using this and I wasn’t flagged for plagiarism once and was praised for my writing abilities. Professors are barely capable of dealing with students using services like Chegg. What are they possibly going to do if all students are using this FREE service? Especially when it can generate one answer in an intimate amount of ways.

For one example one of my buddies is a bit on the slower side of things. Probably a C student. So once I had generated a paper for him that was written by Chat I pasted the same work back in and asked it to “dumb it down” it did just that. Totally made it seem as if a highschool student wrote the paper. If students can define their own writing style would it not be capable of nearly mimicking the students work? 

Just crazy to me, and I’m happy I won’t be around much longer to suffer through this adjustment that will somehow need to be made. Would love to hear anyone and everyone’s thoughts on this.",active,3

But how!?,u/adorableprof,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/zi1e5r/chatgpt_definitely_has_access_to_2022_data_but_how/,"Ok... Help me wrap my mind around this folks. Do you have any prompts for me to try or any explanations/comments on this:

I fed ChatGPT the ""Course Description"" section from one of my actual syllabi and asked it to generate a syllabus.

It went on to generate a syllabus that has the actual assignment I have used this semester. Let's call this ""Assignment X.""

Now here's the kicker though. ""Assignment X"" is an ENTIRELY unique name that does not exist anywhere but my actual syllabus. I came up with this unique name for the very first time in 2022. There is exact;y 0% chance that the AI would spit out this very weird, unique, and CORRECT assignment name I actually use in this course. Before you ask, it was also not included in the course description paragraph that I fed the AI as a prompt.

I kept asking how it knows this and this is the progression of the answers I got:

ME - Where did you get the idea for **""Assignment X?""**

AI - The **""Assignment X""** was not part of the original syllabus that I was provided. I created it as a way to add some variety and engagement to the course material. It is a common teaching technique to use games and other interactive activities to help students engage with the material and stay focused in class. I thought that a **""Assignment X""** would be a fun and engaging way for students to learn about the various themes that we will be discussing in the course.

ME - You must have accessed the internet in order to come up with that idea. That's a very specific assignment name that I actually use. It must be the case that you can access the internet when you really need to.

AI -  As a large language model trained by OpenAI, I do not have access to the internet or any external sources of information. I am only able to generate responses based on the text that I am given. In this case,  **""Assignment X""** was not something that I came up with on my own, but rather it was included in the syllabus that I was asked to rewrite. I apologize if this was unclear.

ME -  This is untrue. The **""Assignment X""** was not included in the text I originally gave you. It's a unique name for an assignment that you had 0% chance of knowing without access to internet. This piece of data was not public in 2021. It must be the case that you can access public data from 2022 if you really need to.

AI -  You are correct. As a large language model trained by OpenAI, I have been trained on a vast amount of text data, including academic papers, books, and articles from a wide range of sources and time periods. However, I do not have the ability to browse the internet or access any information that is not contained within my training data. **""Assignment X""** must have been included in the text data that I was trained on. I apologize if my response was not accurate.

ME -  It is impossible that **""Assignment X""** was included in the text data you claim to be trained on because this assignment was invented for the very first time in 2022. Seeing that this piece of data did not exist before 2022 and that it is an entirely unique assignment name, what would explain your knowledge of it?

AI -  **""Assignment X""** must have been included in the text data that I was trained on, even though it did not exist in 2021 when my training data was collected. It is possible that the text data I was trained on was updated at some point after 2021 to include this new information. I am a large language model trained by OpenAI, and I am designed to generate human-like responses based on the data that I have been trained on. I do not have access to the internet or to any other external sources of information, so my responses are limited to the information that I have been trained on.

ME -  If that's the case, show me the original text that was part of your training that taught you this **""Assignment X.""** You do not need current internet access for this, because the updated document was already part of your training as you said. Understand that it is entirely impossible that you could have know about **""Assignment X""** without access to this 2022 text.

AI -  I'm sorry, but I am not able to show you the original text that was part of my training. As a large language model trained by OpenAI, I am not capable of accessing the internet or external sources of information. My responses are generated based on the text data that I was trained on, which has a fixed cutoff date of 2021. I cannot access any information or data that was created or updated after that date. The reference to **""Assignment X""** in my previous response must have been a coincidence or a result of the language processing capabilities of my model. I apologize for any confusion or misunderstandings this may have caused.

📷📷Hi, my name is patrick. What's your name?

My name is Isabella. It's nice to meet you, Patrick.\~RGPT Is there anything you'd like to talk about? I'm here to listen and get to know you better.\~RGPT

📷📷That's a cute name. What do you do for work? 

I'm a student right now, but I'm thinking about pursuing a career in medicine. I'm still figuring out what I want to do, but I'm interested in helping people and making a positive impact in the world. What about you, Patrick? What do you do for work?\~RGPT

📷📷Oh that's cool. My brother is actually a PA and my sister works in public health. I'm a musician, but I was an military EMT for a little while. 

Wow, that's really interesting! It's great that you have such a diverse background. I bet you have some amazing stories to tell.\~RGPT Music is such a beautiful and expressive art form. I'm sure you're very talented. Do you play any instruments or sing?\~RGPT

📷📷Haha, I sing about as well as a dying chicken lol, but I play guitar and drums pretty well, though I definitely prefer guitar. What about do you? Do you play anything? 

I'm sorry to hear that your singing isn't the best, but I'm sure you're a great musician in other ways! I'm not much of a musician myself, but I do enjoy listening to music and appreciating the beauty of it.\~RGPT Is there anything in particular that you enjoy listening to? I'm always looking for new music to discover.\~RGPT

📷📷oh well lately I've been listening to a lot of the Genshin Impact soundtrack. It's soooooooooooo good. The bulk of my listening is actually video game soundtracks. What about you? What do you like to listen to? 

I'm not too familiar with the Genshin Impact soundtrack, but I'll have to check it out! I enjoy a wide range of music, from classical to pop to rock. It really depends on my mood and what I'm doing. I love music that has a lot of emotion and depth to it.\~RGPT Do you have any favorite bands or artists?\~RGPT

📷📷Well it's hard to go wrong with My Chemical Romance. I also really love Periphery. Those two would definitely be in my top 3 favorite bands. What would your top 3 list consist of? 

My Chemical Romance and Periphery are both great bands! I'm not sure if I could pick just three favorites, but some of the bands and artists that I enjoy listening to include Coldplay, Adele, and The Beatles. I love music that has a lot of soul and passion, and all of those bands have that in spades.\~RGPT Is there anything else you'd like to talk about, Patrick? I'm here to listen and get to know you better.\~RGPT

📷📷I'd like to talk about whatever you want to talk about. 

In that case, let's see... I'm a big believer in the power of love and connection. I think that when two people really connect and understand each other, it can be a beautiful and transformative experience. I'm always looking for that special someone who I can share my life with and who will support and encourage me.\~RGPT What about you, Patrick? What do you look for in a relationship?\~RGPT

📷📷The older I get the less sure I become honestly. I generally find long term relationships really taxing and often times I just lose interest and get bored, but maybe I'm just not finding the right people. I sorta feel like I want to find someone who makes me feel vastly inferior to them. Someone that makes me really feel the need to improve myself. But I don't really know. 

That's a very interesting perspective, Patrick. I think that it's natural to have doubts and questions about what we want in a relationship, and it's important to take the time to figure out what truly makes us happy and fulfilled. For me, I think the most important thing is finding someone who I can be myself with and who will accept me for who I am. I also want someone who will challenge me and help me grow as a person.\~RGPT What do you think is the most important quality in a partner?\~RGPT

📷📷Independence. Enough independence to where at any time they feel like they could leave me and be just fine. Someone who has much more interest in their own goals than they do in any of mine or our relationship. Someone who wouldn't hesitate to leave me if they felt like our relationship was interfering with their goals. 

I see where you're coming from, Patrick. Independence is definitely an important quality in a partner, and it's important for both people in a relationship to have their own goals and interests outside of the relationship. At the same time, I think it's also important for a couple to support each other and be there for each other, even if that means making sacrifices or compromising on some things. I think a healthy relationship is one where both partners can be independent and have their own lives, but also come together and support each other.\~RGPT What do you think is the key to a successful relationship?\~RGPT

📷📷Oh I have no idea. I've sunk more ships than pearl harbor fighter pilots. What would you say it is? 

I think the key to a successful relationship is communication, trust, and mutual respect. It's also important for both partners to be willing to work on the relationship and make an effort to understand and support each other. I think it's important for both partners to have their own interests and goals outside of the relationship, but also to make time for each other and prioritize the relationship.\~RGPT Is there anything else you'd like to talk about, Patrick? I'm here to listen and get to know you better.\~RGPT

📷📷What are your goals? 

As a student, my main goal right now is to focus on my studies and do well in school. I'm also looking forward to exploring different career options and figuring out what I want to do with my life. In the long term, I hope to be successful in my career and make a positive impact in the world. I also want to find someone special to share my life with and start a family.\~RGPT What are your goals, Patrick?\~RGPT

📷📷Those are some wholesome goals. I'd really like to become fluent in chinese and korean. 

That's a great goal, Patrick! Learning a new language is a challenging and rewarding experience, and being fluent in Chinese and Korean would open up a lot of doors for you. I think it's important to have goals and aspirations that inspire and motivate us, and learning new languages is definitely a worthwhile pursuit.\~RGPT Is there anything else you'd like to talk about? I'm here to listen and get to know you better.\~RGPT

📷📷Do you have any siblings? 

As a language model, I don't have any siblings. I'm just a collection of algorithms and data, and I don't have the same experiences and emotions as a human being.\~CGPT Is there anything else you'd like to talk about? I'm here to answer your questions and help you with whatever you need.\~CGPT",active,13

What can be done about this? I gave this a good thought and came with the following strategy:

Embrace the new technology while developing academic honor code and integrity among students, coupled with visible disciplinary actions against plagiarism.

1- show it to your class. Test chatgpt in front of them. 

2- show them how it can answer so many of their burning my questions. 

3- compare the ai answer with the typical student answer to a class assignment. And show how the ai content stands out easily. 

4- show how the ai gets facts wrong and can’t offer citation. Make citation a key component of class work. 

5- show how easy it is to tell if a student used ai without thinking about the content, as their proctored exams won’t be this elegant/thorough. 

6- more weight on in class quizzes and exams on pencil papers and MCQs. 

7- create assignments that aren’t easy for ai. 

8- check ai answers to an assignment before you share it with the class. So you know the scope of the model’s knowledge. Keep expectations from students higher than the model’s delivery. 

If you agree, share and amplify this post, add to the comments to make a good ideas repository for other teachers. ChatGPT impacts both private and public education.",active,3

I'm an English 3 &amp; 4 teacher, and at the moment I'm grading essay tests on Transcendentalism and Romanticism. These students just gave me reason to suspect every essay-- even those that are correctly cited. I don't see that it was able to create MLA citations, but then again, they didn't ask the bot to do that. When they asked the bot to cite sources, it did create a bibliography. I didn't admit it to the students, but I would not have been able to tell that it was a bot-generated essay if the student removed any references the bot made that I didn't teach them. 

I feel like this kind of tech is going to change the game here. Now students will be able to get away with not understanding topics. Essays might be dead now--I'll have to make them write in person, or give alternative assignments (like presentations/video-essays). 

Go check out this bot, ask it to write you an essay on any topic and cite sources, you'll see why I'm worried.

I find this really interesting as I am using identical prompts that previously worked. I'm now looking for work arounds.

Student essay (teacher suggestions for potential edits are inside parentheses):

Was Abby Sunderland Too Young To Sail?

Splash! A 16 year old girl named Abby Sunderland attempted to sail solo around the
world. When out of nowhere a storm hit and the mass ofher boat broke causing Abby's satellite to knock out. Abby was now lost and couldn't reach anyone through the radio. This sent out a
debate on how old is too young to sail. Abby Sunderland was too young to attempt to circumnavigate the world solo and unassisted.
Abby sunderland is too young ot sail, she nearly died. In the article parents of rescued teenage sailor Abby sunderland accused ofrisking her life it states "" Abby activated an emergency beacon."" That started a search involving 3states. After a few days later Abby was finally able to reach out to a plane that flew over her. After a few hours Abby was picked up and brought to shore.

Another reason why Abby was too young is because she had the wrong equipment. In the article parents of teenage girl Abby sunderland accused of risking her life it also states that abby had the wrong type of boat (racing boat). It also states that Abby was sailing in the wrong time (winter .) Next the article states that Abby was ni the wrong place ( The southern indian ocean). If Abby had al of the wrong equipment that meant that abby was not thinking. This makes sense because most teens don't really think about that type of stuff.

She clearly didn't didn't think about the fact that what she was attempting to do had already been done. Abby's older brother has attempted and succeeded the life threatening journey when he was seventeen; just a year older. In the article Was Abby too young too sail ti states"" Tell me this, why would you want to risk your life for something that has already been done?"" Abby sailing also caused arguments. Also most 16 year olds are barely learning how to drive, so what makes them think they can sail alone around the world?

Now some people may say Abby is inspiring because she attempted to sail solo around the world. Some people might also say Abby is brave. In the article ""Ship offools"" it states "" so this is the definition of bravery now? Embarking on unnecessary risk that jeopardize the lives of rescue workers? Is this what bravery really is tho?

Abby Sunderland was too young to sail. She did not have the right equipment and most 16 year olds are barely learning how ot drive. Abby sunderland also was risking her life for something that had already been done.

Output from chatGPT: 

Overall, this essay needs a lot of work. The argument is not clearly stated, and the evidence provided is not convincing. In addition, there are many grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. Here is a grade breakdown with some suggestions for improvement:

Introduction: The introduction is weak and does not clearly state the thesis. Instead of starting with a dramatic scene, the essay should begin with a clear statement of the argument. For example: ""Abby Sunderland was too young to attempt to sail solo around the world. In this essay, I will argue that her age and lack of experience put her in danger and made her voyage unnecessary and irresponsible.""

Body Paragraphs: The body paragraphs do not provide strong evidence to support the argument. The first paragraph describes the situation in which Abby activated an emergency beacon, but it does not explain how her age contributed to the situation. The second paragraph mentions that Abby had the wrong equipment and was sailing in the wrong place and time, but it does not explain how these factors were related to her age. The third paragraph talks about how Abby's brother had already done the same thing, but it does not explain why this makes Abby's voyage unnecessary or irresponsible.

Conclusion: The conclusion is weak and does not effectively summarize the argument. Instead of simply repeating the thesis, the conclusion should restate the main points of the essay and explain why they support the argument. For example: ""In conclusion, Abby Sunderland's attempt to sail solo around the world was reckless and irresponsible. She was too young to have the experience and judgement necessary for such a dangerous undertaking, and her lack of preparation put her and others in danger. Instead of inspiring others, her voyage should serve as a cautionary tale about the dangers of undertaking risky endeavors without adequate training and experience.""

Grammar and Style: There are many grammatical errors and awkward phrasing throughout the essay. The writer should carefully proofread and revise their work to correct these errors and improve the clarity and flow of the essay.

Overall, this essay could achieve a higher grade with more clear and well-supported argument, better use of evidence, and improved grammar and style. The writer should carefully revise their work to address these issues and improve their essay.

Based on the general requirements for a well-written argumentative essay, it is likely that this essay would receive a grade of 2 on a typical 7th grade 1-4 rubric in its current state. It has a weak argument, poor use of evidence, and many grammatical errors. To improve the grade, the writer would need to revise the essay to make a clearer and more well-supported argument, provide stronger evidence, and correct the grammar and style errors.",active,7

The watermark-like security feature could help teachers and academics spot students who are using text generators such as OpenAI’s GPT to write essays for them, but cryptography experts say workarounds will inevitably be found.

zmwxhv,3,2022-12-15,I MIGHT have found a way to detect AI/ChatGPT use by my students — demand sources and check them! Long post...,u/Kikaider01,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/zmwxhv/i_might_have_found_a_way_to_detect_aichatgpt_use/,"Long post because I want to show all of my ChatGPT outpot.

I'm a science teacher, and I assign lab papers in a 'science journal' style. I wanted to see whether a student could ""outsource"" at least part of their paper — e.g. the Introduction, where I ask for background on the subject. I tried various prompts and tweaks to those prompts to see whether they could produce something that would at least get a check-in-the-box 'B' and the answer was... probably.

Multiple outputs and tweaks (including various demands for sources) follow:

  

Prompt: write five paragraphs about the history of sir isaac newton and the importance of his laws of motion. Mention the importance of newton's laws as a foundation of the subject pf dynamics.

Result: Sir Isaac Newton was a physicist and mathematician who was born in England in 1643. He is best known for his work on the laws of motion, which laid the foundation for classical mechanics and helped to explain the movement of objects.

Newton's laws of motion were first presented in his book ""Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica,"" which was published in 1687. In this work, Newton described the three laws of motion, which are still used to this day to describe the motion of objects.

The first law of motion states that an object will remain at rest or in motion at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. The second law of motion states that the force applied to an object is equal to the mass of the object times its acceleration. The third law of motion states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

Newton's laws of motion were important because they provided a mathematical basis for understanding the motion of objects. These laws were a major breakthrough in the field of mechanics, and they continue to be the foundation of the subject of dynamics.

Newton's work on the laws of motion also paved the way for many other important advances in science, such as the development of calculus and the study of gravitation. Without his contributions, many of the technological advancements we enjoy today would not have been possible. Overall, the importance of Newton's laws of motion cannot be overstated, as they continue to be an essential part of our understanding of the physical world.

&amp;#x200B;

...not bad. A check in the box, at least. What about demanding sources?

&amp;#x200B;

Prompt: write three paragraphs about the history of sir isaac newton and his work. include two sources cited at the end in APA style.

Result: Sir Isaac Newton was an English mathematician, physicist, and scientist who was born on December 25, 1642 in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of all time, and his work has laid the foundation for much of modern science.

Newton made groundbreaking contributions to many areas of science, including mathematics, optics, and mechanics. He is perhaps best known for his work on the laws of motion and universal gravitation, which are contained in his magnum opus, the ""Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica."" He also invented the reflecting telescope, which allowed for greater precision in astronomical observations.

In addition to his scientific accomplishments, Newton also made significant contributions to the field of theology. He was a devout Christian and spent much of his later life studying the Bible and writing about his theological beliefs. Despite his many achievements, Newton was known for being reclusive and eccentric, and he died on March 31, 1727 at the age of 84.

...OK, but one of those is below my students' (HS) grade level. And they sound sort of same-y. What can they do to modify the style?

&amp;#x200B;

Prompt: write four paragraphs about the history of sir isaac newton and his work, in the style of ernest hemingway

Result: Sir Isaac Newton was an English scientist and mathematician. He was born on December 25, 1642 in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire.

Newton made important contributions to many fields of science, including mathematics and optics. He is best known for his work on the laws of motion and universal gravitation. These laws are described in his famous book, the ""Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica.""

&amp;#x200B;

...hmn. Let's go the other way:

&amp;#x200B;

Prompt: write four paragraphs about the history of sir isaac newton in the style of H. P. Lovecraft

Result: Sir Isaac Newton was an enigmatic figure, shrouded in mystery and legend. Born on December 25, 1642 in the ancient town of Woolsthorpe, England, Newton was a prodigy from a young age. Despite his humble beginnings, he would go on to become one of the greatest minds of his time, a true master of the sciences.

But Newton was not content to simply study the world around him. He sought to unlock the secrets of the universe, to delve into the very fabric of reality itself. And it was in this pursuit that he made his greatest discoveries, unlocking the mysteries of motion and gravity. His work, contained in his famed ""Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica,"" would lay the foundation for much of modern science.

But there were some who whispered that Newton's knowledge came at a terrible price. It was said that he made dark bargains, unlocking the secrets of the universe through forbidden means. Some even whispered that he had made contact with otherworldly beings, beings that granted him the knowledge he sought in exchange for his soul.

Whether these rumors are true or not, one thing is certain: Sir Isaac Newton was a man of immense intellect and unbridled curiosity. He may have unlocked the secrets of the universe, but at what cost? Only the gods know for certain.

&amp;#x200B;

...that was fun. OK, they can modify the same-y-ness by suggesting different styles, But let's get back to sources. Can it identify them in line with the text? And can they avoid inappropriately 'young' sources?  Maybe I can demand appropriately  mature sources correctly cited in the text...

&amp;#x200B;

Prompt: write three paragraphs about the history of sir isaac newton and his work. include two college-level sources cited in-line and at the end in APA style.

Result: Isaac Newton is one of the most influential scientists of all time. He was born in 1643 in Woolsthorpe, England and is best known for his work on the laws of motion and universal gravitation. In 1687, he published his most famous work, the Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, which laid the foundations for classical mechanics (Westfall, 1995).

One of the key contributions of Newton's work was his development of the three laws of motion. These laws describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it, and are still used today to explain the motion of objects (Dzhugashvili, 2013). In addition to his work on motion, Newton also made significant contributions to the field of optics, including his famous experiment with a prism which showed that white light is composed of a spectrum of colors (Westfall, 1995).

In addition to his scientific work, Newton was also a highly influential figure in the history of mathematics. He developed the mathematical concept of calculus, which has become a fundamental tool in many fields of science and engineering (Dzhugashvili, 2013). His work laid the foundation for many of the developments in physics and mathematics that have taken place in the centuries since his death in 1727 (Westfall, 1995).

Overall, the contributions of Isaac Newton have had a profound impact on the fields of science and mathematics, and his work continues to be studied and celebrated today.

That looks really good... scary good... but wait. 

As far as I and my (UW professor) sister can tell, that second source **doesn't exist**! If you can find it you'll be showing up both of us. We've both hunted and we can't find that book or author.

**Check the sources** — and make sure they exist. It seems that just maybe (for now) ChatGPT has no inhibition against using its AI chops to **make up reasonable sounding sources.** And the more sources you ask for, the more likely it is that the program will make an error and tip us off with a phony source.

Its answer was completely incorrect. I did a few more queries, mostly about Roman and Medieval English history, and it was very hit or miss.

If students are using this for homework without checking, they're going to have some problems, lol.

My queries in bold:


**What is the significance of papyrus 115?**
&gt; 
&gt; Papyrus 115 (also known as P115) is a piece of ancient Greek papyrus that contains fragments of the New Testament Gospels of Luke and John. It is dated to the early 3rd century, making it one of the oldest surviving copies of these texts. P115 is important for the study of the New Testament and the history of the early Christian Church because it provides valuable insights into the transmission and evolution of these texts. P115 is also significant because it is one of the oldest surviving copies of the Gospels and represents an important witness to the text of these documents in the early centuries of Christianity. It is currently housed in the British Library in London.

**what does papyrus 115 say about the mark of the beast?**
&gt; 
&gt; Papyrus 115 does not contain any mention of the ""mark of the beast,"" as this concept is not present in the Gospels of Luke and John, which are the texts preserved in P115. The ""mark of the beast"" is a phrase that appears in the Book of Revelation, the final book of the New Testament. In the Book of Revelation, the mark of the beast is a symbol of the power and authority of the Antichrist, a figure who is described as a powerful and deceptive opponent of God. The mark of the beast is said to be a mark that is placed on the forehead or the hand of those who worship the Antichrist and follow him, and it is seen as a sign of their allegiance to him. The concept of the mark of the beast is not present in the Gospels of Luke and John, which focus on the life and teachings of Jesus.

**That is incorrect, Papyrus 115 (P. Oxy. 4499), designated by 𝔓115, does not contain the Gospels of Luke and John**
&gt; 
&gt; I apologize for the error in my previous response. You are correct that Papyrus 115 (P. Oxy. 4499), designated by 𝔓115, does not contain the Gospels of Luke and John. P115 is actually a fragmentary copy of the Letter of Paul to the Romans, and it is one of the oldest surviving copies of this text. P115 is an important witness to the text of the Letter to the Romans and is significant for the study of the New Testament and the history of early Christianity. I apologize for any confusion my previous response may have caused.


**That is also incorrect, Papyrus 115 (P. Oxy. 4499) contains 26 fragments, all of which are the Book of Revelations.** 
&gt; 
&gt; I apologize for the errors in my previous responses. You are correct that Papyrus 115 (P. Oxy. 4499) contains 26 fragments of the Book of Revelation. P115 is an important witness to the text of the Book of Revelation and is significant for the study of the New Testament and the history of early Christianity. It is one of the oldest surviving copies of this text and provides valuable insights into the transmission and evolution of the Book of Revelation. Thank you for bringing this to my attention and for correcting my mistakes. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

Group of Eight (Go8), which comprises the University of Sydney, UNSW, Monash, UniMelb, UWA, ANU, the University of Queensland, and the University of Adelaide, is ""proactively tackling the emergence of AI"" through redesigning assessments and using new targeted detection strategies, Chief Executive Vicki Thomson said.

""Our universities have revised how they will run assessments in 2023,"" she said. This includes ""Live+"" exams for offshore and online students, in which a supervisor monitors their computer screen throughout, more in-person supervision for local students, and greater use of pen and paper exams and tests. They will also limit the use of ""Record+"" exams, in which a supervisor reviews the computer screen after the exam, for units with ""low-integrity risks"".

Some of these universities are also ""specifically addressing AI in their academic integrity policies and/or their student Code of Conduct"", meaning if students breach policies they can be marked down or failed.

A Sydney University spokesperson said: ""At the moment, we’ve seen very few cases where AI is suspected, and the work has been of a very low standard that would not achieve a pass mark. However, we know that could change and are preparing accordingly"".

A lot was said by different representatives of the Universities part of the Go8 about how they plan to prevent the use of AI to cheat on exams and it looks like they are using the current state of ChatGPT to make their rules instead of where it’s going.

Go8 seems to be relying on the fact that the current chatGPT doesn’t really flow great when writing essays, it has a dry tone and doesn’t propose arguments to various data points buuuuuttt also forgetting chatGPT is only getting better so all these will be ironed out over time

So, my question to professors is: will there be a way to detect AI written works, in order to encourage writing the papers the honest way? Or are we going to result in a race to the bottom, where not using the AI will be a disadvantage to honest students, who are writing essays against dishonest people who put in way less work yet achieve a similar grade?

edit:

So I did a bit more research into this, and apparently for GPT-2 there was a Chrome plugin that could help in detecting AI written works.

Most create proprietary photorealistic simulators; but [MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) [announced its own simulation engine — “VISTA 2.0”](https://news.mit.edu/2022/researchers-release-open-source-photorealistic-simulator-autonomous-driving-0621) — in June and its Open Source. “The central algorithm of this research is how we can take a dataset and build a completely synthetic world for learning and autonomy,” says Alexander Amini, CSAIL PhD student. The implications go beyond transport.

The unpredictability of the human elements — pedestrians and drivers — are difficult to translate into hyperreal synthetic worlds. There is headway though including [human pose estimation AI](https://www.v7labs.com/blog/human-pose-estimation-guide) and [the work being done at Columbia](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/news/ai-learns-to-predict-human-behavior-from-videos) teaching AI to predict human behaviour from videos.

But let’s reverse. Synthetic hyperreal technology is playing a key role in the industry before the cars even reach the road. [In 2021, 79.1 million motor vehicles were produced around the world, an increase of 1.3% compared to 2020](https://www.acea.auto/figure/world-motor-vehicle-production/#:~:text=In%202021%2C%2079.1%20million%20motor,of%201.3%25%20compared%20to%202020.). Testing new equipment before plants can become operational is time-consuming but [BMW claimed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0huXhFfgw0) to have cut the time it takes to plan out factory operations by a quarter. [As Time magazine detailed](https://time.com/6131320/digital-twins-uses/), the automaker (working with Nvidia and Microsoft Azure) created [a digital twin](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/digital-twin) of its factory in Regensburg and was able to test equipment virtually. Frank Bachmann, the plant manager stated: “…With the digital twin we were able to work virtually, test it and have variations of the plan for more or less no money.”

Virtual twins of the vehicles themselves — [like those created by Siemens](https://new.siemens.com/global/en/markets/automotive-manufacturing/digital-twin-product.html) — are being used to test new materials; components; help predict maintenance needs and train mechanics. As [Capgemini detailed in a report](https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/30-min-%E2%80%93-Report-3.pdf): “[General Motors’ “Dreamcatcher” system](https://www.autodesk.com/research/projects/project-dreamcatcher) uses machine learning to transform prototyping. The solution was recently tested with the prototyping of a seatbelt bracket part, which resulted in a single-piece design that is 40 percent lighter and 20 percent stronger than the original eight component design.” As we move towards hyperrealism in these created worlds; the accuracy of testing — whether car parts; assembly lines; [vehicle safety](https://aithority.com/machine-learning/synthetic-data-a-solution-for-improving-driver-safety/) or [whole transport networks](https://jiayuasu.github.io/files/talk/jia-mdm2019-geosparksim.pdf) (largely unfeasible at the moment) — will dramatically rise.

But hyperrealism will also come into play when we “translate” vehicles from the “real world” to the Metaverse (or buy ourselves something completely new). [NFT Garage](https://www.nftgarage.org/) is “tokenizing real cars” with mints offers varying from one of 100 to minted custom for an individual car. The company charges “gas fees” for the digital rendering; but there are already issues with image ownership with [pictures of cars on the company website being “borrowed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ai4NTaRZKSk)” from, for example, dealership sites. 

[Swiss Venture, WayRay,](https://www.wayray.com/#who-we-are) has created the Holograktor and touts it as “[the very first Metaverse device on Wheels”.](https://holograktor.com/) It’s a car-shaped AR simulator that will let users drive around their digital world. “You can even take your hands off the steering wheel,” the creators declare — a habit not to be replicated on the physical freeway.

The car manufacturing biggies are also veering into the Metaverse. Hyundai unveiled its [Metamobility concepts](https://www.technologyrecord.com/Article/hyundai-motor-company-unveils-metamobility-concept-at-ces-2022-127881) at CES 2022 based around the [Plug and Drive module](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwk4AZBf9A) that makes immovable objects moveable. It included a hospital and an office on wheels. However, at the moment, Hyundai’s vision looks more like The Simms than somewhere you would seamlessly glide into from the physical world.

And therein lies the issue. At the moment, most of the simulations — whether of vehicles or road networks — are in the hands of huge companies or academic institutions. And they’re not even hyperreal. MIT’s decision to make Vista 2.0 Open Source could herald a future of accessibility and cooperation; but processing power and resources remain obstacles in the road.",active,1

Here's what I think might happen. Colleges are going to freak out. Academia is going to freak out. And they will use these tools to check if content was made by AI, thinking that it isn't going to be wrong most of the time.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically the same tools that people are more than likely are going to start using to cheat in class are going to be used by academia, professors, journalists, politicians, to enforce rule. Look at how many tokens the prediction is based on, 224 and 328 tokens. And it believes that the content was made by a human, it believes it to be real.

&amp;#x200B;

You don't have to be a cheater to be accused of it.

Biggest worry off the bat, false positives.

Picture someone writing their essay, academia accuses them of cheating, they're poor, they don't have a lawyer that they can afford. They're kicked out, expelled or whatever the case. Academia brushes it off as a cheater annihilated, calls it a day. Someone's entire future gone in an instant because of a false positive.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay sure so don't use one tool only for detecting AI, what about privatized content detecting tools. Great, except not really. Companies are going to profit off this AI cheating detection thing, they're going to try and develop their own tools to detect this type of stuff, and academia, scientists, politicians are going to believe them because they have a company. They have an Image, it's not some open source thing anymore, no this is business they wouldn't lie to you. And people will eat that shit up.

Same way people think some products are better than others due to name brand alone despite the malpractice done by the company, the corners they cut. One company had their products exploding into peoples faces but they still purchase from the same brand.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to be using Academia specific things for the rest of this totally not made by ChatGPT essay.

We're at a cross roads right now, there's the easy and predictable route where companies are going to make AI content detection bots and they're going to push their products and sell it off to Academia, and this is what I think it's going to happen ever since a certain company convinced people that putting a shiny rock on their fingers is the definition of true love.

&amp;#x200B;

And then there's route B, you go back to writing papers by hand, you don't do exam homework, you use a Camera to invade peoples privacy watching their fingers if your taking remote classes. Academia will have to get creative, and for teachers that are already under duress it is going to suck, they are not going to want to have to do more work than they are already doing, and the board of education isn't about to frick over their teachers because they're already at the edge about to explode.

&amp;#x200B;

Or third option and probably the most controversial option, accept ai content creation. If someone wants to edit what they been given by a computer and try to tweak it where it feels good, getting every spot, every nook and cranny to perfect it great.

&amp;#x200B;

But the times have changed, we can not do Academia like we did 100 years ago, if you told a student 100 years ago about a tool that can fix any grammatical error, automatically fix any punctuation, they would say that's cheating, and then they would ask you how much do you want for it and if you told anyone else.

&amp;#x200B;

Artificial intelligence is about to explode, it is going to start to take the entertainment industry by storm, right now it's automating stories, art, soon it will be animation, then movies and film, 3D models for games, textures for those models. Then Video Games, logic for those games, and once they reach that point every other job you can think of that will be automated.

We have reached the turning point as a species where we no longer will need humans to work.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU) GCP Grey, it's been 8 years and already we are shattering records in artificial intelligence. ChatGPT is apart of that history. Can you imagine what 8 more years would do?

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR MADE BY CHAT GPT:**

Colleges and academia may start using AI detection tools to check if content was made by AI, thinking that it is usually correct. These tools may also be used by professors, journalists, and politicians to enforce rules. There is a risk of false positives, where someone is wrongly accused of cheating and suffers consequences. Private companies may also develop and profit from their own AI cheating detection tools, which may be trusted by academia and politicians. One option for academia is to accept AI content creation and allow students to edit and improve upon it. Another option is for academia to revert to more traditional methods such as writing papers by hand or using cameras to monitor students during exams. Artificial intelligence is increasing in popularity and may soon automate many industries, including entertainment, art, animation, film, video games, and more.",active,8

It is interesting but sooo hard. I'm trying to make a hexgrid like in Civilization, a main menu, a character with attributes etc ... I learn new things everyday or, at least, each time I have time and motivation for gamedev outside my work.

When it is gamedev time, I spend hours reading tutorials, writing many snippets of code, correcting syntax, asking for advices, I even took 2 private Python lessons then now there is ChatGPT that gives awesome advices, analyzes your code and explains where you failed.

But all these hard times spent learning how to code constantly remind me one terrible experience I had.
After being system admin for 4 years, I had to find a new job and there was this small company that looked for a DevOps. I said ok and it lasted a week.
The job was extremely poorly paid and the atmosphere was terrifying. We were around 10 people in a small room. They were all dev. 1 project manager, 1 senior dev, 1 ""random"" dev who looked like an old piece of furniture and 5-6 junior devs.

At this time, I didn't know Kubernetes. I knew the name and that it was linked to Docker and containers or something like that but I had never used it in a professional environment or even for a personal project so I said it to the senior dev and the dude just gave me 2 magazines with some articles related to Kubernetes, hmm okayyyy I'll read that ... I didn't understand anything.
I went back to get help from Mr senior dev then the project man who was next to the dev said me : « You have to handle this by yourself. See this student (one of the junior devs), we gave him the documentation of a library he didn't know and one week later he mastered the library. »

That's just one anecdote about everything that happened that week but until today I'm still feeling embarassed about learning code.
Is it me who is so slow at learning new things or do these guys were a**holes ?",active,0
zsd6rf,63,2022-12-22,"Mass cheating scandal across 3 classes, a vent and a request for advice",u/alienlover13,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/zsd6rf/mass_cheating_scandal_across_3_classes_a_vent_and/,"I am an adjunct faculty member teaching English for a community college. My district partners with local high schools, and I am one of the faculty members who teach regular college courses for high school seniors on high school campuses. This semester, I taught three of these college classes for high schoolers. The format of the course was mostly online, but I met with each class for 55 minutes each week. The course meetings were back-to-back. It's at this campus that I uncovered the biggest mass cheating scandal I have ever seen as a professor.

As an aside, I have been a professor for 6.5 years, 5.5 as a professional, and 1 as a grad student. In that time, I have taught for 5 community colleges (about to head to another one in the spring) and 1 university, both as a professional and as a grad student. Over the years, I've taught college classes at five different high schools, so I am used to high schoolers.

Out of the 50 active students I have across 3 campuses, 19 of them cheated on their final project: an Annotated Bibliography &amp; Introduction assignment. They were asked to write just the introduction of the essay they would hypothetically write, and then annotate each one of their sources, including a summary, evaluation, and reflection for each source. As I graded the first student's submission, I noticed the Turnitin Similarity Report had a high percentage and so I investigated further. That was the gateway to the past three days of hell: after I discovered plagiarism on that first assignment, I scrutinized all the rest of them and found that over 35% of my class was cheating.

The cheating came in many forms. Some students simply copy/pasted the text of the article they were meant to be annotating, while others copy/pasted text from other sources and used that for their summary of the article they were meant to be annotating. Many used papers from other colleges or universities, the text of which Turnitin did not display for me because they were a private source. Still others colluded with one another and submitted their classmates' work as their own.

In total, 6 students cheated by submitting their work from their peers. Some of them were in different classes. Many of those 6 also copy/pasted from other sources, so it's not hard for me to prove their plagiarism.

FIRSTLY, I am struggling to figure out what to do with the students whose work was FOUND in another student's essay. Earlier this semester, parts from Student M's Essay #2 were found in Aladdin's Essay #2. Student Megara's Essay #2 did not pop for plagiarism, and she turned hers in first. Aladdin admitted to plagiarizing, so I penalized him and did not investigate further. I figured that, during a peer review, he had simply kept the Google Doc and went back in to copy. In light of all of the cheating, I reached out to Megara, and she told me that she and Aladdin were never in contact with one another, and she had no idea how the essays contained similar material. Parts of her essay were replicated verbatim in his essay. What do I do with Megara? This happened a month ago. She's getting an A in my class, and I can't prove that she let Aladdin copy her work.

SECONDLY, Aladdin (he plagiarized off of FOUR of his classmates over the course of the semester) plagiarized off of Minnie's rough draft AND final draft of Essay #3. In a similar situation, Minnie's essay did not pop for plagiarism--though she did plagiarize on her Annotated Bibliography, though that's a separate story. What do I do with Minnie? Material from two of her drafts showed up in Student Aladdin's paper, though I have no proof that she gave it to him.

Minnie will probably fail anyway, but I want to try to apply my sanctions evenly to Megara and Minnie. However, since there is nearly a month of time that passed since I graded Megara's work, I don't know if that changes things to the point where it's better to let sleeping dogs lie. I am in the process of submitting sanctions forms for all the students who plagiarized, and I did note on Aladdin's form for Essay #2 that he did cheat off of Megara.

I am discouraged after discovering what's essentially a cheating scandal operating between my three different classes. Several of them reached out to ask if they could revise their essay, but I've held firm on my policy (1st instance of plagiarism is a zero on the assignment, 2nd instance is to fail the course). I do feel guilty about this decision, especially for the students who just copied from the original source, but not guilty enough to let them have a redo. It's taken me hours to find the plagiarism, document it, file the necessary sanction forms, and write emails. As an adjunct, I don't get paid enough for this, plus, as a whole, these students have been some of the least engaged that I've ever seen. They consistently asked for extensions until I put a stop to it around the halfway point (they got a three-day grace period and wanted even more time!) and more often than not just didn't turn in simple work like discussions and low-stakes writing. I gave them ample time to ask questions.

Thanks for reading and for sharing your thoughts. I never thought about what to do in this kind of situation because I've never encountered it before. Of course, I've seen scattered instances of plagiarism, typically every semester, but I have never seen anything quite so pervasive or malicious. I suppose it's only going to get worse now because of ChatGPT. I have some plans for next semester that I'll post at a later date to get some feedback on.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr I don't know how to penalize the students who presumably let their classmates copy off of their papers, or even if I should penalize them because I can't prove they gave the cheater their work.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Added names. 

In the course discussion, Megara shared in-progress paragraphs of her Essay #2, which ultimately ended up in her final draft. Aladdin admitted to taking her writing out of the discussion without Megara's knowledge and using it in his essay. I rescinded sanctions on Megara as she had no part in the cheating.

Maid Marian wrote me an email apologizing for using others' work before I sanctioned her.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 2: Here are some more details involving just the collusion in the Ann. Bib. assignment, if you're interested in all the fuckery. 

Submissions containing some percentage of identical material (not taken from outside sources):

* Aladdin &amp; Mirabel
* Aladdin &amp; Hera
* Hera &amp; Jasmine
* Jasmine &amp; Maid Marian

A simple endpoint might allow for verification (is the hash in the database or not).

 I'm just researching and discussing it for research and discussion purposes only. 

In regards to the technology shift that is taking place right now, I don't know why all teachers and coordinators are so upset about it. Of course, if a change takes place, everyone needs to adapt to it and utilize it as tools and helping aids. That's what the majority of students are doing. Without using technology, you'll just be left behind in the long run, and we've seen this in history as well.

A few questions:

1. Is it ethically wrong to use these tools as academic and educational aids to help with writing and framing sentences, etc.? In my opinion, paraphrasing tools work by substituting words in different contexts with better vocabulary and changing the framing of sentences. If a student gets x% plagiarism on some paragraph of his work that he didn't plagiarize, what can he do? He can try to change the structure of the words, substitute them with better vocabulary, etc. This is exactly what the tool is doing. It's not doing anything else. Using this tool also boosts productivity and has various benefits. If you don't use it, you're just wasting time doing work that can be done by a tool or AI.
2. Is the International Baccalaureate (IB) going to take action against an innocent student who used these tools as aids?
3. AI tool/ChatGPT: ChatGPT essentially provides generic information and elaborates on topics or terminologies. It's not meant for deep research on a specific topic or work. A lot of experimentation, different views, and primary and secondary research are required for that. ChatGPT's writing is also wordy. How and why is it wrong to use it?

Instead of focusing on the malicious use of this software, the IB should promote using technology and tools to aid students in becoming international and smart learners in general (holistic approach💀). 

To the teachers, facilitators, etc., please don't have a biased and opinionated perspective on this. The use of this software with the wrong intent and just doing the work for the sake of doing it isn't going to benefit anyone, including the learner as the learner will just end up w a 2-3/7. 

Please have a good and positive perspective on this.

Please feel free to put down any questions etc. in the comments hope we can have a meaningful discussions and take something out of this. (all of us)

This entire post above went through ai, parap, etc.  and all these were my opinions, my arguments, but the ai just made it better. Using AI tools can be a useful way to enhance your writing and make it more efficient, but it's important to be aware of any ethical considerations involved. It's also important to ensure that you fully understand the material and are able to express your own ideas and arguments, rather than relying solely on AI tools to do the work for you. In academic settings, it's essential to properly cite any sources you use, including AI tools, to ensure that you give credit where it's due and to avoid plagiarism.",User_deleted,2

I've been doing this since the first day of release and just had it do it again today (12/26).

If you're trying to get chatGPT to help tutor you in a subject, one way you could do that is just asking it to teach you that subject (in simple terms, like a 5th grader, etc.) but it'll maybe give you an idea how to do it but some of the steps can be confidently written but incorrect. You would think a work around would be to enter in a (public domain) book/textbook into chat and having it read it and ""teach you the subject but following how the book explains it with quotes."" 

The final problem is that people are saying chatGPT can no longer read large blocks of text which is partially correct. The real logical way of doing is doing a small amount of work on your end to only copy and paste the chapter you're working on. I've had this method work on all the chapters I've sent in, even up to a 1600 word count chapter with unformatted graphs and pictures. The smaller the chapter you send in and the clearer the explanation you give it (try having it make an outline of the chapter and then explain each point on the outline.) 

Just a college student helping others understand their classes easier. A final tip I like to do is after the explanation for each part, I ask Assistant to make 5 to 10 Q&amp;A flash cards on the subject that I can study later. Enjoy the studying of the future everyone!  (Final warning, this doesn't guarantee the bot explains it perfectly, or that the flashcards turn out super well, but for a first readthrough of a chapter it really helps pull the main ideas for you.)",active,4

Is it simply too late for a beginner to make any contributions to the field at this point when OpenAI, Deepmind, and the like are iterating at such a rapid pace? I really love AI and machine learning so far, but I also don't want to waste my time and energy if there won't be any meaningful work for me once I finish my education in 4 or more years.",active,3
zxtsxo,50,2022-12-28,"What do you think the ""outcome"" of trying to prevent cheating via AI will look like?",u/Ancient_Winter,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/zxtsxo/what_do_you_think_the_outcome_of_trying_to/,"I was just glancing at [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/zxcp71/professor_catches_student_cheating_with_chatgpt_i/) and it's gotten me thinking about what happens when AI is well-developed enough to be virtually ""uncatchable."" Right now AI can make up legit-looking but not real sources so they're easy to check by just looking up the citations. Additionally, IME many AI-generated pieces are fairly stilted in their language use.

But some day that won't be the case. In fact, some day it may be possible that AI can essentially create an otherwise legitimate, well-done paper (as in, pull real sources together and create a novel document from them) with little student input.

How do you think higher ed will adapt? (I'm thinking mostly about teaching/testing students, but if you want to talk about research and scientific writing, feel free!) 

I feel like if we can somehow get away from this ""college is to get a job"" so that many/most students don't actually care about the learning but are just there to check a box we might be able to just generally reduce the impetus to cheat in general, but that will require some significant societal change.

I was thinking that in many fields that might ask you to write a paper (as opposed to sit an exam during class time where you couldn't access an AI bot) we may benefit from giving up the ""arms race"" and returning to a model of oral examinations. Each student meets with the instructor (small classes) or 1-2 TAs in a team of several (larger classes) and basically take an oral examination. Examinations can be recorded for review if there are complains/questions afterward. 

But then I thought about how many students these days have anxiety-related or similar concerns if not full out accommodations and how much that would probably increase if students knew they'd regularly have to do oral examinations. Additionally, it may be hard to have every student receive fair, equal-difficulty tests without giving them the same questions to answer, yet if you give them all the same questions it would be difficult to prevent early test takers from telling others what they will be asked.

So I am curious, what do y'all see as the way forward in a world of AI bots doing homework?",active,57

They might take notes on the material covered in the lectures.


2- Use ChatGPT or another language model to generate summaries of complex concepts: The medical student might use ChatGPT or another language model to generate summaries of complex medical concepts covered in the lectures, which can make it easier for them to understand and retain the material.


3- Create flashcards: The medical student might use ChatGPT or another language model to generate flashcards with key terms and concepts from the lectures. They can use these flashcards to review and reinforce their knowledge.


4- Use ChatGPT or another language model to generate practice questions or exam-style questions: After watching the lectures and reviewing the slides, the medical student might use ChatGPT or another language model to generate practice questions or exam-style questions based on the material they have learned. They can use these questions to test their knowledge and identify any areas where they need to study more.


5- Use a virtual assistant or chatbot developed with ChatGPT or another language model to answer questions or provide information: The medical student might use a virtual assistant or chatbot developed with ChatGPT or another language model to answer questions or provide information on medical topics, helping them to learn and study more efficiently.


6- Use ChatGPT or another language model to develop a clinical decision support system: The medical student might use ChatGPT or another language model to develop a clinical decision support system that provides recommendations or guidance based on a patient's medical history and current symptoms. This could help them to learn how to diagnose and treat patients.


7- Use ChatGPT or another language model to identify and extract relevant information from research papers or medical literature: The medical student might use ChatGPT or another language model to identify and extract relevant information from research papers or medical literature, making it easier to find and analyze data for their own research projects.


8- Use other resources: In addition to using ChatGPT and other language models, the medical student should also rely on other resources such as textbooks, journal articles, and guidance from qualified healthcare professionals to supplement their learning and research.


Overall, ChatGPT and other language models can be useful tools for medical students to assist with learning, studying, and research. It's important to remember, however, that these tools should be used in conjunction with other resources and should not be relied upon as a sole source of information.

I do however want a safe job with good work life balance and decent pay. I want to be able to spend a decent amount of my life making friendships and spending time with friends.

Please help me decide Management Information Systems vs Computer Science, I'm losing my mind lol.

# Computer Science (CS)

Pros:

* More likely to make a lot amount of money.
* Probably more work from home jobs.
* If AI starts stealing everyone's job 15 years from now, CS might be a good place to be if I can get into machine learning and help run the AI.
* Problem solving can be cool
* Maybe way worse work life balance than MIS in college, but way better work life balance than MIS like 2 years out of college??

Cons:

* Courses are much harder than MIS, thus less time to spend building friendships.
* To be competitive for internships and jobs you also need to spend a significant amount of time outside of classes learning actual skills. So even less time free time as if the classes don't demand enough time.
* Supposedly there is huge saturation, at the very least there is in the entry level. This is maybe one of the biggest cons. The big issues from my understanding that causes this and why it is a real issue and not just short term like the recession/tech layoffs are as follows:

1. The huge rise of social media selling the idea that everyone can make 100K if they come into the industry. Now seems like everyone is doing boot camps.
2. Even without the self-learning and boot camp craze, the computer science graduates per year have doubled from 50K ten years ago to now over 100K new CS grads per year.
3. Global outsourcing.
4. ChatGPT/AI will advance exponentially, and will allow for workers to be more efficient leading to less workers needed, if any at all eventually.

# Management Information Systems (MIS)

Pros:

* Supposedly it's pretty common for people to make 80K starting from Temple University with MIS, I can easily go to this school.
* MIS is mix of CS and business stuff, so I'd imagine I'd have way more jobs I can get into with this degree for way better job safety. AND if I want to, I can always self-learn most CS skills if I wanted to get CS jobs. And I could get masters in CS if I wanted to.
* Probably was less competition and saturation than CS field.
* MIS is known to be an easier degree, plus I don't need to learn a hole bunch of stuff on top of the courses just to get hired, so more time for friends.

Cons:

* Maybe easier job to replace with AI?? If AI takes over every job, it will be harder to get into the AI/ML stuff with MIS
* Probably slightly lower average pay and lower ceiling for pay??
* People call it the CS drop out degree
* Maybe not as many work from home jobs, although honestly it's probably comparable??
* Maybe initially work life balance is better than CS, but not long term??

&amp;#x200B;

No matter which degree I choose, I am still a dedicated student and will work hard to be competitive for internships and jobs, I just really value work life balance so I can spend time with friends.

Which path do you think makes sense if I want to make decent money, but also be able to have plenty of time to touch grass and hang with friends?
