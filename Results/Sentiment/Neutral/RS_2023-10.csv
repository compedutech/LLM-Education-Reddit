I feel like ChatGPT is an important for us students in the future, they (robots/AI) will be taking over our jobs and the only way to run a techno-society is by using AI to your ADVANTAGE, not hiding it. Chatgpt, or AIs in general is like a pandora box, once it have been discovered, they cannot be hide nor destroyed, and I feel like we should embrace the future and not just hide ourselves under or hide deep underground, away from technology and its help with students.   


HOWEVER, I do understand the furstration of teachers and AIs with plagiarism, but it just shows how students sometimes are less prepared, or other situations (or lazy in general) and would rather want to resort to using AIs in a subject in which they might not be excel (OR don't bother to do) at but still want a good grade, but it just reflects how the teaching style of students are old.   


I feel like AI should and will replace us humans very soon, it isn't like the 60s and 70s, where limited technology exists. The modern students use AIs to their advantage in terms of studying (I DO NOT CONDONE ANY FORM OF PLAGIARISM!!) as AIs seem to be more efficient and very VERY easy to use. Modern business and online videos (YouTube, Tiktoks, ect) are already seeing AI generated contents, gaining thousand views VS an actual person doing so, dispite the person taking more time on editing and filming/sourcing information by themselves.   


And I am here to ask you a question, when you take a look at the IPhone 3gs and IPhone 15 Pro Max, you see how the shift in computing powers and specifications in general, that is a roughly 530% increase (600 MHZ vs 3.78 GHZ) over a series of 14 years. Now compare that to the education system, take a look from the US School system from 2009 and 2023, the only difference is shifting away from chalk boards to digitalized boards, BUT the school building design, busses, and staff members and policies don't shift as much. What I am trying to say is that with the introduction of AI, I feel like IN MY OWN OPINION that AIs are here to revolutionalize the school system forever, and that the only way to actually engage students to the class is by a different, more modern way of teaching rather than taking notes (hands-on/experiments teaching) and that might, MIGHT allow students to actually take your class seriously and that allow your students to be WANTING to use their own brain and thought and language in class and on assignments.

I apologize in advance for this in-cohesive vent/ rant. So, I (20F), am currently in college, majoring in history with the hopes of getting my master's and then going into high school education after that (though I’m not sure which type of history I want to teach yet). I love history and I love teaching and I honestly can’t see myself doing anything else. And from there stems my problem. I’m not sure if this is just me being an indecisive, anxious 20-year-old or if it’s something else but I seriously would like to know if it would be worth it to dedicate my entire life to teaching. Since high school I havent really been able to be passionate about anything (which is a whole other thing I need to work on) but education and history are the two main things I’ve been able to hold onto since then. It is basically all I’ve prepared for myself. I will list some of my concerns so yall can see where I am coming from. 

-Technology and AI: despite being young, I’m not necessarily the biggest fan of some aspects of technology, especially that of AI. This is a personal preference, but I prefer to read/ write things on physical paper, and I planned to have a good amount of my class “offline”, if you will. Of course, technology won’t be completely banned but I just feel as if you’re seeing it on just a regular sheet of paper you may retain the information better (stupid logic I know). Of course, I would give my students the option between physical and electronic assignments, however that brings me to my next point. I know its super common for kids my age to use ChatGPT and other programs to write their essays for them and such, and who knows what will be the new “thing” 5 or so years from now, but my main goal with teaching history is to really get my students to understand certain complex concepts and to be able to think critically about whatever topic at hand, so it’s a little disheartening to know that a lot of them won't even apply what they learn and will just copy and paste whatever bs an AI program will spit out 
-Laws and such: So, I live in Florida however I don’t plan to teach here at all. This breaks my heart a little bit because I think learning history is so integral to a young adult’s understanding of our government, political system, etc. I plan to move to Washington state/ Oregon after I get my bachelor’s to continue my education and life there. I guess this is more of me being worried about the uncertainty of political atmospheres by the time I'm ready to settle down and have a career. 
-Disrespectful students and students falling behind: I’ve seen an influx of videos and stories online of students verbally and physically attacking their teachers which is rather frightening. Constant disruptions in class seem to be making it very difficult for other students to learn, which is completely unfair to them. I’ve seen a few stories on here of students not respecting boundaries and privacy. I’ve also seen all the videos of teachers saying how students are performing way below their grade level so I’m just wondering what will that mean for when it's my turn to teach them? 
-Parents: Students aside, what about the parents that enable and teach this behavior? I can’t imagine they're any fun to deal with. Or the parents that will share a complaint with administration about something I’m doing in my own free time or something I may have said, or something I may have assigned, leading me to potentially setting me up to be fired?  

This feels like I’m writing an essay for class, but these are only a few reasons that I can think of that I would appreciate some guidance on. I feel I still have rose-tinted glasses on and my images of having perfect classes are somewhat being shattered by reality. Also please have some mercy on me, I’m not very good at articulating my thoughts, especially when I type them out so a lot of this is just word vomit, so I apologize... I also thank anyone who replies! 
 
TL;DR- A bunch of different factors have been somewhat weighing on me and I'd like to know if yall think entering the field is worth it. I am also open to any guidance/ advice.",active,1

My first experience with programming was with C at the beginning of the year. Fast forward to summer, and I decide to take on HTML and CSS. It was fun, for a while, but I found them quite boring later on, and thought hey, maybe front end development is not for me…
Anyways, started learning Java Script last month, won’t say I have made a lot of progress.
What I am getting at is that, I applied for an internship and got it. Apparently, they said they liked how I approached my problem solving, even though I have almost 0 experience coding when compared with other CS students.

I got my first list of tasks today. And they had to do with automation and scraping the web. I have absolutely no experience doing any of this, but a little Google and YouTube here and there with a sprinkle of chatGPT and I was able to figure it out, but I am scared that there will be a point Google, YouTube and ChatGPT won’t be able to help me anymore, and I’ll be fished out as a scam and fired.

One of my typical assignments is a critical essay on some of the course readings. It's designed as a lower stakes way to get the students to write something for me before doing the more involved assignments at the end of the course.

I've noticed sudden spike of my student essays identifying whether a reading is using inductive versus deductive reasoning. I would estimate that about half the essays for my current classes have this trait.

This is not something I teach or ever mention. At first, I couldn't figure out what was going on, but it suddenly hit me: ChatGPT, possibly. Is this something other people are seeing? The essays are different enough that I didn't immediately peg them as coming from a similar root, but that doesn't mean anything if the students are using LLMs to get started and then revising.

I'm not too concerned about trying to bust anyone right now, as all I have is a gut feeling. Also, the grades aren't that good on the essays with this trait (often C+/B-).

I'm currently facing a bit of a dilemma regarding my thesis, and I'd really appreciate some advice from the ChatGPT community.

So, here's the situation: I used AI in the process of writing my thesis, and I'm confident that my usage aligns with my school's AI policy. However, recently, my school has introduced a new requirement saying that we need to declare our use of AI and provide details about all the prompts and chat links we used. This is turning out to be a major inconvenience for me because I used hundreds of prompts and had many AI chats throughout my research. Explaining all of them will take an enormous amount of time.

Also, my suspicion is that the school's motive behind this requirement is not just transparency but also an attempt to strengthen their use of Turnitin, a plagiarism detection tool with AI detection capabilities. I believe that admitting to ethical AI use could potentially be used against us, because if Turnitin flags parts of the thesis as AI generated, the teachers already know you used AI in some form due to your own admission. This worries me because turnitin's AI detection software is very unreliable, as it often flags human text as AI.

Here's my school's AI policy for context:

* The use of generative artificial intelligence to create ready-made content in assignments is considered fraud and not allowed.
* AI can be used as a sparring partner and feedback tool for text quality, but it should not replace active writing, designing, and reflection skills.
* Students are accountable for the correctness, completeness, and coherence of their texts, as AI output is not always guaranteed to be correct.
* Students must acknowledge and report their use of AI in their thesis reports, including listing prompts, chat links, and explaining in detail how AI affected their work.

Given this situation, I'm seriously contemplating not admitting to using AI at all. I'm concerned that if Turnitin flags significant portions of my paper as AI-generated, addmitting to ethical AI use could be used against me.

Do you think this is a good choice, or should I go ahead and comply with the school's requirement despite my concerns about Turnitin? Has anyone faced a similar situation, and if so, how did you handle it? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",User_deleted,0

1706e2f,1,2023-10-04,"Used to love teaching, now getting increasingly jaded",u/muaddib8619,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1706e2f/used_to_love_teaching_now_getting_increasingly/,"Like the title says. Up until quite recently, in fact up until last year, I really loved teaching and looked forward to every semester. Yes, there were issues post-pandemic, but I didn't feel those first few semesters like the grad students I usually teach were still trying and pushing themselves; the quality of their projects may not have been as good as pre-pandemic but it wasn't far.

This year has just been a nightmare. The quality of work has taken a complete nosedive this year, and the principal reason I can figure is that students have stopped giving a damn. Like, completely. I had the same cohort last semester and this, and it was the same problem. Set a deadline for students to show up with work in class, and most of them show up with 20-30% of it done. Their final presentations were atrocious.

It's only been 3 weeks so far but their first assignment: same problem. Some students clearly didn't give even as much time doing them as I spent giving them written feedback: 80% of them clearly didn't even give more than 30m to homework this week. Work ethic seems to have gone down the drain - I spent the last two weeks spending half of class time to exercises designed to prep them to deliver on this assignment and some of the work handed in read like the students were treating the whole thing as a joke. 

Not to mention when I gave some not-very-harsh critique to one assignment that read like it had been cobbled together by ChatGPt (the sentences literally did not go together - these are masters students in their second year), the student went and complained to my program chair. He took it all well - he knows what the deal is - but honestly, higher education is in the gutter if this is the sense of entitlement at play: they expect As while not even attempting to put in the work for a C.

Anyway, rant over, but seriously considering quitting academia. I was never in it much for research, the service they force me to do is overwhelming, teaching was the only thing keeping me going.",User_deleted,65

She teaches multiple grades and reads hundreds of essays. Although in particular, the freshman class has a student ""Y"" who writes essays at the college reading level, and she eventually pieced it together that ChatGPT or a similar program is writing his essays. Any other time he has to write something, let's just say his vocabulary is average for a freshman.   
She has been hesitant to confront Y. After all he is not a bad kid, just demotivated and not very engaged with the class in general. So, she waited until the most recent short essay was turned in, and sure enough, the college-level vocabulary was back again. At the top of the paper she left it with half credit this time and added a note that she will talk to Y after class.

She continued grading until she saw something peculiar, which was that yet another student, Z, had also found an advanced vocabulary, and some of the sentences looked similar to what Y had on his paper. After putting them side by side, it was obvious that if Z had not inputted the same commands to ChatGPT on the chromebook, he was looking over at Y \[his desk is right next to his\] and copying his essay with a slight change in sentence structure. Not sure what to do, she put half credit for Z's essay and the same note to see her after class.  
The next day is where it gets interesting.  
After class, she starts by only handing Z his essay, asking why the vocabulary he used is so far ahead of his past essays, short answers, close readings, etc. When she asked Z what ""implement"" means, he said he has never heard of that, and yet he literally has the word written multiple times in his essay. She pointed this out and Z says he forgot. Still with no confession, she places the paper where Y can also see it. Instantly, Y looks surprised. She could tell he was trying not to snitch, but he interjected ""Miss, I didn't copy that paper. I handed mine in first"" so she looked again at Z who shrugged like it was a mistake. Having confirmed that Z wrote the copy, she dropped his grade to a zero and sent him on his way.   


But there is a silver lining. With Y still in her class, she gestured at the half credit marking and politely told him ""I think you are using AI to write these, is this true?"" Y confessed and told her that he only does it because he can't organize his thoughts enough to write well. And he added that he never uses ChatGPT for any other kinds of assignments. Due to his honesty, she raised his grade to a 70% and told him that if he wants support, she could offer him a diagram that is good for structuring essays. He took the offer and promised not to use AI on any future assignments, so it looks like a win-win.",User_deleted,0

>By now there is substantial evidence that deep learning models learn certain human-interpretable features as part of their internal representations of data. As having the right (or wrong) concepts is critical to trustworthy machine learning systems, it is natural to ask which inputs from the model's original training set were most important for learning a concept at a given layer. To answer this, we combine data attribution methods with methods for probing the concepts learned by a model. Training network and probe ensembles for two concept datasets on a range of network layers, we use the recently developed TRAK method for large-scale data attribution. We find some evidence for convergence, where removing the 10,000 top attributing images for a concept and retraining the model does not change the location of the concept in the network nor the probing sparsity of the concept. This suggests that rather than being highly dependent on a few specific examples, the features that inform the development of a concept are spread in a more diffuse manner across its exemplars, implying robustness in concept formation.

>To check if a network learned a concept, they attached a simple classifier to different layers of the network. If this classifier could accurately tell snake vs non-snake images using the layer's outputs, it meant the concept of ""snakes"" was present in that layer.   
>  
>They then wanted to know - which training images were most important for the network to learn each concept? To test this, they removed some top important images and retrained the network. Surprisingly, removing up to 10,000 top images didn't really change the concept detection accuracy.

>This suggests the networks don't rely on a few special examples to learn a concept. Instead, they gather relevant information from lots of different training images in a robust way. So the networks learn the concepts in a flexible, diffuse manner.

I don’t want to burn out before I really get into it, I really love it so far but I will 100% not make it if I keep this up. So I’ve legit just started turning to ChatGPT and I feel like it’s helped me with lesson planning and the research behind my lesson plans when I am trying (my best) to accommodate for the students in my class of different needs. I was driving to school the other morning and heard that in QLD they are bringing out a new framework for AI and I am keen to see what it entails. But I thought I could learn more from seasoned teachers how I can use AI to be more productive with lesson plans and research, and save myself from burnout. Please feel free to share anything but I thought I’d use some prompts as conversation starters too as these are the things I’m focused on lately. 

Does it allow you to support diverse learners? (Any diverse learners, special needs, langauge barriers)

Alignment with the curriculum? (Achievement standards, learning objectives, educational frameworks)

Enhance your research process or productivity? (Think data analysis, literature reviews, or even content generation)

Integration with lesson planning to enhance your teaching outcomes? (Saving time, prompts, direction)

Would love to see what everyone’s experience and thoughts are across any or all of these points. Maybe we can all learn from each other & identify new ways to explore ChatGPT in our classrooms that we hadn’t considered before. If you’ve made it this far please don’t bash me for turning to AI, I don’t think I’m the only one but I appreciate everyone’s thoughts, positive or negative! Thanks y’all.

Beginner Here,u/Comfortable-Unit9880,leetcode,https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1764v62/hi_what_is_your_approachstrategy_when_learning/,"I just purchased Neetcode Pro to take the Data Structures and Algorithms for Beginners course. I took a DSA course in the summer at college (comp sci student) but I am so rusty and barely learned anything. My main intention for it is to start solving the Neetcode 150 and Grind 75 questions. But what should my approach be?

1. Watch Neetcode video lesson/reading

 2. then do some more online research/ChatGPT to learn more about the given topic 

3. then attempt the Leetcode style problem(s) that comes with the specific topic he is teaching. Then perhaps do more similar problems on LeetCode?

What is your approach when you get stuck? For example I saw TwoSum on Grind75 and there is no way i will get it done in less than one hour (my problem solving skills are weak, i am working on it). I do not want to look at solutions, and I don't mind spending several days on the problem. If I am stuck on the problem, is it okay to use online sources to learn more about the topic and ask GPT to teach me/give me hint? or is all of that too much spoon feeding? 

Tell me your approach when learning DSA and also working on Leetcode/Neetcode problems. Thanks in advance",active,28
1767unb,1,2023-10-12,"bullies, grow up PLEASE.",u/hopinghopefully,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1767unb/bullies_grow_up_please/,"*tw: slight mentions of self harm, near-suicide, bullying.* 

  
4 years ago, I had to pull someone off a ledge. The memory still resurfaces every now and then, leaving a bitter taste of those contributed to the near-tragedy. I’ll use “S” as a placeholder for his name, for privacy reasons.

I was a Sec 1 student in 2019, S was one year my senior. His classroom was next to mine. My classmate from his CCA introduced him to me and we got along very well. The most obvious trait of his was that he was extremely intelligent and possessed an unusual level of general knowledge. S and I would have many meaningful conversations about subject matters that I would not otherwise be able to talk in-depth with other people. Everything was going pretty well.

Enter: FUCKERS. They were Secondary 2, the same level as S. Call them a friend group or a gang they were UNTOUCHABLE. The group was a collection of 4+ student counsellors, 2 sports captains and other leadership position holders. Some would call them notorious, but I had only heard anecdotes of their behaviour up to that point. But when they did finally make their presence known, everything turned to shit.

One day, S was obviously down and distraught, I asked him what had happened but he refused to tell me in the beginning, but he did eventually. The “gang” tore up and disposed of a receipt he needed to make a refund for a pricey item, worth 60+ dollars. What was even more infuriating was that they burst out laughing at how helpless he was and mocked him. I thought it was a random attack, but it turns out S kept a lot from me, ugly things I had to hear in third person. They had been causing trouble left and right, being a menace and going beyond conventional name-calling. I was about to tell the teachers about it but S told me to forget about it, saying he tried, and that the system would protect its high performers at all costs. Plus he had no evidence that they did it. The ways they tormented him got to a point he just wished they would give him a physical blow, so he could destroy their meticulously created fake front they used to deceive teachers. But they were just as ball-less as they were evil. They wouldn’t be stupid enough to give someone a chance to bring their inhumane behaviour to justice. From that point on S went on a downhill spiral, and he was not the same person I knew before. His mental health dipped significantly and he underwent counselling. It made my blood boil that while he was suffering and the people responsible were shaking their legs, probably even salivating while looking for more new prey. Nothing seemed to be able to bring them down, probably only divine retribution. S got quieter and quieter and we grew distant. He began wearing a black sweater to cover his self-harm.

A few weeks later, I went back to class slightly later after recess. The walkways were empty. I walked past the bridge connecting the canteen block to my classroom block. S stood there looking into the distance. I said hi, and he didn’t reply so I walked towards my class. I turned my head and he started making an effort to climb above the short wall. I was dumbfounded. Whatever education I got to that point did not ready me for that moment. He was fast. At that moment my physical actions were purely up to instinct. I grabbed his hand and pulled him backwards. I was frantic, but I tried to keep my composure because he was already in distress. What he said afterwards saddened me but also caused my blood to boil. He told me he had enough and that the world wasn’t listening to him. I had to calm myself down and I told him that his life was meant for so much more than they made it seem and the next few moments were just me trying to deescalate the situation without going insane. I walked him to the counsellor’s room and the counsellor took over from there. No one saw because the part of the bridge was a blind spot from the classroom block blocked by a large pillar, and probably everyone was just busy with life.

From then on, we grew further apart. His studies took a big hit due to his mental health and he didn’t get the subject combination he wanted. His friends told me he was surviving more than he was living. The bullies would continue to thrive, becoming head of various sections of their leadership groups and enjoying all the glory and limelight. If you ask me, seeing that was just a truckload of crap.

Honestly, if you have to bully to entertain yourselves, then yall are such thorough lowlifes. yall think that yall rule the world with your titles and PARENT’S MONEY. not even remotely. So a poor upbringing gives them a reason to fuck someone’s life up to the point they want to do the unthinkable? Bullying is so rampant and yet overlooked as “just immature behaviour”, it’s fucking cancer people. It’s not fashionable, it’s just revolting. and the teachers who do nothing? yall can even be considered accomplices in their grand plan. yall just sweep their sins under the rug to the point no one bothers telling yall, only to be disappointed by yalls inaction. if yall actually make the people responsible pay, shit wouldn’t escalate to serious extents. is it really that hard to write incident reports or hold people accountable? Just chatgpt or smt ffs, it’s literally part of your job. “Teachers are your second parents?”. How the fuck does a parent overlook when a child is having a hard time. Half the time you read bullying stories it includes an NPC teacher who lets more shit happen. Also to the bullies who have a sudden epiphany of what fuckers they are, and hope for forgiveness, I don’t think apologising or even praying would wash away your sins. How about you time travel backwards and un-fuck the lives of whoever you trampled on thoughtlessly. Sounds like nonsense? Biggest load of nonsense is believing an apology is near enough to make things right or be liberated from your wrongdoings.

TLDR: OP friend was bullied. OP pulled him off a ledge. OP condemns bullies and teachers who refuse to take action.

1775hjs,1,2023-10-13,Grading literacy in post chatGPT education.,u/Nathan_RH,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1775hjs/grading_literacy_in_post_chatgpt_education/,"It's doable. People feeding text into chat, and getting analysis back, reveals the quality of that analysis.

This assumes that the student, armed freely with LLMs, has an LLM with some bias. The lack of memory on current LLMs, produces a defineable boundary for bias. Because the bias present must be introduced by the user.

So what bias is present is testable. You can write a cliche, or polysemantic phrase, and get a pass/fail data point. 

That's not new testing. That's old style standardized testing. It's very likely it's set up on purpose. But that's usable, testable material that can help a teacher accurate assess literacy. You just need to write double entendres, and the student will show their bias with or without chatGPT. The student may or may not ask an LLM for analysis, but they will catch confirmation bias if they do. So commitment to a wrong answer can be symptomatic.

Give a student a polysemantic phrase -> they perform an interpretation = now you know bias. The charicter of the bias will be different with or without chat. So a pathway to write effective literary tests in any language should be available.",active,3

I am an autistic person who also has ADHD. In 2018, I had a stroke at an age where it was unusual but not unheard of (middle age) 


When I first started graduate school for my master's and early PhD coursework, I was breezing through it. However, after the stroke, I had to take time off to heal, then COVID...I  am now in my second year back. 


I am struggling to understand concepts that I understood before. It is very frustrating. I couldn't remember how to do a review of the literature, for example... As in how do I structure it. So I asked chatgpt to explain it to me. 


I will also feed it an article or a chapter and have it write an outline that I read first, then I read the main article, making notes of what is still unclear. 


 I work in k-12 and these are strategies we use to pre-teach or prime our special Ed students. Is it ok in higher ed? What I'm also questioning is if I feed it my writing and the assignment and ask chat gpt what is missing, is that acceptable? I feel like I need an extra set of eyes.

AI scientist Luis Serrano has shared a video explaining how natural language processing (NLP) uses text embeddings to capture the meaning of language [1]. Text embeddings, including word and sentence embeddings, are vital components of language models. They translate human language into computer language, capturing relations between words and enabling translation and understanding of text in different languages. Cohere's embedding model uses transformers and attention mechanisms to generate sentence embeddings with 4096 numbers, which can be visualized and used for various practical purposes. Cohere has also developed a multilingual model that can understand text in over 100 languages [2].







Before writing the first line of code to build a model, it's recommended to use a baseline, sometimes even a random one [3]. However, Santiago warns against claims that a model surpasses human performance, as these claims often don't hold up under scrutiny [4]. There's also a debate around the practice of balancing datasets. Some argue that artificially changing the data distribution is ineffective in production systems [5], while others agree but caution that there are consequences that can't be mitigated with a static test set, such as overfitting towards the minority class [6]. The underrepresentation of certain samples is not the only reason a model may not learn them, and algorithm-level methods like weighting classes can help the model pay more attention to rare events [7].







AgentHub_AI, a platform that allows users to automate repetitive workflows using AI, has launched. It offers a no-code visual builder for creating reliable and cost-effective AI-powered automation [9]. Anthropic is hosting a Hackathon in London on November 4-5, where participants will have the opportunity to build apps using the Claude API [10]. They have expressed gratitude towards their partners and supporters, including Cerebral Valley, Balderton, MongoDB, Brave, LangChainAI, Deepset AI, and Truera AI [11].







The recipients of the 2023 Google PhD Fellowship, a program created in 2009 to support exceptional graduate students in computer science and related fields, have been announced [12]. Google AI has introduced a new method called Batch Calibration to address the sensitivity of large language models (LLMs) to design decisions. This method mitigates bias from a batch of inputs, unifies various prior approaches, and effectively addresses the limitations of previous methods [13].







For AI systems to be widely deployed, the harms associated with them must be minimized to acceptable levels, similar to other technologies such as cars, airplanes, lawnmowers, computers, and smartphones [15]. Yann LeCun has responded to Gary Marcus, stating that the droids being referred to are not the ones that the person is thinking of [16]. He also agrees with DavieLofi and GaryMarcus that AI can cause a significant amount of harm, but mentions that there are low-level sensors in place that prevent it from doing so [18].







Greg Brockman shares his vision for suggesting improvements to user interfaces (UI) [20] and a link to a video titled ""DALL-E & GPT-4 Vision iteration in a loop"" [21]. A recent event discussed the topic of generative AI and LLMs, featuring speakers such as Marc Andreessen, the CEO of Navan, and the president of Atlassian [22]. Hugging Face mentions three other users: @jerryjliu0, @LoganMarkewich, and @llama_index [23].

177x8lu,14,2023-10-14,"Paper ""Generalization in diffusion models arises from geometry-adaptive harmonic representation"" demonstrates the transition from memorization to generalization in diffusion models trained on various non-overlapping subsets of a faces dataset as the size of the training dataset increases",u/Wiskkey,aiwars,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/177x8lu/paper_generalization_in_diffusion_models_arises/,"[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02557).

Abstract:

>High-quality samples generated with score-based reverse diffusion algorithms provide evidence that deep neural networks (DNN) trained for denoising can learn high-dimensional densities, despite the curse of dimensionality. However, recent reports of memorization of the training set raise the question of whether these networks are learning the ""true"" continuous density of the data. Here, we show that two denoising DNNs trained on non-overlapping subsets of a dataset learn nearly the same score function, and thus the same density, with a surprisingly small number of training images. This strong generalization demonstrates an alignment of powerful inductive biases in the DNN architecture and/or training algorithm with properties of the data distribution. We analyze these, demonstrating that the denoiser performs a shrinkage operation in a basis adapted to the underlying image. Examination of these bases reveals oscillating harmonic structures along contours and in homogeneous image regions. We show that trained denoisers are inductively biased towards these geometry-adaptive harmonic representations by demonstrating that they arise even when the network is trained on image classes such as low-dimensional manifolds, for which the harmonic basis is suboptimal. Additionally, we show that the denoising performance of the networks is near-optimal when trained on regular image classes for which the optimal basis is known to be geometry-adaptive and harmonic.

Quotes from the paper:

>Several recently reported results show that, when the training set is small relative to the network capacity, diffusion generative models memorize samples of the training set, which are then reproduced (or recombined) to generate new samples (Somepalli et al., 2023; Carlini et al., 2023). This is a form of overfitting, implying that the learned score model does not provide a good approximation of the “true” continuous density. Here, we demonstrate that these models do not memorize images when trained on sufficiently large sets. Specifically, we show that two denoisers trained on non-overlapping training sets converge to essentially the same denoising function. As a result, when used for image generation, these networks produce nearly identical samples. These results provide stronger and more direct evidence of generalization than standard comparisons of average performance on train and test sets. The fact that this generalization is achieved with a small train set relative to the network capacity and the image size implies that the network’s inductive biases are well-matched to the underlying distribution of photographic images (Wilson & Izmailov, 2020).  
>  
>\[...\]  
>  
>The generalization of the denoising performance suggests that the model variance vanishes when N increases, so that the density implicitly represented by the DNN becomes independent of the training set. To investigate this, we train denoisers on non-overlapping subsets of CelebA of various size N. We then generate samples using the scores learned by each denoiser, through the deterministic reverse diffusion algorithm of Kadkhodaie & Simoncelli (2020) — see Appendix A for details. Figure 2 shows samples generated by these denoisers, starting from the same initial noise sample. For small N, the networks memorize their respective training images. For large N, however, the networks converge to the same score function (and thus sample from the same model density), generating nearly identical samples. This surprising behavior, which is much stronger than convergence of average train and test performance, shows that the model variance tends to zero at a train set size that is quite small relative to the sizes of the network (700k parameters) and the image (40×40 pixels).  
>  
>\[...\]  
>  
>Diffusion generative models, which operate through iterative application of a trained DNN denoiser, have recently surpassed all previous methods of learning probability models from images. They are easily trained, and generate samples of impressive quality, often visually indistinguishable from those in the training set. In this paper, we introduce a methodology to elucidate the approximation properties that underlie this success, by evaluating the properties of the trained denoiser, which is directly related to the score function, and to the density from which the data are drawn. Here, we showed empirically that diffusion models can achieve a strong form of generalization, converging to a unique density model that is independent of the specific training samples, with an amount of training data that is small relative to the size of the parameter or input spaces. The convergence exhibits a phase transition between memorization and generalization as training data grows. The amount of data needed to cross this phase transition depends on both the image complexity and the neural network capacity (Yoon et al., 2023), and it is of interest to extend both the theory and the empirical studies to account for these. The framework we introduced to assess memorization versus generalization may be applied to any generative model.

I used language model Claude 2 with prompt ""ELI5 this paper at the level of a high school student."" using the paper's PDF as an input file:

>​Here is an explanation of the key points in this paper at a high school level:  
>  
>The paper is about how neural networks can generate realistic images, like faces. Here are the main ideas:  
>  
>1. Neural networks can be trained to take a noisy or blurry image and ""clean it up"" by removing the noise/blur. This is called image denoising.  
>  
>2. The neural network learns to estimate what the original, clean image probably looked like before it got noisy or blurry. This is an example of how neural networks can learn complex patterns in data.  
>  
>3. The researchers found that neural networks trained on different sets of face images learn very similar ways of denoising faces. This shows that the networks are learning the general patterns of what real faces look like, not just memorizing the specific training faces.  
>  
>4. By analyzing the math behind how the neural networks denoise images, the researchers found that they focus on the key shapes and patterns in faces, like the contours of facial features. The networks ignore less important details.  
>  
>5. This suggests that neural networks have an ""inductive bias"" - they are biased towards learning certain types of patterns that are common in real images. This inductive bias helps them generalize beyond memorization.  
>  
>6. When the researchers tested neural networks on artificial datasets that don't match this inductive bias, like randomly shuffled images, the networks did much worse at denoising.  
>  
>7. Overall, this paper helps explain why neural networks are so good at generating realistic images - they have the right inductive biases to focus on the most important patterns and regularities in natural images like faces.  
>  
>Does this help explain the key ideas in a way that makes sense at a high school level? Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!

This paper shouldn't be cited as evidence that diffusion models that generalize also can't memorize some images in the training dataset, since we have empirical evidence - cited in the paper - that they can. Also, from paper [Diffusion Probabilistic Models Generalize when They Fail to Memorize](https://openreview.net/forum?id=shciCbSk9h) (my bolding):

>In this work, we investigate the data memorization of DPMs through a series of hypotheses and controlled experiments. Our central observation, which we call the “memorization-generalization dichotomy”, is that for DPMs, generalization and memorization are mutually exclusive phenomena, which contrasts with the modern wisdom of supervised learning that deep neural networks exhibit “benign” overfitting and generalize well despite overfitting the data. We experimentally demonstrate the memorization-generalization dichotomy by showing that preventing memorization (by reducing the model size or by injecting additional dummy data that the model must expend some capacity to learn) induces generalization. **We furthermore show that the memorization-generalization dichotomy can manifest at the level of classes, where the model simultaneously memorizes some classes of the data while generalizing with respect to other classes.**",active,17

**The THEME in my ECs & Essays**

I was heavily involved in Linguistics and Machine Learning Research throughout high school. Most of my ECs revolve around computational linguistics research focusing on optimizing current AI algorithms to endangered languages that do not recieve much attention in academia and thus do not have widely available training data. I personally speak an endangered language, and in my essays I wrote about my linguistic & cultural heritage and how that motivated me to delve into the field of computational linguistics working with various indigenous endangered languages and promoting linguistic diversity in the AI industry.

In one of Cornell's essays that asks ""what is an engineering problem that affects your community"" I wrote about how as AI models like chatGPT improve, conversational AI systems will become the foundation of future global industries, and if only dominant languages like English and Chinese are supported while endangered languages that don't have sufficient training data are left out, the linguistic diversity will be harmed and the economic gap between developed and underdeveloped regions of the world will increase. I connected this cause with Cornell's worldclass NLP department and how it can support my future research as I expand my current work to endangered indigenous languages within the Americas.

Me and my friends were hanging on the phone and bored to the max. One of them – we’ll call him Max – suggested trying out some games; and without batting an eye, we did.I was unknowingly about to step afoot in an oasis. The pond seemed to be full of water; a small break from my hectic life back then. But like all oases function, this was far from the truth. What I had fallen into was a pond not of water of energising but a crevasse which I am still falling deeper and deeper into 5 months later.

We started off fine. I would call it healthy at the time. Spending time with your friends and telling them about your day while you hear theirs’. The calls first used to last for a couple of quarter hours, which then turned into half hours and then three quarters. This continuum proceeded for the first week to the point where we were spending 4-5 hours on the phone each day just playing games. At that time, we called it off by saying that it was a vacation of 2 months and this is what we were meant to be doing. Little did I know calling it off was ringing the phone to self-devastation which I have been unable to hang up on even until today.

My daily screen time has risen from \~2-3 hours before I played games to \~5-6 hours when I first started playing games. And I now hang at a detrimentally high average of 8 hours per day. Those are the days when I have a holiday from school. When I am home all day, it peaks at 11-12 hours a day.

I had been using a service at that time; less of a service, more of a disgraceful demeanour. It was Instagram. I had somehow by a miracle got the realisation that I should probably delete this “service” for my own good. And so I did. 4 months went by and I again created an ID last month promising myself I would only use it to check my school’s page. Because believe it or not, I am a frequent occurrence over there. Like all my previous endeavours, this one got the best of me and I am now in a cage endlessly scrolling reels.

To ping back on the “frequent occurrence” part. Yes, I am a straight-A student whose domain of excellence is not just bound by the boundaries of exams. Or should I say, was not just bound by the boundaries of exams. Those boundaries have now lost all their enclosed area and are invisible to the eye. Not having stretched to unimaginable distances but having collapsed and sprung to a dimension of distractions. The dimension I now spend the entirety of my day in.I used to get 100% in Science, 100% in Math, 100% in English. Social and Hindi were my weak points back then too but I used to scrape by scoring 90-92%. All that has perished the digits seemed to have been now chosen from a random number generator. But I myself am the one altering the digits from underneath the roulette table.

I am arguably the best public speaker in my school, having won awards at the State level. But I am soon to be stripped of that title should I continue embracing myself in this box of unethical and undeserved dopamine.

This is not all I have to unfold. So strap in for the ride of a lifetime. For the ride… of my lifetime.

I also am addicted to porn. What more could you ask from a 15-year-old guy trying to ruin his life in every way possible? This addiction has grown and grown to the point where I cannot go a day without masturbating. This is drastically affecting my social prowess and I cannot talk or look at a girl without dreaming of something romantic, not necessarily intercourse. I am still far from the thoughts of r\*pe which is something I believe I will never get. My mother did not raise someone that cheap.

Developing crushes on girls who have the slightest of conversations with me has also become a prominent feature of mine; I say that sarcastically. I know I am too immature to have a relationship at this point in time. And I am not someone a person would have a crush on anyway, so practically no chances of me getting in one. But I want friends. I want friends regardless of what gender they were born. I do not want one-sided relationships that consume me and prevent me from progressing the friendship, let alone turn that one-sided into both ways, which is not happening in the first place considering how big of a loser I am right now. I would be doing the girl an injustice by letting her get along with me.

Every day, when the game is on the loading screen and I observe the view of a loser, that is me. Every day, when reels just start to buffer I go to restart my phone. Every day, I see the face of a person within whom are instilled the hopes and dreams of the person himself and his closest family, friends and teachers yet the person is letting his impulses rule him. I feel ashamed to admit it, that person is me.

I had an inter-house debate competition two weeks before. I was given a topic on which I had a strong opinion. Yet I lost miserably. I who won at the State level lost at the House level. Every day preceding and up until the day of the debate I procrastinated and played games and watched reels and spent time destroying myself. Then came the morning of the day I had my debate. I copied, pasted and printed the debate matter Mr. Altman’s creation, ChatGPT wrote me. Then spent the first four periods in the school regretting, something I have become accustomed and insensitised to. The debate was in the fifth period. And to everyone’s surprise but my own. I failed. I forgot the matter, stammered in between, ate up a paragraph, jumbled up words, mixed up the facts and figures and in the end, disappointed those who believed in me. Those who believed in me for their own profit and heartbreakingly those who believed in me for my own good. I disappointed them.

There is currently an ongoing national-level competition in my country. A Shark Tank for high-school students of sorts. Our team swept the school-level competition. We did not win the competition, we swept it. Our score was 98/100 and the runner-up got a measly 79/100. Perhaps I got too wound up in celebrating a victory as imperceivable as this in the massive scale of the life I have ahead of me that I have not spent a single hour the past week doing what I was assigned to do. Doing what I assigned myself to do. Yes, someone as loser-esque as me is the leader of the team. I am wronging my teammates who have been working consistently and submitting what they were expected of and asked to perform. Today was the deadline, tomorrow is the submission of what I have done this past week. I will be entering the room empty-handed. With a heart full of regrets and ears wiped empty to hear and absorb the disappointments of my mentor in this project and my fellow teammates. For I have let them down in the worst way possible.

The only thing keeping me from self-harm now is the urge to get more dopamine - from sources lowly. It is neither the motivation to improve nor the courage to get out of this quicksand I have been stuck in. It is instead the urge to fall to the bottom, where I know I’ll have no way back. I keep trying to fight back and swim out of this, yet I only keep falling further and further. The one way to escape quicksand is to call for help and hope someone rescues you. I am too full of cowardice to make that move, hence I am writing this document.

If you have made it this far into my page of regrets and hopelessness. I say give yourself a pat on the back. It takes courage to read something this long and not lose your mind through it. I’ll post an update sooner or later on where I am in life.

179d60v,1,2023-10-16,Study advice for Calculus,u/rom1503,learnmath,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/179d60v/study_advice_for_calculus/,"I’m university student taking Calculus. My class is 90% exam based. The prof gives out problem sets at the end of the week for all the topics we covered. 

The assigned questions are from my textbook and only the odd questions have the answer with no step-by-step solutions on how to answer the questions.

My problem is, sometimes it takes me a while to understand some concepts and I can’t cover all of the problems assigned because I am taking other classes as well + other commitments. I need advice on how to study more efficiently in spite of time constraints. There’s no problem for me understanding the concepts but it just takes a while for other topics. I know Math is all about repetition but time is the problem for me. I want to learn as quickly as possible. Any tips?

Currently my process goes like:
1. Preview chapter before lecture 
2. Actively listen during lecture
3. At the end of the day, go through the lecture slides & questions from lecture + create a summary
4. Next morning, work on the practice problems & note down difficult questions
5. During the weekend, I work on the difficult questions
6. If I can’t answer the questions, I use try to get help using resources such as ChatGPT, Chegg, & office hours if time permits
7. Before the exams, I try to go through everything but emphasizing on the difficult questions 

My solutions:
1. Should I just solve the odd numbered questions because of my time constraints? The even numbered questions are quite similar. I was thinking of doing the even questions if I have time.
2. For the problems that just seem impossible to solve, what do I do? I just post the questions on Chegg and ChatGPT. Maybe office hours if time permits.
3. Should I try to understand the material 100%? Is it worth spending a little bit more time or 80% of understanding is okay? I get paranoid not being able to solve assigned questions because I feel like it will appear on the exam. So I try to solve as much as I can.
4. Any tips to improve my study process?

I need some advice. Thanks!",User_deleted,2

Since it's hard to find mentor texts that specifically address the types of writing we do, I've been having ChatGPT write them. On the one hand, I don't know if that's the idea of mentor texts. Sure, it provides a model, but they aren't that well-written or creative. On the other hand, I'm trying to get my students to follow a structure, format their work, and punctuate correctly, so having a very basic model seems helpful.

Has anyone else been doing this? If so, have you found that it works or not? If not, do you have other recommendations for where I could get better mentor texts?",active,2

I used to get kind of 'high school' ish and have them do handouts on the skills for homework (diagram this sentence, spot the sentences with comma splices and fix them, etc), but over the summer when I taught a similar class...they all used AI.  

Also, I had a student sitting at his desk after class and I went over to see if he needed help and that was why he'd stayed behind and....no, he was using ChatGPT to do the programming homework for his Computer Science class he had next.  So it's not just my subject dealing with this. 

So I'm hoping the massive throbbing collective brain of this sub can share...how are we handling this?  Are there things you tried that work? That absolutely DID not work so don't waste time trying them?

&#x200B;

Module 1 - Team Engineering Case Study, Modeled after the Lockheed Martin Engineering Ethics Case Competition, teams of two or three students will work to analyze and prepare recommendations during the first four weeks of class.  Academically, we will cover teaming and the competing values framework.   This four week 'final exam' happens to check how prepared you are for a 'real world' engineering analysis problem. Check out previous LM cases here - [https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/news/features/2022/ethics-in-engineering-competition.html](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/news/features/2022/ethics-in-engineering-competition.html)  


Module 2 is a hands-on, student-driven project for UMD continuous process improvement - design phase and user experience exploration.    
Each student will be invited to find a problem or solicit a campus organization for the engineering groups to work on behalf of.  You could develop automation tools for a campus student organization, or inquire about staff processes for student athletics, - The world is your oyster.  Each student is responsible for doing problem finding and sponsor solicitation during module 1, and then the group will choose one stakeholder to work on behalf of through their availability to attend a 'Strategic workshop' at the start of module 2. (A member or small group will be invited to come to class for interview facilitation) - Module includes design thinking style instruction, up to and including the delivery of a 'pre-totype.'  We will also explore counterpoints to 'empathy' as the first step in design thinking.  


Module 3 is focused on meeting styles and 'production productivity' methods.  Based on sponsor interest and engagement, we may attempt to build one or more 'pretotypes' to be iterated on by the entire class.  Time in class will be split between learning and practicing 'liberating structures' for meeting facilitation and getting time to work on your team projects.  There will be engineering requirement definitions and commercial point of parity and point of departure comparisons.  User feedback on 'shitty prototypes' will be preferenced over 'analysis paralysis'  


The Final Exam - is a compendium paper reflecting on the 'final exam' you presented at week 4, and how you would re-analyze the case using the skill and techniques you've learned from the books.  An explanation of the three core lessons you learned while taking the class - expressed as images with explanations.  A diagnosis and recommendation for one change to the experience of engineering students at Maryland that you'd wish you had gotten as a freshman (ENES100 student) and a one-page creative writing assignment - 'letter from 10 years in the future' - about what your career has been like and what technological changes have occurred (or an annotation of a several page story generated by AI)  


Academic Standard 1 - the two books for the class is Strategies for Creative Problem Solving, by Folger and LeBlanc and ""The Goal"" by Eliyahu M. Goldratt. There is a weekly discussion board and some questions about how to implement suggestions from each book to your module 2 and 3 content. A supplemental/optional text is ""Pretotype it"" by Alberto Savoia.  


Academic Standard 2 - how to run a meeting - Partner pairs from Module 1 will be responsible to choose and facilitate an activity from, [https://www.liberatingstructures.com/](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/). These tools help you with module 2 and 3 activities and will be compressed (some are 2+hrs) into 30 minutes of you delivering something, and 15 minutes for the class to provide feedback. (depending on total course enrollment - Ideal class size is about 20 ppl, not sure what UMD will cap it at.) - this class fulfils an ME upper-level technical elective.  


Digital platforms - we will make extensive use of miro for workshop planning and to collaborate with UMD groups in module 2.  I may create a discord server for teams to communicate (or use zoom chat, or TBD based on student interest) All teams will benefit from students who are comfortable in maker spaces, and we will heavily rely on support from Terrapin Works in Module 2 and 3.  


**Your grade**  
Module 1 - 20%  (Learning Objective: QUALITY and Innovation)  
I will provide initial feedback to your 'Final Exam' in the first four weeks based on the logic and effort put into the analysis of the case and presentation of recommendations.  
Module 2 - 10% (analysis of user needs, detailed write up of problem requirements)  (Learning Objective: Innovation)  
Module 3- 25% (peer evaluations of delivered skill) (Learning Objective: Decisions and Risk)  
Discussion board and facilitation - 30% (20%+10%) (use of ChatGPT within reason to help with rote content, more emphasis on 'discord like' peer to peer interaction. - The discussion board will include assignments like 'create a meme to describe lessons from each module)  
Final Reflection - 15% (Learning Objective: Quality, Decision and Risk, and Innovation)  
Final 'five paragraph' essay - what are the three most important principles you learned by TRYING to IMPLEMENT your engineering skills in the real world, with real people, on their real problems - AS A TEAM. (should include quotes from the discussion board with fellow students, and evidence of engagement from sponsors/stakeholders as to the relevance of your ability to be creative and helpful in solving their problems.  


Here's a student perspective:  


If I’ve learned anything from my time in Engineering thus far, it’s that you’re only as good as your team. That’s why a course like this is such an ace in the hole.  My name is Josh B. I’m a graduate of UMD’s Clark School of Engineering and I had the pleasure of taking Managing for Innovation and Quality with Dr. Eagle. This course taught me about the personal side of problem solving. You won’t just be crunching numbers when you get to the real world. Most of my days are spent with people… negotiations, expectation management, timelines, soft skills, questions, answers, thinking outside the box.

In this course you’ll learn how to refine the process of problem solving, whether that’s through different techniques of problem definition ideation, critical thinking on quality, idea adoption through lateral thinking, or flexing your muscles on real engineering case studies. For me, all of this was viewed through the lens of the TEAM. We deployed the Innovation Genome, which helps you leverage the talents of your groups, and thrive through your differences. Our groups hosted workshops on the Liberating Structures, thought pattern disruption techniques that can shake up entrenched thinking, and spot solution soft spots. The course covers a lot more. Mostly, I remember having fun with it all.

To sum things up, I thought I was coming into this class to learn how to be a manager. I ended up learning how to be a better team member, and team members make the best leaders. Don’t sleep on this course and you’ll find you have a real leg up when you enter the office.

A **design pattern** is a general, frequently used solution to a commonly encountered problem in a given design context.  
  
We will focus solely on the aspects of game design, excluding visual style, plot, music, and other game components.

The article is structured as follows:

1. Criteria for the pattern in designing a hardcore experience
2. Components of a hardcore experience and ways to apply the pattern
3. Conclusion

# 1. Pattern Criteria:

* **Universality** \- this pattern should be applicable to any type of game, regardless of the genre, style, or other elements.
* **Autonomy** \- this pattern should not depend on unknown or dynamic variables such as a player's skill.
* **Applicability** \- this pattern should have practical feasibility within the game development framework.

# 2. Components of a Hardcore Experience

**Entry Threshold**

* **RulesVolume**: the number of game rules that a player needs to grasp to understand what is happening.

**Cognitive Load**

* **CountOfDecision**: the number of available decisions or actions a player can make per turn or unit of time.
* **TimeRate**: the interval between a player's decisions, or in other words, the speed of the gameplay.
* **DecisionCost**: the ratio of the cost of making a mistake (loss of progress) for a player's action to the player's progress in the case of a correct decision.

**Randomness**

* **Random**: the factor of randomness and unpredictability of events in the game.  


Any of these components of this formula may be absent in your game, depending on the game type.  
  
So, what does a hardcore experience entail?  
  
Hardcoreness is a special balance of these elements in the game to create a gaming experience that requires players to dedicate a significant amount of time to the rules, stay highly focused on the gameplay, make timely decisions, and punishes them for mistakes while also having a high level of unpredictability.

# 2. Methods of Creating a Hardcore Experience

>The author does not claim to be the ultimate authority but shares their perspective on game design for hardcore games, which, in their view, should be adhered to in order to achieve an engaging yet fair hardcore player experience.  
  
The author also acknowledges that there might be enthusiasts for games with broken or unfair balance, such as ""gacha"" games. However, they strongly recommend considering game design with the average gaming audience in mind rather than catering solely to the ""gifted.""  
  
**Disclaimer**

The sense of hardcore is achieved through a balance of the factors mentioned above. In general, the following methods for increasing the hardcore nature of a game can be described:

* Raise the entry threshold (e.g., EVE Online).
* Increase the cognitive load on the player (e.g., Dota).
* Make the player pay for their mistakes (e.g., Rogue).
* Introduce unpredictability into the game (e.g., Darkest Dungeon).

**2.1 Raise the Entry Threshold**

  
When creating games with a high level of complexity, a multitude of in-game rules and mechanics take center stage. However, it's not always apparent that an essential component of this experience is educating players right within the game. To reduce the entry barrier and not deter potential players, it's important to skillfully integrate educational elements for beginners.  
  
**Craft Your First-Time User Experience (**[FTUE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-time_user_experience)**)**  
To ensure that players spend enough time preparing for the core gaming experience, it's crucial to provide a gradual and systematic introduction, rather than throwing them into an ocean of information from the very beginning.  
  
*For example, in the game Path of Exile, a novice is likely to make mistakes when choosing their first character build due to the vast number of classes and options. To avoid this issue, the player will need to invest a lot of time in studying materials before starting the game to avoid obvious mistakes.*  
  
**Let Players Get a Feel for the Game**  
A proper game design would imply that players are provided with content either gradually or are allowed to try out each of the builds in test runs so that they understand what experience they can expect and what combinations they can develop overall.  
  
In this regard, the game Overwatch serves as a good example. Here, players can easily familiarize themselves with different heroes in test conditions without risking their main game progress. This allows players to better understand their preferences and choose the optimal path of development.  
  
An analogy can be drawn with the education of students. The ideal approach involves introducing students to basic knowledge first and then providing them with challenging tasks. Throwing them directly into deep mathematical intricacies without preparation often only discourages their interest in the learning process.

**2.2 Increase Cognitive Load**

Someone might say that creating a bullet hell on the screen is enough, and there you have cognitive load on the player with a frantic pace. But it's not that simple.  
  
**Important and Less Important Decisions**  
Make the player handle a large number of tasks within a limited time and require them to make decisions quickly. However, the key point is the sequential presentation of tasks of varying degrees of complexity and danger. This way, the player will truly feel that their mind is not working in vain and that they are genuinely forced to take important steps necessary to achieve the game's objectives.  
  
**Don't Forget About Rest**  
The brain, like any other organ, needs breaks. If you increase the pace and intensity of the gameplay, requiring the player to multitask and make important decisions in a short time, provide them with the opportunity to relax and engage in less intense strategic tasks.  
  
This approach is often seen in real-time strategy games (RTS), where the game rhythm is characterized by alternating phases. For example, a phase of intense combat is followed by a phase of preparing new troops or developing new tactics, where the player's demands are reduced both in terms of volume and decision-making speed.

**2.3 Pay for Your Mistakes**

Implementing a high cost for mistakes may seem like a straightforward and logical solution for a game designer. Loss of progress upon failure motivates the player to ""suffer"" and encourages them to recover their lost achievements. Conversely, reducing the cost of mistakes to a minimum makes the previously mentioned methods less effective *(hello to the developers of cyberpunk games with their important leveling system)*.  
  
However, as with everything, there are certain pitfalls in this case. A too high cost for mistakes can lead to the abuse of the save and load mechanism, undermining the fairness of the game. On the other hand, if there are no save points *(unless justified by the gameplay)*, the game may be perceived as unfair. Both situations can disrupt the player's flow. So, what should be done in this case?

**Choose One Thing**  
It's important to emphasize that an unreasonable disproportionate balance between the cost of an mistake and progress should not be accompanied by excessive cognitive load. A high level of stress caused by simultaneously increasing both the cost of an mistake and the intensity of gameplay can create a negative experience, punishing the player twice for a single action.  
  
This means that you should not simultaneously increase both of these parameters without reasonable proportion. Maintaining balance is essential, and if one parameter is high, you should handle the other carefully to ensure player comfort.  
  
**The Player's Pain Is Your Job**  
You need to maintain control over the player's experience, managing it rather than allowing chaos. When the game designer keeps the situation under control, the gaming experience remains intense but consistent. Even in the most intense moments, players prefer to feel stimuli in a measured and predictable way, much like how a person wants to experience even pain, considering dosage and predictability.  
  
When a player embarks on an ultra-hardcore adventure, they expect not only the validation of their emotional expectations but also the opportunity to discover unique and wonderful aspects of the new gaming experience.  
  
**Risk & Reward**  
As mentioned earlier, the concept of ""DecisionCost"" represents the ratio between the penalty for an mistake and the reward for a correct decision. By increasing the penalty, you can create the desired gaming experience, but that's only half of the equation. To keep the game fair, you need to increase the rewards for correct decisions, especially when the stakes are high. Fair distribution implies that the higher the risk, the higher the reward should be.  
  
However, in the context of a hardcore experience, it is recommended to maintain a slight bias toward risk. In a standard game, where high risk is twice the norm, the high reward corresponds to 1.75x the norm. In a hardcore experience, you can slightly reduce the reward, so the risk level is 2.25x, and the reward is 1.5x.  
  
Naturally, balancing will be adjusted multiple times during game polishing, but the general principle is that **when increasing the cost of an mistake, you should also increase the reward for a correct decision**.

**2.4 Randomness Is Fun**

Oh, that darn Korean RNG! Make the player hit less often, while the enemy crits more often, and you're good to go! This is how games are designed, as it seems to me, by idiots. Or, more accurately, lazy game design looks that way. Crank the player's chance roulette to a minimum and increase the chance of positive effects for the enemy to the maximum. But how to make good randomness?

**Unpredictable Conditions, Not Results!**  
The best kind of randomness is the one that creates unpredictable conditions, not results! If a player is used to shooting goblins in a cave while sneaking through a narrow passage, great, add a chance for a goblin to spawn with laser eyes. Manage the player's expectations and habits, not the outcome or result. Randomness should push the player into unusual situations, not determine whether the right decision will work or not. Yes, it's also one of the tools of game design, but for heaven's sake, don't overuse it. You'll only create an unfairly frustrating gaming experience where there's no point in planning your decisions if the outcome is still uncertain.

# 3. Conclusion

It's important to strive for creating an enriching gaming experience for the player rather than making games with impossibly difficult levels. The essence of hardcore gaming is not solely about extreme health or damage values but rather focuses on cognitive load and player concentration during the game. This implies the need for quick and precise decision-making and the creation of a sense of real punishment for mistakes, seasoned with a dose of randomness.

* A game with an extensive set of rules that requires the player's knowledge can raise the entry threshold. However, if other aspects of the game are severely limited, the hardcore experience may not reach the expected level.  

* In games where the player is provided with a multitude of decision options in a unit of time or turn, such as in real-time strategy games (RTS), high cognitive load is guaranteed. Nevertheless, if the time for decision-making is excessively stretched, this load will simply be evenly distributed over time and won't provide the expected concentration.  

* In the case of high-paced games like shooters but with a low cost for errors, the experience can be dynamic but not hardcore enough, as seen, for example, in Counter-Strike (CS).  

* If the cost of error is too high, but the game is too simple and has few solution variations, the result will be overly simplified and not sufficiently interesting, as in games like ""Russian Roulette.""  

* When events are almost entirely random but do not pose a threat to the player and do not present any challenge, this also does not contribute to creating the desired hardcore experience.

17elmz0,1,2023-10-23,21 Day Challenge Bowei Strategy James Liu,u/Basic-Recognition-44,ESL_Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/ESL_Teachers/comments/17elmz0/21_day_challenge_bowei_strategy_james_liu/,"I wanted to share my personal views on the 21-Day Challenge I completed a few months ago. This is a marketing course designed to assist ESL teachers in finding clients willing to pay $50 per hour or more. The course is created by James Liu, who isn't an ESL teacher but holds a master's degree in marketing and excels at marketing his course. The course is priced at $297, and it involves following daily videos and tasks. The initial focus is on identifying your niche and then working on your marketing skills on LinkedIn.

At the outset, I was quite enthusiastic, but my enthusiasm quickly waned, and the same was true for many other students in the group. The promise of having a coach to guide and support you fell short in reality. Coaches were either unavailable or simply offered generic advice, like ""just go for it"" or ""be patient, results will come,"" without providing the in-depth professional support needed.

Midway through the course, they introduce the requirement to offer your first three clients three lessons for free (not the $50 they advertise) if you wish to learn more. The instructional videos came across as patronizing, and you end up relying on ChatGPT with the prompts they provide to find your niche and create daily messages on LinkedIn.

The main objective of this program appears to be to convince you to join their Inner Circle program, which costs $997 for six months. Days 19, 20, and 21 of the course are focused heavily on the message that you'll only achieve results if you join the Inner Circle. While there is some coverage of marketing skills, this program lacks the depth, professionalism, and support required to truly help you find $50/hour clients. My advice is not to waste your money and time on this course. It's disheartening to see it consistently sell out each month, primarily because James is skilled at marketing his course, but the course itself doesn't deliver on its promises of helping you earn $50 to $100 per hour as it claims.",active,8

Her work to date has been very obviously broken English. Her most recent assignment is a flawless essay. It doesn’t read as AI (I’m a ChatGPT/Bard user myself and can recognize it’s style pretty quickl). I think someone is writing for her or maybe she’s using an exceptionally advanced AI. But it’s extremely different than her discussion board posts or other written work.

However - she has failed this class already and another failure will kick her out of the program. She is an immigrant who is getting an MS degree in a professional field where she already works as an assistant (think teaching assistant becoming a teacher). My class is all about the philosophy behind the work and is a ton of reading and writing. Her work will primarily be with Spanish students and I think they will greatly benefit from her. In my mind does not being able to write about Vgotsky’s theories really a reason to fail someone if I know they can be an asset to disadvantaged students? Our profession needs people like her. 

I feel that I can plead ignorance and pretend I really thought it was her work if I am caught for passing her. I’m new faculty without tenure so I am scared but I feel like this is the right thing. Other than her English, her work is stellar and she clearly understands the content. She doesn’t have time to go to a writing tutor because she has children and works two jobs.

On the other hand, there are people I’m not extending this courtesy to (lenient grading) because they are not trying and are just expecting to pass.

for context:

Grade 12 HUMSS student me. Ako rin ang leader. Ang research namin is all about gender-responsiveness ng school. Quantitative type.

Ito 'yong plano namin gawin (sana).

Hahatiin namin sa tatlong ""strata"" ang ""school""— SHS students, faculty, and staff/school heads. Gumawa rin kami ng 10-item assessment form and naka-tailor siya for each strata. In-adapt din namin 'yon from related research and approved na siya, nalagay na rin sa Google Forms.

For example: 

1. I use my schoolmates preferred pronouns.

1- Strongly disagree
2- Disagree
3- Agree
4- Strongly Agree

Kunwari gan'yan 'yong sa students. Tapos pag sa teachers, ""students"" ang term imbis na ""schoolmates"". Tapos pag sa school heads, iba rin term pero may mga halo rin about policies/rules na pinapatupad nila sa school na may be related sa gender bias gano'n. Basta, may statement tapos ir-rate nila kung gaano nag-apply sa kanila 'yon.

Soooo, ito na. Data gathering na sana kami. Final defense na daw agad bandang end of November pero walla pa kami nasu-survey.

Ang sabi ng research adviser, alamin daw muna namin ang total population ng lahat ng strata and overall. Nakuha namin 'yong number: halos 1k, 'yong 900+ doon students lang. I tried to search and I also used ChatGPT para mabigyan ako kasagutan kung ano next step. Kunin ko raw proportions and such tapos mag-decide kami sa sample size.

Iniisip namin noong una, ibibigay na lang namin 'yong link ng Google Forms sa mga students na kakilala from other section/strand ta's pagpapasahan hanggang makaipon respondents. Tapos sa faculty, balak namin na ibigay ang link sa isang teacher tapos siya na lang magse-send sa iba na willing sumagot. Tapos sa heads, balak namin specifically bigyan sana ng assessment form 'yong school nurse, guidance counselor, security guard etc kasi feeling namin mahalaga ang sagot nila sa research namin.

GIRL MALI-MALI NA PALA KAMI?! Hindi ko na alam kung ano na bang sampling gagamitin namin😭 Kung stay ba kami sa stratified random sampling or magiging purposive or convenience or what. We also don't know how to make it ""random"" kasi ang sabi dapat daw mag-roleta or online draw kami ng numbers assigned sa loob ng population namin PERO TEH ITS 1K PEOPLE HOW...

Kung makapag-decide nga kami na baguhin, 'di ko naman makuha sa research adviser namin kung ilan nga dapat ang i-survey at kung tama ba mga plano namin kasi siya mismo nagsabi na humanap kami statistician (?) kung di namin alam mag-compute. Akala ko sa college research lang 'yon huhu 

Saur ito 'yong questions.

1. Saan kami nagkamali huhu 
2. Ano suggestions/recommendations niyo plz lalo sa sampling
3. Resources para makatulong din like websites or apps

Pls no shaming/pagalitan pa kami 😣 Wala akong research sub nung elem di ako from science high school and di ko talaga makuha 'yong sagot na gusto ko makuha online or from my research adviser.

17h6gr9,1,2023-10-26,Passed Linux+,u/MallOpenNoOneShoppin,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/17h6gr9/passed_linux/,"Passed Linux+ XK0-005 with a 745/900 (720 = pass). The test was just as hard as everyone says it is, but the questions/answers often give you just enough context to squeak by. My adrenaline was through the roof.   


2 months of intense (no friends, no leisure, no life, poor mental health) constant study while working from home (""tech adjacent"") full time and attending a virtual cyber bootcamp twice a week. I have a 50% student discount from the bootcamp I am taking through a nearby college, so I figured I would splurge on a voucher. I have wanted to ""learn Linux"" ever since I saw a youtube video telling me to back when I worked in a shitass factory years ago.  I try to listen to smart people so I never kicked learning Linux off my mental back burner. I am pleased with myself for taking the advice 3 years later. 

&#x200B;

Going into this with no prior Linux experience, I thought it was going to be a lot more fun. The reason why I think it was not so fun for me was because I started my studying by reading a textbook front-to-back while completely un-introduced. There was just a massive amount of complex, dry, interlinking knowledge to soak in, without the actual magic of working in the bash shell. If you do not have any experience with Linux I would definitely recommend watching videos and following along in your own VM or Linux install before jumping to a textbook. This is probably already what most people that aren't complete masochists like me do, but I digress. The learning became MUCH more fun once I cracked into practice exams and the exam objectives and started experimenting with all the commands/flags. Now I just need to snag my S+ before the end of the year, which I am already mostly prepared for. If I pass, that'll be A+, Net+, Linux+, and Sec+ all just in this year with no IT experience at 30 years old. The goal has been to mirror what WGU students do.   


I will ramble for awhile so I will try and get to the point in how I prepared:   


\- Back during studying for A+ at the beginning of the year, I installed a VM for the first time and threw Ubuntu and Kali on there. I fiddled around in the desktop environments (did not know what that was at the time) but did not do anything in the terminal.

&#x200B;

\- Fast forwarding, for Linux+ (and each of the trifecta exams) I started off by watching the 6-hour youtube vid ""Introduction to Linux – Full Course for Beginners"" created by freeCodeCamp.org.  


\- Then I read the McGraw Hill Linux+ All-In-One Exam Guide front-to-back. 

&#x200B;

\- While reading the textbook, I tried to engage myself by taking notes on every little thing in Obsidian, I am not entirely sure how productive that was.. and I have rarely referenced my hundreds of notes.

&#x200B;

\- That is partly because I setup dual-boot on my main PC as a part of the preparation and installed Linux Mint as a semi-daily driver. That is one thing I saw everybody saying: ""use Linux as a daily driver.""  I ended up moving my Obsidian vault over to my Linux filesystem because the visual graph mode in Obsidian was really laggy when I was accessing the vault from my NTFS formatted drive where I originally started the notes. Because my notes are only available after booting into my Linux install, and it is currently inconvenient to always be on my Linux install, I did not review my notes nearly as much as I could have.  
\- I  installed Ventoy onto a USB stick and dropped a few distro isos on there that would allow for live booting/installing. I fiddled around with those a bit just to get a look at the visuals of different distros.  
\- I installed Arch on my laptop and spent a lot of time experimenting with commands.

&#x200B;

\- I have used ChatGPT a TON. I have incorporated it into my daily life at this point and am very thankful it exists. It's my tutor and guiding light, my very best friend in a utilitarian sense. It is often fallible but it's easy to catch when it's derping. I have used it to help generate questions, generate labs, generate bash scripts (that I would then dissect to understand). If I ever encounter errors in the terminal, I ask ChatGPT. Just a couple days ago I asked ""can I switch between different desktop environments in Arch?""... and now I have installed and can switch between xfce, KDE, GNOME, and more in my Arch install. Cool! As someone with negative self-talk issues, I even used it to generate some affirmations that I could repeat to myself as I dealt with the intense anxiety and stress leading up to the exam. 

&#x200B;

\- Jason Dion practice exams on Udemy - 73, 78, 83, 84, 84. They seemed too easy but they helped me fill in some gaps. He makes sure you learn about containers and orchestration types.

&#x200B;

\- I ran through the Sybex Practice Test book, did unit 1, which was like 285 brutal (did them all in one day while working from home), punishing questions that completely destroyed my confidence. Reviewing all of the questions I missed was not feeling productive, and was actually exhausting. I had a similar experience preparing for Net+ with Certmaster, where the questions were overly difficult and seemed to be wasting my time. I ended up backtracking during this past week because I knew how hasty I was being with scheduling the exam so soon, and decided to embrace the suck. Instead of blindly answering all of the questions for a given section of the exam textbook at once in a spreadsheet, I decided to sit on my laptop and prove out each question by typing and experimenting with commands. That was infinitely more productive, and led to tons of questions along the way that I directed to ChatGPT to help reinforce ideas.  


\- I used PocketPrep for Linux+ (and Net+, Sec+). I ran through about 400/500 of the question bank with 76% correct. I then reviewed the questions I missed.   
\- Watched a lot of LinuxTV videos on youtube, and a bunch of other youtube channels taught me some stuff. 

&#x200B;

\- Made sure to scan through the objectives more than once.",User_deleted,19

We also discuss professional development opportunities, I'm really trying to make it a productive experience for them.  

I asked them to create a one-pager for an important component of the work we are doing and gave them three days to work on it (I was being generous).  This one-pager would be shared with hundreds of state-level government officials, academic staff, and those working in the field.  They sent me their one-pager for a final review today and it seems like something totally copied/pasted from ChatGPT.  The language is superfluous, empty, and inappropriate for the field is was generated for.  And, some sentences just end abruptly (e.g., ""demonstrates the product for."").  For what?!  And, ""product"" is not the term we use in the field; it's ""resource""!  The language used in the one-pager is unlike the writing used in their standard emails.  

I made a ton of comments on why direct, concise language is better.  I highlighted every flowery, superfluous sentence and commented ""too superfluous, please make more direct"" and I highlighted every odd word that someone with any baseline knowledge in our field would never use and said ""please be careful with the language"" and explained why. It felt like I was giving advice to a 9th grader, not a second-year graduate student; I was totally exasperated doing this LOL.  If this one-pager were shared with our intended audience, it would not be good for our reputation.  I was hoping an intern would save me time, but it's ending up costing me even more time.  

This is the second time I've been suspicious of their use of ChatGPT. I'm totally baffled that they would assume I wouldn't notice the use of ChatGPT, but I have no proof so I won't call them out.  Should I be more hands on with the intern?  Should I level set about expectations?  Or, should I just wait it out and cut my losses?  They are very kind and enjoyable to meet with, but are an average intern in terms of effort and productivity.  They are only with me for one more month, but we work in a niche field so I want to give them advice that will be useful for their career.  

What would you do?  How can I tactfully approach this situation?

**arxiv**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.15819.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.15819.pdf)

**Abstract**: The surge in popularity of large language models has given rise to concerns about biases that these models could learn from humans. In this study, we investigate whether ingroup solidarity and outgroup hostility, fundamental social biases known from social science, are present in 51 large language models. We find that almost all foundational language models and some instruction fine-tuned models exhibit clear ingroup-positive and outgroup-negative biases when prompted to complete sentences (e.g., “We are...”). A comparison of LLM-generated sentences with human-written sentences on the internet reveals that these models exhibit similar level, if not greater, levels of bias than human text. To investigate where these biases stem from, we experimentally varied the amount of ingroup-positive or outgroup-negative sentences the model was exposed to during fine-tuning in the context of the United States Democrat-Republican divide. Doing so resulted in the models exhibiting a marked increase in ingroup solidarity and an even greater increase in outgroup hostility. Furthermore, removing either ingroup-positive or outgroup-negative sentences (or both) from the fine-tuning data leads to a significant reduction in both ingroup solidarity and outgroup hostility, suggesting that biases can be reduced by removing biased training data. Our findings suggest that modern language models exhibit fundamental social identity biases and that such biases can be mitigated by curating training data. Our results have practical implications for creating less biased large-language models and further underscore the need for more research into user interactions with LLMs to prevent potential bias reinforcement in humans.

**TL;DR**: LLMs learn and display two core social biases (ingroup solidarity & outgroup hostility), and this can be modulated with fine-tuning. Suggests more broadly that LLMs will have the same biases as those present in their training text. This work has implications beyond prior work on AI fairness re: race & gender, as social ""groups"" can be nearly anything (CS vs. stats majors; android vs iphone; libs vs cons; etc.),  and there are MANY biases that contribute to human-generate text beyond the 2 in this paper.

17iys8j,1,2023-10-29,I passed the SEC+ EXAM,u/Zealousideal-Most431,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/17iys8j/i_passed_the_sec_exam/,"Yesterday, I made the resolute decision to confront my fear and undertake the exam. My fear was primarily on the performance-based questions rather than the objective part of the exam, as I was already well-versed in most of the concepts due to my comprehensive coverage during my MSc program.   
  
Here are some tips that proved instrumental in my preparation:  
  
1. \*\*Deep Understanding:\*\* The most effective way to excel in the exam is to have a profound understanding of all the concepts. Ensure that you can explain these concepts to yourself with real-world scenarios.  
  
2. \*\*Teaching Others:\*\* Forming a study group and teaching the material to others can be an invaluable aid to memorization. I initiated a study group with undergraduate students at my institution and dedicated two months to training them in cybersecurity to comprehensively cover the exam requirements.  
  
3. \*\*Leverage ChatGPT:\*\* If you have constraints on your study time, ChatGPT is a valuable resource. Copy your study materials into ChatGPT and request explanations for each concept, even at a novice level.  
  
4. \*\*Practice Questions:\*\* Regularly work through practice questions and strive to define each available option. Utilize the elimination method to eliminate improbable choices.  
  
5. \*\*Acronyms:\*\* Familiarize yourself with as many acronyms as possible since they are abundant in the exam.  
  
6. \*\*Performance-Based Questions:\*\* Practice as many performance-based questions as you can to develop proficiency.  
  
On the day of the exam, consider the following tips:  
  
1. \*\*Maintain Composure:\*\* Make a conscious effort to eliminate nervousness and stay focused.  
  
2. \*\*Prioritize Objective Questions:\*\* Start with the objective questions and skip the performance-based questions initially. This strategy allows you to allocate time for revision and potentially revisiting the PBQs.  
  
Now, let me share my personal experience:  
  
I arrived at the exam venue one hour prior to the scheduled time. When offered the opportunity to begin early, I accepted. The first few performance-based questions felt like second nature, and I even found myself chuckling at the ease with which I answered them. The third PBQ posed a slight challenge, so I wisely opted to set it aside temporarily and focus on the other sections.  
  
After completing the majority of the exam, I still had a generous 40 minutes remaining. Returning to the two previously skipped PBQs, I finished them with 37 minutes to spare. This time cushion allowed me to meticulously review my objective question responses and even complete the post-exam survey, concluding with a comfortable 8 minutes left before submission.  
  
I can assure you that, with diligent preparation and adherence to a systematic approach, success in the exam is entirely within reach.  
  
Regarding study materials, I recommend the following resources:  
  
\- Professor Messer's video series  
\- CyberKraft  
\- ""Inside Cloud and Security"" (Please note that this source is best suited for those with a solid foundation in the topics, as it offers a condensed summary of key concepts and keywords to anticipate in the exam.)  
\- ""CompTIA Certification Guide"" (Second Edition) by Ian Neil  
  
In closing, I express my gratitude to everyone who offered me motivation and support on this journey. Your encouragement was invaluable in helping me achieve my goal.",active,41

17kqvj5,1,2023-10-31,ChatGPT one last time.,u/CreatorGodTN,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/17kqvj5/chatgpt_one_last_time/,"Well, coincidentally, I caught several students on my last exam committing the ChatGPT sin. It raised a couple of interesting factors that helped me panic less about it. 

First, all of the answers were functionally identical. The words shifted slightly between the answers, but the structure was identical, as were the key details it used to support the premises of each paragraph. This was the first major clue that students had used generative AI. 

Second, the ChatGPT responses were all just a little bit wrong—and all in the exact same way. So the students who used it were wrong on precisely the same details in precisely the same way, no matter how it was written (by the AI) or rewritten (by the student).

The third factor isn’t so much a direct finding from this example but rather just a general realization. We are all, presumably, experts in our fields of instruction. Students are learning not only the bare facts of the materials they are studying but also our unique perspectives—which should be forming a critical part of our assessments. ChatGPT is not capable of applying our unique perspectives (and never will be capable of doing so, given how it is designed and functions).

So if anything “needs to change” re: responses to ChatGPT, it’s that we need to be watching for tell-tale patterns (the same answer structures, unique phrases, etc.) and the specific manners in which the answers are wrong, alongside assessing our particular slants on the material we are teaching. 

Put another way, absolutely nothing changes, so far as catching cheaters is concerned, with the exception of making sure our assessments are capturing our unique perspectives we are imparting to students on the material we are studying.  (Which we should already be doing, anyway.)

The most interesting part of these realizations was that the farther the student goes in their career, the easier it is to catch them.",active,22
