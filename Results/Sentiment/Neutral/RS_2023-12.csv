18857qc,13,2023-12-01,My own honors in stats experience,u/threesaltedeggs,universityofauckland,https://www.reddit.com/r/universityofauckland/comments/18857qc/my_own_honors_in_stats_experience/,"Hello! The holidays have been a bit dull, so I've decided to jot down my experiences of pursuing honours in statistics. This might help anyone struggling to decide whether to go for it. ChatGPT has paraphrased this post to preserve anonymity and prevent recognition; hopefully it works well. PLEASE DON'T TELL ME YOU SEE THIS POST IF YOU KNOW ME!!!!)

I come from a background in mathematics and statistics at the bachelor's level. Still, my coding experience is almost nonexistent—the only undergraduate stats coding course I took was maths 162 and stats 20x (which I have forgotten everything).

My honours project revolved around some theoretical learning. It required no coding but leaned heavily on knowledge from mathematical analysis, drawing mainly from maths 254, 332, and 333.

In the first semester, I enrolled in stats 779, 782, and 720. As I've mentioned, my R programming skills were virtually non-existent, which made stats 782 and 779 quite challenging.

In stats 779, we had weekly homework consisting of coding tasks and multiple-choice problems. My unfamiliarity with R made the workload seem heavy, but I'm confident those well-versed in R would find it manageable. 

Stats 720 covered queuing theory. It was a small class where the lecturer sweetened each session with chocolate. The first half was straightforward, essentially a review of stats 320 and 325. The second half, which delved into renewal equations and such, was more demanding but manageable. Assignments usually comprised 3-4 questions, each with multiple subparts. While the questions were quite 'classic' and solvable if you were familiar with the material, some required considerable thought.

Stats 782 felt like a foundation of time series; it contains a group project. My experience was less than ideal; two group members were absent until the last few hours before the deadline. However, the lecturer patiently clarified our questions in great detail. The course involved extensive coding, which I found challenging. It's a data analysis course with plenty of practical examples. If you're aiming for a data analysis role or project in the future, take stats 782.

This semester, I was assigned some reading materials for my project, which were more mathematical—like measure theory—than statistical. I completed this reading in the first six weeks. During the study break, I began drafting my dissertation summarising my reading material. By around week 9, I had a draft of the initial chapters but paused to prepare for exams.

Over the holiday, I focused on the main paper my report was based on. My supervisor was incredibly patient and met with me weekly—a blessing indeed. Family commitments limited my work time to roughly two hours a day. By the start of the second semester, I had completed the preliminary chapters.

The second semester felt more enjoyable. I took stats 726, 766, and 782.

Stats 726, another course on time series, was more theoretical and very much to my liking. It covered multivariate techniques and models, emphasising theorems and proofs. Without tutorials, the approachable lecturer was an excellent resource for any uncertainties. I found this course very inspiring. The lecturer aimed to balance theory with application, considering some students might lack a stats/maths background. With a foundation in stats 310, this course wasn't challenging and proved to be enjoyable (at least for me).

Stats 766 was a small class on multivariate analysis, exploring distributions, multivariate techniques, and copulas. It felt like a natural follow-up to 310 but less intense. The course included some coding, but mainly in assignments and tutorials, requiring only pseudocode. Some assignments were challenging and time-consuming, but the lecturer was always willing to answer questions and give extensions.

Stats 782 was purely about coding. If you're proficient in R, it would likely be straightforward. (However, the class environment, regarding inclusion and diversity, was not my liking. ) Before the exams, many students appealed to Piazza to cancel the double pass requirements, presenting some solid arguments. Eventually, final grades were scaled, and the double pass was based on a weighted combination of midterm and final grades.

In the second semester, I invested significant effort into my dissertation. Despite enjoying my project, writing it was stressful. I studied around 7 hours daily during the study break and up to 13 hours as the submission deadline approached. I completed about three-quarters of my report during this semester. My supervisor's prompt feedback on my extensive dissertation was invaluable. It's always crucial to have a supportive advisor.",User_deleted,21

188pe33,1,2023-12-01,I feel like ChatGPT is making me dumber and more incompetent,u/El_Shark7,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/188pe33/i_feel_like_chatgpt_is_making_me_dumber_and_more/,"I'm a student in my second year in a business school ( specific program aiming at a master ), and I've been using chat gpt more and more. 

\- At first, it was out of desperation during a fiancial math test. Heard a lot of people were cheating with chat gpt, I was struggling with the concept of this specific test and time was running so I rolled with it. It only gave me one question right and it was pretty obvious to me that the other answer the AI gave me were wrong, so I basically only used it twice. I didn't really believe Chat GPT was useful.

\- I didn't use it for a while until this year. I have an English class since I'm not in a English speaking country, and I was struggling to find inspiration for the text of a presentation and since time was running, I used ChatGPT. I made some small change but I basically just ran with the text which worked very well for me.

\- This year, I also started financial analysis as subject. The subject was hard for me since it relied on accounting knowledge which I'm not very good at, the professor explaination didn't work for me at all and I was struggling to keep focus in his class. So, after the sucessful use of ChatGPT for English, I tried it because I had no idea on how to solve the exercises given and at this point anything was good. I didn't just ask it to solve my exercise, I rather asked it for step by step explanation on how to solve it without giving the result in number... It worked so well, not only did I did well with the exercise, but I was finally starting to understand how financial analysis worked!

\- Similarly, I had an incoming exam on tax law. While I had more understanding, I was also struggling in some way with the subject so to study for the exam I pretty much did the same thing as finance: take exercise and ask step by step explanation how to solve it without result. I did an exercise without the AI after to see if I had learned and I managed to do everything without trouble... Went to the exam ( on paper no AI ) and I did really well.

\- It started an habit where for each exercise/exam preparation in those two subject, I automatically went to ChatGPT. I was using it quite often.

\- It started to creep on other subject too: Exercise out of my level in German? ChatGPT. Need to find more information on a very specific topic for Sociology class? ChatGPT. Not sure I'm understanding well what is asked in my Marketing project? ChatGPT. It even came to my life outside of scool with dumb things like asking where to find a specific printing option, or if there was a specific twitter hashtag on a specific topic.

That leave with me now. I have a very important presentation in Sociology. I love this class, I love the subject of the presentation, I love the people and event I'm going to talk about. Really, I'm doing this presentation more for myself and my desire to learn on this topic than for a grade. But, I found myself using ChatGPT. Unlike in finance or tax law, I think I pass the line where I get the topic considerably deeper than surface level AI: for this presentation, I even made a quite specific plan that I'm very proud of, I genuily think it's really good. But when it came to write it... I need to summerize some historical events and struggled with how to do it, I was also really scared to forgot some important point or badly explain them so I asked ChatGPT out of insecurity ( still doing throughout research on each event to complete and change things, but still ). Despite being even more risky with AI than history, I had the same fear with some concept and author in sociology and phylosophy so I did the same. If I keep that my text will be technically 80% ChatGPT before all the modification I plan to do ( reogarnisation, adding transition, adding further details, removing part that are useless or will come later, modifying sentence so that they're easier for me to say naturally during the presentation, etc ).

And I'm so scared because of that. If I continue using ChatGPT when I struggle with wording and summarizing, won't I just become worst at it? Am I even incapable to focus and work enough on subject I love? Won't I risk to become dependent of AI? Am I already becoming dependent? Are my academics sucess with its help just lie?

I always though ChatGPT as a great tool, but I feel it's becoming a crutch that just make me worst. It's hard for me to event try to stop using it, because I'm someone with bad organisation and a lot of trouble focusing who survive on the motto fake it until you make it (I basically went throught highschool with pretty good gardes because I understood concept quickly and was more invested than most in the various subject, which don't really work anymore once you go through the years in college ). I just want to succeed, I can't afford to fail my semester but on the other hand I really want to seriously understand what I'm learning.",User_deleted,0
18ac5jz,7,2023-12-03,Explicitly using AI language models to facilitate learning (Seeking insights from academics),u/Name-minus-Number,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/18ac5jz/explicitly_using_ai_language_models_to_facilitate/,"Good day everyone!

I am interested in what your experiences in utilizing AI in facilitating learning. when referring to AI I mean language models like chatGPT, Claude etc.

Specifically, for those who have allowed and/or integrated AI langugae models in your teaching, I am interested in learning where have you applied it, what was your rationale, and what are your strategies. I assure everyone that I am not doing research for a manuscript but I am trying to learn from fellow acadmics (young and senior) on what have been your practices. 

For context, this is my experience:
I am m social science teacher hence my insights are mostly limited to pedagogies in sociology, political science and history. 

From personal experience and reflection as a university level lecturer, I see two distinct ways in utilizing AI: first is outright allowing it to be used to process readings, answer quizzes and write essays; and second is integrating AI in learning activities such as explicitly requiring students to utilize AI tools as part of the learning. I refer to the former as copilot style, and the latter as co-learner style. 

In assessing the two, I lean more towards the latter--. The former is simply too unpredictable if not checked or supervised, and it also leads to dilemmas of grading, attribution and assessment. I however see value in it in terms of assisting students in making sense of oftentimes, overwhelming information like ancient readings or thick rims of data (e.g. government documents). This is especially true when students are ESL or EFL students. Language models have been useful for them to make sense of complicated data that requires them to translate information in several layers (e.g. from academic english, to their langauge, to conversational english). 

In terms of the co-learning model, I explicitly require students to use AI language models i  their learning activities. I do so to either demonstrate a point on the value of critical thinking, ease the process of managing info, or even using as an opportunity to teach ethical ways of using AI. For example, I ask students to use chatgpt or bard to summarize and identity key points from classical sociology scholars like Weber. I give them a basic prompt to ask, and they are to ask to critique it in class. They can obviously use AI to critique it  but I find that language models tend to be bad in self-critque and reflection. They usually go around to the same point. I have other activities but I hope my point is clear here. 

I know that AI in teaching is a complicated topic, and the current consensus or at least the more popular take is to ban AI language models. I, however, prefer to approach it from a lens of opportunity to address existing challenges and anticipate potential challenges that may arise from it.

I am therefore in your experience with AI as a learning tool. Feel free to debate and disagree but I encourage you to indicate your reasons. My objective, again, is to seek insights. 

Thank you everyone!",active,10
18att91,2,2023-12-04,Creating a Student Advisor Chatbot - Need Advice,u/Horizonard,LocalLLaMA,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/18att91/creating_a_student_advisor_chatbot_need_advice/,"Hello everyone!  


 I'm looking to create a student advisor chatbot that can answer questions related to study programs, which field of study suits a student best, what subjects and focuses a particular field has, and more. As I'm relatively new to this field, I've experimented with QLoRa fine-tuning using a German fine-tuned Llama 2 model for testing purposes. I'm in the process of preparing my dataset from study advisory books, and I expect to have around 2000 question-answering data points. I've read that Instruction tuning can bring more advantages to tasks like this. I've used the same format (Alpaca) for fine-tuning that was used for the German fine-tuning.

I have a few questions:

1. I want my bot to learn how to respond based on the  information(##input) in the dataset. Would having 1000-2000 rows of data be sufficient to teach it the format of responses and what's relevant from the instructions for the response?
2. Are there any good German models that are well-suited for such a task?
3. What's the best way to evaluate if the fine-tuning was successful for such a task? How can I effectively test the model?
4. Is there a good script I could use for my training, where I can experiment with parameters and conduct tests?

I'd appreciate any insights or guidance you can provide. Thanks in advance!",User_deleted,2

(Already cleared this post with a mod so hopefully it doesn't run afoul of any rules).

We’re former educators (10+ years teaching math+physics and running educational outreach at the HS/college level) turned AI Researchers (ex-Alphabet). We’ve been building an AI tutoring chat agent to help both students and educators/parents, and we were wondering if some of our fellow Redditors here could play around with our demo and give us some honest feedback and discussion. We built everything custom, and did not use ChatGPT in any way to train our AI model, since we don’t believe the current big models are very capable of being good teachers (versus just telling users the answers). Since we’re just two random people working out of our garage, **things are still very rough especially in terms of accuracy**, although the model should become more accurate as we improve data/compute. But we are optimistic that our from-scratch model already seems more tutor-like than other AI bots.

**You can access the demo here:** [**https://aitutoringproject.info**](https://aitutoringproject.info).\*\* It’s free and we don’t collect any info other than what’s typed into the chat window. Any chance the folks here could let us know what you think? We’d like to understand what you like and don’t like and how we can better serve learners and educators moving forwards.

Also happy to discuss in general how people think AI tech can support education. We have a fairly interesting blend of Education and AI backgrounds so would love to engage in that discussion.",User_deleted,1

⚠️This video is a response to a highly controversial video posted on Instagram by a teacher about identifying if their students have used ChatGPT for their homework. The video sparked a huge discussion among the ChatGPT for Teachers group members on Facebook, so I decided to state my point of view on the matter. 

ChatGPT for the classroom is super beneficial for both teaching and learning, but if you follow this approach, your authority will diminish and your students' trust will fracture.

It was a real challenge. The teacher wanted us to use five different sources, and I thought it would be a breeze. But as the deadline approached, I found myself struggling.

I had a hard time finding those five sources. The library visits and online searches didn't go as smoothly as I hoped. I ended up submitting the paper with just three sources, feeling a bit defeated.

But you know what? It turned out to be a big learning experience. My teacher gave feedback, pointing out the importance of diverse sources for a well-rounded paper. Instead of feeling discouraged, I decided to do better next time.

From that point on, I became more organized in my research. I learned how to find reliable sources and plan ahead. It wasn't an instant improvement, but over the next assignments, I gradually got the hang of it. Looking back, that small failure was a stepping stone to becoming a more effective and resourceful student. 

PS: The ONLY reason I passed (no thanks to professor brown) was thanks to these research ai tools: Sourcely AI for citations, perplexity ai for research, ChatGPT for writing, pdf.ai to read research papers, yomu.ai for writing help

18bme8w,2,2023-12-05,I created NexusGenAI — a No-Code Large Language Model Configuration Platform,u/NextGen-Trading,ArtificialInteligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/18bme8w/i_created_nexusgenai_a_nocode_large_language/,"Two months ago, I was trying to fix a bug in my AI-Powered automated investing platform, [NexusTrade](https://nexustrade.io). Specifically, the issue was with the “Create a Portfolio Prompt” feature, which is designed to generate a unique set of trading strategies based on user inputs. It was frustrating trying to perform the prompt engineering in the source code, and it was difficult to isolate and test the functionality.

At the same time, I had a sorta revelation: the AI-Powered Chat is NexusTrade’s most popular feature by far. It allowed the configuration of highly sophisticated trading strategies, even for people without a technical background. The core principles of the chat — automating complex processes and improving the user experience — can be applied to a wide range of applications. For example, imagine if a teacher could generate a highly customizable lesson plan for their students that’s tailored depending on each student’s interests and personality. If only they had a platform that made this easy.

That’s why I set out to build [NexusGenAI](https://www.nexusgenai.io/). NexusGenAI branches off from NexusTrade and abstracts the AI-Powered Chat to a separate application. At the same time, it allows the configuration of Large Language Model (LLM)-Powered applications in an easy-to-use user interface.

This article will describe the current functionality of NexusGenAI and the migration of NexusTrade’s Chat to the platform. It will then describe the next steps before the application is ready for a large-scale public release.

If you want to be the first to try NexusGenAI, sign up for the waitlist today!

# Transitioning NexusTrade’s AI Chat to NexusGenAI

The initial step in developing NexusGenAI involves establishing a minimum viable product (MVP). The primary goal is to integrate the sophisticated capabilities of NexusTrade’s chat into this new application. This will encompass features such as the creation and backtesting of trading strategies, along with advanced financial analysis. For a comprehensive understanding of NexusTrade’s chat architecture, refer to the detailed description provided in the [following article.](https://nexustrade.io/blog/architecting-an-extensible-maintainable-ai-chat-bot-for-your-web-application-20231014)

To summarize the article, the NexusTrade application operates through a sequential process:

1. It identifies the user’s request as pertaining to a specific “Prompt.”
2. It utilizes the corresponding Prompt to formulate a response to the user.
3. Optionally, it engages in post-processing steps, which may include executing additional function calls.

This established workflow was successfully transitioned to NexusGenAI, culminating in a user interface that encapsulates these functionalities.

18bv4tv,12,2023-12-05,Textbook review: 新实用汉语课本5 （New Practical Chinese Reader 5: Textbook),u/BeckyLiBei,ChineseLanguage,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/18bv4tv/textbook_review_新实用汉语课本5_new_practical_chinese/,"TL;DR:

- ""Reader"" does not imply ""graded reader""; it's a textbook similar to, but less comprehensive than, the HSK6 Standard Course.

- I spent 8 to 10 hours per chapter (10 chapters total) studying it in detail.  I discussed things I didn't fully grasp in detail with ChatGPT.  Most of the vocabulary I already knew (it'd take longer for a student who doesn't know these words prior).

- It starts off easy and gets harder.  The texts towards the end are more diverse and interesting than vs. other textbooks.

- No answers to exercises are provided (ask ChatGPT).

- Like the HSK6 Standard Course, vocabulary is defined via English (and thus imprecisely), and the grammar points are explained using Chinese linguistics jargon (and thus are harder to fully appreciate and understand).

- I feel it's useful for preparing for the HSK6.  While HSK6 Standard Course textbooks are more comprehensive, I found 新实用汉语课本5's grammar explanations and exercise more helpful.

- Where relevant, I suggest reading the original texts online as they differ from the textbook version.

In preparation for the HSK6 exam, my iTalki teacher suggested I study the textbook 《新实用汉语课本5》, which I've just now finished studying.  It has 10 chapters: 51 through 60.

First things first, while the title uses the word ""reader"", it's not a graded reader (for years I saw ""reader"" and thought it wasn't a textbook, so never thought about using it).  There is a lot of reading involved, though.

It's quite similar to the HSK6 Standard Course in style: the main thing is texts with vocabulary translated into English (no Chinese definitions are given, but Chinese is used for grammar explanations).

It uses a standard chapter structure: (a) main text with 50 to 70 new words; (b) relevant grammar with collocations and example sentences, (c) exercises (e.g. write words using a specified hanzi, fill in the blank, true/false questions, answer questions using vocabulary; it varies); (d) auxiliary text with 10 to 20 new words; (e) questions about the auxiliary text; (f) dialogue (text) with ~10 new words; (g) listening (mp3) with ~10 new words, usually less than 2 minutes long; (h) questions about the recording.  The textbook is weighted far more heavily towards reading than listening.

I spent something like 8 to 10 hours studying per chapter, this included reading the texts aloud (sometimes multiple times); doing the exercises (I skipped a few I thought were pointless); discussing details with ChatGPT; reading the original text where relevant (sometimes the text was modified from an original source), and listening (sometimes multiple times) to the mp3.

I knew most (maybe 80%+) of the 1000+ new words it includes.  (Obviously this is not enough to cover all 2500 HSK6 vocabulary.)  There were a greater proportion of words I didn't know towards the end.

Some of the texts are ""less bland"".  E.g., 初为人妻 (in chapter 57) is somewhat anti-feminist, where a woman finds that her feminist ideals are inhibiting her from 幸福 (the audio in chapter 57 is also fairly anti-feminist, portraying a woman being unreasonable, and then just deciding to stop being unreasonable and everything is fine).  背影 (in chapter 58) was written about 100 years ago, and is super-emotional, about a father's breakdown after his mother dies, and his son who regrets distancing himself from his father; it was a struggle to get through this, both grammatically and emotionally.  The text 十八年的秘密 (in chapter 59) actually has intrigue and mystery, but it feels like ""hijinks"" in that people don't simply do the obvious thing, like tell each other the truth (I guess it's fictional).  The dialogue 梁山伯与祝英台 (in chapter 59) reads a bit like an unfunny Monty Python sketch.

I recommend reading the original texts where relevant (I found them online by Googling the title and author's name); a few passages are modified from an original, which can make the story sound awkward.  E.g., in one passage words to the effect of ""died in combat"" were replaced with words to the effect of ""crushed by a rock""; in another passage, the textbook changed it so that an adult Chinese woman had never cooked before (which wasn't part of the original story).  I found the plots make more sense if you read the unmodified version.

The audio for chapter 58 is weird.  A youth convinces a frail old man (who they just met) to sell their house for 1/10-th of the price, making all sorts of promises.  The audio presents it as if the youth is doing a really lovely thing, and not scamming an old man.  The audio for chapter 60, which I was hoping would be a grand finale, was weak.

All in all, while not perfect, I found this textbook to be a reasonable way to study at the HSK6 level.",active,16

18cvela,2,2023-12-07,"Kids are getting so elaborately and creatively good at cheating, they may actually do well in the workplace",u/Comfortable-Chip-740,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/18cvela/kids_are_getting_so_elaborately_and_creatively/,"I just read that post about the invisible ink and the ChatGPT, and don't get me wrong, that was insanely mislead and wrong (not to mention laughable due to the lack of omission of the ""Certainly, here are..."" starters ChatGPT gives you).

However, I work in engineering and if these kids were working as grad/undergrad engineers and had _that much capability_ with the cheating tools available to them in just _middle school/high school_, I can only imagine how creative and resourceful they will be by the time they are in the workforce (and AI/user-assisting technologies have got their feet off the ground). They'll be fully able to generate efficient and computer-checked solutions by blending together AI prompting, design software, the vast array of knowledge from Google, all with minimal human intervention therefore reducing human error, saving time, and streamlining the design process.

Obviously this comes with its negatives, for example if the engineers don't know how to design it without their fancy AI, who is actually checking it's correct? I don't condone cheating but given that it's already occurring, I find it funny that these kids put more effort into finding efficient cheating solutions instead of actually doing the work - it's become an entire skill in itself.

Please give your inputs in the comments as I'm not a teacher and would love to hear your thoughts for the effects of efficient (sadly) student cheating on their workplace proficiency with creativity and tools. Disclaimer again that I completely understand cheating in school bypasses the important learning to actually be able to engineer anything in the first place, but hopefully you can see what I'm talking about.

Tl;dr students put so much effort, creativity, and critical thought into cheating that they may be able to put those skills to use in a workplace to become efficient workers (but I know their understanding and learning will suffer due to cheating and I don't condone it)",active,3
18d8qum,2,2023-12-07,Thoughts on true strong AI like Data,u/galtoramech8699,agi,https://www.reddit.com/r/agi/comments/18d8qum/thoughts_on_true_strong_ai_like_data/,"So I have been looking at AI for about 20 years, mostly as an enthusiast or amateur.   I have an engineering degree and do software engineering now I follow the AI field but not my core focus.  I read papers from time to time.  We may been doing machine learning at the company but ML is ML and ChatGPT are ...just that.

A little history and thoughts.

So I wrote small chat bots like Eliza and do basic pattern matching and respond with some proper response.  And I am surprised that Chatgpt was so far advanced from Eliza.  Just thinking, I guess in software, there is still a difference between an amateur developer playing around, student doing programming, open source projects and major companies doing development.  For example, MS may add AI into their OS in future.  Can't imagine Linux will do that anytime soon or Ubuntu really not the Linux kernel. I would like to be on those discussions if they are though.  


But anyways, ChatGPT is interesting.  I am still not that impressed for the reasons I will list later.  But a good project, it is not like I came up.  And it could be a disruptor if used the right way. I don't think it is the internet.  When I got on the Internet in 1995? with netscape, I didn't necessarily had to use, but I was pretty addicted and if you to 2000, 2010, we had to use, no other options essentially. Chat gpt, I use about once a week I guess because I still search stuff on google. Even then I use chatgpt for 10 minutes.  Basically I ask it stupid questions I wouldn't get away with on reddit.

I think Chat GPT is deficient in a couple of ways and I will lead into my strong ai question.

&#x200B;

* The hallucinations are still a big deal.  Isn't it basically that wrong information can influence Chat gpt.  And I guess like fake news, how would it know?
* Chat GPT prompts go one way, a user has to prompt chat gpt essentially, prompt, prompt with questions.
* The responses are canned and not really changing much, you ask 100 times, get about same response.  You ask a human the same question, it may change from day to day, which is fine.  And maybe the answer for chat gpt do change over time, but not like a human would
*  I still think chatgpt is advanced transformer, language model, doesn't really think.  I still think about really good chat bot, like eliza with a large database.  Which is basically google, google has probably a larger database but not no real language there.
* And let's not discount the technolgies that have been out there.  Google, Internet Search, Alexa, Wolfram Alpha, Siri.  I am surprised like google didn't come out there first.  I guess they are always search focused and advertising.  Really I think Alexa was the first big chat bot, maybe Siri, siri just always seemed annoying to me for some reason.
* It is not like... this thing is bad technology.  And I wonder in 5 years, where it will go.  I think the big buzz is over and people will use it like they do now.  Writing and summarizing documents, search , researching things.  Customer service maybe, better help chat bots.  Improving canned algorithmic software code.

Here is what I think on strong AI, and a question.  Are there good papers on strong ai, the kind of psychology driven AI, human like AI.

* So Chat GPT can do the language and seems life like with the canned questions and responses.
* So the closest amateur research thing I did.  I was really interested in the low level, bottom up AI and evolutionary algorithms.  My thought was, I would replicate earth like beings.  If you think about it, we share a lot of dna with a lot of smart animals, like dolphins, dogs, pigs, monkeys, ravens.  They are all smart if you think about .  I just got a dog.  And I pour dog water and I wondered, how does it know to drink the water.  And I think it is the same way we do.  The dogs parents probably drank water and then they learned to drink water and how to find it.  So when I pour the water or hear it splash into the container, they can probably assume this is water and they should drink it. I still dont think it was smell but anyway...  I was interested in low level AI, not just dogs  or dolphins, but the evolutionary process from amoeba life to humans.  And if you really go back, you have to understand the environment we live in too, so almost have to go back 4 billion years and replicate all that in some time simulation.  I think it is a cool idea but computationally impossible.  And I looked artificial chemistry research, evolutionary biology, cellular automata, stuff like that.  I think it was cool, because the dynamic nature generated interested results.
* Anyway, taking that above, I thought the key to AI was understanding early life.  I am done with that but I still think we need to look at the nature of animals and how that leads into Strong AI.  So think about humans, and not all humans are smart.  Chat gpt is probably smarter than 95% of them certain areas.  For example you can ask the fast food restaurant person to analyze markets from 10 years ago.  Chat GPT can.  But at the same time, why would Chat GPT analyze markets anyway.  Maybe the fast food worker, does look at stocks in their free time and maybe 10 years later, they could make some side money with basic knowledge on it.  And then maybe come back with basic ideas on how they do that.  But here is the question, the fast food worker is motivated to look into stocks because they have some ""desire"" to do so for their family or friends or to enrich themselves.  Why would chatgpt do that?  It couldn't unless you prompt it and just happened to have that knowledge.  Will chatgpt do this?
* Like I said, I wont back to the amoeba.  But I am curious what motivates a dog to drink water.  What motivates people to want things?
* The other thing I hate about things like Chatgpt and canned tools.  And really even AI in games.  I have always wanted bad AI?   Even I create an AI or game or something.  I want a bad actor, a bad AI.  Just like we have bad people and google people. We need bad AI and good AI.  I really think Open AI should create an AI that actually steals, cheats and lies to people.  They wont, but then then create an cop AI.   Better goverance in their AI system will function better when their is some bad actor to protect against.  As it stands now, we basically expect chatgpt to always act perfectly and lawfully.
* Basically current AI is not strong AI, it has no desire, no issues, no depression, no anxiety, no fear.  And from that, maybe not ability to respond to bad situations unless we program it.  Current AI does not act organically or dynmaically or adapt as well as humans or other animals.  AI has no memory because it doesnt need one.  Our fears, sometimes drive our memory to avoid certain things, AI doesn't do that.  


&#x200B;

Anyway, will chat gpt go there?  When? How long?  Is there research on this?  Does it make sense at all?  


Sorry I am not an academic so my terms may be off here.

In every single class I see him turn in work that was created by using a template with very very minimal changes- the background is the same, layout, colors, fonts, site structures and content, etc. Basically just some words are changed. Which brings me to the words themselves- they are clearly straight out of ChatGPT ( you can tell just by reading them and I've also thrown them in some chatgpt detectors and they come back 99% chance written entirely by AI). Here's my question- am I right to call him out during our next critique? My thinking is why should we waste our time giving him critique when he hasn't designed any part of his project.

This is my fourth year. I try very hard to really vary the assignments in regard to difficulty. Historically, my classes average an 80. The course is broad and I provide a lot of assignments. I’ve found that the students in prior years were much better equipped to do well. I was able to challenge them when appropriate, and they performed as expected. 

This semester…..oh boy. I may be experiencing the effects from COVID academic easing, and it’s put me in a pickle. 

Class average is 58, median is 59. There are 19 students. 4 of which are between 77-80. All others are below 70, which is the C- threshold. 

The remaining 15 students, by the standard rubric, are failing. Not only do they not do well on the assignments (after multiple attempts), they don’t have a grasp of requisite arithmetic, or simple algebra. Many don’t know how to use a calculator. None have approved special accommodations. They are simply unprepared. I blame the school for moving them along. 

Now I have to submit grades soon and I don’t feel comfortable in “curving” according to the bell or inflating grades 20 points. Given that I also teach the class that requires this to be a pre-requisite, my gut is to fail them because that’s the rubric and they don’t know the material to even merit a C. 

I’ve already provided 15% extra credit, which they did poorly on. It only benefited the top 4 students. Some submitted extra credit, got 100% on it, and then could not answer THE SAME question on the sit in exam with a study guide at their disposal. Thanks ChatGPT. 

I haven’t spoken to my chair yet. I’m a bit embarrassed. I understand the implications of failing students but also don’t want to lower the standard in my own field of work.

I am also collecting material on actual experiences from both sides from other people.

Could you share with me your experience with chatGPT (or similar) in the field of teaching or learning? I am obviously also interested in opposing opinions or problems derived from its use, as long as they are justified and you have experienced them firsthand. You can also write to me privately.

My hope is to bring a balanced reflection on the topic, hoping that the integration of these tools into the educational system happens in a sensible way in my nation. Thank you very much for the help!

18efjh1,7,2023-12-09,AI tools used for determining whether or not a body of text was written by a human or AI are flawed. They cannot be relied upon and I will explain why.,u/seeking-immortality,ArtificialInteligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/18efjh1/ai_tools_used_for_determining_whether_or_not_a/,"I've spent the majority of my spare time for the past 4-6 weeks, researching each induvial case on social media. Mainly due to the influx of student (mainly US based), raising complaints against their faculty when it comes to marking their assignments invalid due to the use of ""AI"". Or more specifically the AI tool ""ChatGPT"".

This peaked my interest and I wanted to test these free online tools that it seems many educational systems are reliant on to spot AI plagiarism. My findings are pretty simple in hindsight:

There is a significant correlation between writing from an x person perspective and these tools incorrectly specifying bodies of text as AI generated content. As well as the level of writing with exclusion of gender specific words. 

1. If you include a lot of first person words and gender denominations and write at primary school level or high school level. Free tools will return 0-10% possibility of AI generated content.
2. If you include a lot of first person words and gender denominations, write at University level or Level 7. Free tools will return 10-60% possibility of AI generated content.
3. If you include a lot of third person words and no gender denominations, write at University level or Level 7. Free tools will return 10-86% possibility of AI generated content.

This shows that:

* When AI models/services are learning from user input behaviour they are expecting the majority of humans to write at a lower grade than expecting. potentially proving that a lot of ""undereducated"" humans are using the tool and therefor training models to expect lower than level 7 writing. 
* Following on from the above when asking AI models for information or specific situations major of the time users will ask it for ""I need x, can you do this?"" or ""Using the information given, can you give me x?"". More specifically I've seen that AI services are being used to reword paragraphs or rewrite passages to sound more intellectual.

Therefore, when work written by students completing a standard or master level degree, is looked at by one of these tools. It's flagged as AI generated because the models expect a lower level of writing and from a first person perspective. This level of writing isn't what these modes are trained on, which results in false positives.

Another aspect is because AI generated text is majority genderless by default, unless requested by the user. This can also result in false positives when writing about something that doesn't require gender to be specified or needed.

Tools I've found are very inaccurate are:

1. [https://writer.com/ai-content-detector/](https://writer.com/ai-content-detector/)
2. [https://gptzero.me/](https://gptzero.me/)
3. [https://detecting-ai.com/](https://detecting-ai.com/)
4. [https://undetectable.ai/](https://undetectable.ai/)
5. [https://sapling.ai/ai-content-detector](https://sapling.ai/ai-content-detector)

I find it odd how intensive testing hasn't been completed on these models considering that majority of people are using these tools in positions they shouldn't be. All AI detectors mentioned have been established since 2023, meaning not only have they been around less than a year but most of these are built from ChatGPT services, adding to the unviability of these tools.",active,10

If you're gonna use it in the workforce use it in school.

I'd turn the tables and accuse the professors of being lazy not the students. Since GPT exists you should expect and encourage your students to use it, and instead just up the essay requirements to exceed the context window. This will force students to focus on research and fact checking which is what they should be doing anyway.

Calculators are cheating on a 5th grade math test and are encouraged on a 9th grade one. You shouldn't be expected to master something by hand you should just be expected to understand the building blocks.

In order for technology to keep progressing we need to cull the stuff not necessary to learn anymore. Why waste time teaching someone something that GPT will do for them when they could devote that time to teaching them something else.

At a certain point the progress of tech will be too much to expect an entry level scientist or engineer to know. Because at a certain point the scientist could spend his entire life only learning up to level 20 when society is at level 150.

The idea is for the AI to be the scribe for the building blocks of tech and instead let us start at level 150 in college.

Microsoft Word started spell checking and then grammar checking. Grammarly took that to the next level and started suggesting rewrites of whole sentences or paragraphs. ChatGPT can take your thoughts and what you want to say and make it sound coherent. It can even learn your writing style and make it sound like you. 

Personally as a masters and doctorate professor, it has made my emails sound more professional and more efficient in their message. It has also cut my workflow down from 10 hours per new lecture hour to about 2 to 3. I give it a prompt, it gives me some pretty good information tailored to the education level of my students. I then review this information, make sure it's correct (and sometimes it's not), add or remove information, and then put it into a PowerPoint. I then have it write test questions from the reading material and the Power Point. Overall, my lectures are way better. They have clearly presented and summarized points. My test questions are clearly worded and sourced so less challenges against them. Overall, it's been great. 

ChatGPT is a tool. Can it be used to cheat? If that's your intent, yes. But education has always been what you want to get out of it as a student. There's always been ways of cheating, let's not kid ourselves. If I get better papers with correct formatting, I'm all for it.",User_deleted,0

I teach a creative writing class next term. I've taught it before, and currently, I have the students writing a ""final story / narrative"" as their final assignment (exams are not a thing my program). 

This is supposed to be a 10-20 page story with analysis of how they chose to structure it, create characters, etc. Obviously, this is ChatGPT-able. 

My admin advised to add ""interim assignments"" e.g. put in multiple assignments to see the process of their rough drafts, which I did. However, I know students will just skip all the rough draft assignments then Chat GPT their final paper. 

Is there anyway around this? Is there someway to include the grades of the rough work with the final project? Figured I should ask the educated masses.

1:Make your cv solid asf, I used tools provided by my uni and chatgpt, and my CV passed screening in most of the applications. 

2: Try to get small work experiences in your 1st year and early stages of 2nd year. I had two small 50 hour web developer internships that I got through my uni.

3: Be open and a bit friendly in interviews (my opinion), don't be nervous and shi, I was getting a bit nervous before the interviews but once it got started I was in the zone, I was smiling throughout, throwing small things that made Interviewers chuckle basically it was a very friendly and positive environment. In the final interview I got 1 question wrong out of 3 technical questions and I still passed it because the communication part was very good from my side.

4: I've been very depressed, stressed and worried about my future in these past 2 years of uni in UK because of the financial pressure that I have put on my parents (I realized this after coming to UK otherwise I wouldn't have), but the day I got that call, when they told me I got the placement, that shit was so fucking satisfying. My plan is to return to India after earning atleast the amount of money I spent on my studies.

5: Last thing: you gotta be a bit delusional, stay in that main character vibe. I didn't knew shit about advance topics of languages but few days before the Interviews I learnt all the basics like OOP, Error handling,  threading and etc. Never in my life I said ""I am worthless"" ""I can't do it"" ""I am shit"" and etc. Even tho I was shit some times lmao🤷‍♂️

I would like to know what kind of material I should research for a IA that describes what is happening in a comic book/manga for the user; I am mainly doing this in order to present the project to a professor of mine, so that i can get closer to the field of Machine Learning and Computer Vision. The purpose of all this is so that manga and comics can become more accessible for visually impaired people, which are very well described here:  [Accessible Comics for Visually Impaired People: Challenges and Opportunities](https://hal.science/hal-01651358/document)  


Ideally, the project should be an app that takes a comic/manga and describes it to the user the same way a normal book or light novel tells a story. But i know that an IA that can do that is really hard to develop, but i am optimistic to ate least study the problem around it.  


I have gathered that at least the segmentation of at least the text inside a comic book or manga is somewhat simple, like in [Unconstrained Text Detection in Manga](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03997) or in [Text Block Segmentation in Comic Speech Bubbles](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353206709_Text_Block_Segmentation_in_Comic_Speech_Bubbles).  


And the detection of characters is also understood, like in [Comic Characters Detection Using Deep Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8270235).

  
The challenge seems to be the description of the content, as it is hard to tell a machine to analyze art, since comics books and manga are a medium of art, since it is very complicated to understand actions, inferring narratives, cultural differences and language barriers;  the best approach seems to be the use of the technologies such as the ones behind Midjourney and ChatGPT. But I would like for my solution to be opensource or at least as free and accessible as possible, because I am studying in a public university and it is good for the visually impaired community.  


In summary, what should I search for in order to build an AI that understands a comic book or manga, so that it can translate the content into a traditional book form.

I am third year law student who is about to start winter break, and I thought it'd be fun to make a little side project (because after my time boils away in finishing up the semester and getting ready for the bar!) to try and learn to build something to make my life a little easier! Finding time for job applications while dealing with classes, research, exams, and externships has been overwhelming this semester. I’ve barely had a moment to breathe, let alone apply to as many jobs as I had hoped. I only got applications out to about 5 places when I really wanted to cast a wider net. Now, with winter break finally here, I’m hoping to make up for lost time. 

I am absolutely spending my entire break focusing primarily on job applications, that is my sole priority! But writing a cover letter is so tedious, it does help a ton but it's the biggest amount of friction I deal with. I'll get everything else needed and then push it off - which is just a lack of discipline on my end but I really want to try to get rid of that friction.

So here’s my idea: I want to take some of the tedious work out of the process by creating a web app to help jumpstart my cover letters. I’d upload my resume and enter key details about the job posting and company. Then, with the click of a button, it would auto-generate a draft cover letter. 

The program wouldn't write anything final - I still want to customize and refine every letter. But having a framework to start from would make writing and revising each one so much easier. I could even build in some variability so that each draft comes out a little different. That way, I won't be sending out carbon copies. The letters will still sound authentic, retain my voice and style, and highlight what makes me a good fit.

Also I am so aware this could also be a form of procrastination (I just have a fear of rejection I have to get over) but this is just something to do when im not applying.  


I wanted to post this in public because I want to be able to see a project to the end, so the accountability helps!  


Though I would love some advice! I am not entirely technical, so I wanted to build it in someway that I dont need to code. I have ChatGPT, but I really don't know enough about coding to even know what to ask or even have a small idea of what is going on. I learned about something called Bubble or flutter flow, apparently I do not need coding experience to use this!

3. For you genEd teachers who need to modify for kids, you can literally copy and paste the text you’re working with in class and prompt ChatGPT to rewrite it at whatever grade/lexile level you want. 

4. For you math teachers, the same applies. Prompt ChatGPT to write math problems covering the topic you’re teaching, but prompt it to write the problems at a grade/lexile level that matches your students.

5. Here’s another universal example: “summarize (your topic/reading/event/theme) into 5 key points and create one open ended response question” 

I encourage you all to play with ChatGPT. You can easily create modified materials with only a few key strokes!",active,186
18i3m9k,453,2023-12-14,"We made $325k in 2023 from AI products, starting from 0, with no-code, no funding and no audience",u/hopefully_useful,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/18i3m9k/we_made_325k_in_2023_from_ai_products_starting/,"I met my co-founder in late 2022 after an introduction from a mutual friend to talk about how to find contract Product Management roles.

I was sporadically contracting at start-up at the time and he had just come out of another start-up that was wiped out by the pandemic.

We hit it off, talking about ideas, sharing what other indie-hackers were doing, and given GPT-3’s prominence at the time, we started throwing around ideas about things we could build with it, if nothing else, just to learn.

I should caveat, neither of us were AI experts when starting out, everything we learned has been through Twitter and blogs, my background is as an accountant, and his a consultant.

Here’s how it went since then:

&#x200B;

**Nov 2022 (+$50)**

\- We built a simple tool in around a week using GPT-3 fine-tuning and a no-code tool (Bubble) that helped UK university students write their personal statements for their applications

\- We set some Google Ads going and managed to make a few sales (\~$50) in the first week

\- OpenAI were still approving applications at the time and said this went against their “ethics” so we had to take it down

&#x200B;

**Dec 2022 (+$200)**

\- We couldn’t stop coming up with ideas related to AI fine-tuning, but realised it was almost impossible to decide which to pursue

\- We needed a deadline to force us so we signed up for the Ben’s Bites hackathon in late December

\- In a week, we built and launched a no-code fine-tuning platform, allowing people to create fine-tuned models by dragging and dropping an Excel file onto it

\- We launched it on Product Hunt, having no idea how to price it, and somehow managed to get \~2,000 visitors on the site and make 2 sales at $99

&#x200B;

**Jan 2023 (+$3,000)**

\- We doubled down on the fine-tuning idea and managed to get up to \~$300 MRR, plus a bunch of one-time sales and a few paid calls to help people get the most out of their models

\- We quickly realised that people didn’t want to curate models themselves, they just wanted to dump data and get magic out

\- That was when we saw people building “Talk with x book/podcast” on Twitter as side projects and realised that was the missing piece, we needed to turn it into a tool

\- We started working on the new product in late January

&#x200B;

**Feb 2023 (+$9,000)**

\- We started pre-selling access to an MVP for the new product, which allowed people to “chat with their data/content”, we got $5,000 in pre-sales, more than we made from the previous product in total

\- By mid-February, after 3 weeks of building we were able to launch and immediately managed to get traction, getting to $1k MRR in < 1 week, building on the hype of ChatGPT and AI (we were very lucky here)

&#x200B;

**Mar - Jul 2023 (+$98,000)**

\- We worked all the waking hours to keep up with customer demand, bugs, OpenAI issues

\- We built integrations for a bunch of services like Slack, Teams, Wordpress etc, added tons of new functionality and continue talking to customers every day

\- We managed to grow to $17k MRR (just about enough to cover our living expenses and costs in London) through building in public on Twitter, newsletters and AI directories (and a million other little things)

\- We sold our fine-tuning platform for \~$20k and our university project for \~$3k on Acquire

&#x200B;

**Aug 2023 (+$100,000)**

\- We did some custom development work based on our own product for a customer that proved pretty lucrative

&#x200B;

**Sep - Oct 2023 (+$62,000)**

\- After 8 months of building constantly, we started digging more seriously into our usage and saw subscriptions plateauing

\- We talked to and analysed all our paying users to identify the main use cases and found 75% were for SaaS customer support

\- We took the leap to completely rebuild a version of our product around this use case, our biggest to date (especially given most features with no-code took us <1 day)

&#x200B;

**Nov - Dec 2023 (+$53,000)**

\- We picked up some small custom development work that utilised our own tech

\- We’re sitting at around $22k MRR now with a few bigger clients signed up and coming soon

\- After 2 months of building and talking to users, we managed to finish our “v2” of our product, focussed squarely on SaaS customer support and launched it today.

&#x200B;

We have no idea what the response will be to this new version, but we’re pretty happy with it, but couldn’t have planned anything that happened to us in 2023 so who knows what will come of 2024, we just know that we are going to be learning a ton more.

&#x200B;

Overall, it is probably the most I have had to *think* in my life - other jobs you can zone out from time to time or rely on someone else if you aren’t feeling it - not when you are doing this, case and point, I am writing this with a banging head-cold right now, but wanted to get this done.

A few more things we have learned along the way - context switching is unreal, as is keeping up with, learning and reacting to AI. There isn’t a moment of the day I am not thinking about what we do next.

But while in some way we now have hundreds of bosses (our customers) I still haven’t felt this free and can’t imagine ever going back to work for someone else.

Next year we’re really hoping to figure out some repeatable distribution channels and personally, I want to get a lot better at creating content/writing, this is a first step!

Hope this helps someone else reading this to just try starting something and see what happens.",active,513

Of course I didn’t say that since I’m too nice. But I firmly held my ground and told her no. She left still clearly upset. I feel that this isn’t the end and I’ll be hearing from her and/or her advisor. 

What on earth happened since I was in school? We wouldn’t have dared to try to negotiate or even demand a better grade when we didn’t deserve it. I guess at 34, I’m an old fuddy-duddy. 

*For those who wonder why, would you trust a nurse who got by on extra credit to tend to you? Especially when it’s a math course where they must learn how to administer medication precisely.

As I sit down to share a peculiar incident that unfolded in my English class, I find myself both amused and slightly perplexed. Today, I stumbled upon a revelation that brought into focus the evolving landscape of learning in the digital age. Let me regale you with the tale of a student, a tool, and a twist in the tale.  
In the midst of a riveting discussion on Shakespeare's timeless soliloquies, I noticed a student, let's call him Alex, immersed in his phone rather than the Bard's prose. Now, as any seasoned teacher would do, I approached Alex, ready to dispense my sternest lecture on the importance of paying attention. To my surprise, I caught a glimpse of an oddly familiar interface on his screen – Reddit, a platform I frequent to engage in discourse with fellow language enthusiasts.  
As I peered over Alex's shoulder, my eyes widened in realization. There it was, unmistakably: ChatGPT, the very tool I had been introducing my students to for honing their writing skills. Caught between a desire to applaud Alex's resourcefulness and a responsibility to maintain the sanctity of classroom discussions, I decided to probe further.  
""Alex,"" I asked, feigning innocence, ""what intriguing thoughts are you sharing with the Reddit community today?""  
Caught off guard, Alex stammered but eventually admitted to using ChatGPT to craft a post on the intricacies of Macbeth's character development. Now, while I couldn't help but commend his initiative to seek additional insights, I couldn't ignore the potential implications for his academic integrity.  
The story doesn't end there, my dear colleagues. Determined to unearth the extent of Alex's reliance on AI assistance, I delved into his recent essays. Lo and behold, the digital fingerprints of ChatGPT were scattered across his submissions like breadcrumbs through a forest.  
It dawned on me that while ChatGPT is a marvelous tool for enhancing linguistic prowess, it should be wielded ethically. As educators, it is our responsibility to guide our students in the ethical use of technology, fostering critical thinking and genuine engagement with the subject matter.  
So, here I am, sharing this tale of intrigue and discovery with you, my esteemed colleagues. Let it serve as a reminder that as we navigate the ever-changing landscape of education, we must be vigilant guardians of academic integrity, encouraging our students to tread the fine line between innovation and ethical conduct.  
Cheers to the ongoing adventure of teaching the wonders of the English language,

After my graduation, I would like to work on one specific problem that was only superficially addressed in the previous literature. And now I have an issue: I don't know where to do actual science!

Of course, I thought about the academia. But I was following several projects in different labs and I noticed some strange patterns. First, since the KPI is about h-index and a number of papers, most of other criteria are ignored. You need to publish in a top venue, and that's it. This results that phd students with more trendy and less rigorous works are getting higher chances to stay in academia. Second, I noticed that (some?) people do not work on problems but they work for grants. For example, recently, I found out that one whole lab jumps closer to the LLM/ChatGPT topic, since it will be simpler to obtain a grant. The same happened with two other research groups I follow: they never really worked deep with LLMs (e.g., chatGPT) and now they write grant proposals with LLMs. Third, I can see that many postdocs don't have much time to do actual rigorous research: they write grant proposals, supervise students, chair conferences, write papers, teach, do networking. So, I ended up with the conclusion that for me the rigorous science would be hardly achievable in academia.

So, here is the question. I really want to solve one specific applied research problem. Should I consider making a startup? Or, should it be some form of non-commercial? What other forms can you suggest for doing rigorous research?",User_deleted,0
18knssp,5,2023-12-17,I'm frozen in indecision,u/L4ndd3ld,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/18knssp/im_frozen_in_indecision/,"Sorry for the length in advance but I wanted to be thorough.  


I've spoken to a lot of people about the issue I'm about to express and, to a person, they have all given me advice that simplified the problem or gave solutions that failed to address all the nuances of the situation.   


For length's sake, lets get right to the point:  

* I have been unemployed for 8 months now.
* I have a wife who is 16 weeks pregnant.
* My mother, who is 56, is dying in a nursing home and is suffering from dementia from an as of yet unknown source.
* I have a 15-year-old violent felony (a fist fight) on my record that cannot be expunged in my state, and there is no 7-year background check restriction in my state.
* I graduated in 2021 with my BS in Computer Science, yet am 38 years old (I wanted to change careers).
* I was a C student and would consider myself a mediocre programmer.
* I was born to a single mother, with a father that was not part of my life. My grandparents are dead. I have no extended family from which to ask for help.
* My family was always poor, and thus I have no intergenerational wealth to fall back on.  


 Now for the context: 

The state my life is in now all really started when I was 23. I got into a fist fight at a party in a small town of only 5000 people. We only have one local newspaper here, and thus the whole thing ended up on the front page of the paper. Between that, and the fact that I pled guilty to get probation and go home, meant that the charge of assault ended up being on my record forever.

This has always made it harder for me to get jobs. So, I did the thing everyone told me to do: go back to school and demonstrate my skills and my ""reformed responsibility."" I needed something that was skill-based and not highly regulated, so, on the advice of many, I chose computer science. I was told that programming was in high demand and thus would help to offset my record when people went to hire me.

Upon graduating, I immediately found that the story was more nuanced than that. As it turned out, all the ""in-demand"" jobs were for senior positions, and in most cases, the person who hired me would be younger than me. If all that wasn't enough, I found that having a record made it just as hard to get a programming job as anything else. I found that I would never be hired to work in a job that needs clearance, never be trusted to program for finance, healthcare, education, and almost every other one of the biggest industries in the country.

This whole process led me to work as a freelancer and for a few small local firms that needed a one-man-show kind of thing. All of these were temp gigs but nonetheless, for a moment, I was making a good living. I worked primarily on Upwork and made quite a bit of money for a year or so. I had thought that everything was finally working out for me, but then ChatGPT hit the market.  


Now I'm faced with a stark choice: 1) try to skill up and get into AI to stay relevant, or 2) do something else.   


Now, scenario  1 might seem like a no brainer but as I've said there are nuances. I said above that I'm a ""mediocre programmer"" and I meant it. What I mean by this is that I got my degree at a community college and was able to bypass much of the complex mathematics needed for programing. Essentially, I'm a code monkey. I've always struggled with math and failed college algebra 3 times before finally passing with a C.   


Now, I do believe that with enough time and effort I could learn the mathematics needed to get into AI, but where it would take others months it will take me years. I simply don't have the foundations that others already have in place.   


I've laid out a possible path for myself which begins on MIT's open course ware website and finishes at a university getting my masters in AI. But, this whole process I estimate will take about 3-4 years. Meanwhile, how do I eat and support my family?   


Scenario 2 is even more stark, as I have spent so much time and treasure even getting to the point I am now that I don't even know where to begin. Again, the felony thing really keeps me out of almost everything. Manually labor is all that's really left and my medical issues won't let me do much of that.   


Besides, if I'm really honest I don't want to do anything else. I was proud of making it as far as I have and won't even know where to begin if I switched careers now.   


In the end I'm up wracked with indecision and don't know where to turn to from here.

Here I wanted to share more specifics about my experience with each class, as well as my master’s project, working as a TA, and internships. 

# Specialization: Computing Systems

I planned to specialize in ML because that’s most relevant to my research interests, but I also wanted to make sure I learned OS, hardware, and algorithms for the sake of covering my CS basics. I settled on systems because, once I knew I was doing a master’s project, it let me graduate a little earlier.  

# Courses

## Fall 2021
**Artificial Intelligence (A):** This was a great survey of the field with well-defined projects and clear expectations. It took a lot of work on my part (20 hours per week on average), in part because it was my first exposure to a lot of the material, but it was ultimately manageable.  


**Network Science (A):** I love this class (I came back to TA for it), but it's a weird one. I think your math background is the main determining factor in how difficult this class is for you. I spent a lot of my TA office hours reviewing hypothesis testing, the different properties of distributions, and eigenvalues. Students should take the ""suggested background knowledge"" for this class seriously. The course page lists ""calculus, probability, linear algebra, and programming"", but I would add statistics as well. At the very least, read some blogs on t-tests and make sure you understand p-values if you never took a stats course.

## Spring 2022
**Grad Intro to Operating Systems (B):** As someone without a CS background, this was BRUTAL. I spent winter break working through K&R's ""The C Programming Language"" and Beej's Guide to Networking, but I really needed more prep time. I easily spent 30 hours a week on this class at times, just wrapping my head around C and the project requirements. I learned a ton though. Highly recommend for anyone who is coming from a non-CS background.


**Machine Learning (B):** I took the class with Dr. Isbell, so my experience is maybe less relevant now. The lectures do a good job developing intuition and the textbook gives you the rigor. The assignments were a bit of a nightmare for me, but by the end I had grip on how to think about applying ML models to real problems. I like the emphasis on data over models and that framework has served me well in my internships and research. 

I would NOT recommend pairing these classes. I knew it would be rough going in and I'm glad I got my toughest semester out of the way early, but this was a bad time.

## Summer 2022
**Applied ML research internship:** I got to do some cool applied NLP work before ChatGPT blew the whole field up, and I got to work at the intersection of where I used to be and where I was hoping to go. 

## Fall 2022
**High-Performance Computing Architecture (B):** Another must-take for those of us transitioning from non-CS backgrounds. Between GIOS and HPCA, I got a solid understanding of how computers actually work and got much more comfortable with C and C++. I found the projects much more manageable in this class and missed an A by just a fraction of a point. By this time, I started to realize I was interested in distributed computing as well as ML.


**Master's Project (A):** I spent this semester getting familiar with the codebase and writing documentation. Not exciting, but it was a good onboarding process. At the end of the semester, the new students all pitched project ideas. 

## Spring 2023
**High-Performance Computing (A):** Oh, how I loved this class. This is where I fully realized that algorithms are absolutely my jam. The parallel and distributed algorithms are maybe a little more mind-bending than what you learn in GA, but ultimately this class was kind of...easy? At least relative to my previous experiences. Part of it was that I'd already been thinking about parallelism and distributed computing in GIOS and HPCA, and part of it was that I was finally comfortable with C and C++. This was the first class where I felt fully and completely prepared and didn't have to do any self-teaching on the side to fill in gaps in my knowledge. It's not an *easy* class by any stretch, but it's very well-organized and no more difficult than it has to be.


**Master's Project (A):** The project I worked on at DILab relied heavily on NLP, and this is the semester when ChatGPT blew everything up. All plans went out the window and my project proposal was no longer relevant. Most of the team pivoted to incorporating this new technology while I focused on performance analysis. It was a little frustrating, but exciting at the same time. 


**Network Science TA:** This was my first semester as a TA! If you have the opportunity to do this for a class that interests you, do it. There is no better way to firm up your understanding of a concept than helping someone else understand it. This class leaves room for discussions about the big picture, too, which is a lot of fun as a TA. 

## Summer 2023
**SWE Internship:** I got lucky and was placed on a team doing distributed ML. I spent the summer building a prototype of a classification system that could scale up to huge training sets. This is exactly the kind of work I want to do in industry. This was also my first SWE experience and I loved it. Most importantly, I got a return offer!


**Master's Project (A):** I ran a preliminary study over the summer and “finished” my master’s project by submitting a plan for a Fall 2023 randomized controlled trial to measure the effect of the lab’s AI agents on student experiences in the classroom. Data collection just wrapped up this week, so I’ll be able to do the analysis and write up the paper soon. 


I didn’t think I could manage TAing on top of everything else, so I skipped this semester. This was a smart move, I definitely would not have had the bandwidth. 

## Fall 2023
**Graduate Algorithms (A):** Honestly, I wish there were more classes like this in the program. the material is challenging but I like the format a lot (lecture, problem set, rinse and repeat). It felt familiar (like an undergrad math class) and predictable, which let me focus on the material. 


**Software Development Process (A):** It’s not the most exciting class I took in OMSCS, but the lectures and projects are well-designed and, as someone who hasn’t worked as a SWE full-time yet, it was probably worth it for me. I got lucky on the group project and got placed on an awesome team. I mainly took this because I needed another core class to wrap up my systems specialization and I wasn’t going to pair GA with AOS. 


**Network Science TA:** Since my first semester as a TA, the class has been added to the ML specialization and was opened up to OMSA. That boosted enrollment a good bit and made the experience a little more stressful. Overall still a good time and I’m really glad I had this experience.",active,33

This blog post will cover on whether or not WriteHuman, an Undetectable  AI tool, can bypass popular AI detectors such as GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn. WriteHuman claims to be the world's most powerful AI humanizer tool. A big statement to say the least but we will test it out to see if what they claim is true.  Finally, we will compare WriteHuman against StealthGPT to see which undetectable ai website reigns supreme.  Here's what we will cover:What Are Undetectable AI Websites?What is WriteHuman?What is StealthGPT?Test PreparationWriteHuman Against GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItInStealthGPT Against GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItInFinal Thoughts 

## What Are Undetectable AI Websites?

Undetectable AI websites are platforms that use advanced artificial intelligence algorithms to create content—such as essays, articles, or reports—that is indistinguishable from human-generated material. They utilize sophisticated natural language processing and machine learning techniques to mimic human writing styles. This makes the content produced by these AI tools difficult to detect by algorithms designed to identify AI-generated text. These websites are particularly useful in scenarios where the authenticity and human touch in writing are essential, such as in academic settings, creative writing, or digital marketing. 

## What is WriteHuman?

WriteHuman is an advanced tool described as a powerful AI detection remover. It is designed to work seamlessly with plagiarism detection systems like Turnitin and ZeroGPT, among others. The primary function of WriteHuman is to help users maintain their online privacy and anonymity by supercharging their text to eliminate AI tracking and bypass AI detection. This feature makes it a valuable tool for those looking to create content that appears authentically human-written, avoiding detection by AI algorithms used in various online platforms and services​​.

## What is StealthGPT?

StealthGPT is an advanced artificial intelligence tool designed to generate written content that is undetectable by AI detection systems. It uses sophisticated algorithms and natural language processing techniques to produce text that closely mimics human writing styles. The primary aim of StealthGPT is to create content that bypasses the detection mechanisms of systems like Turnitin, which are designed to identify AI-generated text. This makes StealthGPT particularly useful in scenarios where the authenticity of human-like writing is crucial, such as in academic writing, creative content creation, and other professional fields where originality and the human touch in writing are valued. The tool is part of a growing trend of AI applications that blend seamlessly into human-centric environments, offering solutions that are both innovative and indistinguishable from human-created work.

## Test Preparation

We will use ChatGPT for our experiment. Let's take the content written by ChatGPT and place them to WriteHuman as well as StealthGPT. We will then take the content produced by WriteHuman and StealthGPT and place them against well known AI detectors.  Popular AI detectors such as GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn will be used for this experiment. We will provide images showcasing how StealthGPT compares against WriteHuman.  Finally, we will make a conclusion based on the experiment to see if whether or not WriteHuman actually works.

# Final Thoughts

In conclusion, it turns out that WriteHuman doesn't really work against major AI detectors such as GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn. Especially against GPTZero which saw over 91% AI written content. While WriteHuman achieved over 93% AI written on Originality, it's a large margin of AI detection which can be detrimental for students or professionals who want to avoid AI detection on their work. TurnItIn was no better at over 100% AI detection which proves that WriteHuman is not the best AI humanizer tools out there.

Comparatively, StealthGPT goes beyond expectations and achieved over 0% on TurnItIn and Originality with a slight 15% AI detection from GPTZero. It's clear that StealthGPT reigns supreme as the best AI humanizer platform out there currently.  

## StealthGPT: Write AI text, Get Human Results

[StealthGPT](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/) is currently the best Undetectable AI website out there, beating even TurnItIn. Check it out in here. If you are a highschool or college student looking for the best AI humanizer tool in the market then look no further. StealthGPT consistently beats GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn. It's simple, easy to use, and give you the assurance you need to make sure you stay undetected. StealthGPT is able to beat most AI detectors due to the way it was built from the ground up. We cannot speak to how WriteHuman was built but we are aware most AI tools are built with very simple prompts from OpenAI's GPT models. Unlike most AI tools out there, StealthGPT was built and trained on hundreds of hours of human styled writings that make it uniquely different from any other AI writing tool on the market. That is how StealthGPT is and continues to remain the best Undetectable AI on the market.

I'm not the best in my field, but I'm not the worst either. I told myself that by working hard, I could consider doing more and more web development and why not even fullstack later.  
  
However, I worry about the future of my job. I don't fear ""the big replacement"", but I realize that my work will be greatly devalued while in France, developers are already underpaid. It will be more and more difficult to get paid and a senior developer will be able to do the work of 3 junior developers with AI. This is even more so in the field of geomatics, where salary increases are only considered from the moment we touch on web or backend development.  
  
Many in my class would deny it, but I see it in the field: a lot of students in my class answer the exercises using only ChatGPT, and it's only a matter of time before companies say ""let's hire someone 'a less expensive and less qualified person who will be able to do the same work at bachelor's level rather than master's level'. Personally, I am impressed by this tool and have already completed projects using only ChatGPT.  
  
It made me very depressed a month ago. I realize that I may have made the wrong career choice. I worry about my financial situation and my financial future in general and I give a lot of importance to my pay.  
  
The field of geomatics is even more doomed to die when we see that ChatGPT can be integrated into QGIS or ArcGIS.  
  
Should I consider retraining in AI? I can't afford to redo my studies because I'm in France and I have to start contributing to my retirement. But I would like to train alone with personal projects. I came across this github which has some very good resources for learning AI: https://github.com/duncantmiller/ai-developer-resources. I have already done classification with Random Forest and SVM, as well as Python scripts in Natural Language Processing.  
  
I am in France. We are a little behind in the world of AI, but I have no doubt that it will end up developing more and more in a few years, and that jobs in the field will be more and more in demand.",User_deleted,0

The college library gives me access to some learning resources for free and at discounted prices. 

At first, my goal is to get an entry level job at help desk. 

The resources I have includes LinkedIn Learning and O'Reilly.  Along with this, LinkedIn Learning gives me 50% off on taking technical exams from famous companies like IBM.

Currently, I am preparing for AZ900 from Microsoft Learn. I keep chatGPT as my study guide for general questions/doubts I get while reading. It has helped me a lot. Other than that, I follow the [AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals Exam Quick Prep](https://learning.oreilly.com/course/az-900-microsoft-azure/9781800206175/) by Vijay Saini on O'Reilly. 

**Are these sources reliable (in terms of learning skills quality) and in demand?**

As soon as I get the above-mentioned cert, I will try to implement that learning through self projects.

>\[Actually I would have left my recent degree and got into CS, but due to certain reasons I can't. My ultimate goal is of Data Analytics and I am working towards the first step, i.e., building strong foundations.\]

I was exposed to Data Science a few 2-3 years ago. I liked the idea of Data Analytics; how systemic it works and my work would actually make sense and have purpose.   
At that time, I did not have any resource. Now, I have both time and resources. 

I have observed this a lot, many people are hoarding in CS field just for the sake of making money. Having genuine interest and dedication is also necessary I think.

i am not going to lie, i have used it on every assignment so far this year. i am a profound, professional procrastinator… and if i can finish an assignment that would take me hours to do, and just have it finished in less than two minutes… i will.

i understand that you guys can EASILY scan it through a detector, but here is two problems.

1. detectors tend to be inaccurate, i ran an assignment where i have not type a single letter, and it did not detect any form of AI.
2. even if it does get detected, you can filter it through a paraphrasing site to make it undetectable.

now, if they were caught, how would you go about the situation? i mean, it isn’t plagiarism, really. even ChatGPT itself mentioned that using it’s generated text is not plagiarism and is fair, free use. so to fail the assignment would be a little counterintuitive. as you also cannot prove it was ran through AI as it generates a different, original text every time.

now, getting to the ethical side of this, how big of a problem does this seem to you in the world of education? in my opinion, to pass grade 11 english, not that big of a deal. but if you are in university becoming a doctor, this can turn out very bad, as let’s say.. you become a surgeon. you only achieved your degree via AI and you learned nothing, putting others life at risk.

if you were a student in todays age, would you use it?

edit: it appears i have started a war by this, which you guys have completely ignored my question. so i’ll ask again… if you were a student in todays age, would you use it?

you guys also seemed to ignore the ways i’ve mentioned the work-arounds, instead made baseless accusations of me. oh well, ignorance is bliss.",active,0

Is the main promise of these prompts that it just write more professionally? 

If so, I can totally see why I'm so unimpressed. Maybe I just had wrong impression on what these engineered prompts could do. But can new or better/more correct information be extracted with an engineered prompt?

My, and probably a lot of others', biggest gripe is that there's no way to know whether the information is accurate or not. Unless this prompt engineering helps with that.. to me it's just putting lipstick on a pig (so to speak, chatGPT is far from a ""pig"", but the notion of improving it with prompting definitely seems overhyped).

Many posts are appearing from professors who are either worried about students using generative AI tools like ChatGPT on assignments or who are reporting students for academic integrity violations when they use such tools. I'd like to find out what people actually know about generative AI, what they know about how it works, what they think about whether it has any acceptable uses in the classroom (or not), and why.

I've found these resources to be interesting starting points:

18o6w02,8,2023-12-21,Passed Sec+ in 2 Weeks,u/OfficialAbsoluteUnit,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/18o6w02/passed_sec_in_2_weeks/,"I passed the security+ on my first attempt without reading the book. I'm a straight to the point kind of person so you're going to have to bash the info out of me if you have other questions since I sometimes lack creativity but here's my experience:

My History:
- Degrees in cyber and digital forensics.
- I did not go to a fancy school but found myself 1 of extremely few very proactive students and never had a mentor that knew what he was talking about cyber wise.
- Went to multiple CTF competitions in college.
- I took OffSec's OSCP course, certified in the WiFi hacking, and took ECCs CEH course & Web app attacks course (all during college so I never focused on testing).
- Job searched shortly but went into family business (non cyber related) for 5 years (COVID prolonged) so I have no ""working experience"". I thought refreshing my knowledge may help now that I'm restarting my job search.

What I Did:
1. Bought the Mike Myers Udemy.
2. Bought Jason Dion's 6 test exam question banks on Udemy.
3. I got the study book but sometimes I found myself rereading the same lines and wasting time. So after 2 chapters I quit reading and fully focused on the course. Played it at 1.25-1.5, and rarely, x1.75.
4. Test exams: I would do test 1 on day 1. Test 1 and 2 day 2, test 2 and 3 on day 3, etc.. I ALWAYS got ~75 in the test questions the first round and found myself constantly 2nd guessing myself. I would sometimes review my wrong answers and retest the failed test the same day. 2nd rounds I always got 80-100. By the time I got to test 6 I would restart test 1 on the same day since my memory of the correct answers would fade and represent ""better accuracy of performance"". As I got closer to when I wanted to test I ramped up how many tests I would perform but lowered the frequency the day before to keep my mind fresh. The day before, the only information I couldn't retain I reviewed the Udemy Mike Myers videos and asked ChatGPT to explain to me how to reason why a particular answer was correct or to define things I just couldn't grasp from Google or the Udemy videos.
5. As I failed or had difficulty with questions I would make notes and throw them onto an Excel sheet i.e. every question to do with unknown services or ports #s, encryption types, and had someone test me on them on a daily basis. <- this did not help me in the exam AT ALL (YMMV) but each day I added 1-3 more ports or encryptions/hashes with the sizes. It obviously helped me memorize them as each day I would be retested on the ones from before + the new ones.

Exam:
I ran out of time reviewing all my marked answers and  I had a lot of them. I did correct a few 2nd guessed questions and passed ~780. When others say skip the performance questions DO IT. I wasted time and rushed back to do them before reviewing my marked answers. I've seen some people ask about memorization and the test has nothing to do with that junk (in my experience). HOWEVER, based off my time in competitions I can vaguely remember the ports for SSH, Telnet, FTP, DBs, what they do, etc..

Although the practice tests represented the difficulty of the exam I found they were very much not so relevant in terms of material per se; again YMMV.

So, what would I recommend? Ive never done practice PBQs that I've heard some people discuss here and I did fine so, I can't say they'll be relevant as I've not consumed that content. But, you may want to do them anyway, along with Udemy Mike and JD test questions. YOU WILL NOT FEEL READY. For me, failing every test bank the first time didn't instill much confidence. You can only do test questions so much before you're answering off memory. Just take the test.

I listed my experience not to pupu on others but to illustrate you may need more or less time studying based off similar experience. I have crap memory, learn by doing, and even though it's been 5 years with fried COVID brain I did fine. If you don't have experience maybe take longer, and read the book too. 

Post Feelings:
If you got this far you read enough of my ramblings so I'll just summarize my feelings quickly. Despite being extremely happy that I passed and now have relief to move on to other projects to renew my resume, I feel like a wasted a bunch of time and money. That's just me, and sometimes you need the cert to buy credibility anyway, which is why I did it.

I mostly want to do research which perplexity is an expert in, since Ive heard that GPT with the browser plugin sucks. Will be doing a lot of research for school.  However, I would also like to learn math, and also have something proofread my works, does perplexity pro also excel in that? I also like how perplexity has both claude and gpt, I use both extensively, claude for writing and gpt for more instructional based prompts. 

Would also like to say that Im part of the student council, and claude has been a massive help for me in writing up project proposals, can perplexity pro do that as well? Or is it really more research focused.

Was wondering if which premium model I should invest in as a student? Help is very much appreciated!!",User_deleted,11
18pfnnp,3,2023-12-23,"What are your thoughts on using AI detection (e.g., Turnitin) in academia?",u/GenomeWeaver,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/18pfnnp/what_are_your_thoughts_on_using_ai_detection_eg/,"I am curious to know about everyone's thoughts on AI detection tools being used in academia. Turnitin especially seems to give false positives and cause a lot of problems for completely innocent students lately, and several universities have stopped using Turnitin's AI detection feature.

I attempted to compile the abstracts or introduction sections of approximately two dozen random PubMed papers into a single document and submitted it to Turnitin to assess for false positives. I was initially surprised to observe over 90% AI detection, with most paragraphs being flagged entirely as AI. The majority of these papers were written before any language AI models were developed. The results were pretty much the same with other popular AI detection tools such as originality.ai, gptzero.me, copyleaks.com, or zerogpt.com.

But this started to make sense when I recalled that language AI models are trained using precise and high-quality human written text. These articles are the foundation of what they use to train the language models. Therefore, AI detection algorithms may very well detect accurate and precise human written text, especially when it is error-free and the sentences are well-structured. I later even found articles claiming that AI detectors ""don't work.""

The problem seems to exponentially increase as the precision and accuracy of the text increases. Try submitting the abstract sections of random papers to the tools I mentioned, or try writing some precise paragraphs conveying scientific information. As a molecular biologist, I get generally more than 80% detection when I do this. This, in my opinion, is quite concerning.

Therefore, I have negative thoughts on this issue. I would want to know what everyone thinks and whether my thoughts are valid. It leaves me in a great dilemma when my students have a high AI percentage in their reports and assignments, which is usually the case. I do not want to be unfair in any way, either by falsely accusing them of plagiarism or by ignoring instances of plagiarism. It might not be considered plagiarism if acknowledgment and citations are provided, but students cannot do that since we restrict the usage of AI.

If you ask me for a solution, I have none. Thus, I am in need of help. What could be done about this issue? I am open to innovative ways, but I believe that students should write their essays/reports themselves so that they can learn.

The challenge is choosing the appropriate and most fitting specialization to continue my career.

Notes:

+ I tried to make it as structured and organized as I can, I hope It's clear and not so messed up.
+ I'm not a native English speaker so excuse the mistakes.
+ If you can't help, please leave an upvote for better reach.

### Background

A little background about myself, I was born and raised in Algeria, a relatively poor country in the north of Africa, I was my entire life a grade A student who thrived academically, and with minor efforts, but not for once was there a subject or even a talk for proper career orientation or college major choice during my 12 years through primary school, middle school, and high school. We were expected to figure it out on our own, by the time we get to our last year in high school and before passing our BAC exam. Most students were either forced by their parents into a college major, chose one randomly, or took another person's experience as a reference that is always true. The average on that BAC exam is what decided The choices you're offered and the priority you're given to get into one of the majors you chose. For top notch students like me it was always between medical school or engineering in one of the prestigious institues of the country. Anyway, when I got to my high school graduation year and before passing my BAC exam I started conducting some research and I finally decided to et into Computer Science as my college major, and I'm glad I did. I joined one of those prestigious institues I mentioned earlier (Higher School of Computer Science), and in my first few weeks I faced two main problems:
1. Academic difficulty gap between high school and college, so suddenly it required much more effort to be one of the best student in my batch.
2. Noticing the talent gap between me and other extremely skilled students who seemed to have started playing around with computers and code editors since the age of 10.
These two problems led to a lot of stress, feeling of being late in my career advancement, fear of missing out on things, and a lot of self doubt, which I now know was all unnecessary and ridiculous. I also started being biased by those extremely talented people, in other words, if that person was good at something, and was good at making it seem cool, I would think to myself that hell yeah, this is what I'm doing with my life, which was where I fucked up the most.

I eventually started experimenting with some specializations like web development, cyber security (mostly by playing CTF competitions), and graphic design.

The self doubt and bias I encountered were some of the reasons I kept jumping from one thing to another, without actually getting a deep view into any of those fields, just to satisfy my need to be as good as other students. This led to two things:
1. Wasting my first two college years in jumping from one thing to another, without actually fully experimenting and getting a deep understanding of the field and building real projects in any of those things.
2. Delaying the talk of what I ACTUALLY want to do with my life, so there was never an unbiased opinion in my head of what specialization I want to get into.

Now I moved to France, and I'm actually redoing my 2nd year in college in one of the french universities (which is something you have to do, you can't continue to 3rd year directly), and I'm still facing the same struggle. Fortunately it's in a much less severe way, I overcame the feeling of having to be as good as everyone else in my batch, and I'm also conducting a lot of research, asking a lot of people, about the potential career paths that might be good for me.

### Things I believe to Be True

1. In order to stand out in the job market and be one of the best people in what I do, I have to start learning, practicing, and building projects from now.
2. I'm pretty damn late regarding the first point, given that I haven't started building a profile and a name yet.
3. Most of my time should be dedicated to learning things about that one particular specialization, because it will give better results in the end. Which leads to me thinking that I should have as little hobbies as I can.
4. Sometimes, even when you do everything the right way, you still don't get to where you want, which is quite scary.

### Important Things to Know About Me

I believe myself to be smart, creative, innovative, and a very fast learner (sorry if this sounds like I'm bragging or something because I'm really not). I like to be recognized and appreciated for the good things I do. I am quite biased when it comes to this particular struggle (choosing a career) by my close friends and the people I love. I have a huge fear of missing out on things, for example in this case, I tell myself what if I choose this path but in reality the other path was more fitting for you?

I am a bit of a perfectionist person (which is why I'm struggling anyway). I want to find the absolute perfect thing for me to do, which I know is impossible but also fail to believe.

I want in the future to lead my own projects and startups.

I like to manage and lead people. The ideal thing that I see myself doing in the future is leading a group of creatives and developers to solve everyday problems, using my creative and technical skills.

I have a small experience in brand identity and visual identity design, I have been doing it intermittently in the past two years and had some clients. For someone who hasn't dedicated so much time to doing it I'm somehow good at it, and I really like it. I don't consider design a career path but more of a side hustle, and definitely a skill that will help me in the future, when it comes to building brands or launching startups. It can also be my creative gateway when things get too technical in my everyday life, or some tool I use to express my ideas.

I studied some web development concepts and built small projects over the past two years, so far I have dealt with HTML, CSS, JS, Tailwind, React.

I played some CTF competitions (3 or 4) and done good in most of them.

I want to start making money through freelancing or part time jobs in the next 1-2 years.

### Main Point

After doing some research on the things I have discovered so far, I found myself leaning to one of the following career paths: full-stack Web Development, and Cyber Security engineering or Pentesting. I will in the following sections discuss what I like and don't like about each of those career paths.

I was introduced to web development before joining college with a month or so, I was moving slowly but steadily in one of the online courses I found (freecodecamp). I liked it, but soon after I started focusing less on the course. In the months that follow it was an on again off again type of thing. I made some small projects in my first two years in college, and I really enjoyed it. Web development is much more available for freelance opportunities than most other CS fields, and companies also hire remote workers frequently, which is an advantage in my opinion. Skills acquired in web dev are applicable in many other software engineering fields, or even entrepreneurship. I can create a website for any idea that I get, making it a very creative field which suits me pretty well. Simply my heart leans to web dev than any other field. BUT, I still have some problems with it. Lately I have noticed that a lot of people have been getting into web development and not so many positions are open, which increases competition and make it harder to get an entry level role. The rise of AI and drag-and-drop website builders may impact heavily the need for big web development teams in the future, I'm not saying all web developers will be replaced by chatgpt, but the number of devs required per company will drop. It's not as exciting as cyber security roles (offensive side), and not as mentally challenging, meaning not everyday is an opportunity to learn new things. Not something I see myself doing for the next 10 years, at some point I would like to either switch careers, to something like AI or cyber security maybe, or move to a management position. Doesn't offer opportunities for academic research.

For cyber security I was introduced to it by one of those highly skilled people I met during my first year in college, ironically I discovered later that the guy was just trying his best to look talented while in fact he really wasn't. Anyway, I started by solving chalenges in platforms like PicoCTF, and participating in online CTF challenges, which I loved. CTF competitions made me realize that the person in me that likes to solve puzzles after being mentally challenged  and after doing a lot of research and learning so many things was really drawn to cyber security. Maybe that was a mistake, since most cyber security roles aren't really similar to CTF challenges (maybe only the offensive roles but still not as similar and exciting). Another thing that I like about cyber security is that it's really technical and mentally challenging, and it presents new things to learn everyday. There's a big skill shortage in the job market, and not enough talented people to fill in those gaps, so with enough effort put over some time, it will be easy to land a high paying job. It will acquire me skills that are really cool and allow me to do great things, but can't be used in other fields. Moving on to what I don't like about cyber security. Fist thing is that there's little to no coding, I've seen many videos on YouTube for cyber security analysts that insist on the fact that they're not coders, and I particularly don't like that because coding is one of the things I enjoy the most about CS. Networking is big a part of cyber security and unfortunately I find it really boring and not enjoyable. It's more of an IT subfield than it is a CS subfield, which I don't like as well. Less opportunities for remote work and freelancing than web dev. If I specialize in cyber security I would like to be a Pentester, which is not really available for entry level jobs, unlike roles like Cyber Analyst. The biggest advantage I'm seeing for cyber security is how unsatisfied the job market is and how much talented people are needed, so given I put enough time and effort in it I will land a high paying job in a short time.

### What Do I Want to Know?
+ Am I being too hard on myself? and making this problem bigger than it should be?
+ How real are the things I mentioned about both web dev and cyber security?
+ How real are the things I stated in the ""Things I believe to be true"" part?
+ I've seen a lot of Linkedin profiles for people with cyber security roles who started their journey by being web developers, is that a common thing?
+ What do you believe is the most fitting specialization for me?
+ What are your insights and advice on this topic?
+ Can I combine the two and still be really good at both of them?
+ Is it a good idea to specialize in web dev and keep CTF competitions as a hobby?
+ Should I still discover more CS fields before I make my choice?
+ If anyone has had the same struggle before, I hope you can share how you overcame it.

In the end, and if you got to this point of the post, I would like to thank you deeply for taking the time. Have a good day!",User_deleted,1

Struggling with medium-level problems and applying concepts like DFS, they worry about their competitiveness in the job market.

I am just now a senior doing online school with SNHU. I am a first gen college student and my parents recently started a pizzeria which I help out at (5yrs experience from mid/high school days). Over the last 5 months that we've been open I've been working \~60hrs a week and have completed 2 regular semesters worth of school work on an over loaded schedule (3 full courses over 2 months at a time). I have regular downtime which I do homework/side projects/leetcode but I feel like I'm falling behind in leetcode and even general programming skill now. I struggle with mediums and while I know DS&A, applying the concepts like DFS to misc problems is difficult and it takes me a long time to make the connection on how to use it.

I graduate in August with 1 internship under my belt (no name 1-10 member company) and feel like I'm not going to be able to get a job at all. I see people with FAANG experience, companies freezing entry/new grad hires, leetcoders with 200+ problems and t50 schools...like there is no way I can compete with that. Even I would toss my resume away if I saw some of the candidates I've seen on here struggling to get work. Which makes sense because I religiously receive rejections.

How do I know if I am falling behind and not a viable candidate, it feels like I am not going to be considered for any roles. I've been applying since June 23' and have spent hours revising my resume using other peoples resumes and the r/EngineeringResumes wiki. All I want is a SWE role with a min $65k salary and decent WLB. I want to work hard and get there and could use some guidance on where to focus my efforts.

18schr2,3,2023-12-27,Two Problems in the American High School System I've Notices After My 3rd Semester,u/yoshi8869,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/18schr2/two_problems_in_the_american_high_school_system/,"Hi. I'm new to the community, but I recently got into a back-and-forth on a YouTube channel with a very conservative guy. I'm rather left-wing on all issues, but he and I reached a unique accord, so I wanted to open it up to others and find a forum where I could expand the topic to a larger audience. I hope this is the right place for it. Feel free to share your own experiences or thoughts!

The topic was largely over assessments (grades) and a lack of structure in the high school system, though originally it was just a blanket statement of ""what's wrong with our public schools"".

ACADEMIC PROBLEMS:

So, when I first started teaching, I had my kids (11th grade U.S. history) write essays. Every essay was the same: Provide the causes and effects of a particular event and then explain, in your own words, why we consider this event to be ""significant"". The only thing that changed every unit was the event. I even gave them a list of 3 events every unit to CHOOSE from.  
  
What I got back was extraordinarily subpar. Some students really did excel, but it was maybe 2-3 total across all 90 kids in all 3 of my U.S. History periods. I scaled it down to just ""short answers"". I also forbade anyone from writing these essays online--good thing I did, because ChatGPT made that even worse today. They write everything by hand in my class now during exam day without ANY devices. I still feel like I'm short-changing them, but the fault lies at the elementary English level. Too much of early education, I feel, is about ""coddling"" the child to success instead of challenging them to get there.  
  
I'd nearly lost faith in the system, and I nearly quit my job after my first semester. The bright side of the story is that I also teach Honors-level World History. Two kids in particular went above and beyond in that class and restored my faith in my career path. I credit both of those kids with single-handedly preventing the utter weight of the broken education system from collapsing down on me. Because of them, I kept the essay writing in my World History classes, and I still use it now. While my best class (with those two kids) is long in the past now, I still see around 30-40% of my kids do quite well on the essays each unit. In fact, the essay structure/prompt is identical to what I used to do in my U.S. History.  
  
I was also fortunate that those two kids liked me as much as they did, because their friends told their other friends and so on it expanded that I was a ""popular"" teacher in the building by the end of my first year. The administration, I believe, sees me as an asset now. Students often choose to be in my class. I don't say this to gloat, but to point out that I can now get away with a LOT more--in a good way. My philosophy on education is now: I am going to push these kids to succeed, but if they don't put in the work, they will fail. If parents or admin want to chew me out for it, I can find a job elsewhere. I have leverage now.

However, my kids can still choose skip the final exam if they have a C- or higher at the end of the semester and have missed not more than 3 classes in the semester (required by the school board), which is such grade A bullshit, I tried to take it up with the school board, but the vice principal told me I have no case, so I chose to back down.  
  
While I'm extremely proud of my work, I know I'm just a drop in the bucket. The real existential problems lie at the foundation. Elementary education needs to be stricter in how it approves or denies people for that line of work. Too many ""babysitters"" and not enough ""teachers"" are educating our youngest children. They're just learning to be ""polite"" and not how to ""read and write"". Especially with the lack of education during the COVID gap, it's only going to be worse for us secondary educators to teach Gen A.

STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS:  
  
I also believe my high school (and maybe others) struggles from a lack of structure and discipline. Students are allowed to just not show up to classes in certain circumstances and leave campus entirely in the middle of the day (called ""flex"" periods). My best and brightest kids are still teenagers at the end of the day, and I know one of my former students chose to leave campus and shoot an old musket at his friends during his 4th period this year.

He often gets up to no good when left alone, which I knew well while teaching him (a 4.0 student, mind you). He suffers from lack of structure, and while he can be as chaotic as he wants after school hours (though I go the extra mile to dissuade him when he tells me about it), while we're responsible for him, we shouldn't be allowing him to go do things that'll get him arrested during school hours. The lack of structure just encourages him to do whatever he wants, which is the exact OPPOSITE dynamic I tried to provide him while he was in my class. I gave him structure, discipline, and strict expectations, and he relished in it. It was like he was seeking out the structure. His behavior improved and he matured, but now I see him regressing due to an abundance of teachers that don't teach him and let him not come to class and buzz off to the forest and do God-knows-what.

POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS TO BOTH:

What I propose to be done is to increase regulation across the board.  
  
Master's degrees used to be required--they still should be. Districts should also receive more money in the form of categorical grants that are to be put to specific purposes. Money also should NOT be withheld or reduced toward districts that are struggling more. That only reduces the chances for those children to succeed. I work in a VERY poor, rural district in the middle of nowhere: about 40% of the student population falls below the poverty line. They need school for structure and even basic necessities like food (which should be free).  
  
Students also need discipline and structure, especially in adolescence. I think requirements should be laid down MUCH more strictly than they are. Students shouldn't be allowed to leave the building at all during the school day, unless it is a unique circumstance preapproved by the teacher and parents/guardians. Students should also be LEARNING while they're in the building, and not relegated to glorified study halls or busy-work electives (which is another rant for another day).  
  
And finally, as an alum of a private, Catholic school, I do believe our public school system needs a full overall. I may even suggest following more of an Eastern structure: one homeroom all 4 years of high school and teachers remain tied to a homeroom the entire time, as in 1 social studies teacher for a select few homerooms that teaches the kids the whole 4 years. And we should do away with busy work and petty grades. I'd have exams and essay writing take up ALL of my grades, if I could. Summative assessments should be the ONLY assessments. Formative assessments can be given to check progress, but not entered as grades in the book.   
  
Feel free to disagree. I'd love to hear some other opinions. Admittedly, I have a LOT to say about this stuff and often don't have a place to write about it. Cheers!",User_deleted,3

While my best class (with those two kids) is long in the past now, I still see around 30-40% of my kids do quite well on the essays each unit. In fact, the essay structure/prompt is identical to what I used to do in my U.S. History.

I was also fortunate that those two kids liked me as much as they did, because their friends told their other friends and so on it expanded that I was a ""popular"" teacher in the building by the end of my first year. The administration, I believe, sees me as an asset now. Students often choose to be in my class. I don't say this to gloat, but to point out that I can now get away with a LOT more--in a good way. My philosophy on education is now: I am going to push these kids to succeed, but if they don't put in the work, they will fail. If parents or admin want to chew me out for it, I can find a job elsewhere. I have leverage now.

However, my kids can still choose skip the final exam if they have a C- or higher at the end of the semester and have missed not more than 3 classes in the semester (required by the school board), which is such grade A bullshit, I tried to take it up with the school board, but the vice principal told me I have no case, so I chose to back down.

While I'm extremely proud of my work, I know I'm just a drop in the bucket. The real existential problems lie at the foundation. Elementary education needs to be stricter in how it approves or denies people for that line of work. Too many ""babysitters"" and not enough ""teachers"" are educating our youngest children. They're just learning to be ""polite"" and not how to ""read and write"". Especially with the lack of education during the COVID gap, it's only going to be worse for us secondary educators to teach Gen A.

STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS:

I also believe my high school (and maybe others) struggles from a lack of structure and discipline. Students are allowed to just not show up to classes in certain circumstances and leave campus entirely in the middle of the day (called ""flex"" periods). My best and brightest kids are still teenagers at the end of the day, and I know one of my former students chose to leave campus and shoot an old musket at his friends during his 4th period this year.

He often gets up to no good when left alone, which I knew well while teaching him (a 4.0 student, mind you). He suffers from lack of structure, and while he can be as chaotic as he wants after school hours (though I go the extra mile to dissuade him when he tells me about it), while we're responsible for him, we shouldn't be allowing him to go do things that'll get him arrested during school hours. The lack of structure just encourages him to do whatever he wants, which is the exact OPPOSITE dynamic I tried to provide him while he was in my class. I gave him structure, discipline, and strict expectations, and he relished in it. It was like he was seeking out the structure. His behavior improved and he matured, but now I see him regressing due to an abundance of teachers that don't teach him and let him not come to class and buzz off to the forest and do God-knows-what.

POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS TO BOTH:

What I propose to be done is to increase regulation across the board.

Master's degrees used to be required--they still should be. Districts should also receive more money in the form of categorical grants that are to be put to specific purposes. Money also should NOT be withheld or reduced toward districts that are struggling more. That only reduces the chances for those children to succeed. I work in a VERY poor, rural district in the middle of nowhere: about 40% of the student population falls below the poverty line. They need school for structure and even basic necessities like food (which should be free).

Students also need discipline and structure, especially in adolescence. I think requirements should be laid down MUCH more strictly than they are. Students shouldn't be allowed to leave the building at all during the school day, unless it is a unique circumstance preapproved by the teacher and parents/guardians. Students should also be LEARNING while they're in the building, and not relegated to glorified study halls or busy-work electives (which is another rant for another day).

And finally, as an alum of a private, Catholic school, I do believe our public school system needs a full overall. I may even suggest following more of an Eastern structure: one homeroom all 4 years of high school and teachers remain tied to a homeroom the entire time, as in 1 social studies teacher for a select few homerooms that teaches the kids the whole 4 years. And we should do away with busy work and petty grades. I'd have exams and essay writing take up ALL of my grades, if I could. Summative assessments should be the ONLY assessments. Formative assessments can be given to check progress, but not entered as grades in the book.

Feel free to disagree. I'd love to hear some other opinions. Admittedly, I have a LOT to say about this stuff and often don't have a place to write about it. Cheers!",User_deleted,2

I'm a 6th year HS Soc. St. Teacher. ChatGPT is here to stay, and the AI is only going to get better. There is no way the old/current model of education (MS, HS, College) can continue. If it is not in-class, the days of ""read this and write..."" are in their twilight. 

I am in a private school, so I have the freedom to do this. But, I have focused more on graded discussions and graded debates. Using AI and having the students annotate the responses and write ""in class"" using the annotations, and more. AI is here to stay, the us, the educators, and the whole educational  model are going to have to change (which will probably never happen)

Plus, the AI detection tools are fucked. Real papers come back as AI and just putting grammatical errors into your AI work comes back original. Students can put the og AI work into a rewriter tool. Having the AI write in a lower grade level. Or if they're worried about the Google doc drafts, just type the AI work word-for-word into the doc (a little bit longer, I know). With our current way, when we get ""better"" at finding ways to catch it, the students will also get better at finding ways to get around it. AI is here to stay. We are going to have to change.",active,824

Leading up to him destroying piggy once and for all. Then continuing with the lesson 

ChatGPT Response; **The Unruly Classroom**

In the quaint town of Bellsville, Mr. Thompson's classroom was known for its old-world charm and his strict, traditional teaching methods. A silver-haired Southern gentleman with a penchant for discipline, he prided himself on imparting knowledge with grace and dignity. Today's lesson: the Pythagorean theorem.

""Alright, y'all,"" Mr. Thompson began, chalk in hand, ""The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse—""

*Prrrfft!*

A loud, unmistakable sound echoed through the room, followed by muffled giggles and snickers. Piggy, a notorious troublemaker with a penchant for pranks, had struck again. The classroom erupted in laughter, desks shaking with the force of stifled giggles.

Mr. Thompson's face turned a shade redder. Taking a deep breath and regaining his composure, he continued, ""As I was sayin', the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares—""

*Prrrfft! Prrrrrrrrft!*

Another round of uproarious laughter filled the room. Piggy, unable to contain himself, reveled in the chaos he had created. The other students exchanged glances, torn between amusement and fear of Mr. Thompson's impending wrath.

""That's enough!"" Mr. Thompson thundered, veins bulging in his forehead. ""Piggy, you've had yer fun, but I won't tolerate such behavior in my class!""

But before Mr. Thompson could utter another word, Piggy let out another deafening blast, louder than before. The classroom was in chaos, students doubled over in laughter, tears streaming down their faces.

Enough was enough. With a determined glint in his eyes, Mr. Thompson marched toward Piggy's desk. ""Young man,"" he growled, ""this ends today.""

With one swift motion, Mr. Thompson grabbed Piggy by the collar and dragged him out of the classroom. The door slammed shut, leaving behind a stunned and silent class.

Minutes felt like hours before Mr. Thompson returned, his face flushed but composed. ""Now,"" he said, wiping the chalk dust off his hands, ""where were we? Ah, yes, the Pythagorean theorem.""

With renewed vigor, Mr. Thompson resumed his lesson, ensuring that every student understood the intricacies of the theorem. The room was silent, the previous antics forgotten, replaced by a newfound respect for their teacher.

As the bell rang, signaling the end of class, the students filed out, whispering amongst themselves about the day's events. But one thing was clear: Piggy's reign of flatulence had come to an end, and Mr. Thompson had emerged victorious, ensuring that the Pythagorean theorem—and respect for the classroom—prevailed.",User_deleted,3

I think students want to embrace this new technology! Let them!   


Tell them to go chat with GPT or whatever LLM they prefer and learn as much as you can about the topic. The students who dive deep into asking questions will know all sorts of interesting facts!  
Then, after that, have them ask the LLM to write a paper on all the questions they asked. You will see the students who asked ""Tell me about Abraham Lincoln"" vs. ""Tell me about Abraham Lincoln"" and had 50 follow-up questions.  
We HAVE to embrace LLM's. Might as well show them how to use them properly. Just get creative with ways to use it.",active,0

18ttn71,1,2023-12-29,Does Humbot Work?,u/joshstealth,stealthgpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stealthgpt/comments/18ttn71/does_humbot_work/,"https://preview.redd.it/m666o60jz99c1.png?width=2876&format=png&auto=webp&s=4eebd6a19a5ee63a6b9c75ee799c64b0f5c1f3f3

This blog post will cover on whether or not Humbot, a cutting-edge bypass AI detection technology tool capable of getting 100% human score, can bypass popular AI detectors such as GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn. 

Humbot claims to be the ultimate solution to bypass AI detection. Humbot can easily humanize AI text into authentic and original content undetectable by most detectors. Humbot claims to be a trustworthy AI humanizer to bypass AI detection capable of being undetectable by most detectors such as: GPTZero, Content at Scale, Winston AI, Copyleaks, TurnItIn, ZeroGPT, and OpenAI's Text Classifier. 

Finally, we will compare Humbot against StealthGPT to see which Undetectable AI Website reigns supreme. The results will shock you. 

Here's what we will cover:

* What Are Undetectable AI Websites?
* What is Humbot?
* What is StealthGPT?
* Test Preparation
* Humbot Against GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn
* StealthGPT Against GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn
* Final Thoughts
* Content at Scale vs StealthGPT's Value and Pricing 

## What Are Undetectable AI Websites?

Undetectable AI websites represent a significant leap in digital content creation. Leveraging advanced AI algorithms, these websites produce content that closely mimics human writing, both in style and substance. The key attribute of these websites is their ability to generate content that is almost indistinguishable from that written by humans.

### Characteristics of Undetectable AI Websites:

**Human-like Content Creation:** The AI-generated content is fluent, coherent, and contextually appropriate, making it comparable to human writing.

**Scalability:** Capable of producing large volumes of content quickly, these websites meet the growing demand for constant content updates.

**SEO Optimization:** The content is often optimized for search engines, improving the website's visibility and search rankings.

**Diversity in Content:** These platforms can cater to a broad range of topics, adapting to different styles and formats as needed.

## What is Humbot?

https://preview.redd.it/5szp6jzjz99c1.png?width=2876&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f3dc85e8b7689a99d8cb5e47c95c48f9d546cbe

Humbot is a term that has been gaining traction in the world of AI and digital content. While the specific functionalities and features of Humbot may vary, it generally refers to an AI-powered tool designed to enhance content creation and management.

### Aspects of Humbot:

**Enhanced Content Generation:** Humbot likely focuses on producing high-quality, engaging, and relevant content.

## Test Preparation

We will be using ChatGPT for our experiment. We will use the content produced by ChatGPT and place them onto Humbot and StealthGPT's bypass tools. We will then test to see if they can bypass against well known AI detectors. 

Popular AI detectors such as GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn will be used for this experiment. We will provide images showcasing how Humbot compares against StealthGPT. 

Finally, we will make a conclusion based on the experiment to see if whether or not Humbot actually works. 

## Humbot Against GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn

Firstly, let's come up with a text written by ChatGPT. Here's the prompt that we will be using for the experiment. 

https://preview.redd.it/2ccovx9nz99c1.png?width=2360&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa9d3170416447578bfdabe4f5bd8dfd355fd93c

Now, let's place this text within Humbot's AI bypass tool.

https://preview.redd.it/0wpfey3pz99c1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c6cdcbbbadb22f746bb19be029b0f40109d68ae

https://preview.redd.it/zyduebjpz99c1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=188e556fa669b72943897ff35b160d73c5a3d20d

## Humbot Against GPTZero

https://preview.redd.it/vh0zu2zsz99c1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1f7961d2b93af467e6b4ba46652ae4444098589

A 94% AI written score from GPTZero is not a good sign for Humbot. All 20 sentences were detected as AI generated. While it's possible for Humbot to bypass the other websites, It's not looking too good for them right now.

## Humbot Against Originality

https://preview.redd.it/9of1nw1uz99c1.png?width=2874&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cbd4c205d49094cb32062c1295665da92b51148

100% AI detection score from Originality already proves that Humbot does not work. Let's see how Humbot does well against TurnItIn to make sure.

## Humbot Against TurnItIn

https://preview.redd.it/z28at7hvz99c1.jpg?width=1954&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ef6dfcc3613e2b32f64d07705ffcbedafc6e89f

100% detection score from TurnItIn is the nail in the coffin that proves that Humbot cannot go up against major AI detectors such as GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn. 

## StealthGPT Against GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn

Now, let's compare StealthGPT against GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn. We'll take the same text from ChatGPT and convert it to StealthGPT beforehand. 

https://preview.redd.it/pmv2vs0xz99c1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=d690b86ae96b794bc0fd0c4ee42588212ee87e08

## StealthGPT Against GPTZero

https://preview.redd.it/jz0o01ryz99c1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbbf20bb35655d898da78bb0e360ff05d82cdb1e

Wow from 94% from Humbot to just 0% AI written content from StealthGPT. This is a good sign but let's not get too hopeful just yet. We still have Originality and TurnItIn to see if StealthGPT is legit.

## StealthGPT Against Originality

https://preview.redd.it/83ov6x200a9c1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=488a5d33c700faec8125049c78be014c3e7e4be0

Okay maybe StealthGPT is legit. However, TurnItIn is one of the most powerful AI detectors out there. If StealthGPT can bypass TurnItIn, StealthGPT can bypass any AI detectors out there.

## StealthGPT Against TurnItIn

https://preview.redd.it/3vhh2nf10a9c1.jpg?width=1812&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd5c729ebf627f276be90991824f8d65bf6644c7

StealthGPT can bypass GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn. That is an impressive feat considering how Humbot failed against all three AI detectors. 

## Final Thoughts

In conclusion, it turns out that Humbot fails to bypass major AI detectors such as GPTZero at 94% AI generated content, Originality at at 100% AI written content, and TurnItin at 100% AI detection score. Humbot fails to claim itself as the ultimate solution to bypass AI detection.  

In comparison, StealthGPT goes beyond expectations and achieved over an impressive 0% AI detection score on GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn. Humbot could not achieve what StealthGPT could in this experiment. It's a major breakthrough for highschool, college students, or other professions out there seeking to bypass AI detectors. It's clear that StealthGPT reigns supreme as the best AI humanizer platform out there. StealthGPT currently ranks as the best AI bypasser website and this experiment proves it. 

We will continue to experiment other undetectable AI websites to see their capabilities and trustworthiness. Check out our blog post here. 

## Humbot vs StealthGPT's Value and Pricing

### Humbot Pricing

https://preview.redd.it/hcytsg170a9c1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c8d4a552146b8d8112b82c67bf13c486eecfa88

Starts at $9.99 per month for 20,000 undetectable AI words, 1 user, ""totally undetectable outputs,"" no grammar mistakes, and fast rewrite speed. Annual price starting at $60 for 20,000 undetectable AI words. There is a slide feature that lets the user adjust according to their needs. Max of $209 per month for 760,000 undetectable AI words and yearly plan of $1,253.04 for 760,000 undetectable AI words.

### StealthGPT Pricing

https://preview.redd.it/prt1f5g80a9c1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5974525176638bda7024ae832ded9664cd13aa9

https://preview.redd.it/vkhxl4p80a9c1.png?width=2876&format=png&auto=webp&s=50a02acdd9b794e87562d4714477c0901a5a02b2

Starting at $14.99 per month for 100,000 Undetectable AI words, 1 user, and with chrome extension. $19.99 for 500,000 words per month and $29.99 for 1,000,000 words per month. An annual option of $99.99 for 100,000 words per month, $199.99 for 500,000 words per month, and $299.99 for 1,000,000 words per month. StealthGPT has a flexible pricing option compared to Content at Scale. Making it a more affordable option for users especially highschool and college students.  

### Humbot vs StealthGPT's value

When we are looking at the pricing alone, Humbot does have a cheaper pricing option; however, Humbot only allows for 20,000 words per month. StealthGPT offers 80,000 more words per month while also being effective. Humbot does have a flexible plan option for users, making it an enticing option for highschool or college students, but there is an increase risk of getting caught by AI detectors. Would you pay as cheaply  as you can in exchange for a higher chance of getting caught? The consequences aren't worth the hassle. In the end, StealthGPT's value and pricing beats Humbot without a doubt.

Unlike most AI tools out there, StealthGPT was built and trained on hundreds of hours of human styled writings that make it uniquely different from any other AI writing tool on the market. That is how StealthGPT is and continues to remain the best Undetectable AI on the market.

I am a M19 alumni, meaning I studied and took my exams before either COVID or widespread LLMs were a thing. My HLs were History, Econ, Lang&Lit, and my SLs were Bio, Math Studies and Mandarin.

I am posting here because I am curious as to how various IB schools around the world are handling the rapid rise of LLMs like ChatGPT. I now work full-time and utilise ChatGPT a daily basis, and I keep thinking about how helpful it would have been to assist me with studying. But of course, it also raises questions of plagiarism which the IB is notorious for being strict on. So I wonder: 

**Are IB schools embracing AI to enhance learning and research, or imposing strict measures to prevent its misuse?**

Any input is appreciated, as I am very curious. 

Thanks and best of luck in your studies!  ",active,6

## What Are Undetectable AI Websites?

Undetectable AI websites represent a new frontier in the digital world. These platforms are designed to function under the radar of conventional AI detection systems. Typically, AI detection tools scan websites to identify if the content is generated by AI algorithms. Undetectable AI websites cleverly mask their AI-generated content, making it appear as if it's created by humans. This is achieved through advanced algorithms that mimic human writing styles, including nuances and idiosyncrasies that are typically absent in standard AI-generated content. The purpose of such websites can vary, ranging from avoiding algorithmic penalties by search engines to maintaining the authenticity of the user experience.

## What is Bypass AI?

https://preview.redd.it/hp1wbwnorh9c1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=6405d6eeb5394bf69794c291eb8d651c9de335fb

Bypass AI refers to the set of technologies or methods used to circumvent AI detection systems. These systems are often employed by search engines, academic integrity tools, and content moderation platforms. The primary goal of Bypass AI is to create content or perform actions that seem natural and human-like, thereby evading detection. This involves sophisticated programming that allows AI to adapt, learn, and modify its approach to mimic human behavior more closely. However, the effectiveness of Bypass AI is a subject of ongoing debate. While some claim significant success in evading detection, others argue that as AI detection systems evolve, they become more adept at identifying even the most advanced Bypass AI techniques.

## What is StealthGPT?

https://preview.redd.it/zsz7wowprh9c1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d732d8ab356b871dff681550706ae73bb6fd2ab

StealthGPT is a term that has emerged in the context of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models. It implies a version or use-case of GPT that operates stealthily, often in scenarios where AI-generated content needs to be undetectable. The concept of StealthGPT revolves around creating outputs that are indistinguishable from human-generated content. This can be particularly useful in areas where the authenticity of content is crucial, such as in journalism, academic writing, or creative writing. StealthGPT employs advanced techniques to refine the output, reduce patterns that are typically associated with AI, and incorporate human-like elements in the content.

## Test Preparation

We will be using ChatGPT for our experiment. We will use the content produced by ChatGPT and place them onto Bypass AI and StealthGPT's bypass tools. We will then test to see if they can bypass against well known AI detectors. 

Popular AI detectors such as GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn will be used for this experiment. We will provide images showcasing how Bypass AI compares against StealthGPT. 

Finally, we will make a conclusion based on the experiment to see if whether or not Bypass AI actually works. 

## Bypass AI Against GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn

Well you heard it here folks, StealthGPT is able to bypass GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn. Are we even surprised at this point? 

## Final Thoughts

In conclusion, it turns out that Bypass AI fails to bypass major AI detectors such as GPTZero at 91% AI detection score, Originality at 100% AI written score, and TurnItIn at 100% AI content score. Bypass AI fails to claim itself as a powerful AI humanizer that transforms your AI-generated content into naturally authentic, undetectable text, allowing you to bypass all AI detectors. They also fail to claim to make your AI text 100% undetectable and trustworthy partner for outsmarting AI detectors. 

Comparatively, StealthGPT goes beyond expectations and achieved over 0% AI detection score on GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn. Bypass AI didn't even have a chance against popular AI detectors but StealthGPT could easily. This is a major breakthrough for college, highschool students, and other professions out there who want to avoid AI detection. It's clear who the true winner is as StealthGPT reigns supreme as the best AI humanizer platform out there currently.

Stealthwriter is one of the many tools that claim to offer undetectable content generation that search engines, your audience, or even your teacher will not be able to detect. It says it can offer you unique writing if you simply input a few prompts, and they will create something that cannot be traced by AI content detection tools like Originality.ai, GPT Zero, or TurnItIn. Some people find themselves short on time and want to use an AI content creation tool to generate their content for them, but in a way that ensures no one knows that they generated it. That might be because they have too many pressures at work to find time to write, it might be because they aren't confident in their writing skills, or it could simply be because they want to take a quick shortcut and save time.

Whatever the case may be, it is easy to see why the world of AI content generation is exciting to some, given the seemingly bottomless well of knowledge and insight and the speed at which content can get created.
