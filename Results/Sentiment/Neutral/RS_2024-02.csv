This is my first year teaching. I was really excited to start but after the fall semester I had, I dread it and wish I didn’t commit to teaching a spring course. The teenagers I work with show more maturity each day than the adult grad students I teach. The course I taught in the fall was full of students who could not do things like use Google sheets to calculate an average or interpret a correlation statistic correctly and they are in grad school to become psychologists. I had two students who I discovered blatantly cheated the entire semester on major assignments. One used chatGPT for her final paper which I discovered by looking at her Google doc edit history wher she copy and pasted paragraphs and then changed the font. When I confronted them about it, they lied to me and flipped it around on me, trying to deny they did anything wrong. When I told them what evidence I had they finally came clean. The department chair wouldn’t let me fail them. they both got a C in the class. I felt extremely powerless. I had two students get an A- who deserved a lower grade but I had offered lots of extra credit. One of them emailed me asking to change it to an A because I was the only professor who didn’t give her an A so she didn’t have a 4.0 anymore. Opened my course evaluations today and one student wrote “the vibes were off” in my class. (And others wrote even worse but that one just takes the cake for me). It was my dream to teach a college class for the longest time and it has been so negative and awful. All my students have been so entitled and truly not capable of graduate level work. It makes me embarrassed to be an alumni of the school.",active,61

Can you possibly take a few minutes and validate my hypotheses and give your unbiased opinion as to whether I should join March 4 or later? I understand if this may be too personal, but I think your opinion would still be very helpful. (My hypotheses may be wrong and I may be missing other points)

HEX Professional online course overview https://www.startwithhex.com/program/hex-ed-innovation:

Topics:
-Problem statement, Solution hypothesis Risky assumptions
- Market research, Customer persona
- Revenue and finance, Business model and structure
- Tools for prototyping, Creating a prototype
- Pitching skills Story telling
Cost: $1100
Services:
1hr mentoring sessions each week with mentors from leading companies such as Atlassian
1hr workshops each week including interactive vids and info from founders and ceos of recognised startups and employees from google.
Checkpoints to complete consolidating learning.

The reasons for not joining on March 4:

I feel like the HEX course focuses on building a business plan for a startup instead of actually building the product and YC recommends to start by building the product and worry abt business aspects later.

It will allow me time to learn coding and ai and try building something myself, which would allow me to gain some knowledge and ask better questions during the mentoring sessions and come up with better ideas if I join later. 

It will also allow time to explore my other interests such as design, painting, blender, photography instead of startups, but I can do this later. 

I feel like the content can also be found online for free or cheaper, albeit time consuming.

I can use chatgpt as mentor.

Reasons for joining March 4:

It will provide me with knowledge and skills to build a startup business and save me a lot of time trying to find the content online. It may also make the process of building a startup easier with the skills gained. 

The HEX course would look good on resume and the skills can transfer into my future job.

I may have been wrong about the disadvantages of the mentoring sessions above and actually gain insightful knowledge from it.

I will have a network of knowledgeable and experienced people earlier.

1aian6o,20,2024-02-03,Researchers say generative AI isn't replacing devs any time soon,u/Primary_Initial_3274,codingbootcamp,https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/1aian6o/researchers_say_generative_ai_isnt_replacing_devs/,">[An October 2023 study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06770), recently submitted to the International Conference on Learning Representations, taking place in May 2024, suggests that AI is unlikely to replace humans in the software development loop any time soon.  
>  
>Carlos Jimenez, a Ph.D. student studying AI at Princeton University, working alongside a group of his colleagues and some peers from the University of Chicago, developed an evaluation framework that drew nearly 2,300 common software engineering problems from real GitHub issues – typically a bug report or feature request – and corresponding pull requests across 12 popular Python repositories to test the performance of various large language models (LLMs).   
>  
>Researchers provided the LLMs with both the issue and the repo code, and tasked the model with producing a workable fix, which was tested after to ensure it was correct. But only 4% of the time did the LLM generate a solution that worked.  
>  
>Their specifically-trained model, SWE-Llama, could only solve the simplest engineering issues presented on GitHub – while mainstream LLMs like Anthropic’s Claude 2 and OpenAI’s GPT-4 could only solve 4.8% and 1.7% of problems, respectively.  
>  
>“It’s just a very different type of problem” to those that LLMs are traditionally trained on, Jimenez explained in an interview to discuss the findings. “If you’re not going to help the model a lot, they’re not very good at isolating the problem from a large code file, for instance.”

\- It supports higher-res inputs, more tasks, and exceeds Gemini Pro on several benchmarks. It maintains the data efficiency of LLaVA-1.5, and LLaVA-1.6-34B is trained \~1 day with 32 A100s. LLaVA-1.6 comes with base LLMs of different sizes: Mistral-7B, Vicuna-7B/13B, Hermes-Yi-34B.
* **Google rolls out huge AI updates:**  
1. Launches an AI image generator - ImageFX- It allows users to create and edit images using a prompt-based UI. It offers an ""expressive chips"" feature, which provides keyword suggestions to experiment with different dimensions of image creation. Google claims to have implemented technical safeguards to prevent the tool from being used for abusive or inappropriate content.  
2. Google has released two new AI tools for music creation: MusicFX and TextFX- MusicFX generates music based on user prompts but has limitations with stringed instruments and filters out copyrighted content. TextFX, conversely, is a suite of modules designed to aid in the lyrics-writing process, drawing inspiration from rap artist Lupe Fiasco.   
3. Google’s Bard is now powered by the Gemini Pro globally, supporting 40+ languages- The chatbot will have improved understanding and summarizing content, reasoning, brainstorming, writing, and planning capabilities. Google has also extended support for more than 40 languages in its ""Double check"" feature, which evaluates if search results are similar to what Bard generates.   
4. Google's Bard can now generate photos using its Imagen 2 text-to-image model, catching up to its rival ChatGPT Plus- Bard's image generation feature is free, and Google has implemented safety measures to avoid generating explicit or offensive content.   
5. Google Maps introduces a new AI feature to help users discover new places- The feature uses LLMs to analyze over 250M locations and contributions from over 300M Local Guides. Users can search for specific recommendations, and the AI will generate suggestions based on their preferences. Its currently being rolled out in the US.

Do you have any resources or ideas about my student's situation?

She is a mother who is fluent, basically native-like in English because she spent a couple of years growing up in the states as a child. I mean, when I first started teaching her, I thought she was American. Her accent is so native, but since she lives in her home-country again and has two toddlers now, she wants to raise them speaking English at home. I have prepared a document with sentences and phrases that I grew up with such as, ""Hey guys, we gotta be out in 5. Are you getting ready?"". I mean, real sentences you would use in daily life that a person who didn't grow up in the USA their whole life might not know. But after two pages of phrases, I've hit a block and don't know how to proceed. I tried enlisting the help of ChatGPT but it gives very unnatural phrases no matter how I word the prompt.

Any places I could get some more phrases?",User_deleted,0
1ajwmp3,1,2024-02-05,How to do a Phd without curiosity? (Doing Ph.D. with no questions asked! ),u/AnnZee3405,PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1ajwmp3/how_to_do_a_phd_without_curiosity_doing_phd_with/,"  

Hi everyone! I am a social science international grad student currently in the USA with a background in engineering. 

My first question is regarding asking questions:

I have never been curious my whole life. If somebody told me anything I would never ask any further questions. But this doesn’t apparently work in academia where students are encouraged to ask questions. If I attend a lecture or read a book, I completely understand its contents and have no questions to ask. I never ask questions or participate in discussions because I don’t have any ideas or anything to say. Is curiosity an acquirable skill or is it natural? How to survive without it in grad school?

My second question (or I would say problem) is:

I came from an educational background where we were never taught analytical or critical thinking skills. Here in the USA and especially in a social sciences department where you are supposed to analyze the text critically and to come up with ideas/ thoughts/ reflections/ critiques, I become blank. I refer to AI for ideas and feel my answers are super shallow. I am never satisfied with the writing or analysis I generate. Is this skill also acquirable? How much time would it take? Is it related to my lack of curiosity? (I accept the readings as they are and have no questions or any critiques for them).

My third question is:  
 Since I am not curious, and I don’t see in between the lines or go into extreme details. How can I generate research ideas? I brainstorm using ChatGPT and Bard etc. (I am never fully satisfied with the ideas I get using these platforms). I have no genuine ideas or passion, so I want to do everything and end up pursuing nothing. I also have a fear/embarrassment that people would think my ideas are so random. Like if one research project idea is about the north another would be about a different thing in the south. Are there any resources to generate research ideas? I understand this could be due to other problems like a change of field and other personal factors but changing the field and leaving the PhD is not an option so how can I find my way around it?",User_deleted,0

It all feels a bit silly when AI is perfectly capable of doing the job, with some human help. I want my students to be able to focus on thinking of good research questions and paradigms, and actually performing the research itself (ie field interviews, behavioral experiments etc). ChatGPT writes beautiful reviews, but with largely made up papers, and thus made up research findings.

1alroq4,1,2024-02-08,Is anyone aware of a super long context ChatGPT?,u/webNoob13,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/1alroq4/is_anyone_aware_of_a_super_long_context_chatgpt/,"I graduated in July of 2023 and recently took a coding test using ChatGPT for this constraints + knapsack type problem that I first tried to do recursively with dynamic programming (with memoization) but ended looking more at Integer Linear Programming and surprisingly ChatGPT's ""memory"" seemed spot on.  What is your opinion though on that ""memory"" or ""context window"" for different tasks?  Mind you I had created a CustomGPT for this task so maybe that helped a bit.  

I ask because I saw:

OpenAI retrieval plugin: [https://github.com/openai/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin?tab=readme-ov-file#retrieval-plugin](https://github.com/openai/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin?tab=readme-ov-file#retrieval-plugin)

And a vector database, ie. storing prompts and responses on the fly as the conversation progresses and then having the retrieval plugin search that vector database for relevant past prompts and responses before giving the current response, is it possible to have a super duper long context GPT?  

I can imagine this being very helpful on coding tasks, ie. for any decent sized project and try to link up with Trello, GitHub and anything else that might be of interest.  Like Cursor IDE on steroids.  

This feels like a no-brainer to build something like this but is there something already out there that I'm not aware of?  

I just started learning about Langchain, LlamaIndex and find them quite refreshing compared to the more technical and rigorous coding that was required in the OMSCS program and my other projects are:

\-coding teacher IDE for students learning how to code

Does anyone have a suggestion? Here is the assignment my students have -

**The Fool or the Devil** 

Students have two options for this task, each involving a different type of conversational partner, which can be either a real person or ChatGPT. The dialogue should be about 800-1500 words of your responses (not including ChatGPT).

Teaching the Uninformed: In this option, students will engage in a dialogue where their partner (real or ChatGPT) acts as someone uninformed or struggling to grasp a concept from the course. The student's role is to explain this concept clearly and patiently, addressing questions and confusions that arise. This process is about teaching effectively, breaking down complex ideas into understandable parts, and responding to misunderstandings.

Debating with a Devil's Advocate: Alternatively, students can choose to have a debate where their partner (real or ChatGPT) takes on the role of a devil's advocate. This partner will
challenge the student's explanations of a cognitive science concept, like the massive modularity thesis, with critical objections. The student's task is to address these challenges thoughtfully and defend their understanding of the topic.

For both options, the key is the quality of the interaction. Students will be graded not solely on the correctness of their answers but on how well the conversation demonstrates their understanding of the material. This includes their ability to clarify concepts, engage with objections, and guide the dialogue constructively.",User_deleted,1

# Introduction

What is LearnFlowGPT? At its core, its a unified collection of commands, taking on the role of an educational expert who employs scientifically backed methods to enhance learning efficiency.

[Visualization of the commands LearnFlowGPT uses and how they might be applied in our defined learning strategy ](https://preview.redd.it/dt1s5ckazghc1.png?width=1736&format=png&auto=webp&s=995a67bdf66c1fb765090e07ec182d257e6c150e)

# How to Use

You might have to add the custom GPTs that act as commands to your account by interacting with them. The basic idea is to use LearnFlowGPT (or really any GPT as your base) and then utilize the @{GPT NAME} command.

# Why?

Many people are not taught how to properly learn. They spend too much time engaging in passive studying. This includes rereading material, taking linear notes, and rewriting those same linear notes. I wanted a way to make engaging in active learning easier for me, and hopefully it helps others. 

# What is Active Learning?

Active Learning involves a deeper engagement with materials than linear, passive note-taking. It's about connecting key terms and understanding their relationships. Consider this fact:

""Modern RDBMS use ACID compliance to maintain transactional integrity and resilience in busy environments, thanks to MVCC.""

You might be able to memorize this short-term, but, if you have no idea where to place this fact in your brain, long-term recall is harder. The key? Give your brain context and links between concepts. Knowing how ACID, RDBMS, and MVCC interconnect makes remembering much simpler. Having a deep understanding of topics results in having to use less flashcards, which is always good.

TLDR: You must engage with the material you're learning. You need to know what X and Y are and also how X and Y are related to each other as well as how they affect Z. This is active learning.

# A Structured Approach to Active Learning

There are many ways to approach Active Learning. This is just the way I enjoy the most. Thanks to Justin Sung for this one:

1. Scoping/Pre-Study 
2. Maybe Mapping
3. Evaluating
4. Simplifying 
5. Breaks
6. Repeat
7. Flashcards
8. Practice Problems

Let us assume a student is reading through a chapter in a textbook.

**Scoping**:

Go through the textbook and pick out keywords. Aim for 10-30 keywords. Write these keywords down. These keywords can be from headings, subheadings, anything that sticks out while you quickly scan through the chapter. Do not aim for depth here, you want to go through all of the material you plan to study. 

&#x200B;

**Maybe Mapping**:

Use the keywords you've accumulated and map out how they might relate to one another. Draw it! Use a tablet if possible. See this good video about non-linear note taking (I swear I am not a Justin Sung shill):  
 \[[iPad Note-Taking](https://youtu.be/ntaO3-n-isc?si=wEb-_tJJTlgtkmav)\]  
It is ok for you to get some of these relationships wrong. In fact, correcting mistakes will lead to even better learning. If you have zero clue what a keyword is though, take around 30 seconds to either google it or ask chat GPT. Hopefully you guys can see how we're slowly building a scaffold of the chapter. While you're creating your maybe map, think about how it might be possible to group or chunk some of these keywords. Then, try and think about how the groups might relate to each other. 

&#x200B;

**Evaluating**:

The fun part. Now, we're removing most of the guess work. You will go through the chapter, except this time you will actually read it. Refer to your keywords list and your maybe map. As you learn more about a keyword, you might find that you have to correct your maybe map. Correct any wrong information, correct any relationships, make new relationships, new groupings, etc. As you get through a keyword, stop and think. Zoom out of your map. Is there anyway for you to simplify? 

&#x200B;

**Simplifying**:

As you finish each keyword, take a step back and ask a few questions. How does this relate to everything else we have so far? How does this change anything I previously thought of the topic? Can I add this to a group? Can I simplify anything? This step is critical. You will notice that as you go through the material, your mindmap will become more and more overwhelming. When you feel overwhelmed, you have to simplify! It takes a lot of effort to do this, and it's generally uncomfortable. What it boils down to: you have to learn more about a keyword/set of keywords and how they relate to each other. An expert in something can explain a very complex topic in very few and simple words. 

&#x200B;

**Break**:

Take a regularly scheduled break. This part is basically just the pomodoro method. 

&#x200B;

**Repeat**:

This is an iterative approach. After your break, continue evaluating until you finished all the content in that chapter. Once you finish the chapter, feel free to stop. Your goal is to choose what to study, complete it, and move on. 

&#x200B;

**Flashcards**:

Flashcards are very useful. However, it can be very easy to have an overwhelming amount of flashcards. It is demotivating to see you have 500 flashcards due. The solution: Make less flashcards! When you approach learning in the way described above, you rely on rote memorization much less. Save your flashcards for rules, facts, theorems that must simply be memorized. 

&#x200B;

**Practice Problems**:

You cannot say you learned something if you haven't had to apply it. It is one thing to know that one unit plus one unit is equal to two units, it's a whole other thing to apply this knowledge to practice problems. These practice problems work to cement the theory in your brain. You get to struggle with problems, which only works to improve your comprehension of it. 

# How LearnFlowGPT Helps

How can we use a tool like LearnFlowGPT to speed up the learning process? Well, we can automate some of the steps. 

&#x200B;

**Scoping/Maybe Map**:

Using the u/Prime \- LFG GPT, users can submit content and get a list of keywords and questions. Create your maybe map from these keywords. Use the questions to guide your thinking when creating this. 

&#x200B;

**Evaluating**:

Using the u/Notes \- LFG GPT, users can submit content and get a structured set of Obsidian-ready notes. These notes use Obsidian Callouts. When reading dense material, I find it easier to read these generated notes to get a good picture in my mind of what the text is saying. Then, I can more easily read the source material and understand better. 

Using the u/Question \- LFG GPT, users can ask complex questions related to the content at hand. This GPT will break down the problem using a Tree-of-Thought prompting technique to produce more accurate results. 

&#x200B;

Both of these, along with source material, enable users to correct their maybe map. 

&#x200B;

**Simplifying**: 

The Base persona - LearnFlowGPT - will be a good for simplifying complicated relationships between keywords/groups. 

&#x200B;

**Flashcards**:

Using the u/Flashcards \- LFG GPT, users can submit content and get a set of basic, Anki-ready flashcards. These flashcards can be imported into Anki. These flashcards focus on facts, rules, theorems, etc. Use the flashcards for things that you believe must just be memorized. The way I do it: upload or copy and paste the entire section I want flashcards on, then I manually filter out the cards I don't want before importing to Anki.  

# GPT Mentions Integration

With the new GPT Mentions feature, I knew there would be a way to create specialized GPTs whose sole purpose is to do one job. Previously, I used slash commands and text documents to implement functions. Now, I've created a specialized GPT for each one of my functions.

# Closing/Future

Use this as a tool to improve your learning. Using AI to replace actual learning is not something that is currently possible, or maybe I just haven't figured out how to do it yet. Hope this helps someone! 

I have some ideas on how it can potentially be improved, which basically just comes down to guiding the GPTs to focus on a specific subject. I am working on a website that does this. The intent is for users to be able to interact with LearnFlowGPT through the ChatGPT interface, and get back a set of instructions for all of these GPTs that are more tailored to a specific topic, or university course.

# Introduction

What is LearnFlowGPT? At its core, its a unified collection of commands, taking on the role of an educational expert who employs scientifically backed methods to enhance learning efficiency.

&#x200B;

# How to Use

You might have to add the custom GPTs that act as commands to your account by interacting with them. The basic idea is to use LearnFlowGPT (or really any GPT as your base) and then utilize the @{GPT NAME} command.

# Why?

Many people are not taught how to properly learn. They spend too much time engaging in passive studying. This includes rereading material, taking linear notes, and rewriting those same linear notes. I wanted a way to make engaging in active learning easier for me, and hopefully it helps others.

# What is Active Learning?

Active Learning involves a deeper engagement with materials than linear, passive note-taking. It's about connecting key terms and understanding their relationships. Consider this fact:

""Modern RDBMS use ACID compliance to maintain transactional integrity and resilience in busy environments, thanks to MVCC.""

You might be able to memorize this short-term, but, if you have no idea where to place this fact in your brain, long-term recall is harder. The key? Give your brain context and links between concepts. Knowing how ACID, RDBMS, and MVCC interconnect makes remembering much simpler. Having a deep understanding of topics results in having to use less flashcards, which is always good.

TLDR: You must engage with the material you're learning. You need to know what X and Y are and also how X and Y are related to each other as well as how they affect Z. This is active learning.

# A Structured Approach to Active Learning

There are many ways to approach Active Learning. This is just the way I enjoy the most. Thanks to Justin Sung for this one:

1. Scoping/Pre-Study
2. Maybe Mapping
3. Evaluating
4. Simplifying
5. Breaks
6. Repeat
7. Flashcards
8. Practice Problems

Let us assume a student is reading through a chapter in a textbook.

**Scoping**:

Go through the textbook and pick out keywords. Aim for 10-30 keywords. Write these keywords down. These keywords can be from headings, subheadings, anything that sticks out while you quickly scan through the chapter. Do not aim for depth here, you want to go through all of the material you plan to study.

&#x200B;

**Maybe Mapping**:

Use the keywords you've accumulated and map out how they might relate to one another. Draw it! Use a tablet if possible. See this good video about non-linear note taking (I swear I am not a Justin Sung shill):\[[iPad Note-Taking](https://youtu.be/ntaO3-n-isc?si=wEb-_tJJTlgtkmav)\]It is ok for you to get some of these relationships wrong. In fact, correcting mistakes will lead to even better learning. If you have zero clue what a keyword is though, take around 30 seconds to either google it or ask chat GPT. Hopefully you guys can see how we're slowly building a scaffold of the chapter. While you're creating your maybe map, think about how it might be possible to group or chunk some of these keywords. Then, try and think about how the groups might relate to each other.

&#x200B;

**Evaluating**:

The fun part. Now, we're removing most of the guess work. You will go through the chapter, except this time you will actually read it. Refer to your keywords list and your maybe map. As you learn more about a keyword, you might find that you have to correct your maybe map. Correct any wrong information, correct any relationships, make new relationships, new groupings, etc. As you get through a keyword, stop and think. Zoom out of your map. Is there anyway for you to simplify?

&#x200B;

**Simplifying**:

As you finish each keyword, take a step back and ask a few questions. How does this relate to everything else we have so far? How does this change anything I previously thought of the topic? Can I add this to a group? Can I simplify anything? This step is critical. You will notice that as you go through the material, your mindmap will become more and more overwhelming.

&#x200B;

**Practice Problems**:

You cannot say you learned something if you haven't had to apply it. It is one thing to know that one unit plus one unit is equal to two units, it's a whole other thing to apply this knowledge to practice problems. These practice problems work to cement the theory in your brain. You get to struggle with problems, which only works to improve your comprehension of it.

I am a heavy user of ChatGPT, Recently, in the community communication, I realized that this is also a problem worth discussing. 

I am not a native English speaker, I have some difficulties in using English. Sometimes I have to use these tools.

I hope to discuss these issues with you:


1. Is it really a good idea to bring ChatGPT into classrooms when it might just end up doing the heavy lifting for students?
2. When a student uses ChatGPT for their schoolwork, should we just call it cheating straight away?

# OLD POST through ChatGPT

Greetings, fellow Redditors!📚

Today, I'm bringing to the table a hotly debated topic that's been swirling around academic circles and beyond: the use of ChatGPT in academic settings. Is it a form of cheating, or is it merely a tool that enhances efficiency and learning? Let's dive in.

**Cheating or Efficiency?**

On one hand, ChatGPT's ability to generate essays, research summaries, and even solve complex equations in seconds is undeniably powerful. It offers a shortcut that can bypass traditional learning and research processes, raising concerns about its potential to facilitate academic dishonesty. Can the use of such AI tools undermine the very essence of learning, where the journey is as important as the destination?

**Tool for Learning**

Conversely, ChatGPT could be seen as a revolutionary educational tool. It can provide instant feedback on writing, help generate ideas for research topics, or break down complex theories into digestible explanations. This perspective views ChatGPT as a complement to traditional learning methods, potentially enriching the educational experience and making knowledge more accessible.

**Ethical Considerations**

The ethical implications of using ChatGPT in academia cannot be ignored. The line between assistance and cheating becomes blurred when assignments meant to assess an individual's understanding could be completed with AI's help. How do we navigate this gray area? Should there be guidelines on how and when to use such tools ethically?

**A Call for Discussion**

I invite you all to share your thoughts on this matter. Do you view ChatGPT as a threat to academic integrity, or do you see it as an invaluable resource for students and educators alike? How should institutions adapt to the rise of AI tools in education?

Let's have a thoughtful and engaging discussion on the role of AI in academia. Your insights and experiences could shed light on how we navigate this new frontier.


**Some Questions**  

1. Is it appropriate to endorse the use of ChatGPT as a learning tool in classrooms, given its ability to potentially shortcut the learning process?
2. When students use ChatGPT to complete assignments, should this be automatically considered cheating?
3. How does the availability of ChatGPT and similar AI tools affect educational equity and access among students?
4. Should educational institutions revise their assessment methods to account for the availability of AI tools like ChatGPT?
5. Is there a need for establishing clear ethical guidelines for the use of AI tools in educational settings to balance their benefits against potential misuse?",User_deleted,0

&#x200B;

For C777:

Start date: 1.12.23

End Date: 2.11.23.

Approximately 30 days.

PA and OA questioning and structure are pretty similar. I shockingly found the OA slightly easier than the PA, but don't take my word for it.

&#x200B;

I already use HTML (only) at my job, so HTML I am familiar with. I am not familiar with CSS/JS. But I found that so long as you take the time to learn all the syntax, at that point its mostly logic based.

&#x200B;

I took the PA, scored a 50% first try. I DID NOT LOOK AT THE ANSWERS, that would've been setting myself up for failure. 3 weeks later after using the entire left side of the study guide, some quizzes here and there, and Quizlet in learn mode, I scored a 70% on the PA and passed. The only field I still did bad on was Javascript. For the next 7-9 days I studied extra hard on CSS and JS before taking the OA.

&#x200B;

Everything I did and recommend:

USE THE STUDY GUIDE. 

https://srm--c.vf.force.com/apex/coursearticle?Id=kA03x000000l9D8CAI

It will tell you everything you need to know. Use the 21 Days pacing guide within the study guide to give you some guidance and pacing but I personally did not use it.

Left side of study guide: where you actually learn the material from. Important to note that while w3schools will have a lot more tags and content to cover than the study guide, just know that you do NOT need to read EVERY SINGLE HTML/CSS/JS related item from w3school. Made that mistake with the HTML portion and I'm glad I found out what I really needed to do before I wasted anymore time doing this.

&#x200B;

You're also recommended to use Acrobatiq. You will only find that material if you go to the class in your student portal and click ""Go To Course Material"". I do NOT recommend using it, and I didn't personally didn't use it. It’s a huge waste of time and it greatly annoyed me as I'm hopping between a gazillion different links. Just use w3schools, or the content on the left side of the study guide. If necessary and you're not clicking with the material from w3schools, then by all means: use Acrobatiq. Be prepared to spend extra time though.

&#x200B;

Middle side of study guide: Be sure that you can answer the study questions in the middle. If you can't, you can use this: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR2jMuLRoNvnks672ZIcQqmmOEj-Gbda3suhShCiWW4behAjYXeupcxTHkVNIJ-IMM8wvygPUU80GyS/pub](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR2jMuLRoNvnks672ZIcQqmmOEj-Gbda3suhShCiWW4behAjYXeupcxTHkVNIJ-IMM8wvygPUU80GyS/pub) to brush up on the questions. Me personally, I was able to answer most of these questions but the ones I couldn't, I just used the link. Near the end questions aren't answered, but that's ok because the most important units are covered. API, Forms, and Mobile sections are dead easy anyways.

&#x200B;

Right side of study guide: This contains the Cohorts, LinkedIn Learning videos, QuizZETS, QuizLETS, SoloLearn, and practices from w3schools. I personally only used the QuizLETS and put it in learn mode. I wouldn't bother with the quizzets, they have a lot of questions that just aren't on the exam. Good for overall context, not good if you just want to learn what you need to know on the exam. The linkedin learning quizzes are decent. The w3school exercises are pretty great. I didn’t watch any videos or Cohorts though I heard good things about them. Again, if you're struggling then by all means: use EVERYTHING they throw at you. I personally didn't as it would've taken way more time and I had 7 weeks left on my term anyways.

&#x200B;

Also use these quizzes, they go hard on CSS and Javascript.

&#x200B;

I may be the first person ever on any WGU channel to recommend this but: ChatGPT is surprisingly good here, but ONLY GPT 4.0. Do NOT, I repeat, do NOT use GPT 3.5. I have tested 10 questions from one source (don't remember) and ran it into GPT 3.5. GPT 3.5 got 7/10 questions right, which seemed… odd. Its possible that the official source is wrong, but I'm sure its unlikely the official source is wrong. So I ran it with GPT 4.0, and it got all 10/10 question right as well as super detailed explanations of why not only said answer is right, but why the other questions were wrong. THIS IS HUGE! Most of the quiz sources I used will only tell me if I got something right or wrong, but doesn't explain ALL the choices. GPT 4.0 actually does. By explaining why that answer is right, and why the rest is wrong, I have a better understanding of the material in question.

&#x200B;

I highly recommend GPT 4.0. The downside to this is that GPT 4.0 will cost you $20 USD per month. Considering the average user will need to spend 1 month on this course, that is plenty. To ensure you do not go over the 1 month period and pay again when you're done with the course, I would only pay for GPT 4.0 ONLY AFTER you have read all the material and you start taking quizzes and practice exams because I think so long as you're focused, you really should only spend 1-3 weeks on quizzes and brushing up on things you're still under competent on.

&#x200B;

Day of the exam: I woke up at 8am, I used ALL the quizlets one more time in Learn mode, used the study guide note, and reviewed my latest PA attempt one final time.

&#x200B;

That's all. This was my last class and I'm glad to be over it. Will get my graduation stuff done soon. Good luck.

1ap4bkc,1,2024-02-12,"Need Help with IAs (ESS, Math, Art)",u/Flaky-Try-4803,IBO,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/1ap4bkc/need_help_with_ias_ess_math_art/,"TLDR:  
I need help making some decisions for my Math AA SL, ESS SL, and Visual Arts HL IAs. For math I thought of modelling the spiderman logo, but my teacher said that my idea isn't in-depth enough (even though I think it is), so is there something I can do to fix it or some other spiderman related thing I could do instead? For ESS it seems to be the opposite problem, where I think my teacher wants something basic, but the thing that I want to do would combine his basic idea (the effect of air pollution on child mortality rates of countries of similar economic development within the same region) with my own which just goes further in-depth. For art I need help coming up with idea of what to paint for an HL piece, and an easy way to compare/contrast ""Impression, Sunrise"" by Claude Monet,  ""The Great Wave off Kanagawa"" by Hokusai, and ""The Monk by the Sea"" by Caspar David Friedrich. Many thanks in advance for advice provided.  


I have this week off from school, and mocks are in two weeks. So far, I've only submitted my French B HL IO, English A L&L HL IO, and Psych SL IA. I'm currently failing Visual Arts HL, having only a bunch of writing for my comparative study with no comparison, no piece of my own, and barely any images. I'm technically not failing Math AA SL, but the deadline has long passed for the final IA, and I have yet to even write a draft. Same with ESS (SL).  
My idea for math was that I would model the Spiderman logo (specifically Miles' one) simply because I know I have to pick something that I like. But my teacher said that I needed to go further with it and that I couldn't just model the image (even though that's what another one of my classmates did and I based my idea off of an IA on [clastify.com](https://clastify.com/) where a student modeled the Starbucks logo). Can someone help me find a way to either further my investigation or help me pick another topic? (hopefully still Spider-Man related).  
As for ESS I originally wanted to run an experiment to investigate the extent to which oil pollution affects the photosynthetic rates of aquatic plants (like elodea) but none of the equipment was working as it should've been, so my teacher suggested that I switch to secondary data instead. After talking with my mom, she suggested that I investigate the extent to which air pollution contributes to child mortality rates in certain countries. I think its a great idea, the only problem being that what my mom wants me to write conflicts with what my teacher wants. Tbh I'm more inclined to follow what my mom wants, because she has a masters in public health and I honestly trust her experience way more than my teacher rn (long story short we had a fucking fantastic teacher for DP1 and this new one we have is sub-par by all means both in teaching styles and in the grades that students achieve in accordance). My teacher said I should use the gap minder site to gather all the data on this, and that I should do it using countries of similar economic development. My mom said that since the site does not let you narrow down the data based on the reported cause of death, I should use other sites like WHO to gather data specific to child deaths based on respiratory diseases and I could also limit the age range as I don't think gapminder provides me with that information. She also said that it would potentially be better to compare an MEDC to an LEDC as opposed to multiple LEDCs. I tried to explain this to my teacher but he just said that it doesn't matter how in-depth I go, just that I should get it done (and this, to me, seems like he just wants it over with and could care less about the grade that I get) but to still use just LEDCs from the same region. I'm thinking about maybe combining the two, have the first part of my IA using just gapminder data and then as I go through I would change my method to make it more accurate. Is that a good idea or am I just overworking myself? Should I stick to what my teacher said? Or what my mom said?  
Lastly, does anyone know of a way to easily compare and contrast ""The Monk by the Sea"" by Caspar David Friedrich, ""The Great Wave off Kanagawa"" by Hokusai, and ""Impression, Sunrise"" by Claude Monet? Or have any similarities/differences they can think of off the top of their head that I can then further develop on? Or of an idea of what to do as my HL piece?

I'm sorry for the long text but I just need some help right now because my IB coordinator's idea of advice is ""you just gotta do it"" and that's not helpful whatsoever.  
Thank you in advance to whomever offers advice on this <3

The advent of AI is transforming various facets of our lives, and the field of learning is no exception. With the integration of tools like ChatGPT, we are standing on the brink of a major overhaul in how training is conducted in both corporate and educational settings.

In corporate environments, speed and efficiency are key. Training programs need to be swift, relevant, and highly adaptive to changing market conditions and job requirements. ChatGPT comes into play as a dynamic learning facilitator, capable of offering personalized learning experiences at scale. Imagine an AI mentor available 24/7 to answer questions, provide explanations, and offer resources tailored to the learner's individual needs and pace. The implications for workforce development are vast.

On the educational front, the traditional one-size-fits-all approach has been a limiting factor in student engagement and retention. ChatGPT breathes new life into the scene with interactive learning sessions that adapt to the unique learning style of each student. This isn't just about answering queries but about constantly assessing understanding and filling in knowledge gaps as they are identified.

Notably, as we implement ChatGPT, we also need to address the potential challenges—ensuring the AI understands and responds to diverse contexts appropriately, protecting user privacy, and preventing the spread of misinformation.

The potential of ChatGPT in learning is enormous, offering an innovative way to not just consume content but interact with it, making learning a much more active and personalized process. This could represent a pivotal shift in our approach to knowledge acquisition and skills development, one that could fundamentally change the effectiveness of corporate and educational training programs.

As we witness the integration of this technology, it's an exciting time to discuss its implications and the future trajectory of learning. What are your thoughts and experiences with ChatGPT or similar AI tools in learning environments? Join the conversation below!",active,1

It is almost the end of my semester and as such there are final projects and papers due. I submitted some work that was questioned by my instructor, they believed that it was generated by ChatGPT. I insisted that my work was original, however they did not believe that to be true. I was given a zero on my paper, I cannot express how anxious this made me. 

After I got off work I did some research, I looked at a few articles and first hand experiences with AI detection tools. The census is that they are dangerous and inaccurate, they give false positives and because of this a 15% AI detection can lead to a rejected paper and disciplinary action. I was threatened with such by my instructor. I have my final paper that I completed a few days ago, I combed through this paper with ZeroGPT, Copyleaks, and UndetectableAI. This lead to my work being flagged as AI generated of various percents even though it is 100% original. 

I don't know what is going to happen, if this paper gets rejected I will fail this course and it will all be for nothing. Why are teachers and instructors so reliant on tools that are hurtful to the integrity and trust between a student and teacher?

I applied across the V50 in mid-late December, T14 w/o scholarship, top 30% (school does not rank), 2+ years corporate WE, NYC market only. Have a handful of law school softs, but nothing extraordinary.

Enjoy my stream of consciousness:

Any success came down to curation of experience prior to law school AND a resume that articulated it properly. Obviously, 1L SA offers (like admission to HYS) are pure luck, but callbacks are different. My callback success was the result of my very unique and relevant WE plus grinding out semi-prestigious undergraduate internships to make up for a subpar GPA (below 25th). However, in my experience, pretty much everyone at a T14 has those sick softs... so what's the catch? Learn how to write a freaking resume! I reviewed dozens of resumes from the smartest law students at my school who were also competing for 1L SA roles. Let me tell you: their curation is abysmal and the writing is atrocious. Seriously, ChatGPT would do a better job if you just copy and pasted your line items into it. Really, start with ChatGPT—but do NOT finish with it! Instead, practice your networking skills early on (literally starting in September as a 1L, or now for everyone else) by handing your resume to everybody you know (and respect enough) to give you critical feedback: friends, family, colleagues, classmates, professors, those crappy career advisors (use more than one, if you can), affinity groups, mentors... literally everyone! Integrate the feedback and repeat! Do not wait until January to apply, aim to have your apps in by the last week of December (the ONLY exception is if there is a firm reception that you will attend in EARLY January). But that goes both ways, do not apply to early! Have your resume and cover letters ""done"" by November so you can lock into finals and submit everything afterward. Why? The last thing you want is to have any interviews during your finals period. Grades can make or break your app (which I am confident is the reason for at least half of my rejections). Once you have an interview secured, go on LinkedIn and filter search for current Associates at that office—connect with them all (do not do this with Partners)! Usually only about 1 of 5 will actually accept, at which point you should send them brief messages asking for a quick 15 minute call—use that as an opportunity to hear about the firm and get candid advice about what exactly you should say to the interviewers.

It can be done. 

Now you have a university course. You host it online. You create a chatbot or custom GPT with the course material, transcripts of the videos, and turn it into a teacher. This teacher will grade you, ask questions, create exams and help you understand the material.

Universities are paywall for 3 reasons:

1) They hide the daily material  
2) They have a certificate  
3) They have insider connection to industry standards and people

But we all know they use what can be outdated information, they link us to YouTube videos anyways, and the paper you get at the end of a degree is becoming less worthy (provided you can display expertise to your future employer\[also, great for content creators which is the new economy anyways\])

My question is, why haven't we done this yet? 

1) Is it the programming and creation of the bots? Python needed?  
2) Is it because we're too distracted? Don't see the value in it?

Share your thoughts. Because I've already created a course for a health sciences bachelor and to be honest, I feel like if I were to watch all the YouTube videos, read the blogs, and get tested on this information, I'd be well more than capable to compete against any graduate in the last 4 years.

1au0d0r,1,2024-02-18,AI Literacy and equitable access to generative AI models needs become a priority in education,u/Arkaysion,ArtificialInteligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1au0d0r/ai_literacy_and_equitable_access_to_generative_ai/,"I work in higher education and have been advocating for AI Literacy and access to AI platforms to become a higher priority across academia. The following are some thoughts I shared recently in my blog with fellow educators:

Like so many others, when I first saw the demo clips of OpenAI's new text-to-video generator Sora, I was floored by the quality of the AI-produced videos.

The debut of Sora has elicited a range of reactions - from astonishment at what AI can now create, to excitement about new possibilities, to fear about potential misuse. But amid the zeitgeist prompted by Sora, I want to zoom out and discuss a broader issue that innovations like this compound: the widening gap in AI literacy. Sora represents just the latest leap in the acceleration of consumer AI, and its capabilities are far from evenly distributed. This disparity should spark serious reflection on how we ensure AI access and literacy for all learners, not just the privileged few. If current trends continue, we risk leaving many students unprepared for an AI-integrated world.

The AI tools we've seen rise to prominence over the last year are incredibly powerful, but that power comes with a cost. ChatGPT Plus, Copilot Pro, and Gemini Advanced each come with their own payment plan. And while $20 per month may seem reasonable to some, for many that cost is prohibitively expensive. Learners and schools without the budget to access premium AI tools are put at a competitive disadvantage. Those able to pay have more opportunities to develop their skills and utilize AI to enhance their capabilities. But many bright and driven learners lack the financial means to access the same tools. This poses the risk of an expanding divide, where opportunities go to those already ahead. Without intentional action to expand access, AI risks exacerbating existing inequities rather than closing gaps. The price tag on powerful AI should not determine who gets to participate in our AI-integrated future.

What's more, merely providing access to AI systems is insufficient. Using them effectively requires a baseline of AI literacy. Learners need skills to properly interface with AI tools. This includes knowledge of how to formulate effective prompts to get useful results from systems like ChatGPT. It also means understanding these tools' capabilities and limitations - what types of tasks they excel at versus where they falter or produce biased outputs. Learners need situational awareness of where applying an AI assistant would provide benefit versus where it could hinder creative thinking. And they need the discernment to critically evaluate AI-generated content and identify misinformation. Without developing these competencies, learners may resort to misusing AI or avoid engaging with it altogether. But refusing to engage is one of the worst things we can do - it will only widen the literacy gap further. AI interface skills are essential for learners to harness these technologies responsibly and effectively.

There is also a huge opportunity cost if we do not proactively facilitate means for expanding AI literacy among learners. We cannot be complacent and assume the future will resemble the present. The truth is, our learners' futures will be integrated with AI in ways we can scarcely imagine today. As educators, we have a responsibility to ensure all learners, regardless of background, have the chance to envision their place in an AI-empowered world. We must give students the tools to develop skills that let them shape the future they want, not just adapt to technological changes happening around them. AI literacy is key for seizing opportunities to supplement human talents and unlock new potentials. Without it, many learners could feel displaced and unprepared in the workplace of tomorrow. But with inclusive access and training, they can help write the next chapter of technological advancement where all participate in the benefits.

So how can we empower learners across the board? A measured, proactive approach is needed. Rushing ahead with AI adoption without equipping learners risks confusion and misuse. But refusing to engage with AI at all puts learners at a disadvantage.

Action steps to consider:

 - Institutions should expand access to AI systems and skills training for their learners. This could be achieved through partnerships with tech leaders to provide free or subsidized access to platforms and learning resources. Work to secure budgets and grants to make these tools available to all learners regardless of financial situation. This levels the playing field so anyone motivated can develop AI literacy.

 - Update curricula and learning outcomes with industry stakeholders to maintain relevance to the AI-integrated workplace. This should be a two-way conversation - industry will look to thought leaders in education for insights as well. Maintain an ongoing dialogue, as the pace of innovation requires continuous reassessment. There is no definitive end state.

 - Provide extensive professional development for educators on AI literacy and ethical usage principles. Equip them to teach with these tools responsibly and design effective learning experiences. We cannot teach what we do not adequately understand ourselves.

 - Create structured opportunities for transparent AI dialogues between diverse voices. Take a proactive approach to illuminate blindspots in how these tools are built and applied. Foster constructive discussion on mitigating unintended biases.

 - Rigorously evaluate how our diverse learning communities interact with and are impacted by AI systems. Seek to understand pain points and risks of marginalization or harm. Adapt teaching strategies to ensure these tools uplift and empower learners. The goal is human betterment through responsible AI integration.

 - Continuously evaluate learner readiness through assessments and feedback channels. Adapt teaching strategies regularly based on experience to date. Maintain an agile, responsive approach oriented toward incremental improvements over time.

I realize this call to action comes when our education system is still recovering and strained from the impacts of COVID. Discussing an AI literacy gap and solutions can feel overwhelming. And expanding access and training requires resources already stretched thin.

However, the pace of AI advancement is challenging our notions of human creativity and independent thought. This potential requires us to lean urgently into conversations on preparing learners to harness these tools responsibly. They are counting on us to equip them not just to adapt, but to actively shape an AI-empowered world with wisdom, care and purpose.

This is my response.
While online classes can save time and money for students, I believe that the disadvantages of online classes outweigh the merits. When people learn in person, students are able to interact with students and teachers which can lead to the development of their relationships. Because of this, students would be more likely to ask questions or have interesting discussions. They will be more comfortable to challenge themselves because of the relationship they have. However, in online classes, it is difficult to interact with others and get to know each other. Therefore, students would be reluctant to challenge themselves. Students would lose their opportunities to learn. In addition, hands-on activities are crucial for one's learning. Labs or other activities that require the presence of students would not likely happen on online courses. For these reasons, I believe that students lose opportunities to learn in online classes.

1aw40x7,1,2024-02-21,WIBTAH if I report a cheating capstone groupmate?,u/HoogityBoogityUnga,AITAH,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1aw40x7/wibtah_if_i_report_a_cheating_capstone_groupmate/,"I’m (25M) currently pursuing my MBA while working full time, and although I’ve had a few instances recently where I’ve missed deadlines due to conflicting priorities, I learned very early on in my undergrad program that if I don’t put in the extra effort in group work, no one else will either.

I’m currently in my final semester taking my business capstone, essentially focused on a major team based project with a competitive grading component. My school isn’t great, but this class has a reputation for brutality as groups generally go all out in the business analysis competition. (Great networking opportunity, free fancy dinner, etc)

As a result of this, I decided to team up with two good friends in the program whom I’ve worked with before. One (Mary) is a bit less reliable than me, but not by much, the other (Sue) is one of the smartest people I have ever met. Our Professor posted options for 3 or 4 person teams, and we filled one of the 3-person slots. Unfortunately, group sign ups were done in an unmoderated google sheets file, and 3-person sign ups used the same format as 4-person sign ups, but with one of the entry fields greyed out.

Unfortunately, an individual (Ellen) who had been extremely unreliable in a project group for a class I took last semester, cleared out the fourth cell and added her name. I wasn’t watching the sheet and edit history is locked, so I don’t know if she did this because other groups were already full, but I suspect that she saw my name and selected the group despite the greyed out field. We did pretty well on that project, and although I certainly wasn’t the only reason that happened, I am a naturally fairly loud and outgoing person who likes to take charge in group dynamics, and like to think the work I produce is decently high in quality.

I’m somewhat anxious about how this semester will play out. Ellen has already missed two of our weekly meetings, and in the first meeting we had, she made a few pretty uncomfortable “jokes” about how tempted she’s been to cheat, citing senioritis/burnout. (Conversation had been focused on excitement about being close to graduation/making plans for commencement) So far we’ve really only submitted two minor assignments, each about 2-3 pages of spaced out writing, basic preliminary analysis and planning. We work out of google docs which has a pretty robust history log, and as a result of that I’ve seen pretty suspicious behavior coming from Ellen’s workflow/process.

Specifically, she pastes in 4-5 sentence paragraphs and then makes changes to wording/sentence structure. This means she either:

A) makes rough drafts in a separate window and then revises them in the shared documents. 

B) is plagiarizing the contents of business reports that I have not been able to locate. 

C) is using ChatGPT or a different chatbot.

My school takes cheating extremely seriously. My undergrad program expelled/placed on probation about a fifth of its entire student body in 2020/21 due to cheating on online exams and the entire uni has been cracking down hard on ChatGPT usage. Two groups in one of my classes last semester were forced to take remedial classes in the winter due to ChatGPT usage. 

I’m very worried that the longer we wait to report Ellen the higher the chance that we will be caught in the crackdown if her behavior is caught. I’ve expressed this to Sue and she agreed, but didn’t want to proceed without solid evidence, as worst case for Ellen she could be placed on probation for something she didn’t do, worst case for us she realizes what we did and works to undermine the group and/or fully checks out. I haven’t run this by Mary yet, although knowing her I’m sure she’d be on the same page as me. My argument centers on the idea that without an explicit admission of guilt I sincerely doubt we’ll get any solid proof.

I don’t know i thought i like computers so why not lol 

I wasnt very much focused on coding i heavily relied on ChatGPT now  realize how much effect it had on me so i ditched Chatgpt started googling things the old fashioned way and i picked a simple javascript program to code 

Today is : Tuesday.
Current time is : 10 PM : 30 : 38

This was what needed to be outputted in thought this was simple 

So i just did it with a if else >=12 ? Am:pm 

Little did i know the answer was different with 

var prepand = (hour >= 12) ? "" PM "" : "" AM "";

 
if (hour === 0 && prepand === ' PM ') {
    if (minute === 0 && second === 0) {
        hour = 12;
        prepand = ' Noon';
    } else {
        hour = 12;
        prepand = ' PM';
    }
}

I was very confused with this syntax like how prepand is  getting assigneed noon and on the other hand midnight 

Took me like three hours to understand this but i still dont think i can code it without looking at something esp with the es6 syntax

Learning this took me this much time it was even categorized easy i don’t think this is a problem with syntax only i have a problem with how i approach the problem how can i be better how to think and understand a problem better is there’s any resources to become better ? Or is it just inherit skill i certainly understand i lack a lot but i don’t want to give up i have came some point so i just want to try my best and if not for me give up least knowing that i tried

Hi there, really simple one here. 

I’m a student at a business school with a diverse cohort. 

I study this class where the group task to submit a technical presentation and paper is 50% of our grade. It is a task for 6 people. 

We’ve submitted the paper and our live presentation is next Thursday, we were also required to record a demo recording and submit this too. 

The task has been frankly horrific. I am the only one who can write English with any real analytical depth. There is one member who can speak fluent English but I could not converse with the other 4 members over zoom. 

Hence I completed or re-written the entire presentation and paper (2000+ words), my peers used ChatGPT to write their points. We would fail if we submitted their work. It wasn’t just grammar it was also extremely poor content.

For example section 3 was about the risk profile of the investors strategy and their points were just about the investor in general. No data, no references, all ai generated. It would fail. 

This extended to the presentation, their slides were not professional at all, irrelevant pictures, copied lines from the paper, zero context. I had to rehaul the entire thing costing me days in a very busy schedule. 

When it came to practicing the presentation, we get marks for natural flow, engaging the audience and articulating the content well. All group members who struggled with English read out scripts they had preprepared in a monotone voice one after another. 

I tried to give advice and tell them how to introduce topics to make it more natural but they just didn’t understand me and kept to their script (costing the entire group marks).

I understand I can’t teach people English, and understand this isn’t what the course is assessing us on. So I wrote to the lecturer informing her of the lack of ability in my group and how it had cost me days of work. 

I also stressed concern for the live presentation, stating I felt it was unfair I will be penalised for being in a group who is not able to present or speak in English at a professional capacity, something the course doesn’t teach yet we are critiqued on. I said my group simply does not have the ability to complete her assignment. 

Now I wonder, who am I to tell her these people don’t have the ability to complete her assignment? Surely as a lecturer she sees this type of ability every year? 

I showed the email to my non-native English speaking friend who thought I might of been a bit harsh, but the monumental effort this has caused me I feel justified to speak out. 

Would be interesting to hear some thoughts happy to share specifics. ",User_deleted,1

Male, 23, attending a Cal State in California. Its class Expository Reading and Writing in Grades K-8. Its mainly about teaching, lesson planning, and expository reading. I emailed her during the semester for assistance on an assignment (this was an online class), but never got an email back. I then tried to call the number she provided on the syllabus three times, I even left a message but she never responded. I had a meeting with my school advisor over an unrelated issue but while I was with her I asked her if she could please reach out to the Professor for me. During our next session, the advisor told me she was not able to get a response from the Professor. To make matters worse, the Professor required that we submit all of our assignments at once the final week of the semester. This meant that we could not be graded throughout the semester or know if we were passing or failing the class. In the end, everyone in the class besides me and one other student received an A, while we received an F. I did every single assignment, followed each bit of instruction down to the word. 

She said she would not be posting grades, but if we wanted to receive our grade then to message her - which I did. I never heard back from her. This was during the Fall semester, I only discovered my grade in January via my transcripts. It was an F. I went back to some of my assignments to find comments on them. For one of my lesson plans I made myself and spent weeks making, she commented, ""Not your work sir."" When I asked her what that meant she meant and she responded on January 29th that there was a high likelihood that this was ""not my work,” but by then, she had already failed my course. By January 29, she .was going to check to see the likelihood and never got back to me. I feel she didn’t  
even know she hadn’t graded most or all of my assignments because she asked me what my grades were. To make matters worse only two of my assignments appeared as graded. SHe provided no proof of me plagiarizing.

We were asked to use ChatGPT on an assignment, a research paper using ChatGPT as the only source. She posted the link for ChatGPT on Google Classroom, she taught us how to use it and everything. I only used it for the required assignment she asked us to use it. Of course for that assignment she commented, ""You cannot use AI."" What the heck!? You told us to!? Again no proof of me cheating.

Today I had an appointment with her and OMBUS, my first time communicating with her live over a Zoom meeting. 

&#x200B;

I figured the grade was from those two assignments, let her realize they're legit then the whole issue is resolved. She said that EVERY assignment I did was wrong. EVERY. ONE. We only had time to go over notes we had to submit, a video and script we were supposed to make, and commented on my lesson plan.  She claims my notes were accused of being unsatisfactory, even though the Professor provided no grading rubric or examples of what content the notes should contain, or how to format them (e.g., in complete sentences, in paragraphs, including our own perspectives or tying into how we resonate with the material, etc.). I took my notes in bullet point format, she claims I should have done it in paragraph format. The point of notes are that they are simple and concise for the student's understanding to refer to them throughout the semester, and again, no rubric or guidelines provided!

  
My video was accused of being low quality, low effort, thrown together with friends (subjective, but most likely I have no evidence to prove this statement false). My video was accused of not including historical photographs which could be used to present students an assignment regarding Bakersfield's past, as well as be used to form an expository text, assignment, or narrative that could be presented with students. My video did in fact include photographs, and my photos could indeed tie into Expository Writing, not to mention that this level of detail was not specified in the assignment. I even turned Share Screen on and showed the video to her and the OMBUS person. 

  
She also claimed I failed to include a script, though I did include a script. The instructions told us to include a script/transcript; the slash (/) implies to select one or the other (or so I assumed, but still stand by!), the instructions do not tell us to feature both, nor does it say to feature a script AND a transcript

  
The Professor never taught us how to make a script or a transcript in the first place. No grading rubric was provided for the final assignment and script, nor for any assignment in the class. The Professor mentioned that for the Midterm she never looked at anyone's midterms, she claimed she gave everyone an A regardless of their content, even if all they included was their name - I feel this violates the concept of fair grading and practice as a Professor, as any Professor could simply give any student or group of students an A or the opposite, an F on an assignment without even viewing it for themselves.

  
Then she began comparing my work to that of another student's, which felt unfair considering we were without a guideline rubric. Felt very unnecessary and rather condescending and unfair, especially when no rubric was provided to instruct otherwise, especially after what seemed like freedom with the assignment to do as we pleased. Again, the purpose of notes are that they written in a simple, concise manner for the sake of students being able to reread and analyze them for themselves, not to be structured in paragraphs and made for the Professor's reading pleasure unless specified otherwise.

   
Tldr and question: Professor accused me of plagiarism on two assignments without proof, claims I failed every assignment, even though I followed all her instructions and did everything, only to be rewarded with an F after the semester ended (she had us submit every assignment at once a few days prior to the end of the semester). I'm finally taking this up to a committee level.

I want to know what else I could and should do to prove her wrong, especially for the next step of going before a committee. Thanks in advance fellow Redditors!

Finally finished the Bachelor of Science, Information Technology program.

&#x200B;

I enrolled in 10/2023, and officially finished in 02/2024. So 4 months/1 term.

&#x200B;

HOWEVER, I did transfer in certifications I already had prior to enrolling, and did Sophie/Study.com (SDC). The certs took 1.5 years, Sophie/SDC took 2 months each, and WGU took 4 months. So realistically, 2 years of non-stop studying. Total CUs transferred: 82/121 (67.77%). I have no idea if taking the certs in school would have changed how long it took overall instead of outside, but knowing me, I could've been faster with it. Outside of school, there was nothing pressuring me to go fast so I took my sweet time with the certs.

&#x200B;

I paid for the certifications out of pocket in hopes I can in help desk, get experience, and move up. Hoping to move into a sysadmin role soon. 

&#x200B;

If you have not enrolled in school yet, consider obtaining the certs and transfer it in. I won't go into great detail about this as I already made a post about it here: [https://old.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/18zccgy/i\_would\_like\_to\_give\_my\_2\_cents\_about\_obtaining/](https://old.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/18zccgy/i_would_like_to_give_my_2_cents_about_obtaining/) This is completely optional and up to you. If you look at this and think ""This is stupid"", or ""I can get certified really fast, there's no need to do this"", good chance this route is NOT for you.

&#x200B;

Another option is prior to enrolling, pre-study any certifications you will have to do. This will drastically cut down on the amount of time it'll take you to study before testing. If you're able to, study for 3 certs at a time. If not, then try to do 1-2 certs.

&#x200B;

One more thing: Consider checking out this post: [https://old.reddit.com/r/studydotcom/comments/vbgx86/wgu\_bs\_it\_efficiently\_maximizing\_transfer\_credits/](https://old.reddit.com/r/studydotcom/comments/vbgx86/wgu_bs_it_efficiently_maximizing_transfer_credits/)

This is the very same guide I used to determine what classes to do at Sophie/SDC, but I did make some deviations for one reason or another.

&#x200B;

I will go over all resources I used for the certs and WGU classes, as well as go over the classes I did at Sophie and SDC that successfully transferred in. Sophie and SDC (except SDCs final exam) are open book so I won't go over tips and advice on them, with the exception of a class or 2. Do note that some things may be subject to change and the classes I did may no longer apply, so double check what classes can transfer in.

&#x200B;

\-------------------------------------------------------------

**CERTIFICATIONS**

&#x200B;

1: A+ Core 1 / Transfer, Self / 3months / Professor Messer's study notes.

It mostly goes over the hardware aspect. If you built PCs before, this one should be a no brainer. I barely used study resources on this and only used Professor Messers study notes to just touch up on topics I just simply needed to know for the exam. Consider using Professor Messers study notes, video study guide, and Jason Dions practice exams here. KEEP THIS IN MIND: Professor Messers videos are on YouTube for free, but his study notes are $20 on his personal website. Jason Dions content is on Udemy, and all WGU students has access to Udemy for free.

&#x200B;

2: A+ Core 2 / Transfer, Self / 3months / Messer's study notes & practice exams, Dions PBQ videos ONLY & practice exams.

This is the only exam I failed, and it was because some of the CLI questions and PBQs got me good, leaving me a couple of points below the passing line. My experience is with the 1001 series of A+, and we're currently on 1101 series. I don't know different it is but I would assume it's not far off. 

I originally only used Messers study notes, but after failing, I picked up his practice exams. Dions practice exams are great as well. Aside from using Dions videos only about the PBQs, I never use his video study guide and only use his practice exams. They are really good at gauging your knowledge of the exam. If you can consistently pass all his practice exams, you can pass his exam.

&#x200B;

3: Net+ / Transfer, Self / 6months / Messer's videos, Dions practice exams.

Not going to sugarcoat it, unless you have experience with networking, this will be the hardest cert you'll do in the program, by far. It may actually be the hardest CLASS you may do, even harder than Web Development Applications or Data Management Applications. Possibly. It took me 6 months of on and off studying. Only reason it took me this long was because I was studying for a version of the exam that was sunsetting soon, and then decided to get the newer version instead. So I started my studying over. This is also the ONLY time I used Messers videos on Net+ because his study notes wasn't doing it for me, but I used his study notes together with his videos to understand the material. After the initial studying was done, I used Dions practice exams only. His practice exams are absolutely key in gauging where you are at. Also, this is the only cert Messer does NOT have practice exams on. It has been a while since I did the cert, but one thing I can guarantee you: you probably do not need to know how to subnet as much as people say you do. It is useful, it is beneficial, but I do not think when I took the exam that I had a single subnetting question. With that said, practice subnetting anyways. I use this from time to time and its actually pretty fun: [https://subnetipv4.com/](https://subnetipv4.com/)

&#x200B;

4: Sec+ / Transfer, Self / 2months / Messer's study notes & practice exams, Dions practice exams.

After Net+, this one was a breath of fresh air. It's mostly a vocab and memorization test. I physically wrote flashcards to help drive the content home. A lot of the Net+ content translates extremely well into Sec+, like about 30-40% of it does.

&#x200B;

5: LPI Linux Essentials / Transfer, Self / 1week / Dions videos

Relatively easy cert to have a basic understanding of Linux. I THINK Dion has this class on Udemy but I'm not sure.

&#x200B;

6: ITIL / WGU / 3 months / Dions video, study guide, cheat sheet, & Zindiaks ITIL 4 phone app.

This does NOT have to be 3 months. It was only 3 months as I pre-studied this exam prior to enrollment. Day 2 of enrolling in school, I took the exam and scored high, which the instructor claims that's the highest he may have ever seen. 3 months is extreme overkill for a relatively simple cert, it may take you 2-4 weeks at most. I used Dions videos, used his study guide after the videos to brush up on topics I may have missed, and used his cram cheat sheet here and there. For the rest of the waiting period, I used the Zindiak app on Android and did each section individually until it was time to take the exam. If there is a section of the ITIL you need to pay close attention to, it’s the ""7 Key ITIL practices"". Seriously. It makes up 17/40 questions you'll receive. Zindiaks mobile app has this section you can practice on over and over.

7: AWS CCP / WGU / 1month / Stephane Mareeks slides ONLY

Not a hard exam as its just purely a memorization game. Stephane Mareek is on Udemy. He has videos and slides. I don't like videos, so I just used his PDF slides. Mareeks goes over nearly or over 100 services used in AWS. A lot of these are distractors, and I believe Mareek will notify you as such. Pay close attention to the super common services like S3, EC2, and Lambda. Those are big ones. Pay close attention to AWS vs Customer responsibilities. Some of who's responsible for what is pretty common sense if you think about it (like for example, no shot in hell a customer is responsible for the physical infrastructure of the cloud lol), and pay extra close attention to Spot/On Demand/Reserved/Dedicated Instances. There are keyphrases associated with it, like for instance Spot Instances can be interrupted, Reserved Instances is typically 1 or 3 years of usage, and On Demand is for random times of the days.

**SOPHIE TRANSFERS**

&#x200B;

All classes from this point forward is Sophie classes. I do not have a lot to say about this as Sophie is completely open book, therefore you need to use the material provided to you to pass the class. There will be exceptions and I'll make a note on some classes. Even while working full time, I made sure I squeezed in as much time as possible to get all of these classes done in 1 month. Also, keep in mind that if an evaluator is grading your written papers, you are allowed to take another class, which is why although adding up all these days show over a month, they overlapped due to the papers being graded and I was doing another class. The max number of classes you can enroll is 2, but if both of those classes are being graded, hit up Sophie customer support. They'll make an exception, guaranteed.

&#x200B;

I'll list the WGU class name and have the Sophie class & ID in parenthesis. And time it took. TIP: Search for Sophie disc.ount codes, as it'll give you $20 dollars of your first month. If you manage your time right, in a single month for $80, you can knock out all classes you need to do.

**STUDY.COM/SDC**

&#x200B;

From here, I list all the [Study.com](https://Study.com) classes I have done. I only did 4 classes, and these were the remainder classes I couldn't do at Sophie. I do not know how long it took me as it doesn't say on [study.com](https://study.com) for some reason so I'm just going to say they took a week each. Before you even begin using SDC, find a disc.ount code to get 30% off your first month. Trust me, you're going to need it. Its $235 for the College Saver plan, and with this subscription, you're only given 2 exams to take. If you want to take an additional exam, it'll cost you $76 each. The max number of exams you can take in a single month is 5. If doing 5 classes without the coupon: $235 + $76 + $76 + $76 = $463.00. It's really pricy and it is up to the individual if it is worth paying up a couple of hundred for some classes at SDC. For me, it was worth it just for Data Management Applications. The other 3 classes are bonuses. I feel even more validated by the amount of horror stories I heard about using ZYBOOKS. I went with it as I believe it'll save me money in the long run. I only needed to do 4 classes and I used the coupon, so it only costed me $300 for the entire single month to get these 4 classes out of the way.

&#x200B;

Important information: All SDC classes has a total possible of 300 points. 300 points = 100%. You need to score 210/300 points, or 70% at the end to pass the class and get credit. Some classes has 3 modules: Quizzes, Written Assessments, and Final Exam. Some classes has 2 modules: Quizzes, and Final Exam. Quizzes and Written Assessments are non-proctored. Final Exams are proctored. If it contains 3 modules, it will be split into 100 points each. If it has 2 modules, it will be split into 150 points each. Quizzes are extremely easy to do and you should be, on average, getting 98-100 points on it. As long as you follow the rubric to the T, you should be also getting 100 points on it as well. Not much to say about final exams. You get a set amount of questions, and however many you get right and wrong will factor into the total possible amount of points you can get for the Final Exam module.

&#x200B;

Let's say hypothetically in a perfect world you get 100 points on the Quizzes, and 100 points on the written assessment. You're now at 200/300 points, or 66.6%. THEORETICALLY, on the final exam, if you scored a 10/100 or 10%, you will now have a total of 210/300 points, or 70% which is just barely enough to pass the class. 

&#x200B;

Now, that's just the best case scenario. Let's take a realistic scenario.

&#x200B;

You score 97/100 points on the quiz. You score 80/100 points on the Written Assessment. That is 177/300 so far. That means on the final exam, you need to score a 33/100 to get the minimum of 210/300 or 70% to pass the class. I think so long as you put in the effort to score high on the exams and written assessment, you can take it easy on the final exam. With that said, You should still make the effort to pay attention and learn the material. But if you want statistics, here it is.

&#x200B;

Because of this model, I made an effort to avoid classes that only has 2 modules, because that will mean that, assuming I scored 150/150 points on the Quizzes, I would need to score 60/150 or 40% points minimum on the final exam to pass. 60/150 points is still generous but nowhere near the 3 modules model. I wanted to take the American Politics class at SDC, but it had 2 modules so I did it at Sophie. I also wanted to take Business 107 over at SDC to satisfy the ""Organizational Behavior and Leadership"" class at WGU, but it also has 2 modules, so I opted for Business 307 instead.

&#x200B;

23: Technical Communication (English 305 (SDCM-0058))

24: Data Management - Applications (Computer Science 204 (SDCM-0218))

25: Information Systems Management (Business 303 (SDCM-0123))

26: Organizational Behavior and Leadership (Business 307 (SDCM-0053))

&#x200B;

\-------------------------------------------------------------

**WGU**

&#x200B;

The rest are at WGU and my thoughts of them. Global tip: If the class has an Objective Assessment (OA), do yourself a favor and take the Pre-Assessment (PA) immediately. Do not worry if you pass it or fail it, all that matters is how much you already know. If you are in the mostly Competent range to Exemplary, it may not hurt to just simply take the OA immediately. Who knows, you may pass the OA and be done with it. If you fail the PA, that's ok. But DO NOT look at the answers. If you do, you'll just simply remember what's on there. PA's usually only has 1 version of the test, while the OA's have possibly 2-3 different kinds of tests. Another global tip: If the class is a Performance Assessment where you have to write out papers or write out a project, do yourself a favor and invest in Grammarly Premium. Student Disc.ounts is a thing as well. You WILL have your paper sent back to you for any grammar mistakes. Using Grammarly is perfectly legal.

&#x200B;

27: Emerging Technologies - The only difficult part of this class is its requirement of picking a technology that is LESS than 4 years ago. That severely limits your options. I used Microsoft/Azure Sentinel because at the time, it was considered 4 years and 2 months old. Evaluators still accepted it anyways, so they may be lenient about it if it’s a few months older after 4 years. After that, I cannot guarantee that they'll allow it. If you find a tech and its 4 years - 4.5 years old, contact your instructor and confirm with him that it is acceptable. Nothing worse than to spend all that time working on it, only to have it sent back because it's too old. I've seen some posts where this is the case. Do remember that when looking up a tech, it's not strictly a brand new, never before seen tech within the last 4 years. It can be a tech that has always existed but it’s a new software or service put out by a company that's been around for a while. Or hell, maybe just use ChatGPT as an example. If you're able to find a tech, it is relatively easy to make a written paper on it. Be sure to use Grammarly here. Took me like a week.

&#x200B;

28/29: English Composition 1/2 - Both are not very hard classes, but if there is one advice I can give to not only this class but to other rubric heavy classes: do exactly what the rubric wants you to do. If it says cite 67 sources, you cite exactly 67 sources. Not 1 source more, and not one source less. Once you're done, check and make sure you have followed the rubric again. They're not playing around with this. Be sure to use Grammarly here. Both has taken me a week altogether. 

&#x200B;

30: Spreadsheets - Actually a fun class. There are some functions I still remember and use to this day from this class and I don't use Excel all that much. With that said, the PA is pretty much the exact same as the OA, but with different numbers and names. There is a certain video floating around that covers the entire PA with answers. I won't link it, and I don't even know where its at but googling it is not hard. I do urge you to just not blindly follow it for an easy pass, but definitely absorb some of the information. You never know when you'll need to make a pivot table at your workplace. ;) Took me 2 weeks to pass.

&#x200B;

31: Ethics in Technology - The ONLY WGU class I failed once. If you never worked in management in the tech industry, its oddly difficult. But I passed comfortably on the second round. You are instructed to use the textbook to read the material. Honestly, screw that. It is 400 pages long and you're probably going to bore yourself out using the textbook. Use the summary pdf that is either given to you by your instructor or is in the tips page on the course page. I literally only used the summary to help me pass it.

https://srm--c.vf.force.com/apex/CourseArticle?id=kA03x0000011e7wCAA

Here it's just called D333 Study Notes. It has everything you need to know condensed into several pages. I only used this to pass.

&#x200B;

32: Finite Mathematics - a 3/10 difficulty class. Even the most mathematically challenged folks will pass this with relative ease. Its really mostly logic based. For example, you're given a triple venn diagram and you are asked how many items are in such and such location. The only ones that really got me are ""Truth Tables"" and determining what kind of numbers are what (Real, Whole, Rational, Irrational, Integer, etc). I just spent an afternoon on Youtube looking up these things.

If you take the PA of it, you'll see exactly what I mean. Took 1 week. Could take you far less, but I had the time and wanted to be sure.

&#x200B;

33: User Interface Design - In this one, you learn about the importance of the User Interface / User Experience (UI/UX). You're given the option to use either HTML or a PowerPoint. Unless you're really good at HTML, do yourself a favor and use PowerPoint. On PowerPoint, you're just using slides in place of web pages. This is probably the one class you must pay extra attention to the rubric. Seen too many people get their papers sent back due to the lack of ""breadcrumbs"" on their project. Be sure to use Grammarly here.

&#x200B;

34: Capstone - The difficulty of this class is entirely dependent on if you have ever done an IT Project before. If you have done a project, whether it's for work or personal, USE IT. It will save you so much time as far as research goes. My personal project was utilizing Bandwidth Management using TPLink hardware and a Omada SDN solution at home since unmanaged bandwidth choked our slow internet harshly, so the topic naturally came to me. Now, if you never done one, then it can be a bit hard. I recommend looking at some of the smaller projects some folks has done to their home, and go with that. Here are some examples I could give: setting up a guest network, setting up a captive portal, bandwidth control, setting up SIEM, setting up a mesh network. Grammarly is KING here.

&#x200B;

35: Web Development Applications - Somehow, I did better on the OA than the PA. This class is a mile wide, 2 inches deep. I won't go deep into as I already made a post here: [https://old.reddit.com/r/WGUIT/comments/1aonubh/not\_only\_did\_i\_pass\_c777\_web\_development/](https://old.reddit.com/r/WGUIT/comments/1aonubh/not_only_did_i_pass_c777_web_development/)

&#x200B;

The ONLY class it seems I have completely skipped is Network and Security - Foundations, as transferring in Net+/Sec+ can make you skip this class, therefore I did not need to do it. I have no advice for this one, sadly. Your best bet is to search up this subreddit to find more information about it.

&#x200B;

Hopefully this serves as a guide for those looking to get into BSIT months from now, as well as currently enrolled folks that wants advice on a class I took in school. Good luck. EDIT: Tagging u/YLB22 u/Thailyer1213",User_deleted,48
1b1ctne,168,2024-02-27,Cheating...?,u/mogumogu7282,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1b1ctne/cheating/,"Saw TWO posts about cheating, one from a teacher and one from a student. This leads to a discussion which I'm really curious about. Is the future..fucked?

 I mean, when i cheated in class, that would be in primary school, and at that time i stopped after primary 3, but now in secondary school, people use chat gpt, alot. Not even in homeworks and stuff but in project works and such. This could be essay writing for example, or them using stuff like photomath to pass through all the answers.

 I mean, this really strikes up the conversation of people copying off of other peoples works, which i did in the past, as a student, or doing peoples work for them, which is what i did due to people threatening me to do so. But it really does bring up the question of the future. Because seeing the post from the teacher makes my heart ache man. 

I don't, hate cheaters, I can't comment on them because I don't know why they cheat or how they cheated, but with this whole AI thing going around in school from photomath, to chatgpt, to even AI art which a student tried to pass as their own in art lesson, I can't help but be abit worried for our future. Schools already know this is an issue but it's, really hard to keep track of it, especially since chatgpt checkers are inaccurate, or how some work may look like it is done by an AI, but it really isnt, or how when two people copy each other, they may have the same answer coincidentally. All of these factors really take into mind on stuff. But still, future is kinda fucked....for students and after they graduate ",active,171

I used to cram the slides at most 3 days before the exam and then I would get a mediocre grade and swiftly forget what I had crammed a week later.

Now I am studying months in advance, almost always read and study what I need to know of something before its lecture is taught, and I constantly review what I study over the course of like 16 weeks, throughout the whole semester, rather than cramming the night before an exam.

The way I study changed too. I used to write notes by hand and stuff but now I can't do that fast enough for such a comprehensive study. Now, I use Microsoft Office (Word) to take notes (I write fast on the keyboard) and instead of reading over the slides and re-reading them, now I diversify my studying:

1. I buy the slides' reference textbook and read the whole chapter and create active recall questions.
2. I use numerous other textbooks to get a different perspective on the specific fact or to learn prerequisite knowledge I forgot (for example, studying CNS Pharmacology, I forgot CNS physiology, so I picked up my physiology textbook and read the CNS chapter to refresh my knowledge of the topic).
3. I use ChatGPT and prompt it to create active recall questions, flashcards, explanations and other things that I double check.
4. I create study guides.
5. I use Anki to recall key information over the course of days, weeks, months, years...

Is this the way it should be done? Or am I going overboard?",active,3
1b2u24h,12,2024-02-29,PASSED: 2015 Graduate. No Qbank Used. Detailed write-up,u/vishvicenta1,step1,https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/1b2u24h/passed_2015_graduate_no_qbank_used_detailed/,"  

This will be a detailed breakdown of my USMLE Step 1 Journey. So, sit back, relax as you scroll

**STUDY PERIOD**: 9 Months on & off

**DEDICATED**: 2 weeks

**Background**: I’m a 2015 graduate from a medical school in India. At the time, around 2016, I was preparing for the USMLE Step 1 exam but in the midst of my preparation, few family things came up and I quit my preparation as I was expected to stay back here. I accepted it and with whatever step 1 preparation I did, I wrote the Residency entrance exam of my home country and got into Pathology residency which I finished in 2020. During my residency, I’d encourage undergrad students to take up USMLE and give them a brief idea of how to study for the exam and when they did well, it was like watching my dream through them. After my residency, I took up a job as an Asst. professor of Pathology at a med school. 

Things changed over the next few years but my dream didn’t die. I still wanted to pursue my US journey. So, I started preparing around the month of May in 2023. Now that I’m older and hopefully wiser, I wanted to see what works best for me in the preparation and avoid mistakes I may have done in the post. Quitting my job for the preparation wasn’t an option. So, I was working and studying in whatever time I could possibly get. 

**RESOURCES USED**:

1. **PATHOMA** : I barely touched this resource for this preparation. Now, you might be wondering why I put it as my first resource if I barely touched it in the last year. Well, I discovered Pathoma in 2016 and my life changed. In a way, Pathoma is internalised in my brain. Pathology was the only subject which kept me sane in med-school and when I found Pathoma, my love for Pathology grew many folds and reinforced my decision to choose Pathology as my future. Dr. Sattar will always have a special place in my heart. I remember watching one of his non-pathology videos on Youtube where he tells a story about a religious teacher who was explaining complex things and made them into bits of simple digestible matter and from that point on everything started clicking for Dr. Sattar and he understood how to teach. Even though, Dr. Sattar and I differ in our religious beliefs, I feel the same about Dr. Sattar. He’s the one who opened opened the door to my understanding of Medicine as a whole and I will forever be grateful to the man. When I teach classes in my med school, there is no bigger happiness than watching the student’s faces glow up when they understand a complex topic and start connecting the dots.  

2. **ANKI**: Before my preparation, I had one goal. I should minimize what I forget since USMLE Step 1 is a lot of facts. So, I chose Anki to do that job of spaced repetition for me. I have used Anki before for stuff like Geography and Language learning but not medicine. I initially created my own cards while I was going through the systems but switched to ANKING (Zanki) Decks which made my life easier. I’d recommend people to understand aspects of Anki and things like “**Suspending/Unsuspending Cards”,** **“Tags”** etc. You could format in such a way that you could do a Boards & Beyond video and unlock only the cards corresponding to that video you just watched. Since, Anking deck is all First aid based, you’ll be finishing the relevant part of Step 1 as you finish each video. I averaged about 400 cards each day for the last 10 months with some days as high as 1500 reviews. 

3. **BOARDS & BEYOND**: This was my major resource. I did all the organ systems except Neuro from B&B and doing the corresponding Anki Deck and it was Gold. Dr. Ryan, sometimes may feel a bit monotonous, but, if you can get through the videos and learn the concepts well there’s no better resource. Dr. Ryan deserves a lot of credit for making such a comprehensive resource to get through the enormous First Aid. 

4. **KAPLAN 2014 LIVE LECTURES NEURO**: I only did Neuro of Kaplan 2014 Live lectures. Found these videos on the web. My weakest subject is Neuro, since I’m in Pathology and rarely ever see any examination etc of Neuro Cases. So, I wanted to take it slow and understand every little thing well. The Anking Neur Deck was based off Kaplan textbook and so, it was perfect for my prep. Dr. White is a great teacher and get’s the job done. After I finished the videos and deck, I started feeling that Neuro was one of my strong subjects

5. **SKETCHY MICRO & PHARM**: Easily the most valuable resource out there. I did about 1-2 videos every day while using Anki and keeping up with the reviews. I’ve seen people complain about Sketchy Pharm being too big but trust me, it WORKS..! I struggled too and it would take me atleast 2-3 passes of Anki until I got all the information and it was GOLD after that. My favorite routine of the day was doing Sketchy’s Anki.

6. **PIXORIZE BIOCHEM**: Like, Sketchy Pixorize is great too. I memorised all the biochemical pathways in 3-4 days and biochem was my strongest subject on the NBMEs. So, I will say Pixorize works especially for the Vitamins and Biochemical Pathways. I have seen people praising Pixorize for Immuno as well. I used Pixorize with Adyumdweller Anki Deck and it worked perfectly.

7. **Randy Neil Biostatistics**: Biostatistics were the last thing I studied and I did Youtube videos of Randy Neil and they were excellent. Takes a little time to get the hold of it. I would use ChatGPT in conjunction and ask it to frame some questions and explain me. 

I took 3 weeks from work in the first week of February. I haven’t done any QBANK at all. Everyone advised me to do the Qbank, but my thought was I need to learn the concepts and facts first and then I will go the Questions. My goal was to pass Step 1 ASAP with the time I get. With my knowledge of Pathology, I felt I could do it without the need of Q-bank. 

So, during the first week of my dedicated, I took NBME 27 online. Till this point, I was like a ship sailing on open seas not knowing if my preparation will help me reach the destination I planned. When I clicked the end, it showed 72% correct with 99% of passing. I was very happy that my goal was in sight. I was also able to finish the Qs in time, so, time was not an issue. So, I booked the exam date in another 10 days. Took NBME 31 and Free 120 on the same day, (3 days out) and score 77% and 75% respectively which greatly boosted my confidence. 

I wrote the exam on 13th of February. I went to bed at 8 PM only to realise I couldn’t sleep for the next 3 years. The nerves were definitely there. I dozed off around 11 PM and I got a good 6-hour sleep. 

On the day of the exam, everything went smoothly in Prometric. I see people here advising Protein bars etc for the exam to prevent sugar crash. But, I’d say take what works for you. I eat Rice based food for all my meals. So, I just went with some fried rice and just ate that. Only took 2 breaks each of 10 mins. Felt the exam was similar to NBME 31 and Free 120. Sometimes Vague but you can get to the answer. Got the P yesterday and I was overjoyed and I wanted to share my experience

**Final Thoughts**: I don’t advise quitting Q-banks. I think UWORLD and AMBOSS are great resources from what I hear but since Step 1 is just a pass/fail exam now and considering my background in Pathology, I felt, my time was better used on Anki and others. I’m writing this for the benefit specifically older graduates like me who may have a good understanding of the subject depending on which speciality they are in. 

I’m happy to answer any questions you might have. Afterall, most of the people in this sub are similar to my students at med school. I’m grateful for the wonderful students I’ve got to teach over the past few years who helped me learn so much more with the questions they asked. 

**TLDR**: 2015 graduate. Pathologist in home country.Used Anki (ANKING STEP 1) thoroughly with B&B, Sketchy (Micro & Pharm), Pixorize (Biochem), Kaplan 2014 Live Lectures (Neuro) and Randy Neil Biostats. No Q-Bank used.  NBME 27: 72% (10 days out), NBME 31: 77% (3 days Out) and Free 120: 75% (3 days out)

Be confident in your strengths and be aware of your weaknesses. Now, go Kill that exam and I’m gonna see you on the other side on r/Step2",User_deleted,14

I have research upon use of OpenAI detector using BERT and GPT 1.5B version, fine tuned it, and also combined it with T5 for question generation to make an application for teachers to evaluate AI plagiarism and generate questions for viva and assessment of students.

For the result section of my research paper, I’ve seen how far model detects ai text from gpt, Gemini, perplexityai too and put their scores of Human v AI. Are there any other parameters I should be thinking of and testing for?? Like ROUGE metrics or more!! If so please explain me and also send me any YouTube or Hugging Face link to see how I shall implement it in Google colab.

Thanks in advance.
