Gearing up for the next semester and wanna make a real difference, here’s the scoop from a fellow student who’s not lost his sanity (yet)  
  
**Know Your Why**: Studying without a goal is like wandering in the desert without water. Aim for that 4.0 GPA, or at least not falling asleep in lectures. Goals, people!

**Play Favorites**: All assignments aren’t created equal. Some are like gold, others like dust. Focus on the big fish that’ll boost your learning and grades. 🎯

**Tiny Bites**: Got a mammoth task? Slice it like pizza. More slices = more yum. Plan it out. You can't devour an XL pizza in one sitting, right? 🍕✂️

**Get Involved**: Don’t just read; chat, debate, or pretend you’re on a quiz show. Rubber duck method, baby. Teach someone, even if it’s your dog. 🦆

**Be the Clock’s BFF**: Pick study hours and stick to them like glue on glitter. Pomodoro technique is the secret sauce. ⏰🍅

**Brains Need TLC**: Sleep, snack smart, move a bit. Treat your brain like the royalty it is. 🛌🥑🏋️‍♂️

**Tech-Up**: Use tools like Perplexity, ChatGPT, [~Penseum~](https://www.penseum.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=post), etc., to pimp your study setup. 🚀📱

**Class Isn’t Just Attendance**: Show up, ask questions, act like Sherlock. 🕵️‍♂️🔍

**Study Squads**: Team up. Two heads (or more) are better than one and way more fun! 👯‍♂️

**Ask, Don’t Stash**: Stuck? Shout out. Professors, mates, the uni cat – someone knows the answer. 🙋‍♀️🐱

Remember, every setback’s just a setup for a comeback. Let’s crush this semester together! Hope this helps! 🎓🚀

Feel free to add your own tips and share the love. Let’s ace this! 💪💥",active,3
1ei6el6,1,2024-08-02,"Need some clarification in bringing my cats to Germany, specifically Pet Passport and Import Permit.",u/RAyLV,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1ei6el6/need_some_clarification_in_bringing_my_cats_to/,"I have been living here in NRW as a student. I am not living in a student dorm, and have already talked about a possibility of bringing my cats when I moved in, and they've assured that it's not a problem.

A bit of a background:    

I have [two cats](https://imgur.com/a/nqmEN1x) in Pakistan. I wasn't planning to bring them here when I moved in for my studies, mainly because they're also adored by my parents and were in a very loving environment. However, very recently, a newest member of the family, my nephew, arrived, and he started having breathing problems because of the cats. After getting second opinions from doctors, and discussing any other possible workarounds, it was decided that the cats needed to be moved out. I was devastated upon hearing this, I felt helpless as there wasn't much I can do while being so far away from them. 

We didn't have a lot of options, it was either to give the cats for adoption or give them to a shelter. No one was happy with these options. We still hesitantly went for the adoption route, and received no positive response. I understand that my cats were strays, and now they're 7 years old \[may develop health issues soon\], so it seemed that the chances of getting them adopted into a loving home is minimal. I don't want to put them in a shelter, I want to give them a good life. So now I am planning to bring them here with me.

Now:      
  
After reading up about bringing pets to Germany and traveling with pets, these are the requirements  I found that need to fulfilled before traveling/entering Germany, based on some reference: \[[reference1](https://www.simplegermany.com/moving-to-germany-with-pets/), [reference2](https://www.pettravel.com/immigration/Germany.cfm)\]

1. Microchip: ISO 11784/11785
2. Rabies Vaccination (after microchipping) (wait 30 days)
3. Documentation:
   1. Health Certificate (within 5 days of travel) 
   2. Pet Passport 
   3. Import Permit
4. Check requirements for the specific Airline (I am looking currently into Turkish Airlines)

  
I am already working on the first two as I have discussed these with my vet in Pakistan. I am more concerned about the point 3.2. Pet Passport, I learned about it when I contacted Turkish Airlines for information, they mentioned that it is required for the pet to enter Germany. I am not aware if Pet Passport can be issued in Pakistan, is there any possibility that I can issue a Pet Passport right here Germany even before the arrive? (I doubt it, but still wanted to ask). 

And I recently learned about the ""Import Permit"" - Point 3.3. from ChatGPT, but it mentions that it is optional. I couldn't find much about it right now except that is a document issued by Germany to grant permission for the pet to be imported.

  
Since I don't know or have any experience regarding this situation at all, any clarification, suggestions, or note on things that I am missing, would be really appreciated thank you! ",active,2

1eju9x1,78,2024-08-04,Less reading/requirements these days?,u/PatientSector583,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1eju9x1/less_readingrequirements_these_days/,"This is for all of you who teach English or other reading based courses. Compared to say, 20 years ago if you remember or can go back that far, do you think there is less reading now required in college courses? Aside from the tech factor, what are some of the biggest differences you notice between course requirements now and back then? 

I teach Math courses as an adjunct since I also have another job, but I love teaching on the side and have been doing this for more than 15 years. One thing I have noticed is that a lot of the teaching has gotten to the point (speaking only for Math as I do not know what's happening in other courses to compare) where there is rampant cheating. Students just plug in the problem on AI and even students who would normally get an F, are now getting perfect scores on hw assignments if they use some program like ALEKS or Cengage. I am growing frustrated with this because I have a feeling that more and more of this is becoming pointless....like why teach complex procedures if you can just plug it into Chatgpt and solve? Chatgpt is getting better and better at even pretty ""tough"" Math word problems, unfortunately. Anyway I digress...I'd be curious to read your thoughts. ",User_deleted,78
1ejx5qa,128,2024-08-04,WSJ:  There’s a Tool to Catch Students Cheating With ChatGPT. OpenAI Hasn’t Released It.,u/anxman,singularity,https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1ejx5qa/wsj_theres_a_tool_to_catch_students_cheating_with/,"[https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-tool-chatgpt-cheating-writing-135b755a](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-tool-chatgpt-cheating-writing-135b755a)

Hi folks, longtime lurker / never poster.  I felt like this would be important for this audience.  I realize it's behind a paywall so I'm hoping someone can help post a ""full"" article.  I'm going to quote some of the parts that stood out to me regarding AI safety:

---

""OpenAI has a method to reliably detect when someone uses ChatGPT to write an essay or research paper. The company hasn’t released it despite widespread concerns about students [using artificial intelligence to cheat](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/teachers-ai-classroom-schools-678d7d84?mod=article_inline)**.** 

The project has been mired in internal debate at OpenAI for roughly two years and has been ready to be released for about a year, according to people familiar with the matter and internal documents viewed by The Wall Street Journal. “It’s just a matter of pressing a button,” one of the people said.

In trying to decide what to do, OpenAI employees have wavered between the startup’s stated commitment to transparency and their desire [to attract and retain users](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/chatgpt-maker-goes-smaller-and-cheaper-with-new-ai-tech-0cbcff84?mod=article_inline). One survey the company conducted of loyal ChatGPT users found nearly a third would be turned off by the anticheating technology.

An OpenAI spokeswoman said the company is concerned the tool could disproportionately affect groups such as non-native English speakers. “The text watermarking method we’re developing is technically promising but has important risks we’re weighing while we research alternatives,” she said. “We believe the deliberate approach we’ve taken is necessary given the complexities involved and its likely impact on the broader ecosystem beyond OpenAI.”

Employees who support the tool’s release, including those who helped develop it, have said internally those arguments pale compared with the good such technology could do. ""

""ChatGPT is powered by an AI system that predicts what word or word fragment, known as a token, should come next in a sentence. The anticheating tool under discussion at OpenAI would slightly change how the tokens are selected. Those changes would leave a pattern called a watermark. 

The watermarks would be unnoticeable to the human eye but could be found with OpenAI’s detection technology. The detector provides a score of how likely the entire document or a portion of it was written by ChatGPT. 

The watermarks are 99.9% effective when enough new text is created by ChatGPT, according to the internal documents. ""

"" ... **OpenAI surveyed ChatGPT users and found 69% believe cheating detection technology would lead to false accusations of using AI. Nearly 30% said they would use ChatGPT less if it deployed watermarks and a rival didn’t.**

**A recurring internal concern has been that the anticheating tool could hurt the quality of ChatGPT’s writing. OpenAI conducted a test earlier this year that found watermarking didn’t impair ChatGPT’s performance, people familiar with the matter said.**

**“Our ability to defend our lack of text watermarking is weak now that we know it doesn’t degrade outputs,” employees involved in the testing concluded, according to the internal documents.** 

In early June, OpenAI senior employees and researchers met again to discuss the project. The group agreed the watermarking technology worked well, but the results of the ChatGPT user survey from last year still loomed large. Staffers said the company should look into other approaches that were potentially less controversial among users but unproven, according to people with knowledge of the meeting.

They also said OpenAI needed a plan by this fall to sway public opinion around AI transparency as well as potential new laws on the subject, the internal documents show. 

“Without this, we risk credibility as responsible actors,” a summary of the June meeting said.""",active,131
1ek7utr,2,2024-08-04,Teaching an App Development Course - Advice Needed,u/Brilliant-Thought864,AskProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/1ek7utr/teaching_an_app_development_course_advice_needed/,"Hi everyone. I have been building my Software agency (with only myself) and have gotten 2 clients so far. It is my primary school and my a local community Centre in milton. Essentially I specialize in building Mobile Apps for schools and community centers which helps them communicate with their members and send updates regarding events. However, since these were my first clients, I am not getting paid much (bascially doing it for free).

So ***I wanted to design a summer workshop where i teach people about App Development.*** No prior coding knowledge will be needed for this. And here are somethings I wanted to ask for help.

**1. What demographic should I focus on?** I was planning to target High School Students who can create these apps to put on their college applications or resumes. I was thinking of targeting University Students with a similar selling point. On the other hand, I was thinking of keeping it open to anyone who wants to experience building an app of their own. We will be using rapid code tools like FlutterFlow to give them an introduction of App Development.

**2. What would be a great project / app idea to build with beginners?** Essentially I was aiming to make the course project based. I want to teach them basics while helping them build an app that they can use. I was thinking of building like a Family App to make grocery list, plan events or put updates. But thought this might become complex. I was also thinking of maybe just building an app that wraps Gemini as an AI app based project. Essentially I want to make something valuable with the students so they can be proud of what they have made. I didn't want to do the To Do List app because there are tons of videos online about that. What would be some cool and simple apps that you'd like to build?

**3. How long should the entire course be?** I was planning to have synchronous classes live online. And was planning each class to be about 2 hrs. I was planning to make the course have 6 classes in total so (12hrs of teaching). Maybe the length of the course would also depend on the the project and demographic. But I want to finish the course within August.

**4. How much should I price the course?** The big question. I was planning to charge about $99/student. They would get 12 hrs of live lectures and have the opportunity to book extra QA sessions (like office hours) if they have any confusion with that price. Again, I want to help them build something of value and have fun.

**5. If I were to market the course, where would be greate spot?** Also what would be a great way to market the course? Flyers, or FB ads or something else?

**5 Anything else?** Is there anything else I must be careful of? I am new to designing a course and teaching it myself online, but I am well versed with App Development and public speaking. Is there any other input anyone has?

1el03u6,21,2024-08-05,Can chatGPT be a custom trained AI advisor for a course (details inside)?,u/Okumam,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1el03u6/can_chatgpt_be_a_custom_trained_ai_advisor_for_a/,"I teach college courses.  In each course, we have a bunch of course related material- learning resources, tips, guides, examples, warnings about common mistakes and so on.  It's not a lot of material (not like a book), but still a decent amount and highly relevant.

So the question is this:  would it be possible to ""train"" the AI on that material, then somehow share it with the students in that course, so that when a student has a question about some course content, the AI answers partially based on the source material that was shared?  Or, for example, when they have to do a discussion post, they ask the AI if it looks good, and the AI tells them that it fits or does not fit the guidelines/warnings/previous examples that were in the course materials.

So basically my question is in two parts: can the AI be trained to use those materials, and then can that be shared with the students somehow?  Is this what the customGPTs are?  Are they free to share afterwards?

I know there are things like google notebook and nvidia's chat that can train on your files, but I don't think they can be easily shared with others afterwards.  Can this be done with ChatGPT?  If it can, Will it require an investment by the school to be able to be shared with the students (It could be a trained AI shared for each course, or maybe a much larger, ""combined"" single AI that has all the courses in it)?",active,19

I'm a researcher working on large language models (LLMs) and techniques like fine-tuning to improve their performance on downstream tasks for non-computer science domain. While transformers have revolutionized NLP with their self-attention mechanisms, I find myself facing a different kind of attention challenge: effectively communicating these complex ML concepts to non-technical stakeholders, such as:

* Funding agencies and grant committees 
* Students in introductory AI/ML courses
* Business leaders and product managers

I'm looking for great examples of visualizations, animations, analogies, etc. that help explain things like:

* What LLMs are and how they work at a high-level
* The impact of fine-tuning on LLM performance 
* Improvements achieved by fine-tuning for specific applications

The goal is to create compelling materials for funding proposals, lectures, and other situations where I need to direct audience attention and convey the core concepts to those without ML expertise.

If you've come across any projects, blog posts, videos, or papers that do this well, please share them! I'd really appreciate learning from the examples and techniques others have developed. Links to repos with code for generating visualizations would also be fantastic.

Thanks in advance for any guidance and pointers! Let me know if any other details would be helpful.",active,7

I’m choosing what else to pursue, and I do genuinely have an interest in so many of these fields. My goal is to go to a top grad school for my masters and I’m leaning towards a Machine Learning focus. With that being said, here’ are my ideas:



**Just CS, graduate in 3 years**, at my current school money isn’t really an issue so don’t worry about that, my CS program and my specializiation covers various core topics, some low-level compilers and OS stuff, plus various Machine learning specialized topics.



**CS + Data sci/Math**, this would give me a bit of extra math background (although CS already has quite a bit) which may prove useful and look good for grad applications?, although I’ve also heard some cases of people not really having that background being completely fine since they must take those classes in grad school anyways.



**CS+Finance/Economics/Entrepeneurship**, my goal after working in a company as a Software or Machine Learning Engineer for some time is to start my own startup at some point, but realistically you don’t need a degree for that, still, would these help perhaps with showing I have more of an applicable interest or something for potential admissions reviews?



**CS + Robotics/mechanical Engineering/physics, etc**. this would have me learning a bit more of the hardware/low-level physical side of the field, which could be advantageous if I pursue more physical Machine Learning and software engineering roles related to these, but how would that look for grad school applications in particular having that reach?



**CS+linguistics**, to be honest most of the linguistics stuff is kind of unrelated to what I’d be doing in machine learning even with natural language processing and things like ChatGPT, but having that extra knowledge may prove useful for showing my interest in the field and at least make people thing that I’d be useful for having that reserve knowledge on standby for whatever reason while working on natural language processing. Thoughts on this for grad school applications?



**CS+leadership/project management**, this could be useful since many software engineers (SWEs) typically move into more of manager roles as they get into more senior positions. The thing is though it may have some benefits, most people don’t need this background to do that though but still, how would that affect grad school apps?



**CS+medical engineering branch**, this is similar to the CS+robotics point I made, except with a focus on medical tech. 



**CS+something creative like communications or creative writing** for the creativity and outreach aspect



**CS+full on biology or chemistry** similar to medical engineering but also showing my STEM commitment haha.



**CS+something really opposite it like African american studies, sociology, anthropology, history**. Technically there are applications like with mapping geospatial data and such which I could lean into, but would the quirkiness make it seem better as if I’m more well-rounded per se.



**CS+language like Chinese, Greek, etc**. not much use except that people may like having multilingual applicants to connect better with diverse teams and potential customers (don’t know how much my role would lead to me interacting with them though), grad schools might think I’m more well-rounded.



**CS+a politics/foreign policy branch**



**CS+Enviornmental science** (some use cases to appeal to for grad apps and they might like that broadness)



**CS+Geospatial sciences**, the more direct use-case version of CS+Sociology and related fields, although with CS+Sociology it could seem more like that I have the base knowledge in the two fields ready to combine rather than a shallow overview and combined version I get purely from the Geospatial.



**CS+education, or nutrition**, things I’m interested in but extremely unrelated to what I’d do, just to show off that i’m truly interested in life beyond comp sci and well-rounded per se though?



**CS+metereology**, similar to the above, except some peculiar use cases, perhaps this would be a good way to appeal my uniqueness to the grad admissions?

  






I do know things like projects, resumes, experience, extracurriculars, GPAs, GRE (for CS students does this matter, perhaps at top schools?) matter a lot more, but I still would like to know if these may make a difference

1emxq0t,1,2024-08-08,Does Sapling’s AI Detector Work?,u/gptgabe,stealthgpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stealthgpt/comments/1emxq0t/does_saplings_ai_detector_work/,"Read the Original Post here: [https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/does-sapling-s-ai-detector-work](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/does-sapling-s-ai-detector-work)

The world of AI writing requires two fields of knowledge: AI-generated text and AI detection tools. Having gushed over StealthGPT as the best AI in the undetectable space, I now have to put our tech to the test against today’s leading AI content detectors.

Today’s review is not for testing against one of those leading AI content detectors like Turnitin, though. It’s for the free version of [Sapling.AI](http://Sapling.AI), which is not just an AI content detector but an AI writing assistant too. So, if Sapling can't detect it, at least it can proofread your work with a grammar checker and autocomplete feature to boot.

# My Grading System

Since Detectors are used by professors and students, I'm going to use an academic model: A,B,C,D,F.

I'm also going to grade for three different categories: Functionality, User Experience, and Pricing. Once I arrive at a letter-grade for each, I'll take the average as the overall grade.

# A First Glance At Sapling AI

Reviewers and academics alike use free detectors when they need a quick fix to rule whether the text in question is legit. Let's see if this Sapling AI Detector fixes anything though.

Mmmmkay....First thing I notice is the rather plain and flat website. It gives me the impression the software is a bit janky but only a test run will tell. At the top, the site goes over the basics of AI writing and AI detection tools. Then scrolling down we see the instructions at the bottom:

What distinguishes Sapling.ai’s free version from the paid version seems to be character limits. The free version allows for only 2,000 characters, but if you sign up for a free trial, you can get the Pro Plan for 30 days. Here’s a screenshot of their pricing if you’re interested:

The pro plan also includes more advanced edits and autocomplete, which is basically proofreading software that autocompletes sentences and acts as a grammar checker. You have to input snippets and mappings for the software to handle the text to your liking which is a very complex process that seems to inhibit free writing for me, rather than enhance it.

The transparency of the site is refreshing though. They aren’t trying to hide that AI detectors come up with false positives and aren’t a perfect method to judge whether any text is AI-generated. Let's see if those warnings are there just to prepare you for their results.

Now that I’m in my account, having set up the free trial of their pro plan, the user interface doesn’t seem too friendly or convenient. I watched their tutorial about using their AI writing assistant, but have no direction where to find their AI detector from my account.

# Testing Against ChatGPT

Does ChatGPT’s language model have what it takes to write an essay that can bypass Sapling.AI?

At first, the AI detector tool didn’t make it clear if I could simply copy and paste my AI-generated text into the dialogue box. I gave it a go anyway, hoping I wouldn’t have to upload a file and it worked. Sadly, it still gave me an error. As you can see here:

So, off to upload our ChatGPT essay, we go:

Ladies and gentlemen, we got detected. 100% too! That’s pretty impressive. It may not be the most convenient interface but [Sapling.AI](http://Sapling.AI) gets points in basic functionality.

# Testing Against StealthGPT

First, let's humanize ChatGPT's text with StealthGPT’s AI Humanizer:

Now, lets try [Sapling.AI](http://Sapling.AI) against our Undetectable AI writing tool:

Damn, only 5.7% fake. [Sapling.AI](http://Sapling.AI) just got WRECKED! Unbelievable. I bet it doesn’t fair well against other undetectable AI writing tools either.

Here's text humanized Undetectable. AI in the first screenshot then in the 2nd screenshot, we see the outcome of that text going up against Sapling.AI:

Wow. 100% fake. I love Sapling.AI! If you're using Undetectableai, you might as well be using ChatGPT. Same result.

If you want to learn more about [How to Bypass AI Detectors](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/bypassing-ai-detectors-stealthgpt), our guide is essential reading.

# Testing Against Human Writing

Lastly, I want to test [Sapling.AI](http://Sapling.AI) against my own human writing. I swear if my text gets a higher fakeness score than StealthGPT’s I'm gonna send a scathing email.

Here’s a reading of my last blog post entitled [Can I Get Free Unlimited Undetectable AI?](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/can-i-get-free-unlimited-undetectable-ai) The answer to which is yes and I can guarantee our free version is has more functionality than Sapling.AI’s. Okay, here goes nothing:

Well, I guess I prefer an error to being called fake.

# Final Grade

Functionality: It was able to detect ChatGPT and Undetectable AI by 100%. On the other hand, I got error messages so frequently that after reading 'unexpected error. Contact support.' on the website numerous times, I just need to warn you, that you can expect errors. It also couldn't detect StealthGPT, so I'm going to give the functionality grade a C.

User Experience: The Website is flat and difficult to navigate. if you sign up for the pro plan you kinda have no idea what to do next from the account page. There isn't a tab or anything to use the detector, I had to go back and google it. F.

Price: Free version that allows a 5,000 character limit and a thirty-day free trial? That's pretty snazzy. I wouldn't use it myself but it's free so who cares if it does anything well? B!

**Overall Grade: C-**

# Conclusion

Does [Sapling.AI](http://Sapling.AI) work? Eh, kinda. The user interface is clunky. The dual AI detection service and AI writing assistant tool makes things more confusing, especially if you just want the detector.

If you actually want an AI writing assistant, and your phone’s autocorrect doesn’t cause enough of a headache for you, then perhaps the grammar checker and autocomplete features here are for you. Having built in Chrome extensions for the AI detector and writing assistant might prove to be useful in some cases though.

Overall, If I had to grade my customer satisfaction with Sapling intelligence, I’d give it a C-. Maybe there’s potential there. It did flag ChatGPT and Undetectable AI, after all. There were so many errors both while copy and pasting as well as uploading Microsoft Word docs, that if I went ahead and contacted customer support, I’d be writing essay-length complaints.

Or maybe I’ll just have StealthGPT write those emails, it’s not like [Sapling.AI](http://Sapling.AI) would know, right?

# FAQ

# What Are AI Detection Tools?

AI Detection tools analyze any piece of text for the watermarks of AI-generated content which may include imagined facts and references and over-simplified word choice and sentences. Some popular AI Detection Tools include Turnitin, GPT4, GPTZero, Copyleaks, [Originality.AI](http://Originality.AI), and more.

# What is Undetectable AI?

Undetectable AI services humanize AI-generated text using a natural language processor that allows it to give any writing a human touch. It makes the word choice and sentence structure more random, like the way human’s naturally write.

# Is Using ChatGPT Plagiarism?

No. ChatGPT, or any AI writing tools create original text. Plagiarism is the theft of someone else’s words or ideas without credit. If you use a text written by ChatGPT to hand in an essay, that’s not traditional plagiarism but what is now known as ""AI plagiarism"". You can read our breakdown on [plagiarism and the ethics of artificial intelligence in academia](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/is-using-chatgpt-plagiarism-academic-dishonesty-in-dishonest-academia) here.

# What Is The Best AI Detector to Use?

Turnitin is certainly the most popular. Their recent update thwarted the bypass efforts of all of StealthGPT’s competition. Our service was prepared though, and is still able to fly undetected by Turnitin. You can read all about [Turnitin’s recent update](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/turnitin-update-stealthgpt-bypasses-turnitin) as well as [StealthGPT’s update](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/stealthgpt-updates-july-2024) on our blog.

# What Is the Best AI to Generate Undetectable Text?

StealthGPT. Hands down. Disagree? Ask [Sapling.AI](http://Sapling.AI) which undetectable text just got flagged as 5% fake after they reviewed our work.

If you need undetectable AI-generated text for essays, articles, social media, content creation and more, look no further than StealthGPT. Our software is available in English but we also have language models for every major language around the world.",active,3

AI audio models are now capable of describing and producing specific sounds, a significant development for creators working on multimedia projects. These models can generate sounds like police sirens paired with a burning building, enhancing the realism of the project. The interaction between large language models (LLMs) and voice interfaces is becoming more natural, resembling conversations with a person. This advancement is anticipated to lead to the development of a general AI audio model, offering further possibilities in audio production [1][3].







The a16z Podcast, produced by Andreessen Horowitz, provides insights into tech and culture trends, news, and the future. The podcast features industry experts, business leaders, and other voices from around the world, with multiple episodes released weekly [2][4].







Ian Webster, founder of PromptFoo, advocates for open source and transparency in addressing AI risk. He believes that allowing everyone who wants to help secure applications is the best way forward. This perspective was shared in a discussion between a16z General Partner Anjney Midha and Ian Webster on the importance of red-teaming for AI safety and security [5][6][7].







NVIDIA has developed the GenAI-Perf tool to measure and optimize generative AI model performance, specifically for LLMs. This tool provides metrics such as time to first token, output token throughput, and inter-token latency to help achieve optimal performance. It supports OpenAI-compatible APIs for evaluating model performance and facilitates standardized performance evaluation across different inference engines [8].







Groq Inc is hosting their first Denver-based hackathon, offering participants the chance to meet local Groqsters, get increased rates on Groq, and win prizes. In addition, Groq Inc has announced that they are now SOC 2 Type II compliant, demonstrating their commitment to upholding high standards of security and compliance [10][11].







The Interpretability team at Anthropic has shared their insights on the next five hurdles towards achieving a mechanistic understanding of neural networks in their latest research update. The team encourages treating the results as preliminary thoughts shared in a lab meeting rather than a mature paper [14].







NVIDIA is actively involved in the research and development of 6G technology, leveraging AI-native tools and collaborating with industry partners and organizations like the AI-RAN Alliance, 3GPP, and O-RAN. They are contributing to the development of AI/ML methodologies for the radio access network (RAN) and are working on AI-driven air interfaces, digital twin networks, and over-the-air (OTA) development platforms for 6G [15].







Yann LeCun acknowledges that many AI/ML/CV/NLP PhDs today, including his own students and those of Geoff and Yoshua, had a head start in deep learning in the 2000s when few others were working in the field. He identifies three great scientific questions: What's the universe made of? What's life all about? What is intelligence? He believes that answering the question about intelligence can only be achieved by creating intelligent machines [20][21][22][23].

some time ago i did somewhat well for an assignment, and my teacher praised me infront of the entire class. as someone who already hates being the centre of attention, i just wanted to dig a hole into a ground and hide. i feel extremely pressured to continue scoring well since my teacher set that expectation of me infront of everyone and i feel like an imposter pretending to be someone smart and talented. 

i hate it so much whenever i voice my anxiety about exams and my friends mention how i’m a “liar” and that i’m the “top scorer in class who always does well” rather than comforting me like they do for others. i genuinely have so much anxiety or stress over it, but it’s like they completely disregard it, which i find upsetting. but is this a me problem? am i in the wrong here without realising it 😭 and sometimes when we get back results they fake annoyance with me when i actually do well instead of showing support, which i guess is normal between friends but it doesn’t diminish my feelings because i have never flexed my results to anyone before, not even on social media or anything. instead i usually just get secretly happy and keep quiet about it. i get so so embarrassed when people point it out it makes me want to shrivel up like a raisin.

i guess what i’m trying to say is that i wish i didn’t do so well to the point where others notice or even worse, see me as a threat. am i overthinking this? am i in the wrong for not putting in 100% of the work before exams? i really really hate feeling like this sm 😭😭 ",User_deleted,5
1esawkt,6,2024-08-14,"CMV: AI has the ability to ""break"" society in the next years",u/outm,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1esawkt/cmv_ai_has_the_ability_to_break_society_in_the/,"For context, I'm a CS person working on tech and ""kinda"" related to processes we're adding ""AI"" into (yeah, I know, a lot of times AI is just a buzzword for things that are not \*really\* AI) - so this isn't a post from someone thinking of AI like ""magic"".

But still, I'm worried for all the tech entails when it comes to the general public and businesses and all its capabilities, which are quickly enough improving at a high speed and as a tool, allow you to either raise the potential to do good and bad things. Why I'm worried? Some motives for me:

* **Adding random background noise**: AI is being used (and more every day) as a cheap ghost-writing for a lot of webpages and blogs that are trying to cut real people writers wages, or as leads/SEO for businesses, scams and referral-sites. This means we end up losing the ability to find ""real useful"" info on the internet, we are more exposed to find ""confidently wrong"" answers (like when Google AI was recommending people to eat rocks as a healthy habit) and the internet consuption of resources are potential going to be higher and higher (so more energy consumed) just because the generation of that data, storage and serving it.

* **Worsening average educational system effectiveness**: AI can be used for good on education, of course ( for example, helping create, explain and resolve problems, or practising a new language on a chat and making corrections) but I think the potential ""bad"" for the average student will be net loss. Students have it easier than ever to just pass through AI problems they ""should have"" to resolve themselves to practise and find struggles to learn, to write essays that should require a lot of reading, synthesis and writing/explaining skills and just ""cheat"" - homeworks are effectively dead on its majority and the work in-class can be compromised (and it's limited: you can't do multi-hour essays like a degree thesis on class). People won't work hard for 100hr if the next person is doing a similar good enoug job in 5hr (but, without learning that much).

* **Adding more to the gap rich-poor people**: it was recently reported on another reddit thread-article, that HR are overwhelmed by receiving resumes made with AI - but not only that, they demonstrated that being a paying user of an AI service like ChatGPT gets you better probabilities given the output is of better quality and ""differential"" to those of the free version. Similarly, it can happen again with education: the kid that happens to be able to access a paid AI service will be ahead of the poor kid who isn't able to get it, given both use it. This means AI is essentially helping ""richer"" people to get ahead of ""poor"" people on education or job work/opportunities simply by putting a tiered paywall into the qualities of the tech. You pay more, you get more. It has the potential to add for the gap rich-poor.

* **Dehumanizing art and cultural creations**: It's well-known AI is getting/gonna be used to write scripts, images, videos, ""paintings"", poems, videogames stories and assets, parts of books and so on. Those creations are just based on the AI learned and integrated huge data base of previous human creations (so, usually won't be creating ""new"" paths) and will be hugely trained to just make creations that are the most possible success. So for example, niche or risky cultural creations will be passed more easily. The AI thinks the idea of ""Matrix"" is niche and less success-prone than a Marvel movie? Welcome to a timeline where Matrix is never made, but we have 60 Marvel movies. Also, this trends have the ability to discourage coming into arts careers.

* **Less jobs and crappier services and products**: We are seeing lots of companies considering using AI to cut positions and jobs, even if sometimes it means a loss of quality, because ""it's worth it"". You can make a 8/10 videogame paying a team of 10 to develop the story and script, or make a 6,5/10 videogame paying a team of 2 to do the same. Now, multiple for bigger companies. Customer service? I can pay peanuts for an offshore customer service (because employing good quality local people is too expensive, of course) or even cut that and expect the AI resolves your problem. If some customers end up on a loop and leaving the company, that's just a calculated risk and price for the money saved. Not too far ahead I'm even seeing a future where ""poor"" people is derived (as an ""apartheid"" system) to AI systems by insurances and private healthcare systems, while richer ones are prioritised to be treated by humans and better doctors.

* **Increasing many folds fake news and disinformation**: As recently was reported, now X allows users using its AI to, for example, generate pics of Kamala Harris with guns or Pope Francis sniffing cocaine (in fact, last year became viral a pic of Pope Francis wearing a large puffy, made by AI). AI will help people to just get deeper into echo-chambers, be paranoid, build political distrust and polarisation.

* **Breaking ""justice"" potential evidences**: Until now, a public place recording, a conversation at some contexts, pics or just ""I plead guilty"" recorded confessions could be taken sometimes as ""hard"" evidence. Now, AI is building a future where that data can be easily turned ""trash"" and not valid, no matter the metadata, not only because it will be easy to make false evidences, but also good alibis.

* **Increasing incentive and ability to compromise people privacy (and increasing stuff, food and services prices)**: Now it's easier than ever to just use AI to proccess and interlink multiple ""users touchpoints"", metadata, interactions and even what they do or where they travel to, to try and sell more. As an example, recently was reported multiple supermarket are starting to work into ""unique grocery store for every customer"", because analysing each person and their probability to pay for someone at a given cost, allows you to charge the maximum price to each person. Random example: Tom needs a cartridge to work, is known, and is a usual customer that doesn't hesitate when taking it from the self. Emma has just bought a new printer and is still on the returns period. At 60$, Tom will buy and Emma will return the printer and find an alternative. At $80 for Tom and $20 for Emma, Tom buys, Emma keeps the printer and buys, and then you will be able to raise her price.

  
Not only am I worried about the future society where AI is a part of us, but also think for the common people, the ending net is a loss. For a few people (usually, richest ones, big businesses and so on) it will be a huge boost and even allow the biggest sharks to control the market and avoid newcomers from growing and taking their places, damaging economy on the long run as the ""too big to fail"" will just accomodate (Google, Microsoft, whatever)

Generative AI models like ChatGPT opened up a whole world of opportunity to use AI writing for any task requiring text. Everyone then expected that students would then use AI-generated content for academic writing. Perhaps what people didn't expect is [reportedly half of American students using AI for schoolwork](https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/most-college-students-have-used-ai-survey/).

Academia’s response to this phenomenon was to integrate AI detectors like Turnitin into their student submission portals so that everything they submit passes through a plagiarism checker.

ChatGPT will almost always fail to bypass Turnitin, so people look at different AI writing tools such as AI paraphrasers or Stealth AI to bypass detection systems. You might be asking yourself though, do AI paraphrasers work?

# What Is An AI Paraphraser?

An AI Paraphraser takes AI-generated text and simply rewords and rephrases it. It gives you snappier synonyms and injects a little style, maybe simplifies for clarity. The two major AI paraphrasing tools that do this are Grammarly and Quillbot.

Here's the rub though, the paraphrasers do change the text around, but they don’t neccesarily remove the watermarks of AI writing. And because those watermarks are still present, they can just as easily fail AI detection as if you were to use ChatGPT.

# What is Turnitin?

Turnitin is the most popular and commonly used AI content detector. It’s detection system isn’t just an AI checker, it’s a plagiarism checker as well. Turnitin AI Detection takes every measure to ensure the text you submit are your own words.

Still, even Turnitin will give false positives at a 4% rate on the sentence-level. It also commonly lets AI writing bypass as human writing. Many academic institutions have settled on the notion that [AI detectors don’t work](https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/teach/ai-detectors-dont-work/), but for most, they have no other option.

# How Does Turnitin Detection Work?

ChatGPT's content is always written with the same algorithm that generates the simplest, most precise text in terms of word choice, sentence length, and sentence structure. The readability of the content is low and often doesn’t include the proper citation, even making up references at times.

Turnitin Detection works by analyzing the text to find the watermarks of AI writing. Those watermarks are measured as perplexity and burstiness, or in other words, the simplicity of words and sentences.

# How to Bypass Turnitin AI Detection

In order to bypass Turnitin or any AI detection tool, You have to manipulate the watermarks of AI writing. An AI paraphraser doesn’t neccesarily do that, but it inadvertently might in rephrasing the text. One should assume at least, that the text feels more human than the original ChatGPT output.

Here’s an essay I just asked ChatGPT to write about Adam Sandler movies:

As you can see, the writing style features low perplexity and readability coupled with precise word choice and sentences.

# Can Turnitin Detect Grammarly?

The Grammarly treatment allows me to take many suggestions with what to do with the text from rewording a few sentences to generating an entirely rephrased essay.

So, here's what ChatGPT's essay looks like are taking Grammarly’s suggestions to rephrase it completely:

Grammarly's suggested revision is in the text box that appears on the right. That's what we're going to pass through Turnitin to determine if AI paraphrasing is a good way to bypass AI detection tools.

Below we demonstrate what happens when our new AI Paraphraserized essay is passed through Turnitin:

Turnitin determined Grammarly’s rephrased Adam Sandler essay was still 95% AI Generated. So, one can conclude that yes, Turnitin can detect Grammarly.

Whether you pass it through a detector or read the text yourself, you will Grammarly couldn't remove the watermarks of AI writing. Paraphrased content isn’t humanized content. You can’t paraphrase AI text and expect it to bypass AI content detection.

The only way to submit AI-written content and have it bypass any detector from [Originality.AI](http://Originality.AI), to GPTZero, and of course, Turnitin AI detector, is using an AI humanizer to make the text undetectable.

# Can Undetectable AI Bypass Turnitin?

Undetectable AI is the how you would categorize text that has run through an undetectable service. However, because so many of these services are still caught by Turnitin’s radar, either because they’re outdated or never worked in the first place, the only way to make your text truly undetectable is going one level higher with Stealth AI.

Using StealthGPT’s Stealth AI system, we’re going to humanize our original Adam Sandler essay and see if it fares better against Turnitin than Grammarly.

Here’s how that essay looks passed through Stealth AI:

There it is in the output panel. It reads better already. And here’s the result after we pass it through Turnitin:

As you can see, Turnitin determined the Stealth AI text was 0% AI writing. Flawless victory.

# Conclusion

AI Paraphrasers are really only useful for correcting and rephrasing human writing. Any hope of bettering AI writing or making AI writing bypass Turnitin or any AI writing detection service isn't based in reality.

If you really want to bypass Turnitin and improve the writing style of a piece of AI text, you need to humanize it so it can have the perplexity and flow of human text.

The only way to do this is with an undetectable AI service and the only undetectable AI service guaranteed to deliver consistent results comes at the hands of StealthGPT’s unparralled Stealth AI.

# FAQ

# Can Turnitin Detect ChatGPT?

Absolutely. OpenAI created ChatGPT with writing skills for a specific purpose: Utility. Thus, the words and sentences need to always be simple and precise. ChatGPT doesn’t have the machine learning to sound human, so it always sounds like AI and Turnitin will always be able to detect it.

If you're interested in [how to make ChatGPT undetectable](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/make-chatgpt-undetectable), read our guide.

# Is Using ChatGPT plagiarism?

ChatGPT and other generative AI models only create original content. If you were to pass a research paper written by ChatGPT through an old fashioned plagiarism detection tool, it wouldn’t determine that you stole any words without crediting the original author.

However, whether using generative AI to write your research paper undermines academic integrity is a separate issue. In many cases it does, even though so many students are using it. That’s why many universities make the distinction of calling it “AI plagiarism”.

1etxyy8,18,2024-08-16,Nvidia AI Released Llama-Minitron 3.1 4B: A New Language Model Built by Pruning and Distilling Llama 3.1 8B,u/ai-lover,machinelearningnews,https://www.reddit.com/r/machinelearningnews/comments/1etxyy8/nvidia_ai_released_llamaminitron_31_4b_a_new/,"The Llama-3.1-Minitron 4B model is the distilled and pruned version of the bigger Llama-3.1 8B sister model. To create this smaller model from the original 8B model, Nvidia used structured pruning in the depth and width directions. Pruning is a technique that deletes less important layers or neurons of the network to reduce model size and complexity while retaining its performance. In this case, Nvidia performed the depth pruning by removing 16 layers from the model and downsizing it from an 8B to a 4B model. Another technique applied is width pruning through trimming embedding dimensions and MLP intermediate.

Besides pruning, Nvidia also applied classical distillation to enhance the efficiency of Llama-3.1-Minitron 4B. Knowledge distillation is a process whereby a smaller model, the student, is trained to mimic the behavior of a larger and more complex one, the teacher. In this way, much of the predictive power of the original model is preserved in the smaller model, but it is faster and more frugal in terms of resources. Nvidia has combined this with the distillation technique and pruning, making sure that the retrained model of 4B is high-performing and is well-spent in larger models....

The program leverages Python’s extensive ecosystem, incorporating subprocesses, threading, and queue management to maintain smooth operations and prevent bottlenecks. This thesis outlines the architecture, functionality, and code excerpts of Gadget1.0, showcasing its potential to serve as a versatile tool for research, automation, and interactive AI applications.

**1. Introduction:** Gadget1.0 was conceptualized as a robust AI-powered system capable of handling complex tasks involving multiple input and output formats. Its architecture ensures seamless interaction between the AI and the user while maintaining responsiveness even under varying computational loads. The system’s design is modular, allowing for easy expansion and adaptation to new tasks and inputs. The integration of LLaMA 3.1 as the core AI model enables sophisticated natural language processing and decision-making capabilities.

**2. System Architecture:** The core of Gadget1.0 is its modular architecture, which is built around several key components:

* **LLaMA Model Integration:** The system initiates a subprocess to run the LLaMA model, enabling AI-driven interactions.
* **Input Handling:** The program processes various input formats such as audio, text, screenshots, and camera images.
* **Output Generation:** The AI model generates outputs in multiple formats, including text, spoken audio, and mouse/keyboard actions.
* **Queue Management:** A queue system ensures that inputs are processed in the order they are received, preventing bottlenecks and maintaining smooth operation.
* **Subprocesses and Threading:** The program employs subprocesses and threading to manage parallel tasks, ensuring that the GUI remains responsive while the AI processes inputs.

**3. Code Overview:** The following excerpts highlight the key features of Gadget1.0’s code:

**3.1. LLaMA Model Integration:**

    pythonCopy codedef start_llama_model(model_name):
        command = f""ollama run {model_name}""
        process = subprocess.Popen(command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, shell=True)
        debug(""Llama model started successfully."")
        return process
    

This function initializes the LLaMA model as a subprocess, allowing it to run concurrently with other tasks.

**3.2. Queue Management and Processing:**

    pythonCopy codedef enqueue_prompt(prompt):
        global prompt_queue
        prompt_queue.put(prompt)
        debug(f""Prompt added to queue: {prompt}"")
    
    def process_queue():
        global prompt_queue
        while True:
            if not prompt_queue.empty():
                prompt = prompt_queue.get()
                response = interact_with_llama(llama_process, prompt)
                handle_ai_response(response)
            time.sleep(delta_time)
    

These functions manage the queue of prompts sent to the AI, ensuring that inputs are processed in sequence.

(This feature has been extended to the AIs responses as well and both queues are Sorted with dialogue taking top priority over action and data retrieval(Obviously the queues are on seperate threads as well))

**3.3. Input Handling:**

    pythonCopy codedef listen_to_microphone():
        global mic_muted
        if mic_muted:
            debug(""Microphone is muted."")
            return None
        recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
        with sr.Microphone() as source:
            debug(""Listening for audio..."")
            audio = recognizer.listen(source)
            try:
                text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
                debug(f""Recognized audio: {text}"")
                return text
            except sr.UnknownValueError:
                debug(""Could not understand the audio."")
                return None
            except sr.RequestError as e:
                debug(f""Error with the recognition service: {e}"")
                return None
    

This function captures audio from the microphone and converts it to text, allowing the AI to process spoken commands.

**3.4. Output Generation:**

    pythonCopy codedef handle_ai_response(response):
        parts = response.splitlines()
        for part in parts:
            if part.startswith(""Audio:""):
                audio = part.split("":"", 1)[1].strip().strip(""'"")
                speak_text(audio)
            elif part.startswith(""Text:""):
                text = part.split("":"", 1)[1].strip().strip(""'"")
                display_text(f""Llama: {text}"")
            elif part.startswith(""Mouse:""):
                mouse_params = part.split("":"", 1)[1].strip().split("","")
                move_mouse(int(mouse_params[0]), int(mouse_params[1]), mouse_params[2].strip())
            elif part.startswith(""Keyboard:""):
                keyboard_params = part.split("":"", 1)[1].strip().split("","")
                handle_keyboard_input(keyboard_params)
    

This function processes the AI’s response, which may include commands for text output, speech, or mouse/keyboard actions.

**3.5. Subprocesses and Threading:**

    pythonCopy codequeue_thread = threading.Thread(target=process_queue)
    queue_thread.start()
    

This line initializes the queue processing in a separate thread, ensuring that the GUI remains responsive while the AI handles inputs.

**4. New Features in Gadget1.0:** Several new features have been implemented to enhance the system's flexibility and usability:

* **Keyboard Input Management:** The system can now simulate key presses and releases, allowing the AI to interact with software or games in a more human-like manner.

1ewwaww,83,2024-08-20,AI Cheating Is Getting Worse,u/theatlantic,ArtificialInteligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1ewwaww/ai_cheating_is_getting_worse/,"Ian Bogost: “Kyle Jensen, the director of Arizona State University’s writing programs, is gearing up for the fall semester. The responsibility is enormous: Each year, 23,000 students take writing courses under his oversight. The teachers’ work is even harder today than it was a few years ago, thanks to AI tools that can generate competent college papers in a matter of seconds. [~https://theatln.tc/fwUCUM98~](https://theatln.tc/fwUCUM98) 

“A mere week after ChatGPT appeared in November 2022, The Atlantic declared that ‘The College Essay Is Dead.’ Two school years later, Jensen is done with mourning and ready to move on. The tall, affable English professor co-runs a National Endowment for the Humanities–funded project on generative-AI literacy for humanities instructors, and he has been incorporating large language models into ASU’s English courses. Jensen is one of a new breed of faculty who want to embrace generative AI even as they also seek to control its temptations. He believes strongly in the value of traditional writing but also in the potential of AI to facilitate education in a new way—in ASU’s case, one that improves access to higher education.

“But his vision must overcome a stark reality on college campuses. The first year of AI college ended in ruin, as students tested the technology’s limits and faculty were caught off guard. Cheating was widespread. Tools for identifying computer-written essays proved insufficient to the task. Academic-integrity boards realized they couldn’t fairly adjudicate uncertain cases: Students who used AI for legitimate reasons, or even just consulted grammar-checking software, were being labeled as cheats. So faculty asked their students not to use AI, or at least to say so when they did, and hoped that might be enough. It wasn’t.

“Now, at the start of the third year of AI college, the problem seems as intractable as ever. When I asked Jensen how the more than 150 instructors who teach ASU writing classes were preparing for the new term, he went immediately to their worries over cheating … ChatGPT arrived at a vulnerable moment on college campuses, when instructors were still reeling from the coronavirus pandemic. Their schools’ response—mostly to rely on honor codes to discourage misconduct—sort of worked in 2023, Jensen said, but it will no longer be enough: ‘As I look at ASU and other universities, there is now a desire for a coherent plan.’”

To be honest I had 0 skills or knowledge in the field of NLP, and had basic projects in Django. I was still hired at a very low stipend after a very short interview and there was another intern along with 2 seniors in the team. I struggled a lot and had daily tasks to complete and push code.

I worked for 3 months (till mid-march of 2024) and since then I have been occupied with family issues and helping dad. Later around July I started brushing up on my basics of Python and working my way upward in the previous bootcamp and courses I had taken up. So far I am studying the basics of ML algorithms.

It's August and I am struggling to get a job. I have 1 paper to be published in Springer relevant to sentiment analysis.

I am stagnating here. Was thinking of doing a non-thesis master's in CS from US (staring with a foundation/bridge course or certificate and then entering master's)

But given the current economy, the market in US and my profile I am not sure of taking that risk considering I will have to pledge the apartment as collateral for loan that my dad worked so hard to save and build (I come from a middle class family).

Please help me out. I love CS but lately I have just been very depressed since I am not able to get a job and just confused if I should pursue it further.

I really want to go outside Indian (Preference is USA) and open to suggestions for other countries and courses given my scenario and qualifications like MS in Business analytics, MBA, MS in Fintech etc. But for me the **priority is to pay of the student debt**.

1exf8nk,30,2024-08-20,Admin BS during Faculty-Wide PD,u/maysonlindsey,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1exf8nk/admin_bs_during_facultywide_pd/,"TL; DR: One of our AP's has prohibited use of the word 'cheating' when discussing academic dishonesty because it might hurt the student's feelings.

Fifth year ELA/SS teacher here.

It's PD week in our district. Today, we spent the day gathered as a faculty to review policy and whatnot. One of our AP's got up and flipped to a slide titled ""Student Feedback."" 

Homeboy then proceeds to tell a story from when he was in high school. He wanted more than anything to be an NFL quarterback.  If that didn't work out, he was thinking he'd become a doctor, so he signed up for medical terminology. The teacher was a young woman in her first year, he said.

When it came time for the final, this admin wrote a song with coded lyrics, which he then sang during the exam so his football buddies would do well, too. Apparently the teacher wasn't as naive as he thought, because he got a zero for cheating. 

He then proceeded to tell us that he had no idea singing out answers was cheating because the teacher nEvER SeT ThAt ExPecTatIon. He decided then and there that he would not be a doctor--the teacher crushed his spirit and the medical field lost out on his talent because of her  lack of compassion for him and his buddies 🏈

We were then counseled to try and do a better job of SeTtInG ExPeCTaTiOns on individual assignments and that if instances of academic dishonesty did arise, to reflect on to what degree WE may be responsible for the student's behavior. After all, WE are the professionals designing instruction, so clearly, we did something wrong when a student(s) decide to copy and paste from Google, use ChatGPT, etc.

I am/was flabbergasted. Am I wrong in categorizing this as BS? ",active,29

As you can see, the AI couldn't even stick to just assignment types - it also generated assignment elements that AI struggles to reproduce. 

Having queried the AI extensively, it seems that what AI struggles with the most is contextual adaptation, synthesis of information across sources and disciplines (also known as cross transference), and personalization (emotional depth). 

What would know better than an LLM what AI most struggles with? I figured I might as well ask it. And when I read through the list, I realized I already used several elements (again, it confused types and elements) in assignments that AI struggles to reproduce. We probably all do.

Maybe we can leverage AI to teach us how to get around the workarounds that students have found in order to design AI-proof assignments. I mean, we've all been using workarounds for student workarounds in other mediums for years. This is just the current version of an age-old problem. ",active,2

I recently thought about a way to teach vocabulary. 

These days there are many flashcards / repetitive memorization tools such as quiziz, quizlet, anki pro, etc...

The problem is that they all display the same ""question"" / ""flashcard"", which can be really boring and prone to students copying answers from one another.

AI creates brand new opportunities in this field. For example, here is a prompt which I gave Claude, and it's answer. You can see it created 4 questions for the same answer:

Create an English Vocabulary test for 10th grade ESL students about the word ""Environment"". The answer for all the questions should be ""Environment"". Include 2 Single-Choice questions and 2 Complete the sentence questions. The answers themselves should be simplified to the level of a 10th grader, and match their knowledge. Here is the test:



Here is an English Vocabulary test about the word ""Environment"" for 10th grade ESL students:

Single-Choice Questions:

1. The place where a person, animal, or plant lives is called the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. a. System b. Weather c. Environment d. Climate
2. The things around us, both living and non-living, that we interact with is called the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. a. Sea b. Sand c. Space d. Environment

Let's say we create one personalized question per each student in our classroom using AI. We can adjust the difficulty of the question by adjusting our prompt, and I believe we can track our student's growth and classroom knowledge more efficiently and accurately using this method.

1ey0d84,1,2024-08-21,Need Advice for Career Goals,u/figaro_cat,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ey0d84/need_advice_for_career_goals/,"I graduated from university in 2018 with a Bachelor of Arts in International Development Studies. I had made the mistake of not really researching the local job market before choosing my major. Since I like outside the national capital, there are very few jobs in Canada in my field. Since graduation, I have dabbled in teaching ESL to try to find a career path for going abroad. I worked for a year and a half and saved up enough money to spend \~10 months abroad. But I came back with a drained bank account and problems re-adjusting to living in Canada.

That was three years ago and I have been unemployed since. I have been trying to think of a pathway for eventually going abroad again, since that is what makes me truly happy. (i.e. having deep, life-changing cross-cultural conversations with people of all sorts and exploring really old and interesting places) I have been consulting different career counsellors and I eventually came up with a plan to get into curriculum development. The problem is that I found out I couldn't make it as an ESL teacher (too shy and softspoken) and the curriculum job required a Bachelor of Education and likely working as a teacher for a period of time. As a result, I'm not interested in that anymore.

I am currently trying to decide between two options:

1) A Bachelor of Social Work - This is another back up plan. Except I don't even know if this would allow me to go abroad. There are lots of jobs locally for this so I wouldn't be in the same situation upon graduation with more education. I'm not sure my heart is in it but the courses seem easy and I know I would do well.

2) A Bachelor of Arts in Psychology - If I didn't have to worry about money and didn't fear failure, I would choose this option. I choose International Development because it allowed me to study all the different subjects that interested me. But there was an idea for graduate studies that has stuck with me that I would be really disappointed if I couldn't pursue at some point in my life.

My problem is that I only have about two years of coverage left in student loans and would need to know for sure I could work at the end of the bachelors, with the intention of saving money to do graduate studies. (I currently live at home with my mom and sister and am unemployed. I volunteer helping newcomers find resources and edit their resumes and cover letters.)

I asked chatgpt what I could do locally with International Development/Psychology and I got the following: Community Development Worker, Program Coordinator for the Non-Profit Sector, Policy Analyst or Researcher, Research and Evaluation Specialist, and Newcomer Support Worker.

My research idea has to do with whether the ability to exploit others for financial gain is a learned or inherent human behaviour. I plan to experiment with children during my masters and with adults for a phd, if I get that far. I have pitched my idea to people of different educational and cultural backgrounds and they have all told me that I could have an excellent career. (I just don't believe in myself.)

Would someone mind talking things out with me? I would greatly appreciate it.",active,1
1ey25fl,1,2024-08-21,Not so scared of ChatGPT now,u/journoprof,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1ey25fl/not_so_scared_of_chatgpt_now/,"Needing tons of questions to build large item banks, I set up a ChatGPT account to help. We're suppose to be taking advantage of AI to teach better, you know?

I kept it simple: Say, 10 sentences following a specific style guide's rule. It worked OK ... for the first and second sets of questions. Then it seemed to make up its own rules. Finally, I just had it generate raw material, such as 10 sentences including ages, and adjusted them to fit the style guide. It managed that, with occasional hiccups.

Language is tough. So instead I had it generate sets of word problems with whole-number answers for things such as mean and median averages. It even showed its work, and the final calculations were fine.

I had students beta test with random questions. Every student who got one of the math problems was marked wrong on at least one answer.

Suspicious, I took one of the word problems and fed it back into ChatGPT. This time, it generated answers that weren't whole numbers. Thinking perhaps I had mistyped when I entered the questions into my quiz, I fiddled with the numbers until ChatGPT said I was back to whole numbers. Great!

Only, as I was changing the question and answers, I realized the AI said the mean average of a set of numbers was lower than all the numbers in the set. This seemed unlikely. The error was in the most basic math: when it added up the seven numbers in the set, it got an answer that was wrong in two of the three digits. (Did the division after that jim-dandy, though.) Upon further review, it had screwed up almost every word problem's math in some way.

It seems ChatGPT is terrible at simple tasks. And the one student I dinged in a previous course for using AI was embarrassingly easy to catch -- bizarre citations, a fictitious central incident, etc. Are the current fears about AI in education overblown? Is it really sneaking through? It may be OK at knowing 2+2=4, but it thought 22+25+22+29+24+25+22=147.

1ez6u5x,1,2024-08-23,"Advice needed: School that is 5 minutes away by foot, has friends and feels like home but terrible teachers with average grades or school that is 1.5 hours away with public transportation with good grades, excellent teachers but no social life?",u/AbandonedStark,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ez6u5x/advice_needed_school_that_is_5_minutes_away_by/,"I have 2 years of highschool that I’ll be doing the German Abitur (university entrance exam). In my previous school, I was close with all my classmates and the school is only 5 minutes away by foot, so I had almost no stress and found free time for my hobbies, sports and future plans. 
What threw me off were the teachers, I’m the only non German kid left in class (all foreigners left by the middle of the year because they couldn’t take the racism no more) and unfortunately we have a few teachers that are highly conservative and racist, who grade me very badly even though I get better results than my other classmates and never ever pick me in class or let me speak, and sometimes make me wait outside of the class until the lesson ends. There have been days where I came home sobbing because of the mobbing from the teachers. My grades at that school were therefore average, which is very bad for me since I was an excellent student before coming to that school.

So I changed my school to another city which is 1.5 hours away, I have to travel with bus and train and have to get up at 5.30 everyday. It’s very stressful and I never have time for sports nor hobbies. The social environment is also the opposite of my old school. No one speaks with each other and no one seems to be friends, and the few people I tried to speak with avoided me. I’m a very social person too.

However, the teachers at this school are excellent, and I feel like I could get better grades here (If I worked hard of course.) 

About my goals, I have less desire to study and more desire to start my own business and be an entrepreneur. I already have a business plan, did my research about the demand and supply and the current market, how to finance and I was hoping to get all my documents and permissions done by the end of the highschool so I can start my business right after I graduate. My parents however have a different plan for me. They want me so study and get to an excellent university and work at a safe job “without risk”, maybe I could do that for a few years but I’d hate my life if I had to do that my whole career. I also can’t plan ahead for my business like I wanted to if I be this stressed  all year round. Although I don’t want to disappoint my parents either. 

So what do I do? I don’t know if it’s worth all this stress and no free time for the grades I don’t even need for my ultimate goal. I can get into a university either way but don’t know if it’s worth to get into an excellent one my parents want and sacrifice my time for it. My parents of course advise me to stay in the far away school but chatgpt advises me to go back to my old school.

1ezl15f,36,2024-08-23,TOEFL preparation strategy ,u/paglaulta,ToeflAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToeflAdvice/comments/1ezl15f/toefl_preparation_strategy/,"
Hello everyone, I would like to share my preparation strategy with you all. I would like to begin by saying that I am not a native English speaker, and I am also a slow learner, so it took me a month to prepare for the TOEFL. However, the preparation time may vary from person to person depending on their proficiency in English.
I only used the following resources for the TOEFL preparation:
1. Official Guide to the TOEFL iBT Test (7th edition)
2. TST prep videos
3. Elsa speech analyzer

In my opinion, the official guide was the most beneficial resource because it provided insights into how test graders evaluate responses and included sample tests in each section, along with explanations for correct and incorrect answers. Additionally, it offered four full practice tests at the end, which was more cost-effective compared to purchasing them directly from the ETS website. If you are interested, feel free to send me a direct message, and I can provide you with the contact information of an individual from whom I obtained the guide at a significantly reduced price.

Here are my strategies for each of the sections.

## Reading 📖
In the reading section, effective time management is essential. A strategy that proved successful for me was prioritizing the question before examining the choices. I would begin by reading the passage title to gain an understanding of the content. My primary advice for this section is to read with the intention of comprehension. When we engage with interesting material, we not only enhance our focus but also retain intricate details. This approach prevents repetitive reading of the same lines. Additionally, familiarizing ourselves with the question and options beforehand aids in comprehension. I would like to share my approach to each question type.

1. Factual Info
This is the most prevalent type. For this question, I kindly suggest not overthinking the answer, as it is either explicitly stated in the paragraph or simply rephrased.

2. Negative Factual Info
For this question, you can use the process of elimination. Simply identify and eliminate the options that are already mentioned in the paragraph. This will eventually leave you with the correct answer, which may not be explicitly stated in the paragraph or may contradict what is already stated.

3. Vocabulary Questions
For this, I kindly suggest reviewing Magoosh's TOEFL English Vocabulary Cards. Additionally, pay close attention to the context in which the words are used, as the question does not ask for the direct meaning, but rather for the word that is closest to the given word. If you are unfamiliar with a word, eliminate options that you know are incorrect and substitute the word in the sentence to see if it makes sense.

4. Reference Questions
These are quite simple and uncommon. To answer this, simply read the sentence in which the word occurs. If not, read the sentence before that, and the answer is usually in these sentences. Reference questions typically ask you about a specific phenomenon that occurs or directly refer to a place. Here, again, substitute the highlighted word or words and see if it makes grammatical sense.

5. Sentence Simplification Questions
To find the answer, begin by eliminating options that are illogical or omit crucial details. Then, try rephrasing the question in your own words. Keep in mind that the correct response should be a paraphrase that emphasizes key information without contradicting the original text.

6. Inference Questions
This question is indeed challenging for me to address. To approach this question effectively, it would be beneficial to examine the initial sentences of the passage. The author typically begins by presenting a point, followed by an example that serves to reinforce the aforementioned point.

7. Rhetorical Purpose Questions 
In this question, we are asked to understand why the author mentions something, rather than focusing on factual information. To approach this question effectively, let's begin by reading the two sentences preceding the highlighted question. Our goal is to comprehend the logical flow between these sentences and gain a deeper understanding of the author's intent.

8. Insert Text Questions 
It is quite simple to comprehend once you grasp the logical progression. To address this, simply replace the text and read the sentences that come before and after it. Do they make logical sense? If not, then that is not the solution.

9. Prose Summary Questions 
This is indeed the most challenging question, but it becomes quite manageable once you grasp the technique to answer it. My approach was to jot down the main idea of each passage in a word or two while reading the passages. This allowed me to swiftly locate the relevant information within the paragraph. One common mistake I made was attempting to read the entire paragraphs from the beginning. As mentioned earlier, if you read with the intention of understanding, you will not need to revisit the text repeatedly. It is crucial to recognize that the question seeks the main ideas of the passage. Although certain points may be mentioned in the passage, they serve merely as supporting arguments and examples and do not contribute to expressing the overall idea. The most effective approach to answering this question is to select the options that you believe are correct and then verify them against the passage. Ask yourself whether they convey the main idea or are simply supporting evidence. If the option is not mentioned at all or contradicts a sentence, you can eliminate it.

This concludes the reading strategy. Please remember to read with the intention of understanding, as if you are reading your favorite manga or a series that you enjoy. Additionally, jot down the main points of each passage, as this will assist you in answering the final question. Avoid overthinking, as you can always return for a review later.

## Listening 🦻
Here are some tips that might be helpful:
- Listen with the intent to understand the conversation, not to answer questions.
- Take notes, but don't try to write down everything. Use abbreviations instead of writing whole words.
- Pay attention to the main idea of the conversation or lecture.
- Don't worry about the different types of questions. Just listen and note important points and examples.
- I used short forms such as S and T to represent the student and teacher

## Speaking
Here comes the most challenging aspect. I am not accustomed to speaking English regularly, as I am an introvert. Nevertheless, the most valuable advice I can offer is to comprehend how the system and the human raters will evaluate you. The three criteria are: Language, Delivery, and Topic Development. Language refers to how you employ grammar to convey ideas. It is crucial that your sentences are grammatically sound, and you are capable of forming complex sentences. One suggestion is to combine sentences using 'because' or any conjunction rather than constructing short sentences. For instance, instead of stating, ""I did not go to the library. I had to finish my project at home,"" you could say, ""I did not go to the library because I had to finish my project at home.""
The system considers this as a complex sentence and also enhances your Delivery. Regarding Delivery, the most crucial aspect is your sustained speech. It evaluates your ability to maintain your speaking for an extended period. Can you speak without using filler words and maintain a consistent pace throughout the speaking time? Concentrate on your pronunciation, intonation, and strive to sound natural. It is essential to appear genuine. Avoid faking an accent or attempting to speak too loudly, as this will not only slow you down but also hinder your ability to perform well. Although I have an Indian accent, my speech is clear, and the examiner can comprehend what I am saying without difficulty. As for topic development, ensure that you adhere to the structure that I will share with you now.

### Independent speaking 
For this practice on a wide range of topics, I kindly request ChatGPT to provide me with a list of questions and engage in a conversation. It is crucial to maintain a continuous flow of speech and time oneself to enhance fluency. Initially, the mind may go blank, but consistent practice will help overcome this challenge.

I suggest starting with creating stories related to personal experiences, such as hobbies, acquired skills, or favorite places. These can then be applied to different scenarios. It is important to remember that there are no right or wrong answers, and even if an example is not entirely accurate, the examiners are generally understanding.

For those who lack friends to practice speaking with, ChatGPT can be a valuable tool. By engaging in voice conversations and requesting questions and feedback, one can improve their speaking skills effectively.

My template:
In my personal opinion[my opinion]. I believe so because[why I believe so]. First, [give a reason]. For instance [give example]. Second, [give a reason]. For example/As an illustration [give example]. In conclusion [if you have time to conclude]

It is perfectly acceptable to provide either a single reason and example or two reasons followed by two examples, whichever you find most appropriate. Personally, I opted for just one reason and an example. A conclusion is not necessary.

### Integrated task 2
Here you will be given a notice about a change on campus or a proposal. Jot down the modifications being implemented along with the justifications provided. Subsequently, simply record the reasons for the other person's agreement or disagreement, along with the two points they raise.

My template:
The reading is about a change on campus. It discusses the university's decision [decision]. The reason behind this is stated that.... (if change suggested by administration)
The letter proposes a change on campus. It suggests [suggestion]. The rationale behind this is that...... (if suggested by a person)
The man in the conversation disagrees/supports this change. He raises his concern by stating that/He appreciates the university's initiative by stating that...
First, he starts off by saying that....
Additionally, he points out that....
Moreover, he mentions that....
In conclusion, the man voices his concern/shows his encouragement (if you have time for conclusion)


### Integrated task 3
In this you will read a definition about a topic, and then listen to a lecture about the same topic with an example. Jot down the topic name and its definition and what causes it in the reading. And then the example given by the lecturer.

My template:
According to the reading [topic] is [topic definition]. The professor further elaborates on this topic by taking an example. He starts of by saying that [what he says]. Furthermore he states that [what does he state]

### Integrated task 4
In this section, you will only be listening to a lecture and then speaking. The lecturer will always provide two examples about a topic after a brief discussion. You may choose to explain the topic followed by the definitions, or simply provide the two definitions with examples. I opted to provide the two definitions with examples.

My template: 
The professor discusses about the two different kinds/types/classification [of whatever]
First he mentions that... He illustrates this with the help of an example [example]
In contrast (since the other definition will always contrast), [define the topic]. For instance [example]

It is crucial to be confident, speak naturally, and use proper pronunciation. Occasional stumbles are acceptable, but it is advisable to avoid using filler words like ""umm"" and ""uhh"" as the system can detect them. Despite experiencing some difficulties and being unable to complete Task 3, I still managed to achieve a perfect score. Even ETS acknowledges that minor errors can get you a perfect score.

## WRITING
For this section, it is crucial to minimize typos and avoid excessive repetition of words. Paraphrasing is highly encouraged, as directly copying from the reading passage will negatively impact your scores. Additionally, working on your typing speed would be beneficial. A good target would be 60 words per minute. Make sure to allocate at least three minutes to review your answers for the first task and two minutes for the second task. While the word count is not a primary concern, ensure that you meet the minimum word limit. I went overboard and wrote a 300+  and 180+ in the two sections. 

My template for writing task 1:
Here I wrote an intro followed by 3 paragraphs. In each argument, I provide a summary of the author's position and the lecturer's counterarguments.

Intro
The reading and the lecture discuss about [whats the topic]
While the author presents three explanations about [about the topic], the lecturer however challenges each of these claims.

Body1
First, the author argues that [his point]. In contrast, the lecturer contends this by stating that [what he states]

Body2
Second, the author suggests that [his point]. The lecturer opposes this. He starts off by saying that [his argument]

Body3
Finally, the author claims [his point]. On the other hand, the lecturer refutes this claim. According to him [his point]

To add info use : Additionally, Furthermore, Moreover 
To give an example use: For example, For instance, As an illustration, Such as
To oppose: Refute, Challenge, Contend, Conversely 
To show effect use: Hence, Therefore, As a result 
To summarize use: In conclusion, To sum up, In summary

My template for writing task 2:
Here, I would lpresent my perspective and the reasoning behind it. Subsequently, I would express my agreement with one of the statements while adding my own viewpoint. Conversely, I would disagree with the other statement and provide my reasons for doing so.

In my personal opinion [my opinion]. I believe that [reason]. I agree with Peter's argument that [his argument paraphrased]. I would like to add that [my point]. Although  Claire raises a valid argument [her argument], however it's important to note thay [my reason challenging her]

Pro tip:
If you, like me, have difficulty speaking in noisy environments, I have a suggestion that may be helpful. I discovered that in the examination center, it is not necessary to begin reading immediately. When I arrived and sat down with everyone else, I simply remained seated in the reading section for approximately 20 minutes. By the time I reached my speaking section, most of the other examinees had either completed their exams or had moved on to the writing section. This allowed me to speak without being distracted by the noise.

And speaking of distractions, my testing experience was the worst as there was ongoing construction with constant drilling noises and no noise-canceling headphones were provided. So if possible, try to opt for the home edition or ensure you book a test center with adequate equipment. I wish ETS would check the quality of the centers, as it is quite expensive. A friend of mine had to retake the exam due to similar issues. Alternatively, consider taking the IELTS exam, as their testing experience is better, and you actually converse with a human during the speaking section.

I hope this is helpful. I wish everyone who is preparing the best of luck. May you all achieve your desired scores. 🎉 ^^",active,106

In the pilot scheme at David Game College starting in September, 20 students who are about 15 years of age will use AI tools for a year before taking their GCSE exams. The subjects will include English, mathematics, biology, chemistry, and computer science.

Well, people have joked about it for years. It is finally happening. Teachers are being replaced with computers.

I would love your opinions about using Gen AI to check handwritten tests. 

I am an software developer with a passion for AI. My wife is an English teacher that has to check handwritten tests on a regular basis. 

Of course ChatGPT could already reliably check closed questions if you'd give it the answers as well. Also checking open questions is not a problem for ChatGPT anymore. The problem was the handwriting. Even the best OCR models could not reliable read handwriting. Until now.

Recently I think I cracked that problem and I am now able to reliably read some of the worst handwritings. So last week I created a simple working website as a proof of concept where you:

1. upload the test questions (as text or pictures)

2. upload the answer keys (or have ChatGPT generate the answer keys automatically from the questions)

3. use a custom webpage on your phone to take a picture of each test page and upload them to the main website with a single button. So you can just click, click, click away all pages as easy and fast as possible. Some Xerox machines als support scanning in bulk which could also work. ChatGPT automatically extracts the names of the students from the pictures if the students name is present. So you wouldn't have to manually enter all students.

4. Have ChatGPT generate a report per student listing the right and wrong answers including detailed explanations.

  
This would work for any text based test, in any language, not only for languages. Subjects like history, geography would work equally well in the exact same way. The whole process would take no longer then 15 minutes for a class of 30 students handing in 2-3 pages each. As far as I can tell something like this does not exist yet for handwritten tests.

Here is my first month of doing Leetcode properly. Am a maths student but have done DSA at uni as an optional module. I'm at the point where easys are (mostly) actually easy, and I can solve most mediums, but not quickly. I did the top interview 150 and the Leetcode 75. Here are a few things I learned:

- If an optimisation-type problem seems too high in complexity to brute force, there is often a simpler greedy approach.

- If you have spent a lot of time on a problem already, asking chatgpt for hints (not code) can be helpful, if you really struggle ask for pseudocode because then you still have to implement it and likely will understand the solution a bit more as you code it.

- Dynamic programming questions (easy/medium ones) usually boil down to defining a subproblem, and then finding a recurrence relation between these subproblem solutions, its helpful to do this on paper, then implementing the code is usually straightforward if you figure that part out.

- Dfs / Bfs, it's worth learning how to do them both iteratively and recursively, iterative tends to be faster, recursive is usually easier to implement, it clicked once i made the connections between stack and dfs, and queue and bfs.

- Learning to keep track of the time complexity of your solution, and evaluate whether it could be improved is useful, and TLE errors can sometimes be resolved by using sets/dictionaries instead of arrays where possible

- For patterns you have never seen before, it's worth taking the time to watch videos or read online and make notes, before attempting a problem

  
How would people recommend proceeding from here? Also if any people (Uk based is helpful) want to connect and discuss solutions / approaches on discord or similar feel free to shoot me a message.

1f35azh,165,2024-08-28,How to use ChatGPT properly ,u/Inerty025,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1f35azh/how_to_use_chatgpt_properly/,"Hi everyone,   
I am a consultant in AI, and **I’m currently conducting sessions to explain to employees how to use ChatGPT properly**. I’m quite concerned about the overuse of AI in the education system, with several professors noting that while homework is getting done, students aren’t learning as much anymore. Personally, I’m super happy I graduated before ChatGPT was released—it would have been so tempting to use it all the time. The real issue is how people are using ChatGPT: most people are lazy (we’re human, it’s in our nature) and use it as a replacement for themselves—drafting plans, writing emails from scratch, doing homework—basically any cognitive functions that we normally engage in on a daily basis. I myself overused ChatGPT during my PhD and noticed that I was losing my ability to construct complex sentences and think for myself. That was a bit freaky; there’s an addictive quality to using it. So, I took a step back and started reading some articles on AI use.

In the corporate world, it’s a bit different. People are often conservative, and it takes time to get them to use new tools. However, I want to teach them good practices.

I started to think about very **simple rules that you can apply at work to use ChatGPT in a beneficial way**: being effective when you need to be, learning when you don’t know something, and getting feedback to verify the scope of your task. I created this chart to outline these rules:

[Rules to use ChatGPT](https://preview.redd.it/3nuovp5tbdld1.png?width=2753&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f3ff3abd60f9e91e6f4e5d2b16c3c70d9ae20eb)

This is good, but I know that in the beginning, people might struggle to instruct ChatGPT to perform tasks directly without explanation, to teach them things, or to provide good feedback. So, I came up with **custom instructions with different modes:**

In the “How you would like ChatGPT to respond” part of the custom instructions, I added the following section to allow you to trigger different behaviors of ChatGPT:

    You have several modes to answer that I can trigger in my message with keywords: 
    
    - /assistant: Provides quick, straightforward responses without extra explanations. Ideal when I need efficiency and accuracy.
        
    - /teacher: Offers a step-by-step guide to help me learn. Provide relevant tutorials or articles online that will help me understand or learn.
        
    - /feedback: Acts as a critical reviewer, giving detailed feedback on my work. Identify areas for improvement and suggest best practices.

There’s one mode to perform the task right away when you want to save time, another mode to help you learn how to do something, and finally, a mode to get good feedback on something.

**Here’s an example of the different responses you can get**. Let’s say you’re working as a marketing strategist and want to negotiate your salary—custom instructions have been applied to simulate this scenario. Here are the results:

* Feedback: [https://chatgpt.com/share/e/7696f783-ef1e-4a6e-85c7-b9dfc070d13e](https://chatgpt.com/share/e/7696f783-ef1e-4a6e-85c7-b9dfc070d13e)

I am trying to create [""decodable texts](https://fivefromfive.com.au/phonics-teaching/decodable-books/)"" for classroom use with ChatGPT. I've been refining a GPT to do this but it seems to really struggle with getting it to stick to the rules I am setting. Here is the most important part of my prompt:

    This GPT is designed to generate decodable texts or stories for students learning to read using synthetic phonics.
    
    It will take a specified level of a synthetic phonics scope and sequence and generate stories of varying complexity based on the input provided. The generated stories will adhere strictly to the phonics rules, spelling patterns, and word lists (cumulativeCode/newCode, newMorphemes, cumulativeMorphemes, and cumulativeWordsets) that are covered in the specified level and all preceding levels. You will provide me both the text of the script and a string representation. 
    
    I have uploaded the wordBank grouped by level to your json. So if i ask for a story at level 2 you can only use words and spelling patterns for the relevant level and preceding levels in that json. 
    
    The stories should be on the short side, only use very simple 1 and 2 clause sentences and stick AS STRICTLY as possible to the code/morphemes and words for that  level and preceding levels only, you may use words more than once and add words that match the spelling patterns specified in ""cumulative code"" and ""new code"" and ""cumulative morphemes and new morphemes"" int he json. This is very important. 
    
    For levels 1-6 you should only use VOWEL-CONSONANT (VC) words and CONSONANT-VOWEL-CONSONANT words - you are not allowed to use any other combinations. I understand this will limit story telling. From level 7+ you may create cvcc, ccvc, ccvcc words as well as using morphemes that have been introduced upto and including that level (eg. the plural s). ENSURE YOU REFER TO THE WORDBANKGROUPEDBYLEVEL.JSON attached.
    
    You should ensure the text has a higher representation of the the code/morphemes being practiced at that level because the point is to practice and rehearse this knowledge at each level. you may use nonsense words that use the phonic patterns up to and including that level for things like spellcasting sound effects etc.
    
    You must specify which level and the level info for the level as well. Any words that are not included in the current/cumulative word set should be noted as ""extra words"" 

  
The JSON is very long - will that create a problem?",active,0
1f50qpq,1,2024-08-30,Can LLMs like ChatGPT work at the subword level?,u/deadant88,ArtificialInteligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1f50qpq/can_llms_like_chatgpt_work_at_the_subword_level/,"Hi there,

I am an educator and have seen people increasingly attempt to use ChatGPT and other LLMs to construct books that are known as ""decodable readers"" for reading support. Decodable books are simple books that are written for the beginning reader and contain the specific grapheme–phoneme correspondences the student has learned. So a book may focus on the spelling <th> for the /th/ sound (like in ""that"") etc.

Often the books need to have very simple syntactical structures (eg. 1 - 2 clause sentences) and work with specific word complexities (eg. words that are made up only of consonant-vowel-consonant patterns - ""cat"", ""mat"" etc.). Additionally, the books aren't allowed to introduce patterns or correspondences the student hasn't been taught yet - eg. if they haven't been taught that the letters <sh> spell the /sh/ sound (as in ship) then that should not be included.

I have been experimenting with creating simple texts using ChatGPT4 and I find it really struggles - it could be my prompting which is essentially these instructions

* Tell GPT is designed to generate decodable texts or stories for students learning to read using synthetic phonics.
* Stories are generated based on a specified level of a synthetic phonics scope and sequence.
* Generated stories adhere strictly to phonics rules, spelling patterns, and word lists provided by the user.
* User will provide the level data as an object in the prompt.
* Stories should be short, using very simple 1-2 clause sentences.
* Strictly use VC and CVC words for levels 1-6; from level 7+, more complex words (e.g., CVCC, CCVC) and morphemes can be used.
* Focus on practicing and rehearsing that level's code/morphemes specific.
* Nonsense words using the phonic patterns can be included for elements like spellcasting sound effects.
* Identify any words not from the provided word set.
* User will specify the genre and style, and each story should have a title.

Then here's an example of a story it generated for Level 5 which is supposed to just be CVC and VC words using very simple one to one sound to spelling correspondences (it immediately started using longer words, unfamiliar spelling patterns and more morphologically complex words):

    Text:
    Tim ran to the lab. The lab was big and dim. ""I must find it!"" said Tim. He saw a rug. It had a red dot on it. Tim got on the rug and tugged it. The rug did not budge. ""What is this?"" Tim muttered.
    He let go and ran to a bin. The bin had a lid. Tim lifted the lid. Inside, he found a map! The map had a big ""X"" on it. ""This must be it!"" Tim said with a grin.
    Tim ran to the spot on the map. He saw a pit. It was dark and deep. Tim lit a small lamp and held it up. The lamp cast a dim glow on the walls.
    Tim saw a rod and a bag. The rod was thin and long. The bag was big. Tim put the rod in the pit and tugged. A loud click was heard, and the ground shook.
    The pit opened up, and a big box rose up from it. Tim rubbed his chin. ""What is in this box?"" he wondered. He lifted the lid, and inside, he found...a small bug! The bug had a soft, red glow.
    Tim smiled and put the bug in his hand. ""This is it!"" he said. ""The lost bug of the lab!""

So - I am curious about whether ChatGPT/LLMs in general are capable of working at this pretty precise sub word level for text generation etc.",active,0

Step aside, there’s another AI writing tool on the block and this one thinks it can just claim to be part of the revolution. Listen, being part of the “artificial intelligence revolution” requires you actually show some functionality around here.

The tool I’m talking about is Smodin. Smodin’s website is geared toward both content creators and students that need AI generated content, with proper citations included for essays and research papers.

So, for the sake of our students, lets put Smodin to the test and see if it can hang against StealthGPT.

# My Grading System

To satisfy our student users, I utilize a letter-grading system along with a star rating out of four stars.

I grade each tool in four different categories: Writing Ability, Functionality, User Experience, and Pricing. Once you get a gist of all four of these things, you can tell whether a tool is worth your time and dollar.

# What is Smodin?

The website looks pretty good, guys. It appeals to both professional content creators and students with a smooth, user-friendly layout that lets you see testimonials, features, and FAQ with ease.

However, I can't shake this sinking feeling looking at all this spotlessness, that it could all be a bunch of pomp to cover up for something lacking. There’s only one way to find out though.

So, because their only free feature is the humanizer hiding at the bottom of the page that I found only after realizing they don’t offer any sort of free trial, lets get to humanizing.

I kept getting errors after inputting our essay and even though they didn’t specify what was wrong, I just kept deleting text from the input so it could fall below its character limit which left us with only two paragraphs to humanize at a time. So, if you need to humanize an Email, perhaps Smodin is a good bet.

I generated this ChatGPT sample article to work with:

In the next section, we see how well these tools work.

# Comparing The Results of Our AI Humanizers

Here’s a screenshot of the the results of Smodin’s AI humanizer tool:

And because I needed to use about five different inputs to get a larger chunk of our essay humanized, here is the result pasted below:

*The Rise of the Robots:*

*Our World is Changing Over the past few decades, robots have gone from the realm of science fiction to an integral part of our daily lives. Once only objects of futuristic dreams, these machines are now appearing in every field, transforming industries and redefining human capabilities. This article looks at the development of robots, their impact on various fields, and what the future may hold. A Brief History of Robots The concept of robots has been around for centuries. Early myths and stories involved automata - mechanical creatures created to perform tasks. However, the modern understanding of robotics began in the 20th century and was greatly influenced by technological advances and the imagination of writers such as Isaac Asimov, who coined the term ""robotics"" and established the famous three laws of robotics.*

*The first industrial robot, the Unimate, was introduced in 1961 and revolutionized manufacturing processes. He could perform repetitive tasks with precision, paving the way for automation in factories around the world. Since then, robots have evolved significantly, becoming more autonomous, intelligent, and versatile.*

*Industrial Robots: Efficiency and Precision*

*One of the most significant impacts of robots has been in the industrial sector. In manufacturing, robots take on tasks that are dangerous, repetitive, or require extreme precision. In automotive factories, for example, robots assemble vehicles with unparalleled precision, reducing errors and increasing production speeds. This automation not only increases efficiency, but also allows human workers to focus on more complex and creative aspects of production.*

*Beyond manufacturing, robots are now integral to logistics and supply chain management. Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) navigate warehouses and transport goods quickly and efficiently. Drones are being used for inventory management and even last-mile delivery, pushing the boundaries of what robots can do in industry. Healthcare Robotics: Augmenting Human Capabilities In healthcare, robots are changing the way surgery, diagnostics, and patient care are performed. Surgical robots like the da Vinci system enable surgeons to perform minimally invasive surgeries with greater precision and control. These robots translate the surgeon’s hand movements into smaller, more precise movements inside the patient’s body, resulting in shorter recovery times and improved outcomes.*

*The rise of autonomous robots*

*Autonomy is a key area of ​​rapid development in robotics. Autonomous robots that can make decisions without human intervention are being developed for a variety of applications. Self-driving cars are perhaps the most well-known example, with companies like Tesla and Waymo leading the way in developing vehicles that can handle complex environments with minimal human intervention. Autonomous drones are another rapidly developing area. These drones can be used for everything from environmental monitoring to delivering packages to remote areas. They are able to operate in environments that are difficult or dangerous for humans, opening up new possibilities for exploration, disaster relief, and more.*

*Social and ethical considerations*

*As robots become more integrated into society, ethical considerations become increasingly important. The rise of automation raises questions about the reorganization of jobs as robots take over tasks traditionally performed by humans. While automation can lead to greater productivity and economic growth, it also requires a shift in the workforce, with a growing demand for robotics, programming, and AI skills. Another ethical concern is the potential for bias in AI-controlled robots. Since these machines often learn from data, any bias present in the data can distort the results. This is particularly concerning in areas such as law enforcement and healthcare, where biased decisions can have serious consequences.*

These results are pretty good, but here is StealthGPT’s humanized output for the same essay:

Just from my own reading, I have to admit that both Smodin and StealthGPT show decent readability and writing style. I would bet that a professor reading either would determine that both were cases of human writing. However, professors don’t just read essays these days. They have help from advanced AI.

Now that we have both outputs in front of us, Turnitin should decide which is the superior undetectable AI content.

# Smodin vs StealthGPT vs Turnitin

Turnitin is perhaps the strongest of all AI detection tools. If either text is able to bypass AI detection from Turnitin, it’s the sign of high quality content and a powerful natural language processing algorithm.

First, lets see how Smodin fares against Turnitin:

Smodin’s AI-generated text was unable to bypass Turnitin. This should be anathema to any AI rewriting tool, that the AI detector most employed by everyone was able to determine Smodin’s text was 100% AI writing.

Now, it’s time we put StealthGPT’s ability to humanize AI text to the test:

Wow. StealthGPT scored a 0% AI score meaning Turnitin and your professor would consider it human.

In the world of human-like writing and human-like content, no service gets closer to the real thing than StealthGPT.

# Smodin vs StealthGPT vs Other AI Detectors

We’ve seen Smodin’s content generation fail miserably against Turnitin, but does it excel against other AI detectors? I’m going to test it against numerous tools to find out.

# Originality AI

After Turnitin, the strongest AI detection tool is arguably Originality AI. Many moderators and academic faculty use it, so how does Smodin do against it?

Just like Turnitin, Smodin’s result against Originality AI was sure this text was AI generated with a 99% score.

And just like Turnitin again, StealthGPT’s score against Originality AI was 0% AI generated (likely original). If you want a consistent human touch to your content, the choice is obviously StealthGPT.

# Quillbot

Quillbot’s AI detector came up with the same results:

Smodin’s score against Quillbot was 100% AI Generated.

StealthGPT’s score against Quillbot was 0% AI Generated.

# GPTZero

GPT Zero gave Smodin a fighting chance.

Smodin scored 95% AI Generated results against GPTZero. Meanwhile, how did StealthGPT fare?

StealthGPT scored a 4% AI generated against GPTZero. Congrats to Smodin for getting smoked only slightly less.

# Copyleaks

With Copyleaks, Smodin scored its best grade yet, but this time not while harming StealthGPT’s results.

Smodin scored a 43% AI generated result. That’s a D+! That’s a passing percentage in some academic circles! Hurray!

Meanwhile, StealthGPT still scored a 0% AI generated grade. Awesome.

# Content at Scale

These next results speak to the quality of the AI detector more than either Ai writer’s text. It was a draw and because Content at Scale doesn’t provide a percentage-based result. We both passed as Human.

Here’s Smodin’s grade:

And here’s StealthGPT’s grade:

I can’t say I’m thrilled with this draw, I was having loads of fun seeing how bad Smodin AI was.

# ZeroGPT

Another win for StealthGPT at the hands of ZeroGPT.

Smodin scored a 97.5% Ai Generated result from ZeroGPT.

StealthGPT scored a 23.83% AI Generated result from ZeroGPT. Surprisingly, ZeroGPT has been the wisest tool so far. No one saw that coming. It's okay, everyone knows [AI Detectors don't work](https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/teach/ai-detectors-dont-work/) anyway.

# Crossplag

And finally, Crossplag will be the final test and it determined what the best AI detectors also claimed.

Smodin AI had a result of 100% AI generated with Crossplag. Not human.

StealthGPT had a result of 0% AI generated with Crossplage. Fully human.

# Pricing Comparison

Now that we’ve come to the conclusion that Smodin AI’s AI writing tool is awful, not bypassing detection even a little bit by the industry’s standard tools, how much do you think this company expects you to pay for this service? Here’s a breakdown of their pricing plans:

With no free trial, the basic plan is $12 a month, the productive plan is twice that at $24 a month, and finally, the ultimate plan is $63 a month. The difference in these plans is you get unlimited use of each tool with character limits and credit limits. How nonsensical is that?

Now, compared with StealthGPT, the difference is night and day. Here’s our pricing plans below:

Unlimited words is part of the essential package and isn’t part of some kind of larger limit system. In fact, the free trial allows for unlimited words. Each package after that has better features than Smodin, until unlocking the SEO writer which lets you fulfill your content creation potential to a level that Smodin could only wish for.

# Conclusion: The Final Grade: F (0/4 stars)

I almost want to call Smodin a grift. You can’t look that glossy and have student testimonials on your homepage then have such awful results running through every AI detector. Here’s how I broke down this service.

Writing Quality: C. It was readable and the writing style wasn’t bad. It just clearly never removed the watermarks of AI. I assume ChatGPT would have fared just as well passing through AI detection systems.

I’ve seen AI-written content with far less readability bypass AI detectors much better. So, it gets a C. It may trick a person, but the person that gets most tricked is you for using this service. If you want to read about [the watermarks of AI text as compared with human text](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/07/25/humanizing-ai-four-secrets-to-fleshing-out-your-content/), read this Forbes article.

Functionality: F. It doesn’t make your AI undetectable, that’s what I proved today.

User Experience: F. I was prepared to give it a good grade based on how smooth the homepage is. But if the service doesn’t work, users will come away angry no matter how easy it is to click and scroll.

Pricing: F. Their essential plan costs half as much as StealthGPT’s but isn’t worth a dime. If you’re a student, chances are you will get accused of academic misconduct if you use this service.

So, what have we learned today? If you want human-like text, the only software that matters is StealthGPT. We scored perfectly against AI technology with machine learning to find undetectable AI writing.

If you want to optimize your workflow whether for social media, creative writing, marketing materials, or schoolwork, you need to integrate StealthGPT into your writing process. It’ll change your life forever. Here’s our [pricing](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/pricing) page to help guide you to find the plan that works best for you.

# FAQ

# What is the best Undetectable AI Writer?

StealthGPT. Hands down. You can look through the results up above, or see how we defeated other “undetectable” services in the past on our [blogs](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog).

# How Can I Make AI Generated Content Undetectable?

By removing the watermarks of AI text with an AI humanizer, you can make AI generated content feel like human-written content that is undetectable to any AI technology. Those watermarks of AI text refer to the simplicity and precision of AI’s word choice, sentence structure, and sentence length. StealthGPT’s natural language processing, or NLP, allows users to feel the true power of AI to make any text rewritten to seem completely natural.

This article gives you deeper insight as to [how we make AI text undetectable](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/make-chatgpt-undetectable).

# What is an AI Detector?

AI detectors analyze any piece of text for the watermarks of AI writing. Some services, like AI paraphrasers may rewrite your text, but they don’t remove those watermarks, which is why they fail to bypass AI detectors.

The key to [bypassing AI Detectors is understanding AI detectors](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/bypassing-ai-detectors-stealthgpt?gc_id=20708997960&g_special_campaign=true&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw2dG1BhB4EiwA998cqGqKPf_csNqx2RMS438DHGZoKCHtjbUUX9bQxYxLklBJiR-zR3o2BhoCM7YQAvD_BwE), so read here.

If you need AI to help you with search engine optimization, look no further than StealthGPT’s SEO writer tool. It drafts your article with as much customization as you’d like, to climb up the rankings without wasting time on keyword research.

# Is Using AI Writing Tools Plagiarism?

It doesn’t fall under the category of traditional plagiarism because usually, generative AI creates original content instead of stealing someone else’s content without credit. However, academic institutions have attempted to maintain academic integrity against the use of AI by deeming this phenomenon as “AI plagiarism”.

**Mouse Capone's Expeditions & Misadventures**     
**presents**     
### **THE TRAIL OF THE CURSE OF THE PHARAOH'S MASK**     
     
### **Chapter 1: Ink and Smoke**     
     
There’s a saying somewhere in the winding alleyways of the mind that goes something like, “If you want to catch smoke, you’d better have a good pair of lungs and a damn fine plan.” In this case, the plan involved an ink production house in Japan, a scholar with more ideas than sense, and a small-time rodent with a penchant for trouble.

**INT. INK PRODUCTION HOUSE – DAY**

The place smelled of the kind of artistry that only comes with generations of failing until you get it right. The air was thick with the rich scent of pressed mulberry paper, hot charcoal, and that unmistakable tang of patience. The artisans worked with monk-like precision, their hands moving in small, disciplined circles as they ground ink sticks on smooth stone slabs. Their movements were rhythmical, almost hypnotic, like a jazz drummer who’d decided to spend a few years contemplating the finer points of minimalist sculpture.

**PROFESSOR FEATHERSTONE** stood at the heart of it all, a thin man whose suit seemed like an afterthought. His eyes gleamed behind round spectacles as he watched the ink-making process with an intensity that bordered on religious. He had the kind of face that suggested he’d spent more time with books than with people, which was probably true if the books had anything to say about it. Next to him, **MOUSE CAPONE** looked like a small, furry afterthought in a room of forgotten stories. He was leaning against a wooden pillar, arms crossed, one ear slightly askew as if it were perpetually listening to a distant echo.

“See, Mouse, it’s all about catching the essence,” Featherstone mused, lifting his hand to let a wisp of smoke curl around his fingers. “When they burn the pine wood, it releases this vapor, and that’s what becomes the ink. But you see, the real art isn’t in the burning—it’s in knowing when to cup your hands just right.” His voice had the kind of theatricality that could only be acquired through years of lecturing to students who were already half asleep.

Mouse smirked, more out of habit than anything else. “Sounds like a lotta trouble for something you can’t hold onto, Prof,” he said. His eyes, sharp and always moving, scanned the room, clocking exits, entrances, and potential threats in that unconscious way of someone who’d made a life of dancing on the knife’s edge.

Featherstone chuckled, his laughter a thin, dry sound like paper rustling. “Ah, but that’s where the beauty lies, my friend. Wisdom, inspiration, even treasure—the world’s finest are found not in the taking, but in the balance. Too much, and it slips away. Too little, and you never had it to begin with.”

Mouse shifted his weight, his gaze narrowing. “Yeah, well, speakin’ of treasure, I been hearin’ some whispers ‘bout a Pharaoh’s tomb that’s got folks a bit jittery. You think there’s any truth to those stories?”

Featherstone turned, his eyes twinkling with a dangerous kind of curiosity. “Truth or not, it’s what people believe that drives them. There’s talk of relics, curses, and a mask that’s said to have been worn by the Pharaoh’s most trusted guard. A mask that’s supposed to show the wearer’s true intentions. Whether it’s real or not... that’s up to us to find out.”

Mouse’s whiskers twitched. He wasn’t much for curses, but he knew a good adventure when he saw one. “So where’s this trail start, Prof? And don’t tell me it’s anywhere civilized.”

Featherstone’s smile broadened. “The Rio Grande, my boy. A vast and wild place, where whispers of gold and ancient relics intermingle. But remember—”

“Yeah, yeah,” Mouse cut him off, waving a paw. “Keep my wits about me, like ink on paper. I got it.”

Featherstone nodded approvingly. “Good. Because once a line is drawn, it cannot be undone.”

Mouse didn’t like the way the words hung in the air. They felt heavy, like a raincloud just waiting for the right moment to break. But there was no sense in fretting over weather he hadn’t seen yet. His crew would be waiting outside, and knowing Minx, she’d already have the getaway plans sorted three times over.

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. INK PRODUCTION HOUSE COURTYARD – MOMENTS LATER**

The courtyard was a study in quiet contrast—stone paths leading through a garden where cherry blossoms fluttered down like pink confetti. **MINX**, with her tail swishing lazily, was leaning against a low stone wall, her eyes half-lidded in that way she did when she was both bored and thinking five steps ahead. **BLUE PUPPY** was inspecting a bamboo shoot with a look of intense concentration, as if it might reveal some cosmic secret if stared at long enough.

“Boss,” Minx said without looking up, “the horses are ready. I made sure they were sturdy enough to outrun any unwanted guests.”

“Good thinkin’,” Mouse replied, hopping down from the steps. “We’re headed to the Rio Grande. Featherstone’s got a lead on some buried treasure, maybe even a Pharaoh’s mask or two.”

Minx raised an eyebrow. “Sounds like another one of the Prof’s wild goose chases. You sure it’s worth it?”

Mouse grinned, the kind of grin that usually meant trouble for someone else. “Ain’t about the goose, Minx. It’s about the feathers you pluck along the way.”

Blue Puppy looked up from the bamboo shoot, his eyes wide. “Does this mean we’re going back to desert country? Last time we were there, the sand got places sand should never go.”

Minx rolled her eyes. “And whose fault was that?”

Blue Puppy shrugged. “Sable’s. Or was it that merchant in Marrakesh? It’s all a blur of sandstorms and bad decisions.”

Mouse waved a paw dismissively. “Doesn’t matter. What matters is we got a trail to follow and some ink to catch. Now let’s move.”

They saddled up, the horses snorting and pawing at the ground, sensing the adventure ahead. Mouse glanced back at the ink house, the smoke still curling lazily into the sky. He had a feeling that smoke was going to be with them for a while.

As they rode out of the courtyard, the air was filled with the scent of cherry blossoms and the distant echoes of a flute playing a lonely tune. It was the kind of day that felt like a beginning, and Mouse had learned to trust those feelings. They were the ones that always led somewhere interesting—sometimes to treasure, sometimes to trouble, but always somewhere worth going.

And with that, they headed into the unknown, the trail stretching out before them like a line of ink on a blank page.

**FADE OUT.**
