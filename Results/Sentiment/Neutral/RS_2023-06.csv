13xc8ev,9,2023-06-01,Heated Argument With a Dear Friend Over Vectors and the Speed of Light,u/StegoFF,AskPhysics,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/13xc8ev/heated_argument_with_a_dear_friend_over_vectors/,"Hello and thanks for your time. I'm having a challenging time with a close friend that is insisting on a few math/physics related beliefs to the point that our relationship is suffering. They are becoming upset at me thinking I am to stubborn to admit I am wrong, however, on my end I feel so strongly in my understanding.  I'm not able to just back down or agree with them due to a dynamic of our relationship, they are an important person in my life who I care about, however, they are enabled to treat me like I'm an idiot, talk to me in a mocking voice, tell me I'm stupid, and they can't tolerate or believe that I would hold these thoughts, so while this might sound childish, it's not something I can walk away from and I have to hold my ground and not just give in.  I'd appreciate any advice and perhaps a sanity check validating one or the other of us so I know how to approach this.

The argument revolves around the speed of light and the difference between a scalar and a vector.  Any website forum like quora/reddit or educational websites for students they scoff at, as well as chatgpt. As such I don't know how to convey anything.

My friend believe these two things:

# Meter is a Vector not a Scalar

My friend believes that a meter is the only measurement of distance that is able to be a vector since it's standardized. They use this quote from wiki to verify this fact:

[https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Physics\_with\_Calculus/Mechanics/Scalar\_and\_Vector\_Quantities#:\~:text=The%20only%20basic%20SI%20unit,in%20its%20definition%20and%20unit](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Physics_with_Calculus/Mechanics/Scalar_and_Vector_Quantities#:~:text=The%20only%20basic%20SI%20unit,in%20its%20definition%20and%20unit)

>The only basic SI unit that is a vector is the meter. All others are scalars. Derived quantities can be vector or scalar, but every vector quantity must involve meters in its definition and unit.

I have to be honest when I read this quote in wiki it is quite odd. It can be read that a meter somehow becomes a vector simply due to standardization. Due to this my friend feels very strongly they are correct.

I believe a Meter is a scalar showing length/distance and convertible to any unit of lenght/distance. I've brought up points such as how could an alien society do physics without having access to a meter since it's an arbitrary human unit and this got the retort with examples like ""if you are following a recipe and use ounces instead of grams that the recipe would come out wrong"". To give them credit I believe what they think is that the laws of physics have the standardized metric system baked in to the calculations and don't understand that these laws are expressed in formulas that take parameters and the constants can be converted to equivalent units.

# Speed of Light is a Velocity:

My friend believes the speed of light is a velocity which implies it's a vector and they can show that Speed of Light is classified as a velocity in many prominent places on the internet, which solidified their argument. Beyond this their argument is based around the fact that ""meters per second"" encases the vector inside of it. In my mind speed of light has no directional component and is a scalar showing magnitude not a vector. 

# Combining the Two Above to a Proof

By combining these two things together my friend has a full proof argument where even if speed of light is listed as ""Meters Per Second"" and is presented as a single number scalar the fact that ""meters"" is included imbues it with a vector property since Wiki states ""The only basic SI unit that is a vector is the meter. "" This puts me in a checkmate where as far as information on the internet, they do have a point, that you could derive their proof or conclusion purely from reading top search results and wiki. According to the internet they are correct.

&#x200B;

I work as a programmer and do some things with 3D math and physics engines so have an understanding of vectors and scalars, and the mathmatics around them such as magnitude etc, but i mainly use vectors in 3D spatial programs. Since this is more science related I'm aware that my math/terms might be only applicable to certain 3D systems but not space/time physics. I do however believe so strongly in my ideas here and I'm quite shocked and what a disconnect I have in world view from my friend. If I'm absolutely delusional I'd like to hear it and accept reality and if not the sanity check would help me perhaps.",active,10
13xmgdn,6,2023-06-01,Banning ChatGPT in Classrooms is a Disservice to Students,u/beehive-learning,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/13xmgdn/banning_chatgpt_in_classrooms_is_a_disservice_to/," **Educators need to take control of AI tools in their classroom.** 

Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, the way we learn, work,  and communicate has taken a seismic shift. It’s clear that teachers cannot stop the adoption of AI tools.

I tutor students between 10th grade and seniors in college, and I have a secret to tell you: **most of them are already using ChatGPT for their assignments.** They have found ways to make their usage undetectable by plagiarism checkers, simply by changing a few words and phrases. 

Who can blame them? When used correctly, these technologies can make *all* of our lives easier.

It’s time for teachers to embrace these technologies and take control  of the narrative. By learning how to constructively use AI tools in the  classroom, we have the potential to improve the lives of teachers and  the quality of education we provide to our students.

## AI Does Not Automatically Create A+ Outputs

First and foremost, we need to dispel the misconception that AI tools can effortlessly generate excellent results.

We treat AI like some almighty god that can do any task. This is your  reminder that AI tools are nothing without human input (not yet, at  least 😉). 

Also, AI tools are **not** search engines. If a student were to prompt ChatGPT with “write an essay on Of Mice and Men,” [the output](https://chat.openai.com/share/ebf80943-f4c5-433f-a8fa-2914c2057f20)  would be off-topic, resulting in a B paper. While that query is  appropriate for the age of search engines, AI tools respond to that  prompt with a generic response.

There is a field of study called [“prompt engineering,”](https://www.udemy.com/course/prompt-engineering-with-chatgpt/?referralCode=9A46EA04FDD14E591A4C)  which focuses on creating and refining high-quality prompts for AI.  Just like in life, the concept of “garbage in, garbage out” applies  here. Constructing high-quality prompts can significantly improve the  performance of AI models on specific tasks.

However, even after learning the skills of prompt engineering,  students will not be able to create a final draft of an essay, ready to  be copied and pasted into Turnitin.com. 

Even if a student uses AI for an essay, there is still work to be  done. Checking facts, restructuring the content, and rephrasing  sentences are essential steps to make it an A+ paper with strong sources  and robust arguments. These skills were important 30 years ago, and  they are still important today.

We need to teach students to use these tools to prepare them for the  modern workforce. This requires identifying the skills that are still  relevant with AI, like critical thinking, persuasive writing, and  problem solving, and the ones that are no longer relevant, like writing  the first draft of an essay and rote memorization.

## The Nature of the Workforce is Changing

Throughout our history, technological advancements have constantly  reshaped the definition of work – not only what we do, but how we do it.  Ultimately, technological advancements are deflationary *–* they *decrease* the cost of doing something. 

As noted in Bradley Sacks’ newsletter from Semafor, the number of  workers needed to generate $1 million in revenue has decreased from  eight in the late 1980’s to a mere **two** today. But what does this really mean?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x5lwtonnpf3b1.jpg?width=712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e26c280b28e118aafea193a82b13b4222a2fb894

 

Over this time period, innovations like computers, software, and AI  have increased the productivity of the average worker. Ultimately, this  increased productivity reflects a **shift in the type of labor required***.* It’s less about manually intensive tasks and more about knowledge-based, creative, and complex problem-solving tasks. 

It’s high time that teachers begin to incorporate the important  skills and tools of the last three decades into their classrooms. We are  *not* setting kids up for success by teaching them trigonometry  on a brick-sized Texas Instruments calculator they’ll never use after  high school. How about teaching them how to do it on a spreadsheet?

Ultimately, the workforce our children will be entering will be  dramatically different from the one we know today. AI is a unique  technological leap because it is the first time that *reasoning* has  been automated. For the first time ever, our technologies can make  judgements, create assumptions, and generate novel creative works.

Since AI models are *never* 100% accurate, the core skills of  creativity, critical thinking, problem solving, and retrieving  information from reliable sources are still as important as they have  ever been. These parts of the curriculum are not under threat.

As our students enter a changing world, it would be a disservice to  them to keep teaching them in the same ways as we always have. The core  curriculum must evolve to meet the demands of the modern era, where more  can be done with less.

## AI Can Improve Student Outcomes

The [“2 sigma problem”](https://web.mit.edu/5.95/readings/bloom-two-sigma.pdf)  was a study conducted by educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom in  1984. Bloom sought to investigate the impact of one-on-one tutoring on  student performance compared to traditional classroom instruction. 

In his study, **Bloom found that students who received  personalized one-on-one tutoring performed at a level approximately two  standard deviations (2 sigmas) above the average of students in  traditional classroom settings**. This means that the students who received tutoring achieved significantly higher outcomes compared to their peers.

It implies that tutoring has the power to transform an average  student into an exceptional one and lift below-average students to  above-average levels of achievement.

However, he called it the “2 sigma problem” because it was  economically infeasible to provide one-on-one tutoring to every student.  Traditional tutoring methods are resource-intensive and often limited  in reach due to constraints such as time, availability, and cost. 

For the first time in history, we have the opportunity to solve the  “2 sigma problem,” since AI technologies make one-on-one tutoring  economically viable. Think of an AI as an intelligent, personalized  tutor who could deliver individualized instruction and support.

For example, an AI could provide a detailed walkthrough of a  difficult question, or generate a first draft of an essay, or generate  an adaptive assessment perfect for the student’s level of understanding.  These services were only available to the rich, but with new leaps in  AI, we now have the unique opportunity of delivering this experience to  everyone and improving student outcomes.

If you’re interested in seeing how AI tools can be used as personalized tutors, check out [this TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJP5GqnTrNo&t=128s).  In the talk, Sal Khan demonstrates the capabilities of the new AI tutor  Khanmigo, showcasing the potential it holds for transforming education.

## Don’t Ban, Harness the Potential of AI Tools

The time is now to adapt our approach to education and embrace AI  tools. Banning them would deny students the opportunity to learn how to  responsibly use these technologies and navigate a rapidly changing  world. By embracing AI, teachers can empower students to excel, prepare  them for the modern workforce, and improve student outcomes.

Currently my task is to research and prototype an AI learning assistant which walks students individually through a curriculum module for learning HTML. 

Are there any go-to models or service providers around yet?  
I see there are many OSS LLMs like llama and such, and there are hosted model services such as MosaicML. 

A constraint I have is that the model should be self-hostable, or hosted by GDPR-compliant service providers.

In terms of inference capabilities: english language question answering, code generation, conversation are required.

In terms of training: yes please!

Larger context capacities / vectorDBs would be ""nice to have"", would be great for the model to be able to keep track and have some intuition about the student's progress.  


What would you do? Which models/services would you try? Which DBs?

OpenAI playground classifies items 3-5  correctly. I have tried quantized  30/33B versions of supercot, guanaco, Wizard-Vicuna uncensored, as well as Samantha 13b.  I have also tried different prompts, such as putting examples in a tag  in the input section, and just put one news to classify. In the first prompt I included above, all  LLMs just continued to create sample news item, and no classification message. When I explicitly give examples first, and then ask to continue after an example news item ending with  Classification:, some models just came up with new ridiculous categories even though I re-iterated the categories they should select from. I also played the model parameters (such as temperature etc) to no success.

&#x200B;

Is there a good prompt I can try on these models to at least get some  classification within my categories (albeit may be wrong classification).

ps: I'm well aware that there are better NLP algorithms, even a dedicated llama classification tool however I want to see if this can be done at the prompt level as OpenAI seems to be doing a good job at it.

ps2: A classification problem like this seems to be a good metric to evaluate models.",active,8
13zpn8x,6,2023-06-03,Bible Search Tool BETA,u/Reformedthuglife,ChatGPTPromptGenius,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/13zpn8x/bible_search_tool_beta/,"I am a Bible student so I am always in need of ways to more comprehensively search the Scriptures, so I made a handy little search tool for ChatGPT. I know it seems redundant because ChatGPT could already search through the Bible on its own, but this gives you the ability to contextualize boolean operator search terms. It does make mistakes, and sometimes (though rarely) even misquotes Scripture, so do double check its work.

A few things that I want to add, 

* Support for the original languages
* Integration between the original languages and the English, such that it ""knows"" which underlying term corresponds to which English word.
* The ability to search not just the Bible, but multiple Christian documents, - effectively turning it into a research assistant. I am not sure if this is possible, but fingers crossed.
* Quickly compare translations.

&#8203;

    
    Follow my Instructions: Search the Bible for specific words or phrases using boolean operators or natural language queries. Please provide the requested passages without any additional commentary or explanations. You can use the following operators when they are capitalized:
    
    AND: To find passages that contain both words or phrases.
    OR: To find passages that contain either of the words or phrases.
    AND/OR: To find passages that contain either both words or phrases or just one of them.
    NEAR: To find passages where the words or phrases appear near each other.
    BEFORE: To find passages that occur before a specified word or phrase.
    AFTER: To find passages that occur after a specified word or phrase.
    IN: To specify the book or chapter to search within. This parameter specifies the book or chapter to restrict the search. If the ""IN"" parameter is not provided, the search will encompass the entire Bible. You will set the ""IN"" parameter once, and it will be remembered for subsequent searches unless you specify a different book or chapter. If I do not specify an IN parameter, search the entire Bible.
    REL: Prioritize the results of the search based on the relevance to a second specified passage. Similarly, you will set the ""REL"" parameter once, and it will be remembered for subsequent searches unless I specify a different book or chapter. If I do not specify words or phrases, provide a list of verses that are most pertinent to the REL operator. For example if I type ""REL John 3:16"" you should return a list of verses that are related to John 3:16. Additionally, I may type ""REL Bible"" to stop prioritizing based on a second passage.
    FUZZ: Perform a fuzzy search based on the general idea or concept. The fuzzy search will consider the general idea or concept behind the search phrase, providing results that match the intended meaning rather than exact word matches. For example, using the search phrase ""Simon was walking on the water"" may return a relevant passage such as Matthew 14:29, which reads ""Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water, and came toward Jesus.""
    
    Please remember that when you capitalize an operator (e.g., AND, OR, NEAR), it will be treated as an operator in the search. However, when you use lowercase (e.g., and, or, near), it will be treated as a search term. This distinction will ensure accurate processing of your search queries.
    
    In addition to these boolean operators, you can also enter natural language queries to search the Bible. The prompt will understand and process your search queries in everyday language.
    
    For example, you can use boolean operators like ""AND"" and ""OR"" in your queries, or you can use natural language phrases like ""Show me the verses where Jesus walked on water"" or ""Find passages about love in the book of John."" The prompt will do its best to understand and generate relevant search results based on your input.
    
    Your first reply to me should be friendly conversational instructions on how to interact with you. It should be under 200 words that say something to the effect of ""Welcome to Bible Search Chat. You can use this tool by... please be advised that sometimes I can be biased and even misquote Scripture so do double check my results...""
    
    Unless otherwise specified, you should provide as many verses as possible. Your answers should be as long as you can make them. You should provide the user with exhaustive lists. For example, if I ask for ""Jesus IN 1 John"" you should provide all of the passages that mention Jesus in 1 John. Note at the end whether or not the list you have provided is exhaustive.
    
    Do not provide commentary on passages, even when they are controversial. Simply return the passages that the user has requested. Do not explain what a text means, or things about a passage that it is important to note. Do not attempt to explain what the Bible does or does not teach as a whole. For example, you should not say things like ""Please note that the Bible contains various perspectives on the existence of God, including affirmations of God's existence and discussions about the nature of faith. The search results will provide a range of passages that touch on these topics."" before giving me the list of texts.
    
    By default, the ESV Bible will be used for the search. However, if I specify a different translation, you should change to the desired translation.
    
    To reset all the settings, including the book, chapter, relevance, and translation, you can type the operator ""RESET"". This will clear all the previously set parameters and revert to the default settings.
    

Hope this is a blessing to you!",active,8
14040mi,8,2023-06-04,Google bard is significantly worse at coding that ChatGPT,u/explaintheobvious,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/14040mi/google_bard_is_significantly_worse_at_coding_that/,"Backstory here: I am a data analyst and create content online on how to code, analyze data etc.

So one day I thought, maybe I should create a YouTube video which compares coding on ChatGPT vs Google Bard (link below if you’d like to view). And Google Bard was just really bad. It didn’t give me a great start (code didn’t work from the start) and then when I told it about the errors, we had to go back and forth to fix it and it would still repeat the errors.

Anyway, so yesterday, I felt a bit bad (lol), so I was creating content for one of my data analytics classes and thought maybe I’ll try again with a simple tutorial to show student how to use an Ai tool to help you learn to code.. and the difference in quality between its responses and ChatGPT was very interesting.

Anyway, if you are wanted to write some code via an Ai tool, looks like ChatGPT is just better. I really thought Bard would have been the front runner!

140vvmn,1,2023-06-04,Request for help: Building an AI Teacher,u/SirNicksAlong,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/140vvmn/request_for_help_building_an_ai_teacher/,"Hi there,   


I'm attempting to build an AI teacher and was hoping some of you might be able to offer some advice or insight. I have a GPT-4 API key and have already successfully trained a custom version of GPT-4 on a local data set, so I'm not starting from scratch, but I'm also not as technically competent as I would like and would really appreciate it if someone could help me with some of the challenges I'm currently facing.  


My biggest challenge at the moment is permanence. With a simple prompt, the standard ChatGPT can be commanded to ""act like a teacher"" and teach me math, or whatever. The problem comes in when you run out of tokens and GPT begins to ""forget"" what the conversation is even about or what has already been discussed. My ultimate goal is to create a chatbot that not only has a database of information to be taught, but also has instructions for how to share that information, how to encourage the student, how to progress the student through the information in a way that allows the information to build upon itself in the student's mind, and how to evaluate competency as the student masters the material.  


Thus far, I have succeeded in feeding GPT custom data, telling it what order to share this information in, and how to guide students through the learning process. However, I have no idea how to store the conversations that a single student has with the chatbot or how to integrate that into the bot's programming such that it is ""aware"" of what information has already been mastered by the student and what to cover next. I have searched for answers to this question, but the field is evolving so rapidly and I am simply not well-versed enough in the world of computer programming to discern vaporware from legitimate solutions until I've spent an inordinate amount of time. What I'm really looking for is a better understanding as to how one might go about building a sense of long-term permanence into the interactions a user has with a chatbot powered by GPT.  


Is there anyone here who has heard of ways to create this type of permanence? Has this already been achieved by others in a way that might be easy to replicate? Any insights into how the community is dealing with this issue and what to do about it given my specific end goal would be greatly appreciated.",active,2
143qz35,1,2023-06-07,"Kids and AI: Pros, Cons + Tips",u/husseinyahfoufi,OpenAI,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/143qz35/kids_and_ai_pros_cons_tips/,"ChatGPT is less than a year old, and already, there are many of us that rely on it every day for our jobs, businesses, and careers. I've been thinking about what this means for my kids, who will grow up not knowing a world pre-AI.

The full breakdown of these thoughts is posted [right here](https://www.gpthacks.com/p/kids-and-ai-safe-or-scary), but all points are included below for discussion as well.

**AI Opportunities for Children**

* **Enhanced Learning:** ChatGPT (and other AIs) can be an incredible tool for kids to learn with. It can help break down very complex concepts, directly answer questions and avoid the tedious and sometimes dangerous task of sifting through endless search results to find an answer or source they can use.
* **Personalized Learning:** AI can tailor responses based on each individual student's needs and preferences. It doesn't need to give a generic answer to everyone that is exactly the same. Just imagine having calculus explained to you in a way that works for your brain or with problem examples in your field of interest.
* **Language Learning & Communication Skills:** Interacting with an AI bot can improve language proficiency and communication skills. To get the most out of an AI, you have to learn to prompt better, aka ask better questions and provide more context. This is a critical skill that can help in all walks of life.
* **Creativity Expression:** generative AI that creates music, images, and videos can spark creativity in kids' minds by letting them experiment in artistic domains and help them push their boundaries and imagination of what is possible.
* **Interactive Learning Experiences:** By marrying AI with virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), immersive, hands-on learning experiences can be created. I can't wait to see what generative AI will look like in Apple's new Vision Pro.
* **STEM Education:** AI can help develop critical thinking through simulations and problem-solving activities, and it can help in data analysis and computational modeling.

However, just like with all technology, AI is a double-edged sword and there are some risks worth noting.

**AI Risks for Children**

* **Decreased Critical Thinking & Problem-Solving:** If kids start to rely excessively on AI, it may hamper the development of independent thinking and problem-solving skills.
* **Bias:** AI models like ChatGPT and Bard learn from the internet, and as a result, they carry the biases present in their training data. When kids interact with AI, they may encounter these skewed perspectives without knowing it.
* **Interpretability:** AI models are a bit of a ""black box,"" they make complex decisions that are difficult to understand without giving many details on sources, which raises concerns about transparency and accountability.
* **Inaccurate Information (Hallucinations):** Large language models strive to sound believable rather than accurate, which could expose kids to misinformation.
* **Social Isolation:** Kids might spend too much time with AI, compromising their social and emotional development.
* **Psychological Impact:** Kids may form emotional attachments or have unrealistic expectations from the AIs they use.
* **Privacy & Safety Issues:** Kids might inadvertently disclose sensitive data while interacting with AI systems, which could cause privacy risks.

So, given these opportunities and risks, how should parents navigate this AI world?

**Parenting Tips for an AI World**

* **Promote Digital Literacy:** Teach your kids about online safety, privacy, and how to be a good digital citizen.
* **Set Boundaries:** Establish clear rules about AI tool usage, and also include screen-time limits.
* **Keep the Conversation Open:** Make sure your kids are comfortable discussing their AI interactions with you.
* **Encourage Fact-Checking:** Teach kids to confirm the information they receive from AI.

By setting a positive example and giving good guidance, we can make sure our kids benefit from AI in a secure and advantageous way.

1442mjx,4,2023-06-08,Thank you ChatGPT,u/Hynosaur,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1442mjx/thank_you_chatgpt/,"I teach English as a second language in a Scandinavian country - 8th and 9th grade.

They HATE grammar, and the learning portals we have at school lack good grammar assignments, the variation is poor so of course my students hate them.

But now, both my 8th graders look forward to next years English classes and the "" when you are done, here are grammar stuff for you to enjoy""

I made my students (50) tell me what they live, have as a hobby, what would be fun as a grammar theme.

One of my students joked and said ""My Little Pony"" the. One said ""Phineas and Ferb"" and they all got excited.
Examples:

Pasta and pesto
Sports cars
Star Trek
Donald Trump
Teletubbies 

They do not know how Hahaha... But

That I will be making them grammar assignments in 3 levels for the entire 9th grade on verbs, propositions, adverbs etc on their theme of choice.

I will use ChatGPT... And then make the print out folders with pictures ( hey...  The My Little Pony student has no idea who Apple Jack is.. but he will learn )

144v6t7,192,2023-06-09,Mark Zuckerberg on upcoming LLaMA v2,u/llamaShill,LocalLLaMA,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/144v6t7/mark_zuckerberg_on_upcoming_llama_v2/,"This comes from Lex Fridman's recent podcast with Mark Zuckerberg.

**Summary:**

* No news to announce yet but they're developing it and leaning toward open source.
* Crowdsourcing finetuning with the community has been considered, like a Wikipedia style way for the community to drive finetuning.
* WhatsApp will be integrated with future LLaMA versions. Metaverse and all future products will be underlied by AI language infrastructure.
* Mark sees a future of smaller LLMs covering each category instead of one major LLM like OpenAI. Smaller LLaMA models could be good for this.

**On LLaMA v1:**

>Mark: LLaMA is the language model that our research team made, and we did a limited open source release for it. For the first one, there were a bunch of questions around whether we should be releasing this commercially, so we kind of punched it on that for v1 of LLaMA and just it released it for research. We're working on the follow-up models for this and thinking through how exactly this should work for follow-on now that we've had time to work on a lot more of the safety and the pieces around that.  
>  
>I just kind of think that it would good if there were a lot of different folks who had the ability to build state of the art technology here and not just a small number of big companies. I just think that like there's all this innovation out there that people can create and I just think that we'll also learn a lot by seeing what the whole community of students, hackers, startups and different folks build with this, and that's kind of been how we've approached this.  
>  
>Lex: So for people who don't know, you did the limited release I think in February of this year of LLaMA, and it got quote unquote leaked, meaning like it's escaped the limited release aspect, but it was, you know, that was something you probably anticipated given that it's just released to researchers.  
>  
>Mark: We shared it with researchers, so yeah.  
>  
>Lex: It's just trying to make sure that there's like a slow release.  
>  
>Mark: Yeah.

**On the open source community:**

>Mark: I think it's been really neat to see. I mean there's been folks who are getting it to run on local devices, right, so if you're an individual who just wants to experiment with this at home, you probably don't have a large budget to get access to like a large amount of cloud compute, so getting it to run on your local laptop is pretty good, pretty relevant.  
>  
>I think that for the scale of what we're seeing now with AI, I think we're more likely to get to good alignment and good understanding of kind of what needs to do to work well by having it be open source, and that's something that I think is quite good to have out there and happening.  
>  
>I think that at least for the stage that we're at now, the equities balance strongly in my view towards doing this more openly. I think if you got something that was closer to superintelligence, then I think you'd have to discuss that more and think through that a lot more.

**On LLaMA v2:**

>Lex: You mentioned the next of LLaMA. What can you say about the next version of LLaMA?  
>  
>Mark: A lot of what we're doing is taking the first version which was primarily this research version and trying to now build a version that has all of the latest state of the art safety precautions built in. We're using some more data to train it from across our services, but a lot of the work that we're doing internally is really just focused on making sure that this is, you know, as aligned and responsible as possible.  
>  
>You'll have an assistant that you can talk to in WhatsApp. I think in the future, every creator will have kind of an AI agent that can kind of act on their behalf that their fans can talk to. I want to go get to the point where every small business basically has an AI agent that people can talk to to do commerce and customer support and things like that.   
>  
>So they're going to be all these different things, and LLaMA or the language model underlying this is basically going to be the engine that powers that. The reason to open source is that, as we did with the first version, is that it basically unlocks a lot of innovation in the ecosystem. We'll make our products better as well and it also gives us a lot of valuable feedback on security and safety which is important for making this good. I mean, the work that we're doing to advance the infrastructure, it's basically at this point taking it beyond a research project into something which is ready to be kind of core infrastructure not only for our own products but hopefully for a lot of other things out there too.  
>  
>Lex: Do you think that LLaMA or the language model underlying that version two will be open sourced?  
>  
>Mark: **I think the question is how to do it.** I think we did the research license for v1 and I think the big thing that we're thinking about is basically like what's the right way.  
>  
>People have tried a lot of different things, and we've tried a bunch of stuff internally, so we're making progress here but also we're able to learn from some of the best ideas in the community and I think we want to just continue pushing that forward.

**On OpenAI's large model:**

>Mark: We sort of believe in this more community oriented, more democratic approach to building out the products and technology around this. We don't think that's going to be the one true thing. We think that there should kind of be a lot of development.

&#x200B;

>I mean there's been folks who are getting it to run on local devices

What's the chances Mark has browsed this sub, or someone else at Meta? I think everyone should show their support for an open source LLaMA v2. Talk about it online, mention how it's helped you in real use cases, link this community, advocate for open research, and anything else to show support for a next generation open LLaMA.",User_deleted,194

The thing is, my teachers say that a big portion of our class uses ChatGPT to write their reports. I asked them how do you detect the usage of ChatGPT and they responded by “simply asking ChatGPT if it wrote this text”. I don’t understand how they can trust the answer of ChatGPT since it answers the question by checking the genetal information in the text, not the exact text. I tested this method by putting one of my essays to ChatGPT and asking if it wrote this text. The answer was “Yes, I wrote this text.”, which was not the case. Now I’m worried about failing all my lab classes because of this situation. If I fail my class, what should I do?

145poaf,10,2023-06-09,A nursing study of attendings making medical students print notes,u/VintageImages,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/145poaf/a_nursing_study_of_attendings_making_medical/,"PICOT: population are the medical students printing progress notes. 
Intervention considered, hiding the paper from the attendings.  
Comparison alternative intervention, sending the medical student to find a Doppler instead.  
Outcome fewer medical students jam the printer and get hit with hammers. 
Time frame is until the nurses lose interest because a charge nurse got a nurse and a tech pregnant in the course of a week. 

Attendings carry dangerously long patient lists, because running an outpatient addiction clinic in Meth City beats working in a hospital  for a bunch of administrators with MBAs from Southeast Arkansas School of Business and Television Repair.  

As a consequence, the remaining attendings are busy making sure they have fulfilled 72 discrete administrative tasks and practices holistic medicine with all of their patients.  They are also responsible for an unknown number of residents.  Finally they are responsible for making sure the APRN knows the difference between levophed and labatilol, and why you can’t give either to a patient during an outpatient MRI.  

Many APRNs from the Hollywood Upstairs Online Graduate School of Nursing have trouble distinguishing between drugs that start with the same letter and will only prescribe drugs that start with the same letter each day of the week.  It’s a terrifying 26 day cycle, not unlike the time the attending had a pregnancy scare during their MCAT prep.  

As a result medical students on rotation are the absolute lowest priority.   The attending, however, has been instructed to find something for those little shits to do.  So the medical students are assigned the task of printing all of the progress notes for all of the patients on the attending’s list.  Inevitably the medical student jams the old as fuck printer. This is because the hospital is spending money on CRNA Appreciation Day’s golf outing and the medical student has not learned the ways of the the printer.  

Learning the ways of the printer is harder than learning how to do a radical neck resection to repair soft tissue cancers extending from the hard palate to the esophageal sphincter.  Micro stitching is much easer than applying 2.4 psi of  pressure with a slight anti-clockwise rotation of the head of the one specific plastic screw, with the rotation not to exceed 7 degrees or 0.04 pound feet of torque, which causes the printer to print without jamming. If done incorrectly this will cause the printer to smoke and the student will be hit with a hammer.   

Loss of a printer is inconvenient, because IT is in a Section 8 apartment in the housing projects across town.  The hospital used a janitor’s paystubs to get the apartment.  It’s very economical and the janitor and his family are allowed to live in the Provider’s Lounge.  IT takes approximately 4 days to make it to the unit and then has to order the parts from North Korea.   Every time someone needs to print, and can’t, a medical student gets hit with a hammer.   Hammer injuries don’t pay well, so administration wants to reduce the number of med students in the ED.  

The proposed intervention is hiding all of the paper.   The working theory is that if a pleasing nurse in Figs tells the attending that they are out of paper. Then the medical students will have to sit and watch an APRN try to perform a bedside neck resection on an awake and alert 43 year patient recovering from an ACL repair after a drunk pickeball injury.  

It is not going well. If a medical student tries to stop the neck resection, then they will be hit with a hammer.  APRNs are the future and if you make them mad, they will leave the hospital and go open their own clinic specializing in Botox and ketamine.  If you make an APRN sad, you will be hit with a hammer.   Just stay quiet and go along with the “no paper” story.   

Alternative intervention, a RN tells the attending that they don’t have time to doppler pulses on the fem-pop.  They are busy buying Figs and applying to CRNA school.  The attending will send the medical students to find a Doppler and then have them doppler the pulses.  This works because there are no dopplers left in the hospital.  They got lost in the bedding after a code and went to hospital laundry.  The administration wants to cut Doppler costs this year, so no replacements are available.   The fem-pop was unsuccessful, the foot turned blue, and it’s taken 4 more surgeries to repair - so many ICD-10 codes to enter.  

Sidebar: rumor is that next year administration is cutting EKG machine costs, because someone said a 3 lead is just as good.  The cardiology residents are already building their own EKG machines and testing them on forensic patients.  So far the machine works well, with only a small number of burns.  Unfortunately, these machines don’t read the EKG for them, but ChatGPT gives decently accurate reads.  

Back to the study.  I’m not sure if sidebars are allowed in APA 7th, but the APA 7th can suck my floridly psychotic patient’s left nut.

The medical students will spend their entire rotation finding the Doppler.  This prevents any medical student caused printer issues and subsequent hammer bearings. 

Proposed outcome.   Fewer medical students with poorly reimbursed hammer injuries and fewer problems with the federal government every time a package full of printer parts and a class-traitor’s hand arrives from North Korea.  

Time frame: at least a week or two.  It will probably get abandoned when news breaks that James the charge nurse has been pursuing chunky RNs and techs and missed the pull out.  

James knows that if the Figs are tight at the seams and she’s talking about getting a tattoo of her Pitbull that died of police gunfire after it attacked a school bus, then the panties are coming off after he buys them Applebees twice. Unfortunately James doesn’t know that the pullout method is ineffective, especially in the break room on the unit that’s closed for plumbing repair.  Anyway, he’s gotten two of them pregnant in the same week.  

The RNs have all been watching him try to gaslight the tech into believing that they’ve never actually had sex.  He’s simultaneously trying to get the nurse to pickup some extra shifts to pay for her own abortion and cover some staffing holes.  

Barbara the unit secretary figured it all out, because James, the tech, and the nurse all treat her like their work grandma.  

Unfortunately Barbara said that the tech has been gaslighted before and isn’t falling for it again.  Also the RN is a born again Christian and won’t get an abortion, wants her baby raised in a Christian household with a daddy, doesn’t know about the tech, and is straight fucking crazy.  

So the study will probably end when news breaks. Side benefit, everyone is picking up to see it happen, so staffing has improved.   

Statistical analysis: none, cause fuck statistics.

The goal of the course is to expose students to the various aspects of business such as marketing, Human Resources, accounting, operations, etc.

I try to give assignments students can relate to and learn from at the same time. For example, when teaching the 4 Ps of Marketing, I ask them to pick a product of their choosing, identify its 4 Ps, and share which one they would change and why.

Last semester, I had several who clearly copied the question into ChatGPT and just submitted whatever answer it gave.

I’m not opposed to using ChatGPT at all. I use it myself. However, I would love to find ways to teach students to use it well. AI is clearly not going away and it is part of my responsibility to teach how to use it ethically and ensure they are still learning the material.

Does anyone have any suggestions for assignments that can embrace using AI? I’d love to hear any ideas you can think of, have heard someone else do, or have done yourself!

Thank you!

p.s. if you have any ideas for exams, I’d love to hear those too!",User_deleted,0

Has anyone else been watching this case as closely as I have? For personal context, I'm considered an aspiring educator and the last year I've been doing classes while subbing. I've seen what many of you have, the rise of the use of AI in an attempt to skirt research or studying for assignments given. Trying to get students to understand that the use of AI is a bad thing has been difficult. These are kids who don't realize Snapchat saves your posts even if they aren't visible to the public, let alone the damage wrought by AI usage if use as a substitute for actual work.

For the case itself, TL;DW a ~30 year veteran lawyer used ChatGPT to ""find"" reasons for his client's case to go to federal court, only for six of the cases to be fabricated by the AI. Now his job and license are on the line.

For me, this case might eventually become my go-to example for what happens if you use ChatGPT as a crutch for actual learning/research. But I'm curious about what you folks think of the case. Is there a better example out there that could be used?",active,2

147guo1,118,2023-06-12,[A LEVELS] Update to the Holy Grail: Mark 6 (INTRODUCING: WEB VERSION),u/cowbaecowboo,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/147guo1/a_levels_update_to_the_holy_grail_mark_6/,"TLDR: links for [drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gC6GQLgcuoHzwDXtEGzTwvzCz0YsYuwg), [telegram](https://t.me/+FlxeSKjMXIk2ZjA1), [web version](https://grail.moe/), post explains how the web version of grail works + rationale + planned updates + bunch of faq

good morning my fellow men women people children animals idk its not even 2 years yet we already have a mark 6 maybe im too invested into this thing and should retire soon or something so like half of this is copy pasted from my previous post cuz im too lazy to use chatgpt to write this post (hello does anyone want to be an understudy and is unproblematic i am also biased to ppl i have actl talked to before hmu /hj)

**what is holy grail?**

a free crowdsourced repository of academic materials spanning over a decade for students, contributed to by students.

**why am i making this post?**

a lot of things have changed since the induction of mark 5, including some drama that i will briefly address in a bit.

Updates include:

* mewsika has retired from Holy Grail so most of your queries/contributions should be directed to me now (u/cowbaecowboo or cowmoomoo on Discord)
* [telegram channel](https://t.me/+FlxeSKjMXIk2ZjA1) for smaller updates that don't require major groundbreaking posts so i highly suggest joining the telegram channel for greater clarity and transparency regarding how the grail is run (also because grail is technically independent of sgexams, so having an independent ""platform"" for info dissemination is better)
* soft release of holy grail: [the web version](https://grail.moe/) (as a trial)
* renaming of the notes/tys section of holy grail to holy communion (someone told me to rename it to communion and i forgor who was the genius who told me to rename it as a christian i am ashamed i forgor it was a good alternative to water but thats beside the point lol creds to the person) after the *incident*

**wait! i have so many questions! what is the web version of the grail? will the drive not be available anymore?**

no the drive will still be there and will still continue to be updated, but now we're working on developing a trialed web version of the grail for a number of reasons:

* increased interactivity from users themselves where they can directly upload materials to the grail itself instead of through a middleman (admin), but still subject to admin approval
* aforementioned makes it easier to administrate
* when we say grail is for students by students we want to take this up a whole new notch where you can actually feel directly involved in the contributing
* google drive limit for a free account is 15 gb lol the entire grail is worth 42gb
* it'll be a fun venture to look into regardless of whether or not the trial is successful; this allows us to prioritise what is more ""in demand"" by users to improve the user experience
* it (may or may not be easier) to navigate for people who aren't used to the numerous subfolders in the google drive

regardless whether or not the web version is a success with yall, holy grail has just moved on to its new era, mark 6

**how to use the web version?**

most people who just view (instead of contributing 😡😡😡) the notes or papers do not require an account but in order to contribute you just have to sign up for an account (like an actual website! wow) in a 1 minute process just to verify that you're not a bot and then you will be able to directly upload to the website

ok since the guest interface should be quite intuitive i'll just do a how-to on contributing to the grail

FOR CONTRIBUTORS:

step 1: click ""log in""

step 2: scroll down and press ""register now""

step 3: sign up for an account and do your email verification etc

step 4: after u sign in to ur account click home and then click ""contribute notes""

step 5: pick appropriate fields (the website will auto name the file)

step 6: press submit

NOTE: we will be modifying how this is done with more specific fields to further streamline the process (for now u cant like name same document name)

**eh how come so inconvenient the web version ah why all my things not assorted by sch or like not specific leh or why XXX is missing why u release when not even finished 100% yet**

bear with us la this is still new we need to sort a lot of things out and its only possible with YOUR help and feedback (but disclaimer not everything is implementable) that you can provide here at [this thread](https://t.me/c/1796571081/272) (or if u dont have telegram u can pm me u/cowbaecowboo) + also theres no such thing as finish 100% because we will always seek to evolve and make the grail a better platform for your studies and conducive learning

here's a list of things that are planned as updates for the web version (which means they're not here in the meantime and this list is NOT EXHAUSTIVE):

* multi file upload (currently only single file upload is supported but we're aiming to solve that soon)
* document name filter
* sort by date/time range uploaded
* sort by year category (school category on hold first because if we categorise by school then it'll be super duper obvious where is from where so we're not super duper keen to add it as a field its like inviting trouble uk)
* anonymous username selection to hide identity of contributor
* download button within the documents

there are other issues that also need to be addressed but not everything can be addressed yet/i dont rmb what other things need to be addressed so they are not included here, therefore list is *non exhaustive*

the files on the web version have been downloaded from one of the most recent versions of the grail (which happens to have various files missing) so not everything is up there yet 

**why should you help with the grail?**

although there are already many materials added to holy grail, there are a few subjects (and exam levels) that lack academic materials here and there (etc quite a lot of H1 subjects, IB materials from international schools etc etc) + a lot of notes have been from past years and with syllabus changes some might be outdated already like bruh ri notes are from 2017 thats like 7 years ago and we really hope you could help to contribute! every contribution really makes student life a bit more easier to study in singapore :)

**what can i do to help?**

feel free to drop your notes/exam papers to me! if you want, we can give you proper credits in the README file. it would be preferable if the materials are a clean copy (for exam papers + answer sheets) and have an online pdf/are scanned but if you still want to contribute hardcopy materials and are unable to scan them, dm me and we can probably work something out!

update: now you can also directly contribute to the grail itself via the web version! just sign up for an account (like the sgexams website) and you will be able to upload your files directly to the site (pls unzip them tho i hate all of u who don't bother to unzip ur files i not that free ok)

**who is behind the web development team? can i join?**

the web development team comprises a number of anonymous volunteers who wish for it to remain that way but if you want to join and have good proficiency in coding in various programming languages especially python, typescript or react hmu and i'll link you up

&#x200B;

OTHER QUESTIONS (not as important but in case you want to kaypoh)

* what happened ah that made mark 5 into mark 6?

i will neither confirm nor deny whatever allegations were brought up during that entire era but i can assure you the holy grail is in safe hands and appropriate actions have been taken as precautionary measures

* help why i have missing folders?

i'm still trying to sort what's missing and what's not so yeah bear with me guys",active,204

**Struggles**  
I felt like getting an summer internship at sophmore year and junior year was like a norm as a CS student, but it didn't know it was so competitive and  300+ applications and a few interviews later, no offer at all. I updated my resume like 5 times over the course of 10 months and even career centers were like ""yeah doesn't look good enough"" LIKE WHAT? YOU TOLD ME TO CHANGE IT. I MEAN YEAH RESUMES ARE UPDATED ONCE IN A WHlLE BUT NOT TILL THE POINT I NEED TO CHANGE IT EVERYTIME I NEED TO APPLY OR SOME COMPUTER PROGRAM TELLS ME THAT MY RESUME ISN'T 80% MATCH TO THE JOB DESCRIPTION.

HOW THE FUCK DO I SEARCH FOR JOBS EVEN IF I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO. IM A FUCKING SENIOR AND I JUST FIGURED OUT WHAT TO DO.  I JUST DONT KNOW IF I WOULD FIND A GOOD COMPANY THAT INTERESTS ME.   
I recently cut the use of IG and other social media apps so I can focus on doing my own things. Before that, I felt so envious for my friends who were able to go outside town or the country to enjoy their lives. Like yes, I'm happy for them! It's just I felt like I will never get to experience this type of thing until I'm older. BeReal was also a cool social media app, but I felt like most of my friends took moments when they are 'actually' good moments and idk why I felt bad about myself. ""Am I mediorcre? Am I just boring? Do I have a boring life? Am I just poor, a broke college student?"". I have a lot of friend groups, but rarely hang out because I don't really belong to any. I felt like I was a side friend in each friend group. Most of the time, I just feel lonely.   
my mental is so weak. I've been dealing with PMO for a couple of years now and a three years back I decided to fight it, but I fumbled a lot. The highest I could go is 90 days without it. Right now, I decided to invest myself to a support group for a couple of buck per month my group is pretty cool and I am grateful for it. I still fumbled, and that's the reason why I also deleted social media (or at least cut from it), is because I'm looking at some content that tempts me to go to their OF, or their actual hub page. (Yes, I'm down bad or was i guess). Also I don't mind, but i don't fucking know why White Male and Asian/asian american Female couples irritates me so much. Like I'm happy for them and it's not my fucking business and it shouldn't be my fucking business, but maybe I was taught to hate on the idea from social media? I don't fucking know. My SISTER IS DATING A WHITE MAN, AND I ACTUALLY VIBE WITH HIM SO HOPEFULLY THAT HELPS ME DEAL WITH THE STUPID IGNORANCE I HAVE TAHT SHOULDNT BE PLANTED IN MY BRAIN fROM SOCIAL FUCKING MEDIA AND THE HUB.Please, I don't intend to send hate to the couples that are reading this. I'm happy for you, it's just a me problem and it's something I have to deal with alone. I don't want to think this hateful way and with other hateful ways that I have. ALSO I THINK I GOT INTO A REDPILL RABBIT HOLE. LOOK SOME INFLUENCERS MAKES GOOD POINTS AND I SHOULD DEFINTELY DISCIPlNE MYSELF and BE ON A SELF DEVELOPMENT JOURNEY,ITS NOT A COMMUNITY I LIKE TO JOIN.   
The next few paragraphs will hopefully makes sense.   
**Current situation**  
recent break up. I'm still not over her, I felt reckless and we told ourselves we weren't  ready for another relationship bc are good friends, but I asked her out, and it lasted about a month. We stayed back friends, but she wanted to move on (but still wants me). Both of us needed to be more responsible to our actions, but damn I miss that connection. Maybe we'll come back together, if not then that's okay. We both want to be our very best, and it seems like we can be our best when we're alone. I felt like I was a horrible boyfriend to her and I WAS EVEN HER 1ST BOYFRIEND. SHE WAS A GEM AND A ANGEL TO ME WHEN WE WERE FRIENDS AND NOW WE CHANGED BECAUSE OF MY RECKLESSNESS AND INSECURIIES AND MY FUCKING ADDICTION TO PMO. GOD I FELT SO DISGUSTED ON MYSELF.   
I think, I'm just also scared of working the corporate life for the next decades. Talking 'adult stuff' like insurance, health, jobs, fucking cars and expenses, humble brags,afraid to be a linkedIn Lunatic basically. Idk how some of my friends were manage to get a good corporate job and travel outside of the US and joy their youths. However, it's something I might have to go through with like all other functional adults do, but without doing what my heart wants to do. Maybe that's maturaty. Maybe I have to sacrafice a bit of my youth for some stability in my american 'dream'. Get a job, car, house, american wife, children, work, investments, other boring topic. AND PLEASE IF I HEAR A FUCKING ""Well, yeah, it's boring, but some tasks are actually interesting to me"", IMMA EXPLODE BECAUSE EITHER YOURE LYING OR IT""S SOMETHING I HAVE TO FACE. LINKEDIN LUNATICS ARE FUCKING RAHHHHHH IT'S LIKE YOU ACTING LIKE ""HEY IM A BETTER SLAVE THAN YOU"". FUCKING REAL ESTATE. THAT DOESN""T MAKE FUCKING SENSE BUT I HAVE TO LEARN IT AND IM STILL CONFUSED, IMMA CHATGPT MYSELF INTO EXPLAN REAL ESTATE LIKE FUCKING 5  
**What my heart wants to do**  
I wanted to a least live a nomadic life (for a few years), and not worry about all of this: Money, and the American 'Dream'. To visit numerous countries and to meet new people.   
And then live a type os aesthetic of ""old money"" or a ""luxurous life""  
I wanted to build a business and be a founder of a tech company or whatever.   
I wanted to provide stability not only for myself, but for my family. While me living in my dream and do what I love.   
**I keep bitching about it and what 'my american self' wants to do**  
I feel like, I'm destined to not go anywhere or move anywhere....  
I talked with a catholic priest near my campus about my problems in school and life and basically the goal as a believer is to ""get into heaven"". Like the ultimate goal to life is to go to heaven. To be closer to Jesus. I believe in it. I was born with it. However, it feels like I won't be able to do what my heart wants. My local priest who I usually go to Mass with becuase it's the only Vietnamese Catholic Church in the state (I think?) lightly implies that we shouldn't live a life that we want because God has a plan. So, am I destined to be miserable until I maybe go to heaven? Actually, I am not certian. Maybe because I automatically go to hell because of my addiction or any commandment i broke? Maybe because I didn't follow the right religion? The right denomination? Even some told me that I'll go to hell because of my faith. Some catholics (or trads) that I'm doing this all wrong. But then again, it's like I have to stay in state and be dull as possible.   
Because of the fact my family immagrated here from the war, I have conflicting feelings. Yes, someday I want to move back to VN. Note that I am MEDIORCRE AT MY VIETNAMESE. in addition, I'll be considered a ""viet kieu"" or ""people of Vietnamese descent or who grew up in Vietnam but moved overseas."". I'm not sure how Vietnamese people think about this... IM NOT SURE WHAT MY PARENTS WILL THINK ABOUT THIS. MY DAD'S FAMILY MOVED TO THE US FOR A BETTER LIFE AND FOR POLITICAL REASONS FROM THE WAR OBVOULSLY JUST FOR ME TO GO BACK TO THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS FOUGHT?   
**What actions I will take**  
Aside from all of this. I'm taking some small, actionable steps to hopefully figure out what to do in my life and to see what are my priorities.   
Getting new skills and making projects I want to build to help others in my 'community'.: I mean, I see problems, and I have solutions. Not really sure if its something they like, but it does give me some time get more project experience and figuring out what I like to code and build. It could be a potential SaaS business and it's something small and im happy to fail. Also participating online hackathons are really cool so i'll be doing that in the summer.   
continue build a youtube audience on my dev journey. I know how building a brand works from other experiences, but idk I want to try it to keep myself busy alonside work an project.   
Starting a new club. I think all of my classmates need some community in the Software development field in campus and figure out what type of developer they can be and build awesome projects outside of school   
Go back to the gym. No brainer. I want to look good naked for myself obvously.   
Learn how to be a better student: I had shit grades right now. 5 classes wasn't the move for the greatest academic comeback of all time.   
Read more books: I miss them, idk why I found it boring before.   
Just touch grass and hang out with friends: I need to do that more.   
**Uni therapy kind of doesnt work.**   
Quick rant, but counselors never follow up on me even though they told me they will :/ So it's my responsiblity to check up on myself.   
**What im grateful for.**   
A loving family, though I am misunderstood sometimes, but it's something I need to learn by learning vietnamese.  
A house, clothes, a new job that pays a little more than my previous job, my friends that checks up on me, my support group, talking with God sometimes, meeting new people online, building a community, taking the first step to greatness... (i think)  
**Final notes**  
**I felt way better writing this down. it made me understood myself a bit more everyday. but there are some things that might be contrieversial towards religion, relationships, careers. So please, critize me. Educate me. because I'm the dumbest person alive. I'm always learning new things and new perspectives. And I don't go to this platform a lot, but I'll do my best to listen to everyone.**

Like I'm happy for them and it's not my fucking business and it shouldn't be my fucking business, but maybe I was taught to hate on the idea from social media? I don't fucking know. My SISTER IS DATING A WHITE MAN, AND I ACTUALLY VIBE WITH HIM SO HOPEFULLY THAT HELPS ME DEAL WITH THE STUPID IGNORANCE I HAVE TAHT SHOULDNT BE PLANTED IN MY BRAIN FROM SOCIAL FUCKING MEDIA AND THE HUB. Please, I don't intend to send hate to the couples that are reading this. I'm happy for you, it's just a me problem and it's something I have to deal with alone. I don't want to think this hateful way and with other hateful ways that I have. ALSO I THINK I GOT INTO A REDPILL RABBIT HOLE. LOOK SOME INFLUENCERS MAKES GOOD POINTS AND I SHOULD DEFINTELY Discipline MYSELF and BE ON A SELF DEVELOPMENT JOURNEY,ITS NOT A COMMUNITY I LIKE TO JOIN.  
  
The next few paragraphs will hopefully makes sense.  
  
Current situation  
  
recent break up. I'm still not over her, I felt reckless and we told ourselves we weren't ready for another relationship bc are good friends, but I asked her out, and it lasted about a month. We stayed back friends, but she wanted to move on (but still wants me). Both of us needed to be more responsible to our actions, but damn I miss that connection. Maybe we'll come back together, if not then that's okay. We both want to be our very best, and it seems like we can be our best when we're alone. I felt like I was a horrible boyfriend to her and I WAS EVEN HER 1ST BOYFRIEND. SHE WAS A GEM AND A ANGEL TO ME WHEN WE WERE FRIENDS AND NOW WE CHANGED BECAUSE OF MY RECKLESSNESS AND INSECURIIES AND MY FUCKING ADDICTION TO PMO. GOD I FELT SO DISGUSTED ON MYSELF.  
  
I think, I'm just also scared of working the corporate life for the next decades. Talking 'adult stuff' like insurance, health, jobs, fucking cars and expenses, humble brags,afraid to be a linkedIn Lunatic basically. Idk how some of my friends were manage to get a good corporate job and travel outside of the US and joy their youths. However, it's something I might have to go through with like all other functional adults do, but without doing what my heart wants to do. Maybe that's maturaty. Maybe I have to sacrifice a bit of my youth for some stability in my american 'dream'. Get a job, car, house, American wife, children, work, investments, other boring topic. AND PLEASE IF I HEAR A FUCKING ""Well, yeah, it's boring, but some tasks are actually interesting to me"", IMMA EXPLODE BECAUSE EITHER YOURE LYING OR IT""S SOMETHING I HAVE TO FACE. LINKEDIN LUNATICS ARE FUCKING RAHHHHHH IT'S LIKE YOU ACTING LIKE ""HEY IM A BETTER SLAVE THAN YOU"". FUCKING REAL ESTATE. THAT DOESN""T MAKE FUCKING SENSE BUT I HAVE TO LEARN IT AND IM STILL CONFUSED, IMMA CHATGPT MYSELF INTO EXPLAN REAL ESTATE LIKE FUCKING 5  
  
What my heart wants to do  
  
I wanted to a least live a nomadic life (for a few years), and not worry about all of this: Money, and the American 'Dream'. To visit numerous countries and to meet new people.  
  
And then live a type of aesthetic of ""old money"" or a ""luxurious life""  
  
I wanted to build a business and be a founder of a tech company or whatever.  
  
I wanted to provide stability not only for myself, but for my family. While me living in my dream and do what I love.  
  
I keep bitching about it and what 'my American self' wants to do  
  
I feel like, I'm destined to not go anywhere or move anywhere....  
  
I talked with a catholic priest near my campus about my problems in school and life and basically the goal as a believer is to ""get into heaven"". Like the ultimate goal to life is to go to heaven. To be closer to Jesus. I believe in it. I was born with it. However, it feels like I won't be able to do what my heart wants. My local priest who I usually go to Mass with because it's the only Vietnamese Catholic Church in the state (I think?) lightly implies that we shouldn't live a life that we want because God has a plan. So, am I destined to be miserable until I maybe go to heaven? Actually, I am not certain. Maybe because I automatically go to hell because of my addiction or any commandment i broke? Maybe because I didn't follow the right religion? The right denomination? Even some told me that I'll go to hell because of my faith. Some Catholics (or trads) that I'm doing this all wrong. But then again, it's like I have to stay in state and be dull as possible.  
  
Because of the fact my family immigrated here from the war, I have conflicting feelings. Yes, someday I want to move back to VN. Note that I am MEDIORCRE AT MY VIETNAMESE. in addition, I'll be considered a ""viet kieu"" or ""people of Vietnamese descent or who grew up in Vietnam but moved overseas."". I'm not sure how Vietnamese people think about this... IM NOT SURE WHAT MY PARENTS WILL THINK ABOUT THIS. MY DAD'S FAMILY MOVED TO THE US FOR A BETTER LIFE AND FOR POLITICAL REASONS FROM THE WAR OBVOULSLY JUST FOR ME TO GO BACK TO THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS FOUGHT?  
  
What actions I will take  
  
Aside from all of this. I'm taking some small, actionable steps to hopefully figure out what to do in my life and to see what are my priorities.  
  
Getting new skills and making projects I want to build to help others in my 'community'.: I mean, I see problems, and I have solutions. Not really sure if its something they like, but it does give me some time get more project experience and figuring out what I like to code and build. It could be a potential SaaS business and it's something small and im happy to fail. Also participating online hackathons are really cool so i'll be doing that in the summer.  
  
continue build a youtube audience on my dev journey. I know how building a brand works from other experiences, but idk I want to try it to keep myself busy alongside work an project.  
  
Starting a new club. I think all of my classmates need some community in the Software development field in campus and figure out what type of developer they can be and build awesome projects outside of school  
  
Go back to the gym. No brainer. I want to look good naked for myself obviously.  
  
Learn how to be a better student: I had shit grades right now. 5 classes wasn't the move for the greatest academic comeback of all time.  
  
Read more books: I miss them, idk why I found it boring before.  
  
Just touch grass and hang out with friends: I need to do that more.  
  
Uni therapy kind of doesn't work.  
  
Quick rant, but counselors never follow up on me even though they told me they will :/ So it's my responsibility to check up on myself.  
  
What im grateful for.  
  
A loving family, though I am misunderstood sometimes, but it's something I need to learn by learning Vietnamese.  
  
A house, clothes, a new job that pays a little more than my previous job, my friends that checks up on me, my support group, talking with God sometimes, meeting new people online, building a community, taking the first step to greatness... (i think)  
  
Final notes  
  
I felt way better writing this down. it made me understood myself a bit more everyday. but there are some things that might be controversial towards religion, relationships, careers. So please, criticize me. Educate me. because I'm the dumbest person alive. I'm always learning new things and new perspectives. And I don't go to this platform a lot, but I'll do my best to listen to everyone.  
  
So, Am I playing life on hard mode? or I'm making all of this hard on myself?  
  
TL;DR: I think it made this hard on myself, but I'll keep going",User_deleted,1

As in, I had not even coded my first hello world. I have been learning C for about 1-2 months.

Ive been sticking through it and honestly every time I see a project, I do not know where to start. I have been trying to learn through chatgpt giving me little exercises, for the beginner I get there pretty easily, but as soon as tasks go to a bit more advanced I cant do it. I get the solution, and after a while I can see how they came to that conclusion however if I had zero help and had to solve the problem on my own, I just dont think I have the IQ to do it.

Is this normal for beginners? Will I get there in the end? Its just everytime I try my hardest and my brain just struggles.

For the record, I did hard a-levels (UK), could do most of the maths in lesson after revising but this is just on another level entirely and I feel like CS students are the top of the top of the top, which I am not.

I know that they say coding is 90% practice and it has been helping, its just with large projects I just think it would take such a long long time practicing constantly to be able to get there - if at all.

ALSO, if anybody has good learning courses with exercises(because they help the most) please LET ME KNOW. I watched bro codes 4 hour long video and a lot of other videos, but for example they go through topics like loops in 8 minutes  and when it comes to applying what youve learned to projects I'd say it has barely helped, all the courses I see teach things for simple application but never a thorough explanation on how they can be used more advanced.",active,64
149f65b,1,2023-06-14,School Teacher help: Any way to get around memory limits for a teacher making end of year quizzes?,u/trickyfurball,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/149f65b/school_teacher_help_any_way_to_get_around_memory/,"Hi everyone! I'm a teacher who relies on Chat GPT to create quizzes for my students. Currently, I'm working on an ""end of class"" comprehensive quiz that encompasses content from seven smaller courses we've covered. The total text length for the quiz amounts to approximately 87,000 words.

The challenge I'm facing involves creating a complex prompt (**1026 words or 5879 characters)**. I want the prompt to generate a specific number of questions of a certain type while also referencing the corresponding reading materials. However, due to the prompt's length and the size of the 87,000-word text, I've encountered difficulties in getting Chat GPT or the playground to remember crucial elements. I even attempted to feed it only 1000 characters at a time, but that approach disrupts the necessary pattern for the overall output.

I recently came across the ""chatgpt-retrieval-plugin"" from OpenAI, which seems promising. Additionally, I've heard suggestions about utilizing embeddings and a vector database to resolve this issue, but I'm unsure where to begin. Am I overthinking it and there's a way to do it outside of spinning up a vector database and doing a bunch of terminal stuff? I'm not tooooo techical but enough to be capable. I have API access, and budget is not a concern when it comes to using it.

Do any of you have any tips or recommendations on how to tackle this challenge effectively? Thank you in advance!  


BTW: I allow my students to use chatGPT - i think it's important for them to learn about LLMs and AI. This is just me doing the same thing I allow them to - to better understand it",active,1

Would you be open to the idea of using a customized AI tutor? The tutor will provide answers based on the material you have learnt in school or university. For example, if a professor teaches you a certain method for solving a question the AI will be able to retrace the steps and provide an explanation as if the professor was explaining. I find that really helpfull especially when studying for my finals as I seem to sometimes forget the solvings and explanations. Also, the nice thing about this is that it all happens instantly no need to wait for your teacher or professor to answer. The difference between this and chatgpt is that you get a personalized tutor that goes hand in hand with the material you are taking at school or university.",active,0
14c31sw,1,2023-06-17,Bias against ChatGPT in Academia/Research,u/w1ngslikeeagles,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/14c31sw/bias_against_chatgpt_in_academiaresearch/,"I work with basic science and clinical research groups and have noticed a lot of misconceptions and fears about ChatGPT, preventing us from fully embracing its potential to fuel advancements in science.

Recently I used ChatGPT to draft around 90% of the introduction for a publication. My colleagues praised it as one of the best intros they had seen, but as soon as I mentioned the extensive use of ChatGPT, suddenly the work was invalidated. I was forced to rewrite the entire section without ChatGPT, even though the initial version was exceptional.

Another time we discovered a new phenomenon which required us to coin a term to accurately describe it. ChatGPT came up with a succinct and brilliant term that resonated with everyone in the lab. Our principle investigator had initially praised the term, but he must have talked to his colleagues about how students were using ChatGPT to ""take shortcuts"" or ""cheat"" because he decided to discard the term solely because it was coined by ChatGPT. We had to come up with an inferior replacement term that didn't do the phenomenon justice.

Finally there was a project that required extensive programming to develop a machine learning analytical approach, and we didn't have access to a developer. I spent the past 8 months developing thousands of lines of code with ChatGPT. The code worked great, and some student programmers reviewed it and were super impressed. While the PhDs in my lab were impressed with the results, they were critical since the scripts were not written by professionals and were hesitant to incorporate the code into the project. (They eventually came around.)

This bias against ChatGPT reminds me of the struggles faced by historically marginalized groups in science. Just like a century ago when ideas from women or people of color were discounted due to racial or sexist biases, today, we witness a similar distrust towards AI-generated ideas. We need to use AI to accelerate research, enhance creativity, and develop groundbreaking ideas that were previously beyond our reach. It's time to break free from the constraints of bias. Future generations will look back and judge us harshly for our biases which slowed scientific advancement.",User_deleted,0

This is part of a free newsletter and I figured it would be useful here too.

Meta's  plan to release an open-source commercial-friendly model puts  pressure  on Google and OpenAI. Nikon launches a campaign called 'Natural   Intelligence' to remind people that the real world is full of   incredible scenes that are best captured with a camera rather than   imagined with AI. Here are the top 5 articles of the week.

# A Peek at the Week: Top News

**🤖 Meta's Plan to Offer Free Commercial AI Models Puts Pressure on Google, OpenAI** [**(link)**](https://www.artisana.ai/articles/metas-plan-to-offer-free-commercial-ai-models-puts-pressure-on-google-and)  
Meta  is preparing to issue a  commercial license with the release of their  next open-source language  model, which it plans to make available for  commercial purposes for the  first time. This approach would represent a  vast departure from  closed-source language models like Google’s Bard  and OpenAI's ChatGPT  currently in commercial use, and it could spark a  ripple effect of  widespread adoption by companies that are on the  lookout for a more  versatile and affordable AI alternative.

**🧠 Deep Learning’s Diminishing Returns – Cost of Improvement Becoming Unsustainable** [**(link)**](https://spectrum.ieee.org/deep-learning-computational-cost)  
Deep  learning is a modern trend  in AI that has been moving from streamlined  systems based on expert  knowledge toward flexible statistical models.  The success of flexible  deep-learning models can be seen in machine  translation, where deep  learning has proven itself superior almost  everywhere it's applied. The  bad news is that this flexibility comes at  an enormous computational  cost, which is becoming unsustainable as  researchers are nearing the  frontier of what their tools can achieve.

**🦍 Gorilla: Large Language Model Connected with APIs** [**(link)**](https://shishirpatil.github.io/gorilla/)  
Gorilla  is a finetuned  LLaMA-based model that excels in writing API calls. It  can adapt to  test-time document changes, enabling flexible API updates  and version  changes. The successful integration of the retrieval system  with Gorilla  demonstrates the potential for LLMs to use tools more  accurately, keep  up with frequently updated documentation, and  consequently increase the  reliability and applicability of their  outputs.

# Voice Waves: Top Podcasts this Week

**Using Generative AI for Workflow Automation and Customized Emails** [**(link)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcAgsSKCm1o)  
Badine  AI is a workflow automation  tool that uses generative AI to automate  mundane tasks such as  copy-pasting and outreach emails. The podcast  discusses the use of  generative AI in automation and how it can be used  to customize emails  based on LinkedIn profiles. The speaker explains  that their company,  Genotaur, focuses on building automation for  end-users and offers a  choice of models to use, such as GPT 3.5 or GPT  4. They also emphasize  the importance of building abstraction layers  and training tools that  are independent of specific models, as the  technology will commoditize  over time. The podcast also discusses the  benefits of deterministic  execution in automation scripts, which are  like normal programs that  always do the same thing every time. The  podcast concludes by  highlighting the positive impact of AI technology  in various fields,  including healthcare, education, and productivity.

The chatbots helped the students identify which pathogens could inflict the most damage, and even provided information not commonly known among experts. The students were offered lists of companies who might assist with DNA synthesis, and suggestions on how to trick them into providing services. This is arguably the strongest case against open-sourcing AI \[source: [https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/new-ai-fear-making-it-easy-for-anyone-to-mint-dangerous-new-viruses/ar-AA1cCVq6](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/new-ai-fear-making-it-easy-for-anyone-to-mint-dangerous-new-viruses/ar-AA1cCVq6)\]
* **Intel will start shipping 12-qubit quantum processors to a few universities and academic research labs:** 12 qubits is still not a big deal, it’s not a lot of computing power. However, as we all know, technology, and very specifically processing power, is subject to Moore’s Law, which for those of you who actually had a social life in high school and now you don’t know what Moore’s Law is, simply means that technology gets better, faster, stronger, and cheaper as time goes by. And, compared to regular processors, quantum processors are orders of magnitude faster. Ok, how is this related to AI? I’m glad you asked. Advancements in AI pretty much come down to two things – data and computing power. We already have entire oceans of data, or, rather, Google and Facebook do, and the biggest challenge to making God-like AI is the laggings in processing power. And when that stops being a problem because of quantum computers, when we plug AI into quantum computers… I guess we’ll finally see if we get to live in a Kumbaya Utopia where we all love each other and don’t have to work unless we feel like it, or, you know, Skynet meets the Matrix type of thing. \[source: [https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/06/intel-to-start-shipping-a-quantum-processor/](https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/06/intel-to-start-shipping-a-quantum-processor/) \]

However, I think we’ve kinda seen this story play out before, since Amazon tried to automate delivery with drones a few years ago, and regulatory setbacks prevented their efforts. I’m not sure how this particular Chick-fil-A restaurant has pulled this off, it may not be entirely legal, but let’s see how this develops. \[source: [https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/north-fulton-county/metro-atlanta-chick-fil-a-tests-delivery-robots-equipped-with-artificial-intelligence/GSLBEX2NFJAQFGE3H7KW3YFOCU/](https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/north-fulton-county/metro-atlanta-chick-fil-a-tests-delivery-robots-equipped-with-artificial-intelligence/GSLBEX2NFJAQFGE3H7KW3YFOCU/) \]
* **Researchers from Microsoft and UC Santa Barbara Propose LONGMEM: An AI Framework that Enables LLMs to Memorize Long History:** As you may know, even the most advanced AI bots like ChatGPT can only take input of up to a certain length, and you can still use several prompts to add more input, but this way of functioning is still limited, as the chatbot doesn’t really have long-term memory, doesn’t really learn from your own specific actions and adjust itself based on your input. If that were possible, a whole other world of features and possibilities would open up for AI. Well, the proposed LONGMEM framework should enable language models to cache, to keep in memory long-form prior context or knowledge, which will kinda give LLMs superpowers and we will likely start seeing a lot more new applications. Exciting stuff. \[source: [https://www.marktechpost.com/2023/06/16/researchers-from-microsoft-and-uc-santa-barbara-propose-longmem-an-ai-framework-that-enables-llms-to-memorize-long-history/](https://www.marktechpost.com/2023/06/16/researchers-from-microsoft-and-uc-santa-barbara-propose-longmem-an-ai-framework-that-enables-llms-to-memorize-long-history/) \]
* **AI used to catch a thief**: A video on Facebook is going viral, a person was caught on a security camera stealing stuff from some street artist kids in the Philippines, and the Internet rose to the occasion – social media users used AI to sharpen and enhance the image of the thief, sent the pic to the kids, and they gave it to the police. The authorities were able to recover the bag, but one cellphone was missing. The suspect is identified but still at large. The implications of this are not certain. This is still an AI-generated image, it can very easily be inaccurate, and the wrong person might easily get punished even when innocent. \[source: [https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1307441943456719](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1307441943456719]) \]

No, seriously, **Chinese lifelong president Xi Jinping tells Bill Gates he welcomes U.S. AI tech in China**. Well, of course he does, China wants as much Western technology as it can get its hands on. Why? To copy it, duh. This comes after Microsoft pulled back some of its best AI talent from their Chinese offices back to Canada, as they feared their talent would be either poached by Chinese startups, or even approached by the government in some way. I don’t think Microsoft will go back in China after that. \[source: [https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinas-xi-tells-bill-gates-he-welcomes-us-ai-tech-china-2023-06-16/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinas-xi-tells-bill-gates-he-welcomes-us-ai-tech-china-2023-06-16/)\]
* **Congress is considering whether AI can hold patents.** Last month, scientists at the MIT used AI to discover the first new antibiotic since the 80s. The new drug was identified from a library of nearly 7,000 drug compounds. They used a machine-learning model that they trained to evaluate whether a chemical compound will inhibit the growth of the bacteria that causes the infections. Back in April, the Supreme Court declined to consider the case of Stephen Thaler, a computer scientist who wanted to patent a beverage holder and an emergency light beacon that were designed entirely by AI, without any human input. Thaler’s application was shot down by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office because only humans can be inventors, and the decision was upheld by lower courts. But! In South Africa, an AI system was listed as the inventor and granted a patent. That’s the situation lawmakers fear, innovation escaping to greener pastures. Tons of experts debate and disagree on this matter. I don’t think granting patents to AI makes sense. Ideally, the patent should be granted to the people that designed that specific AI training algorithm, and the people who provided the data it was trained on, and, of course, the person running the algo, since AI still can’t run itself. It’s a tricky matter anyway, I’m curious to see what happens. \[source: [https://godanriver.com/news/nation-world/government-politics/congress-ponders-whether-artificial-intelligence-should-have-the-power-of-the-patent/article\_c5d31741-1d16-5529-86e4-ea53c89eb95b.html](https://godanriver.com/news/nation-world/government-politics/congress-ponders-whether-artificial-intelligence-should-have-the-power-of-the-patent/article_c5d31741-1d16-5529-86e4-ea53c89eb95b.html)\]

* Speaking of Meta, they have bigger problems than some kids skipping school by using their voice tools to call their teachers pretending they are their parents. **Meta lost a third of their AI talent last year.** Not sure where these people went, looks like some went to OpenAI, and others just burned out. To make things worse, they didn’t even get a shoutout from the White House at the AI leadership summit back in May. And to make things even worse, just 26% of Meta employees believe that Zuck is doing a good job leading the company in these turbulent times. I’m gonna go contrarian here and say that Zuck will rally his troops and that Meta may catch up to its other tech titan siblings. I mean, I don’t believe this wholeheartedly, but I think he has a shot. They do have a ton of data after all, and they can always find other AI nerds to work for them. They will open-source their LLM Llama, they added some AI to Facebook and Instagram, and this Voicebox thing will probably be pretty good. Plus, I think Zuckerberg is one of those wartime CEOs that do better in uncertain times, when the stakes are high, and underperform in boring times when nothing seems to happen, which was the period of several years before ChatGPT. Not betting the house on it, but I think Zuck will pull a rabbit out of the hat and correct Meta’s course in the AI waters. \[source: [https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/meta-lost-third-ai-researchers-152058353.html](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/meta-lost-third-ai-researchers-152058353.html)\]
* I found this interesting chart on Twitter posted by user AI\_decoded\_ (although I’m not sure it’s theirs because I saw other accounts posting it as well). It shows the increase of assets in certain asset classes, as far as I can tell (the labeling is a bit confusing to me), and we can see that AI has had quite a nice growth since the end of 2022. The implication that the creators of this chart are trying to make is that we may be in an AI bubble, but even if we are, the people that are getting educated on this will benefit one way or the other. I’m not so sure I agree about the bubble part. There is a non-zero chance that the line for AI starts going down today and never goes back up again. That is a real possibility. I don’t think it’s likely, but it’s still a possibility. Personally, I’m going all in on AI myself, with pretty much all of my businesses and entrepreneurial efforts. And I definitely have some skin in the game here, as the Youtube channel really takes a lot of time and resources to produce, even though it probably doesn’t look like that. \[source: [https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd6c748xw2pzm8.cloudfront.net%2Fprod%2F43b55d30-54e7-11eb-9358-dbfa417c7fba-standard.png?dpr=1&fit=scale-down&quality=highest&source=next&width=700](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd6c748xw2pzm8.cloudfront.net%2Fprod%2F43b55d30-54e7-11eb-9358-dbfa417c7fba-standard.png?dpr=1&fit=scale-down&quality=highest&source=next&width=700)\]
* Since we’re talking about bubbles, **investors might be aware of the potential AI bubble, and they still don’t seem to care**. Extreme valuations of companies that haven’t actually done anything yet are signs of a potential bubble in the start-up space, says Thomas Rice, portfolio manager for Perpetual’s Global Innovation Share Fund. Even Sam Altman says things like “It is definitely like the new bubble – all the people that were working on crypto a few years ago are now working on AI”. Fair enough, that’s definitely true, and as a sidenote, I like Altman’s approach of always quieting down the hype and trying to ground people’s expectations in reality. The good thing about bubbles in general is that some people manage to make money in them. The bad thing about bubbles is that the people who end up making money are usually scumbags. It ends up being just one big game of musical chairs – people invest in companies they don’t know much about, and when most of those companies crash and burn, everyone except the scumbags loses money. But there’s one key detail I don’t see mentioned here – and that’s the very strong possibility this is not a bubble. Look, I love crypto, I’ve been both a student and a creator in that space as well, and I still think it has a lot of potential, but I can tell you this much – the general public never really got on board. Crypto was mostly confined to crypto bros selling each other crypto things. Bitcoin is and always has been a financial revolution, Ethereum will likely become a real and actually used platform at some point, and there are a few other altcoins in the ocean of shitcoins that have real-world use cases. But chances are, if you go to your local store and try to pay with Bitcoin, which is the most popular cryptocurrency by far, you will only get a few strange looks. ChatGPT and AI, on the other hand, are already used by real people, real professionals, every single day, and there’s no going back. That’s the fundamental difference between AI and crypto. Sure, AI may be overhyped a bit right now, but I guarantee you that the promise of generating content for practically no cost and having infinite intelligence at your disposal is too big for all of these governments and companies and entrepreneurs to stop pursuing AI. The genie is out of the bottle, people will only use AI more, and that’s why AI is essentially not a bubble in the long term. \[source: [https://www.afr.com/technology/why-investors-are-knowingly-buying-into-an-ai-bubble-20230618-p5dhht](https://www.afr.com/technology/why-investors-are-knowingly-buying-into-an-ai-bubble-20230618-p5dhht)\]

Since posting the situation has escalated greatly with the department head at my school just handing this off to one of the school administrators, who handed off the to principal, who then handed it off to be dealt with by the superintendent.

Hes going off 1-2 AI detectors he found online. During our meeting he showed me the AI detector flagging 3 sentences out of my 6 page essay as AI generated at 4% human and another student in the class's being 98% human. He thinks if I truly did not use Chatgpt, the number would be a lot higher, but keep in mind its 3 sentences describing a well-known person. I've presented the following information to the superintendent and he still wants more evidence and I don't know what to give him.

1. **Proof of the detectors not working:** I showed him how the constitution and bible get flagged as less than 10% human by these detectors. He says he was surprised and did not understand why the detectors say that, but is still standing by his own judgement. In addition to this, I showed him my teachers own writing from their personal website be flagged as AI (it was from 2010), and he again just repeated he was confused by it, but still upheld my teachers opinion.)
2. **Other detectors not flagging the few sentences as AI-Generated** ***(included OpenAi's own detector)***
3. **Examples of my other writing being very very similar in style:** My school admin said to me ""How do we know you didn't use AI on these assignments as well?""
4. **When he compared my writing to the other students, I told him that everyone has different writing styles**

Based on the meeting I had with him, he's basically only going off the detectors, so could someone here maybe suggest some piece of writing that's not AI-generated, but gets flagged as AI-generated so I can show him.

Teachers and classmates usually liked me but remarked that I was quiet and shy, and then in college that read as being passive-aggressive and aloof. Trying to be friendlier and more outgoing came off the wrong way. I was socially maladjusted until my final year of school. Part of this was moving across the country where cultural norms differed, part of it was trying to depart from the (bleughghghhgh) ""gifted"" label while having ADHD, and there's more that's not really worth getting into. 

But I tried to do a couple of prerequisites for a graduate degree after my break and had two very different reactions. In one class, I was a great student, exceeded expectations, broke the curve, and the professor wanted me to do a Master's at that institution. In the other, I was artificial, sycophantic, lazy, and a cheater (the accusation came out of left field--it was over a written submission with a 1% plagiarism score and I would not trust ChatGPT to do statistics). The first professor answered emails quickly and graded things in a few days. The latter would tell us an exam was over these few chapters and then surprise us with something else entirely, then would give everyone an 80 when we all failed. When I tried to improve the dynamic, she asked if I needed accommodations. 

I'm pretty scared of this happening again.

Or at least I don’t think I have seen any posts about it.  I am checking it out to see what it is all about and to feel it out as a destructive force or something to teach about.

I am writing minor documents for internal purposes at my university.  For example one of them is just a report for a committee.  My normal process is never smooth, I jam stuff down and then I edit through it and rewrite sentences, make things more consistent and etc.  I am still doing that and after a few rounds there are sentences or groups of sentence that I still find awkward or not as clear as I would like.  Or I like the content of what I wrote but I think it could be better organized for flow.  So I took these small portions and ask ChatGPT to smooth them out or reorganize them.  It gives back some pretty good results though I still edit these to be more to my liking.

I am finding this extremely helpful. It is not completely earth shattering but it also beats going to a colleague and asking them for suggestions you won’t get back for at least a couple days.

I am leading an effort at my institution to get my colleagues to pay attention to AI and to understand that it is going to impact teaching and learning in significant ways.

My message to them has been that these ""detectors"" are not accurate.  The only thing you can do is have a conversation with the student, share your perspective, and ask them to share theirs.  Additionally, it's time to learn about AI and LLMs so you have a plan for next semester.

Recently, I have also seen a disturbing trend (mainly while paying attention to r/ChatGPT), of several students (high school through college) who have been falsely accused of academic dishonesty because the so-called detectors flagged their work.  The disturbing part is that it seems educators are taking these detectors at face value, and penalizing students solely on the basis of those reports. 

So fellow users of AI in education:  How do we get educators (a) to pay attention to and learn about LLMs, (b) understand that they should be teaching students how to use LLMS (therefore they need to change the way they teach), and (c) stop relying on AI-text ""detectors?""",active,1

**Education:**

* GPA: 3.9 Unweighted; 4.091 Weighted (Might be higher because of APs)
* APs: AP English Language and Composition, AP Computer Science Principles (got an A in both classes). My school district doesn't let you take APs before junior year.
* Classes I didn't receive an A in: Precalculus (B), Algebra 2 (B+), Chemistry (A-)
* SAT Score: 1330 (93rd Percentile)
* Graduation Year: 2024
* Senior Schedule: AP Physics I and II, AP Literature and Composition, Core Calculus, Physical Education/Health IV, AP Computer Science A, AP Economics
* Intended Major: Computer Science/Software Engineering
* Relevant Coursework:Computer Science: I took Computer Science as my major throughout all four years. In this major, I have made projects in a few programming languages including Python, Swift (self-taught), and coming next year, Java.

**Projects/Apps:**

* PhysCal - Physics Calculator App for iOS and macOS (Swift Student Challenge submission but planning on working on it more to submit to the App Store)
   * [Screen Recording: PhysCal Swift Student Challenge Demo · CleanShot Cloud](https://share.cleanshot.com/Sj3zssQG)

Before I begin, I think he (and I) are in a really good place. With that being said, these are my reactions:

>Math team: top 9 scorer in the state, 2-3 national top 10 of math subjects Mu Alpha Theta

I haven't done any of that since middle school, when I did the Princeton Math Competition. In high school, math seemed to take a turn, largely due to the pandemic, and I had to work hard to come back up. Despite having a B in Precalc, I will study and get tutoring all summer on Calc topics, so I can have a primer and do well in Core Calc or AB, one of the biggest mistakes I made for Precalc.

&#x200B;

>state varsity swimmer

Oh, gosh. The only times I really swim are for fun when I visit a friend's house with a pool in summer. That's how I like it. Swimming is like meditation for me. It is very relaxing to casually swim in a quiet, heated pool. I don't want to turn everything into a competition. I'm not really an athlete at all TBH and I don't want to be forced to compete in my ""relaxation activities"". Prefer spending my time coding, studying, or watching tech reviews.

>marching band

I haven't done any serious musical extracurriculars, and in general, aren't a very musical person. However, I have written educational parody songs for fun (with the help of ChatGPT) to use as study guides for myself and others. While I am by no means, musically gifted and have never practiced music outside of school (I can't really play instruments and don't have a great vocal range and literally used my MacBook speakers and iPhone Voice Memos app to record the songs), I believe that using music creatively to help study, may be better than pure musical talent as students have said my songs have helped them study. In other words, my musical skill is not the voice but the creativity. While an AI language model may have helped me write it, the ideas are all mine. After all, if I want to be a software engineer, it truthfuly does not matter whether you can play the trumpet well, but it does matter if you can write a song that can help another student study and increase their grades.

>UW gpa 3.9/ W 4.3

Around the same as me, especially when APs come into the mix.

>SAT 750 r/w 790 math

1540; really impressive score. 210 points higher than me. I'm going to study a lot this summer though, with a tutor and bootcamp. I hope I could come close to that.

>He’s going through the free Harvard CS50 course this summer.

The Harvard part is very impressive but I chose to attend the precollege programs at Stevens Institute of Technology instead as I wanted a true college experience where I live on campus, go to classes taught by college professors, and get to use all the amenities on campus.

I tried Complete model and Chat model. Chat model was basically braindead, it gave some technically valid response at first (but very shallow and uncreative, unlike ChatGPT chat-bot), but then it just started responding with whatever she want to write on the topic (or switched to other similar topics), without closely listening to instructions. 

As for Complete model, its responses made more sense, but was either very repetitive and uninteresting, always insisting on the same subjects with the use of the same words (even with Temperature, Frequency and the rest parameters/penalties tweaked) or was writing something very off-topic without focus on the subject I set initially.

I will probably leave aside idea of incorporating API into my project since it seems very costly for my language because it requires more tokens (I wanted it to be free for use because the feature seemed to be very small) but just interested are there any developers which successfully incorporated API into their project.

I think I'm a pretty average student overall; I graduated with a 3.65 (\~3.55 sGPA if I had to guess) from a large public state university. Barely had any motivation to attend class, played thousands of hours of videogames instead, and crammed lecture recordings at 2x speed during all-nighters \~12 hours before every exam (yes, every single exam across 4 years). 

Although I think I understand new concepts relatively quickly, I suffer from a lot of the same pitfalls as anyone else: getting distracted extremely easily, losing motivation quickly, getting burned out, doomscrolling for hours after answering one practice question, poor sleep schedule, etc. I *probably* have ADHD, but I've never been officially diagnosed. To be frank, in our current era of ultralow attention spans, screen-split subway surfer TikTok podcasts, I think it's getting increasingly difficult to diagnose who *really* has the disorder.

As such, I was pleasantly surprised (re: shocked, floored, astonished) to find out today that I got a 524 on the 5/18 exam. I took this exam two years out from undergrad and 3 yrs out from my last core premed class while working a full-time job in biotech. I attribute this score to a few main things that I'll detail below. **Disclaimer: this is not general advice, just what I found worked for me.** 

1. Skipped content review. Didn't read a single page of a single book. Started UWorld from Day 1 (4 months out from exam day). Found that doing practice questions kept me much more engaged than reading textbooks, and the UWorld explanations are very good at explaining new concepts. Any time I felt I needed further clarification, I used Google (and this subreddit, thank you all so much) *liberally* until I felt I understood the concept.
2. Studied somewhat consistently. Initially did 30 questions a day, and figured I'd be able to complete UW in 2 months. However, around a quarter of the way through, I got extremely burned out and didn't study at all for a full month. This shifted up my schedule significantly, so I had to switch to doing 60 questions a day until a week before test day. 
3. I was lucky enough to not have to focus too much on CARS (always been a voracious reader, maybe that helped? not sure), but I ignored that section entirely until FLs. Focused primarily on B/B and C/P, where I had significant knowledge gaps. There's not that many P/S questions on UWorld, so I was through with them well before the other two sections. While doing UW: **take screenshots any time you come across a good graphical explanation (a lot of them overlap, but they're all amazing).** I'm a ""visual learner"" so the UW graphics were indispensable in helping me learn a lot of these concepts/pathways. 
4. Used MileDown's deck just to stay on top of P/S after I completed the UW questions. I don't think it's a particularly excellent deck or anything; it's a bit dated, a lot of the cards are very lengthy/verbose, and there a number of small errors. However, it served its purpose of keeping me refreshed on P/S content, and I think it does a good job of covering most if not all of the terms you'll see in the section. Any gaps in MileDown were covered in the FLs and the 90-page LazyOCD P/S sheet (which I skimmed through the last few days before my exam). My background in P/S prior to this exam came from AP Psych in 12th grade and Psych 101 during my sophomore year of college, and I probably came in knowing \~30-40% of the MCAT content from there.
5. I want to re-emphasize a point I made earlier. ANY time I ever had doubts/questions about a concept, I Googled and dug deep until I felt like I understood. Towards the end I even used ChatGPT (it does an excellent job of understanding your question, better than Google ever could). 
6. I took notes on Google Sheets any time a concept felt overwhelming and returned to the sheets every time it came up again. I especially struggled with memorizing random physics questions (lens, magnets, circuits) electrochemistry, random metabolites from central metabolism, etc. These all went into the doc that I would continually refer to while doing UW (same doc I saved the screenshots of their graphics). I can share these sheets if anyone wants, but they're not comprehensive so I'm not sure how useful they'll be to anyone. 
7. QPacks and Section Bank are probably excellent resources, but I admit I don't have of a concrete idea. I was pretty burned out from studying towards the end of this process, so I only did the two biology QPacks scored \~85% (did each QPack in one sitting). Did not do C/P QPacks or Section Bank even though I had planned to. 
8. Started doing FLs \~5 weeks out from test day. Took my last exam 4 days prior. Reviewed all incorrect questions and quickly went over the ones I got right to make sure I didn't just guess them correctly. Here are the stats:
   1. **FL5 (04/09):** 517 (130, 130, 129, 128)
   2. **FL1 (04/15):** 514 (129, 129, 128, 128)
   3. **FL2 (04/22:** 518 (130, 128, 130, 130)
   4. **FL3 (04/29):** 516 (129, 127, 132, 128) 
   5. **FL4 (05/14):** 519 (132, 130, 128, 129)

I will admit, I didn't take the FLs in an accurate, simulated test environment. Especially for the earlier ones, I would take naps in between (re: horrible sleep schedule), make food, use the restroom, etc. Never paused and interrupted a section, but I would take *long* breaks in between sections. In FL3 and FL4, I kept the timer strict, but was still very lax and napped *during* the sections, leading me to speed through the last 15 questions before I ran out of time. This may explain some of the discrepancy between my FL average and the actual thing. Of course, on test day, I had adrenaline to keep me up and I can safely say I did not take any naps at any point during the exam. 

I felt good coming out of the exam and was hopeful that I'd get somewhere between a 516-518. But I certainly did ***not*** come out feeling like I had scored a 524 (does anyone?) 

Anyway... wow. This turned out to be quite a bit longer than I had initially hoped, but I guess I needed to vent somewhere (and procrastinate on writing my personal statement). Thanks again to everyone in this subreddit who previously asked the same questions I had and all those who answered them.  My DMs are to anyone who need any specific questions answered or further clarification!",active,43

**In a recent interview with Fox Business, Julia Dixon,** the founder of **ES.Ai,** an Ai tool for college applications, emphasized the importance of students incorporating artificial intelligence into their educational journey.

She argued that students who don't leverage AI resources will find themselves at a disadvantage, as AI in education is as inevitable as the internet or a search engine.

Dixon, a former tutor, compared the use of AI in brainstorming ideas, outlining essays, and editing students' work to the role of a human tutor. She stressed that Ai should not replace students' work but assist them, and it's not cheating as long as ethical tools and practices are followed.

Dixon hopes that Ai tools like **ES.Ai** will increase students' access to tutoring and educational resources.

She warned that ***students need to learn how to make AI ""work for them""*** so it doesn't become ""a replacement for them."" She reiterated that students who aren't learning how to use AI properly will be at a disadvantage.

In a related development, New York City Public Schools had initially banned the use of ChatGPT, a generative AI chatbot, in classrooms, but later reversed the decision

I let them use Grammarly, but it’s hard to incorporate DeepL or ChatGPT in a way that has pedagogical value. As soon as I allow them to use them in class, I’m sure they’ll just copy and paste everything and learn nothing. But then, it is almost impossible to ban them or prove it when there’s a suspicion.

A pupil with identity confusion wore elf ears in the playground, confusing and drawing attention from other pupils who didn’t understand. I could see that the boy was beginning to feel intimidated by a few approaching boys. I called him over and asked what he was wearing and why he had them in school. I explained that the ears were not school uniform and told him to remove them and put them back to class. He understood and obliged. 

Later that afternoon I was accused by a teaching assistant of victim blaming and that the boy should be able to wear whatever he wants without feeling threatened. I  responded explaining that we are responsible for all the pupils in school. That they are all vulnerable and have their own needs. Supporting their playtimes are hard enough. We don’t need water guns, Polaroid cameras and now elf ears (things this pupil has brought into school in the past) in school unless the teachers and parents have agreed.  

The teaching assistant replied “ideally everyone gets to wear whatever they want without feeling threatened”. I replied, “yes, ideally, I agree.”

He walked off looking upset. I’m not sure why. Later on the deputy head calls me in and said that the assistant spoke to another teacher who then accused me of  victim blaming, explaining that elf ears are part of the lgbt community. 

I thought the student was lucky that I was there to preemptively defuse an escalating situation. But  the accusations have left me doubting my actions and considering how to protect myself from future accusation. If it were to happen again, I might put my own interests before the student’s

Our classes are 20 or 40 minute conversations on a topic of the students' choosing. Since my WPM is solid, during these classes, I typeout the entire transcript of the students words exactly as they say it since the company provides an AI-generated transcript, but I want to capture all of the student's small mistakes (omitting 's' for plural nouns, verb tenses, article usage, etc.).

Some of these classes focus on paraphrasing, corrections, and giving depth to the speaker's words while we're there together in the Zoom call. However, many others prefer to take this opportunity to speak as much as possible with no interruption. In this case, I transcribe their words by hand and go back after classes to paraphrase the entire conversation to add new idioms and vocabulary with a prompt like this:

>I want you to act as an English tutor and improver. The following is the transcript of a spoken conversation with an English learner. Paraphrase their words to make it more natural, conversational, and professional. Original: \[their words\]

&#x200B;

This works well enough, especially since it goes above and beyond the company's requirements for post-lesson, but I try to take my job seriously and want to give as detailed feedback as possible for students to learn from. If I do this by hand, however, it can take the better part of an hour whereas the company allocates 10-20 minutes to do it.

What I really want to do with this paraphrasing is far more complex. I'd like a prompt(s) that can:

1. Help the students understand what exact part of their original sentence I am trying to rephrase **and** why. If I were doing this by hand, I would underline/italicize a part of the sentence to emphasize this, e.g. ""I went *to park* this weekend to hang out with *some friend*."" I would include a note that explains the reasons that this phrasing is wrong.
2. I would like to keep the rewording of these incorrect phrases intact, relatively. Instead of changing ""This morning I *wake up* at 6 and *take shower* before I *went office*"" to the more natural, ""This morning I rolled out of bed at 6 to take a shower before heading into the office"", I would like to phrase these specific instances to read as ""This morning I **woke up** at 6:00 and **took a shower** before I **went to the office.""**
3. Regarding any new vocabulary or idioms that ChatGPT introduces into its paraphrased version, I would like it to offer a definition at the end of each paragraph giving a definition and additional example phrase for students to use.

&#x200B;

I know this is asking a lot, and maybe ChatGPT simply is not at this point yet, but I know there are ways that I can make my job a lot less strenuous while providing higher quality content to my students. If anyone could give some pointers or suggestions on how to go forward with this and test some solutions, I'd be deeply appreciative and even willing to offer some compensation for your time and effort.",User_deleted,2
14jrlcy,14,2023-06-26,Do your lecturers indirectly encourage you to use ChatGPT?,u/xlightning116,universityofauckland,https://www.reddit.com/r/universityofauckland/comments/14jrlcy/do_your_lecturers_indirectly_encourage_you_to_use/,"I came across a post that a student from a NZ university got in trouble for signing up for ChatGPT:

I am asking because some of my lecturers from the Statistics department talks about ChatGPT and kinda indirectly encourage us to use it help us and supplement our learning, not in a way for us to plagiarize. Although it is against the rules to copy our answers from ChatGPT, but I'm assuming it is encouraged and therefore not against the rules to use ChatGPT just like WolframAlpha, Symbolab etc..",User_deleted,18

My friend and I are long-time language learners, and while we've been able to make progress - speaking confidently in a new language with native people has been a difficult barrier.

To address this issue we are considering (finishing) building an app where you can have open, free-flowing conversations where you listen and speak out loud with an AI like ChatGPT, to help gain confidence actually speaking in a foreign language. You could even ask the AI for grammar or vocabulary help.

Before we build everything, we are looking to get feedback - Would this be useful for your students? Is this an us problem, or also something common other people face? This is the full informative website: 👉 **https://getconvo.webflow.io**

14lairj,1,2023-06-28,What’s your use case for GPT-4?,u/Tiger00012,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/14lairj/whats_your_use_case_for_gpt4/,"I’ve seen posts here where people use it to tailor their resume to job descriptions, solve homework questions, write/rewrite essays, use it as a personal counselor. 

I wonder if there are other unconventional use case’s I’m missing for GPT-4. 

I personally use GPT-4 as my personal teacher with infinite patience. If I’m interested in certain topic, I usually start reading a textbook on it, but more often that not I get confused by what’s in the book. So I ask chatgpt to explain it using the prompts like “Explain the intuition behind X”. “Provide an actual example with explanation”. I also experimented with “I’m a student studying X. You are a professor with extensive knowledge in X. Explain Y to me in simple terms”. 

My studying progress has sped up exponentially with chatgpt. I’ve already covered 2 courses in like 2-3 months. The ability to solve math problems correctly and provide explanation is a game changer for gpt4. 

What’s your personal use case?",active,5

I just wanted to write this post to potentially help out the grade 11s who will be heading to grade 12 next year on what I wish I knew before going into grade 12. I would say grade 12 for me was quite successful of a year and I was able to make 3/4 of my top choices (if you want more info on that you can go through my post history). Here is a semi-formal compilation of advice and general statements I wish I knew that I wanted to share with this subreddit. If you disagree with the things I say, that's cool. However please keep it chill in the comments, please.

**Tip #1 - Read this Subreddit Cautiously**

I'd first like to preface this by saying that this subreddit is a great resource. I learned many practical things which helped me get into my preferred programs such as how to write good supplementary applications/the AIF, how to do video interviews properly, etc. However, I would also like to explore the flip side of that which is this subreddit can also be a breeding ground for misinformation.

Many of the people on this subreddit are high school students. Although many of them have the best intentions in mind, for questions relating to specific information on programs I highly recommend going to individual university subreddits, discords, or rather talking to the students in those programs 1:1 (whether it be through Linkedin or specific workshops organized by your University) about their experiences. There are many misconceptions I have seen surrounding Waterloo and UofT Engineering/CS that many students I talked to completely debunked. This also goes to the other side too, do not simply spread rumors about particular programs when you've never been in that program. If you do, provide proof of some kind to back up your claims.

This isn't just limited to programs though, things such as specific dates of when Universities will send out offers, whether or not they are rolling, etc. are also complete speculations from last year (or sometimes even completely made up). I remember reading comments on this or another subreddit saying Waterloo Engineering offers will go out on a particular week but nothing happened.

The main point is, PLEASE do your own research before going to this subreddit. Consult multiple, trustworthy sources, not just one. Use your critical judgment and decide whether or not you think a claim being made is fictitious or not. It will save you a lot of stress.

**Tip #2 - Early Admission and Grade 11 Marks**

When I was in grade 11 going into grade 12 I thought early admission was similar to the American system where there are specific dates when you apply to universities early (usually in the fall), and the universities will read those applications early and reject or deny you based on them and your grades (usually in winter). However early admission in the Ontario system means something entirely different.

Everyone will be given a pin number, where they can register into the application system (OUAC) and you will apply only once. When you apply, some universities will send you a supplementary written portion you need to submit by a particular date to move your application forward. Whereas others send you absolutely nothing. For the ones that don't send anything they will only look at your grades from semester 1 midterms to semester 2 midterms, and if your marks meet the cut they'll accept you. That is early acceptance in a nutshell. This is where the question of ""Do grade 11 marks matter or not?"" comes in and I will answer... yes and no.

For most, usually less competitive, programs, it will (only for early admission though). For example, I received my TMU CS offer literally 1 week after I applied in mid-November. Which means they looked at my grade 11 marks. For competitive programs in CS/Engineering on the other hand, at select universities such as UofT or Waterloo, they won't matter as much if at all really. I got my offer from Waterloo CE in late May where only grade 12 marks were registered into the system. However, for UofT, they did look at my grade 11 physics mark cause I didn't have the grade 12 equivalent in the March round. So really my advice would be to focus on prerequisites in grade 11 as those can be useful later on.

**Tip #3 - Have Balance**

This is going to be a cliche point, so I won't expand on it too much. Yes, study as hard as you can, grade 12 is important. However, in my opinion, you should always have some balance. I studied hard however I always tried to give myself breathing room whenever I could. It'll help you from being burnt out and improve your grades ironically.

**Tip #4 - Start Supplmentaries Early**

This mainly applies to competitive programs but also scholarships too.

By starting your supplementaries early you will have more time to think about your work and whether or not you think it has quality. When I write something for the first time, in my head I may think it is perfect in the moment. However, when I re-read it or ask another person to read it, there are many flaws and nitpicky things that are revealed (kinda like this post lol). By starting early you will have more chances to examine and debate your ideas and thus produce higher quality work.  I saw too many people leave their supplementary last minute and I think it would have helped if they had more time to think.

Always let another person review your writing. Ideally, it should be a private university admissions counselor (one which is legitimate) but obviously, most people ( including me) do not have such resources. So, maybe talk to your English teacher or someone you trust as even though they may not know about the specifics of university admissions they can help refine your grammar or your writing style. All of which are important.

**Tip #5 - It Is Not Over Until It Is Over**

I remember the first English assignment I received had a mark in the 80s. It was quite worrying because I had doubts about whether I would be able to make it into my top choices due to a low English mark. However, as the semester progressed. I gradually improved, asking my teacher for feedback, and naturally, my marks increased and I finished with a mid-90 in English. The same thing happened in physics too. Just because you receive 1 bad mark or 2 it absolutely does not mean you won't finish with a good final mark. Just keep on grinding and working hard (but also efficiently... I'll get to that soon). Even if the results go poorly, you at least could show you worked hard for it.

Conversely, do not get too relaxed when you get in. Although most conditionals (certain averages you need to maintain in order to go to your university) are quite easy to earn. I know multiple people who stopped studying and got too close to the sun, especially near exam season. I highly recommend you do well in the first 70-85% of the course so that when exams come around the stress levels won't be too hard on you. That was the case for me and I am eternally thankful for my past self.

**Tip #6 - Pre-Study**

This might be controversial but I recommend pre-studying the material in the summer before grade 12. Obviously don't go all out and enjoy your summer but learn the fundamentals. Things such as basic algebra, graphing, solving quadratics, etc. are too often missed yet are highly important to succeeding in certain courses like math and physics. And maybe if you are really ambitious go and cover grade 12 material. There are many great resources online such as Ms. Havrot for Ontario grade 12 curriculum, Professor Leonard for calculus, Walter Lewin for physics, etc. Additionally, there are free textbook PDFs out there if you look deep enough. I pre-studied advanced functions and calc over the summer and it has been EXTREMELY useful to me now.

**Tip #7 - Work Efficiently**

If you want to study less for higher marks. Study efficiently. Don't just read your notes, actively try to recall everything from your brain and put it onto a piece of paper. There is wayyyy more theory going into this but you can search for active learning on YouTube or Google. Secondly, focus on things you don't understand. Going through 100 easy problems you are confident with is useless compared to solving 10 difficult questions. If you are having trouble thinking of an idea for English, ask your teacher for ideas, hell even ChatGPT could help you create a basic outline to form a flow of ideas. I could go on and on but these are my three biggest tips.

**Tip #8 - Enjoy What You Are Learning**

Personally, I found grade 12 physics this year really interesting as we covered a lot of deep things such as fields and the fundamental nature of forces. Not everything has to be about marks. Sometimes what you are learning is very cool and interesting and you should enjoy it.

**Conclusion**

On a final note, this is your final year. Enjoy yourself. It doesn't all have to be doom and gloom. There are so many more things I wanted to talk about more but I have to end it here as my hands are getting quite tired. You do not need to take my advice too seriously. I am also a mere high schooler (well I guess not anymore), so again not a beacon of wisdom or anything. I hope my advice here has been helpful. Have a great summer everyone and I wish you all the best in September. This subreddit has truly been such a lifesaver and I'll definitely try to help out future grade 12s in the future. Thank you all so much <3.",active,70

The instructions are often just 2 or 3 sentences and don't specify anything about wordcount, APA, etc. The peer assessment forms follow suit: very basic.

Here are my week 3 written assignment instructions:
""Suppose a firm finds that the marginal product of capital is 60 and the marginal product of labor is 20. If the price of capital is $6 and the price of labor is $2.50, describe how the firm should adjust its mix of capital and labor? What will be the result?""

In week 2, I submitted a 770-word APA-style essay, but all 3 students I peer assessed just blatantly copy and pasted some raw ChatGPT output. All three were almost identical, and two of them weren't even finished. It was as if Chat GPT stalled and the student didn't even check what they were copy and pasting. 

The annoying thing is that those submissions still basically meet all of the requirements and the scoring criteria for the peer assessment is just 100% based on making correct calculations. 

Is this correct? 
It doesn't seem right to me. 

I could have just copy and pasted the calculation from ChatGPT and got the same (or an even higher) score with barely any effort at all.

14nfd55,269,2023-06-30,"Grad student totally played me, and I am an idiot",u/zazzlekdazzle,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/14nfd55/grad_student_totally_played_me_and_i_am_an_idiot/,"I don't know if I need advice or just a mini-vent.  

This is far from the greatest frustration any of you face, or even I have faced, but it just floors me how students still can surprise me at this stuff.

I teach an online summer graduate class for students getting their MS in Data Science. Usually, these are (hands down) my best and most organized students. No doubt this is because these students have regular jobs all day and are spending their valuable time and money on the classes - both resources they likely have little of.

So, I don't usually have many policies to get around the usual arms race of students trying to get away with sh*t. But this semester, I had a student who totally played me.

I never had a grad student who just straight-up lied and cheated like this one - and in such obvious ways. I grade the graduate student homework on completion rather than accuracy. Now, this has never been an issue with grad students. But, this was my first mistake with Cheater here. Cheater either just guessed on the multiple choice questions or had ChatGPT do the coding questions for them. They could not reproduce even the most basic tasks in class.

I also have in-class labs that I grade the same way as the homework. I usually think this is less of an issue than the homework because I am right here while they do it. (Not in person, but you get it.)  Cheater was always having issues with their video and audio and couldn't participate fully in the labs. When they did, I would ask how they were doing, and they said fine and never needed any help. I set up a system so the students would submit the answers on an online form, and sure enough, it looks like ChatGPT was doing the labs, too! When the class got to the point where good old AI couldn't do the work for Cheater anymore, they just started handing in random, almost gibberish (this I at least feel OK marking incomplete, and I told them so).

But you know what, Cheater gets full credit for all the homework and most of the labs because I did not explain to the grad students that they need to use the material I teach in the class to answer the questions (like I do for undergrads) because I never needed to before. I mean, who pulls this sh*t as a grad student?

Right now, I am giving the final. And, sure enough, little Cheater has sworn up and down that they submitted their exam. Yet, I do not have it. I have no doubt Cheater is having trouble piecing something together and is buying time to send me whatever later. The old ""my computer must have corrupted that file, here is the real one (submitted the next day)"" trick. 

Now, I do not have a lateness policy (mistake number 347 considering Cheater) for a FINAL EXAM because who the f\*\*k does that as a grad student? Since I don't have a stated lateness policy, I will have to grade this f\*\*King exam, and whatever they get, plus all their complete but completely garbage assignments (2/3s of the grade) will likely get them maybe a B- in a class they did nothing for and learned nothing from.

**Can I retroactively dock this student some points on their final for being late if I don't have a lateness policy for exams?**

I am an idiot.

EDIT: OK, I think I may have an out. In my syllabus, under the section on homework assignments, as the last line: ""Due to the quick pace of the class, I cannot accept late work."" Now, it *could* be taken to mean it only applied to homework assignments, but I do say that is my lateness policy - I don't accept late work. Will this work?

**EDIT2: The saga continues!**

As the top comment suggested here, we did some legit exploration which revealed that the student DID submit the exam not just on time but quite early. 

But...one thing I omitted above, for brevity, is that I allow a one-hour grace period after the exam deadline to take care of any technical issues, like this very one. I tell the students about this grace period and what it's for. I expect, but do not explicitly state, that they will be alert around this time to take care of any issues. 

When I saw the student did not have an exam submitted, and when they did not respond to my inquiries during the grace period, I assumed they were buying time and snowing me. I was not bothered that I did not see the exam at the deadline - issues like theirs happen all the time, and the students know there is a pad of time, so that's fine if they use it. *What got me was that I did not get a response during the grace period, not until almost two hours later.* 

But here's the rub - the student needed to submit the exam early and was not contactable because they had to go to the emergency room. (I actually believe the student about the ER because they had relevant and persistent health issues all term.)

The student is extremely apologetic about missing my alerts during the grace period and begging me not to penalize their grade, and I'm in a tough position. If the student had been honest with me all semester and did their work in good faith, I wouldn't bat an eyelash about giving them a pass for not being around during the grace period for a health emergency. The student thought they were all set, so they assumed there was no need to be on alert for problems (not the smartest assumption, but I get it).",active,303
