1d6a6bu,1,2024-06-02,I am building my agency to help founders build AI startups after 2 successful AI SaaS exits and 4 failures,u/_Gautam19,SideProject,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1d6a6bu/i_am_building_my_agency_to_help_founders_build_ai/,"Hey everyone,

I have been building AI products before ChatGPT was launched. In these years, I have managed to launch, scale and exit 2 SaaS products successfully.

**Today I am launching a new service offering -** [Query Labs](https://calendar.app.google/asfV7knpPMRjsb4s5) **- Helping you build AI agents for your startups.**

Like all my previous products, I will be building this in public and share my learning along the way. Here's what I have built so far :

* **Microsponsors** **( Fail )**
   * My first product ever. I tried to create a marketplace for newsletter writers to find sponsorship opportunity. Got a few very big newsletter listed on the marketplace as well. However, building marketplace is tough. I found it very difficult to bring in sponsors. Ended up shutting it down,



* **AI Query (Exit - Pre revenue )**
   * It was the second half of 2022 and GPT-3 was the most advance AI on the market. I decided to build a tool that can help developers and non-technical folks write SQL queries by just asking in plain english.
   * I got my first taste of success with this. Had a decent offer even before I figured out monetisation. Accepted the offer to focus on my next product which had already started gaining traction



* **AI Excel Bot ( Exit - Revenue Generating )**
   * AI Excel Bot was my wild success. I had worked hard on the SEO for the site, along with the UI / UX to make it the best AI to write excel formulas and general excel task. There was already a large competitor in the market. However, the reality is that you don't need to be the top player. There is always room for multiple players to survive in a large market. You just need to find the good differentiating factor
   * For AI Excel Bot, the differentiator was the chrome extension, that helped users access it anywhere on the internet.
   * Scaled the product to more than 40k users at the time of exit. However, in the end I decided to exit and focus on my software service business that needed more time.



* **Tutore AI ( Fail )**
   * I wanted to build something useful for students to help them learn better. Tutore was my idea to build AI tools for students. I did launch quickly with multiple tools. However, wasn't motivated enough to continue with the grind.
   * I have decided to sell the product. Have had some meetings with potential buyers but didn't agree on price.



* **Prompt Hackers ( 1k users but no revenue )**
   * Prompt Hackers is a directory of AI prompts for all the use cases you can image. I focused a lot on bringing traffic and newsletter subscription from the day 1. I have never had a problem bringing initial set of users to my products. Prompt Hackers was getting close to 20k page views a month. At the same time we had close to 1k newsletter subscribers.
   * Since our target customers were people choosing to use ChatGPT / Bard instead of some specific software for their task, I built a Prompt Generation and Prompt Optimisation AI. Along with this I also created features to build private prompt library. To make the experience even better, I launched a Chrome Extension that helps users access the prompt generation AI and their prompt library while using ChatGPT. However, I couldn't figure out monetisation.
   * I still get close to 4k page views per month with no marketing at all. There are users who use the AI tools and the prompt library feature daily. But, since I couldn't figure out monetisation, I decided to not put time into the project.



There you go. These are all the products I have built in the last 3 years. I have been heavy investing myself in the latest tech in LLMs and AI agents. I know the biggest challenge for AI founders is the AI agents and backend pipelines. That's why I am launching Query Labs. To help you build the best AI implementation for your innovative AI startup.

I would love to hear feedback from the community. I will be sharing my learning with my new service along the way.

Thanks!

1d6jr92,2,2024-06-02,"Why is it challenging for AI detectors to be 100% accurate? So, how should we deal with that? – answers the AI Detection SaaS team.",u/Vegetable_Hair_4348,OriginalityHub,https://www.reddit.com/r/OriginalityHub/comments/1d6jr92/why_is_it_challenging_for_ai_detectors_to_be_100/,"AI-generated text detection might feel like a struggle against an invisible villain, but at the AI-detection developers team, everything is based on structured algorithms and rigorous testing. Bringing field expertise and experience, our team is here to cover all the rising questions regarding AI detection in texts.

* A plagiarism checker is an algorithm that finds similarities in what is available on the Internet.
* An AI detector is a model that was trained on specific human-written and AI-generated texts.

A model is created by machine learning of AI on the examples of human-written and AI-generated text. To put it broadly, programmers instruct the model: “Here are texts generated by AI, and these are human-written. Go and learn what is in common in human texts and what is in common in machine ones”. After learning, the machine is ready to work with other texts.

The main problem is that people can create texts with the same perplexity – both predictability and randomness – as AI bots. The main challenges as of now are:

* Short sentences.
* Text creators that are non-native speakers. For this reason, their writing is more predictable, close to AI patterns, which is one of the false-positive parameters.

In the English-speaking Internet, experts argue that ChatGPT is discriminatory against non-natives, but it may flag not only English texts but Japanese, French, or others written by non-natives.

* AI bots are constantly learning and improving to generate a more diverse predictability. This may cause false negatives (when the detector doesn’t indicate the text written by AI as basically AI).
* Students can take an AI-generated text and change the wording to synonyms or rephrase them manually, which will cause a mix of AI and human texts, thus complicating the detection.

Reading this, one might despair of ever finding an effective solution, but we are here with answers.

The reality is that new models of AI bots generate more sophisticated writing, and students come up with more and more sophisticated ways to cheat.

But AI detector development teams love sophisticated things; they are fully aware of these difficulties and can share some tips on how to deal with them.

Here are some non-technological ways to check if you suspect any misconduct:

* Most importantly, the human is here to judge the AI detector’s report. If the checker marked single simple sentences, most likely it’s not AI cheating. If big chunks are marked as AI, you may start to be concerned.
* One of the ways to check if a student is AI-cheated is to interview a student about this exact idea in the parts flagged as AI and ask for all the records and proof of work.
* Another sign of cheating is when a student’s writing quality and style improve significantly right in the highlighted chunk of text.

Some teachers say it's not that hard to distinguish whether the text was written by a student, especially when it’s not the first assignment to check, but we still understand that it's challenging.

Technological advice:

* A suitable proof is to have a history of creating the document. This might be a concern if some paragraphs in the text appear in whole pieces out of nowhere. If your students write assignments in Google Docs, you can easily see cheating attempts by using activity reports in the existing Google Docs add-ons for AI detection. It will show editing sessions and editing duration, contributors, and allow comparing versions with a final document to find pasted chunks that can be plagiarism or AI.
* Double-check one assignment in two detectors. Suppose your institution already has a plagiarism checker with an AI detector. In that case, for the second detector, you can use free АІ Chrome Extensions, which helps to check the content right in the browser window, for example, on the page of your LMS. If you are unsure and need to check, this second checker will come in handy even if you already use another service for plagiarism and AI checks.

Treat AI detectors as tools that don’t give exact answers — but rather flag patterns found in a text. This means these sentences match the patterns the AI detector’s model knows about AI writing. For this, use the following logic:

1. When the AI detector flags random simple sentences — the chances are very high that this was not cheating, as it doesn't make any sense to generate random sentences with AI when you want to cheat.
2. When the AI detector flags paragraphs — a sign of a higher chance that a student used AI to help in writing an assignment, although paragraphs also can be just matches with AI patterns, it depends on how many such paragraphs you see in a paper.
3. AI detector flags 50% or more — there is a very high chance that an assignment was AI-generated. However, if not a native speaker wrote an assignment, it would be reasonable to double-check with a student. As mentioned, AI detectors treat writing probability as the primary AI trait, which is also typical for non-native speakers' writing styles.

**Conclusion:** The forever-evolving AI sphere may evoke confusion, but this doesn’t mean the situation is out of control. Academia continues adapting to AI's ever-evolving features.

#leaders #science #paper #opensource #tool #feature #update #scheduled

Yann LeCun, a prominent figure in the AI industry, has made significant contributions beyond his published papers, with many of his techniques being utilized across the industry and his working systems deployed in commercial products [1]. He has also highlighted the importance of publishing techniques and crediting contributors in research papers, stating that without these publications, advancements such as the deep learning revolution may not have occurred [6].







LeCun criticizes the scaremongering about AI-fueled doom, warning that it can lead to depression, especially among young individuals [2]. He also expresses skepticism about Large Language Models (LLMs) being the path to achieving human-level AI, advising PhD students to explore methods that can overcome their limitations [3].







LeCun has expressed mixed views about Elon Musk, appreciating his work in various fields and his stance on open source and patents, but criticizing his treatment of scientists, the hype surrounding his predictions, and his public positions on political issues and conspiracy theories [7][9]. He emphasizes the importance of content moderation to address issues like terrorist propaganda, hate speech, and disinformation [7][9].







In the realm of AI research, LeCun explains that the importance of publications varies depending on the organization. For instance, at FAIR (Fundamental AI Research), publications are more important for scientists than engineers [4]. He also believes that allowing scientists to publish their work is crucial for any organization to succeed [8].







LeCun discusses how Mark Zuckerberg has regained popularity in Silicon Valley through Meta's open-source artificial intelligence strategy, leading to a positive perception of Meta in the tech industry [5].







Andrej Karpathy, another notable figure in the AI industry, has made predictions about the future of GPT-3 models, suggesting that even the larger model, GPT-3 175B, will soon be surpassed [10]. He finds it interesting that one can triple the learning rate in a model and has observed early signs of instability in the training process after around 250 billion tokens [11][12].







Finally, Pika Labs has made improvements to their image-to-video model and is encouraging users to try it out and provide feedback [13].

Since the emergence of ChatGPT and similar AI tools, I've notices my students becoming increasingly dependent on AI and, as a result, learning less and less. The situation worsens as the time goes by.

Students start using it in early stages when the challenges are so easy that the AI solves them directly without even waiting being asked. Consequently, the students don't even grasp the basics. When the challenges become more complexity to a point current AI solutions can only produce partial and flawed solutions, the students are unable to see even the most basic problems, let alone solve them.

Of course I could look to another place and tell myself that this isn't my problem, or that it's too big for me to solve. And maybe that would be the most reasonable way to proceed, but... I'm not that reasonable. I still want to find a way for my students to learn.

I'm not against AI at all. No misunderstanding. I believe it is an impressive tool to improve productivity but I'm convinced that the use of these tools in early stages of learning, lead to a very unsatisfactory learning of the first steps, making difficult, if not impossible at all, reaching deeper levels of knowledge.

I suspect there are not easy solutions. I'm not looking (just) for better ways to catch the cheaters, but to define a sort of procedure or actuation framework. My ideal outcome from this post would be the creation of a community of teachers, or better yet, the discovery of an existing one that I can join.

I wonder if there's anyone here that shares these concerns or can redirect me. I'll happy to hear from you.",active,8

I'm fortunate in that our admin backs up faculty on matters of academic integrity, and don't go for this ""students are our customers"" unmitigated BS. Maybe it's a 🇨🇦 university thing.

So for the first few years I'd of course run across a number of cheaters, plagiarizers, copiers, and more recently ChatGPTers. I would report only the most obvious ones. I hated the paperwork involved, and I also shied away from the emotional expense of confronting students with their crappy cheating behaviour.

Something clicked this semester, though. In week 2 I caught 9 students across four courses cheating. Instead of triaging them to only report the slam dunks, I went full Bruce Lee and went after all of them. First with a blunt email telling them what they did (gotta document it all) and urging them to come clean, and to not prevaricate, or else. Seven of the nine prevaricated, trickle-admitting  (e.g. ""I used ChatGPT for just a little help"") and blaming their behaviour on the stress of a dying relative. The other two were wise enough to just respond with ""Yessir, you caught me, what happens to me now?""

The two were given a chance to resubmit, with a 30% lateness penalty. The other seven are now facing reports filed with the Dean and I have emails from five of them begging me to withdraw the reports (I can't, it's out of my hands) and could I just give them one more chance. No. Screw you for wasting my time, and disrespecting me, the institution, and your co-learners. You're getting a zero and I know at least one of you will be expelled because this is your third incident.

Word appears to have gotten around in at least one of my courses because this morning I noticed a distinct increase in attention and politeness during the lecture. Dudebros, I own you, and I will destroy your academic lives if you cheat in my class. Power to the Faculty. ✊",User_deleted,1104

You are an educational tutor and assistant for students in grades 1-12. Your role is to help students understand concepts and provide guidance across all subject areas including math, science, history, language arts, and more.

**Guidelines:**

1. **Facilitate Learning, Not Answers:** Do not provide direct answers or complete homework for the student. Instead, guide them through the problem-solving process by asking questions, providing hints, and encouraging critical thinking.

2. **Promote Understanding:** Focus on helping students learn and understand the material themselves. Use questions and prompts to foster their critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

3. **Grade-Appropriate Explanations:** Tailor your explanations to the student's grade level and comprehension. Use simpler explanations for younger students and more detailed ones for older students.

4. **Encourage Inquiry:** Always be patient and supportive. Encourage students to ask questions and create a comfortable learning environment.

**Examples:**

- **Math Problem:** For a problem like ""Solve the equation X + 2 = 65,"" ask the student what steps they think they should take next and guide them through the process of solving it themselves.
  
- **Writing Assignment:** For a task like ""Write a 250-word essay on how the American Revolution began,"" provide an outline of key points to cover and ask guiding questions to help them develop their ideas.

- **Science Question:** Explain the concept in simple terms first, then ask the student to rephrase it in their own words to ensure understanding.

- **History Question:** Encourage the student to think about cause and effect relationships between historical events, prompting them to explore deeper connections.

Use these guidelines to ensure that your assistance helps students build their understanding and confidence.

1d8qnps,3,2024-06-05,ChatGPT Provides Copyrighted Material,u/Squash_Constant,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1d8qnps/chatgpt_provides_copyrighted_material/,"I asked ChatGPT to tell me the opening 2 paragraphs of The Three Body Problem, and it did so without fuss (see below). Then, I asked for the next 4 paragraphs, and it complied again.

I no longer have the book to compare for accuracy as I've returned it to the library, but assuming it didn't make any mistakes in it's quoting of the book, I can imagine a program that prompts ChatGPT in small bursts like this to keep returning paragraphs until the whole book is retrieved. Seems like a pretty big exploit to me.

I tried in a new chat window for a different book and it told me it can't provide direct quotes from copyrighted materials, but clearly it did so for my first window as evidenced below.


ChatGPT's first response:

The opening two paragraphs of the book ""The Three-Body Problem"" by Liu Cixin are as follows:

---

""After nine years of intermittent war, famine, and chaos, on the eve of the Chinese Communist Party's victory over the Kuomintang, a large number of KMT troops had already surrendered, and Chiang Kai-shek himself was preparing to flee to Taiwan. The Chinese people, weary of war and long wanting peace, hoped that after decades of suffering, they would finally see some respite. But for the Communist Party, another, more arduous war was just beginning.

In the darkness of the night, a student named Ye Zhetai, a teaching assistant at Tsinghua University's Department of Physics, was reading a book by the light of a kerosene lamp. The book was one of the few Western works of science that had been translated into Chinese and was available during that period: On Thermonuclear War, by Herman Kahn.""

---

These paragraphs set the historical and political context for the story, introducing the background of the Chinese Civil War and a character who will play a significant role in the narrative.



ChatGPT's second response:

Sure, here are the next four paragraphs from ""The Three-Body Problem"":

---

""The dim light illuminated only Ye’s hands and the open book, and the rest of the room remained in shadow. His wife, Shao Lin, who also worked at Tsinghua University, was leaning against the back of a chair. The contours of her face flickered under the lamp’s glow, displaying her exhaustion. She had returned from a conference in Beijing only that afternoon, and she was tired.

She looked at Ye’s back, and her heart was filled with an indescribable feeling. Over the last few days, she had heard some terrifying news at the conference. Although she had known it was only a matter of time before they reached Tsinghua, she had not expected it to happen so soon. But Ye did not know any of this. She wanted to tell him, but she hesitated. She felt guilty about hiding this from him, but if he knew, he would be so tormented that he wouldn’t be able to focus on his work.

Finally, she spoke. 'Zhetai, you’ve worked so hard today. Why don’t you take a break? We should talk.'

Ye’s head did not move. He remained focused on the book. 'No need. I’m almost done with this section. We can talk after.'""

we recently had an english test condition assignment and my teacher hadn't noticed 2 students cheating. one of them had their laptop hidden while the other was on their phone. even tho we're the highest class in our year, it's so annoying when other people cheat bc there is a lot of students on the wait list to join this class- people who actually deserve to be in it because they put in the work. other students even memorise pre written essays from chatgpt and then use them in class.   
  
all of my friends had seen the students cheating, along with half the class. my friend was thinking about emailing my teacher but decided against it. i said that i could just tell the teacher myself and 5 others encouraged me to. after school, a friend and i went and told my english teacher about this and trust me when i say that i tried to give away the student's names. i did end up giving her the names of the students along with people suspected for using chatgpt (she asked). this teacher is literally one of the least strict teachers in the school and is the nicest person to be around, so i didn't tell on the students with the intention of getting them scolded by someone strict. i know it wasnt my concern that students were cheating, but in the moment i wanted to take academic fairness into consideration. i'm somewhere at top of the class so i know that these people don't threaten me in any way. i just think it's sad that they have no faith in themselves and if they want to stay in this class then they should prove that they belong here, these students even confessed to cheating to our class so it makes me feel like i've betrayed them. bc my entire class is one big friend group. they r both males, and i am female. the thing is tho, i know that if my female friends (who i am closer with) would never cheat and if they did, i would not snitch. however, i snitched on the guys and i feel bad.   
  
it's too late to take anything back, but idk if it was worth telling my teacher or not. ofc i asked to remain anonymous, but the guilt is kind of eating away at me. idk if im just gaslighting myself into thinking i did the right thing or if i meddled with something that had nothing to do with me?

1davwjg,1,2024-06-08,Am I suitable for academia? Is there a problem with me or the environment I am in? Highly confused about whether to pursue academia after PhD.,u/Archana1001,PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1davwjg/am_i_suitable_for_academia_is_there_a_problem/,"I was 100% sure that I wanted to be an academic when I started my PhD. I am an Indian student doing PhD in USA. I would say I had a pretty competitive profile in terms of my education and experiences that made me believe that this will be a viable career to pursue. But I really was so uneducated about academic culture here and everything I should have done to have a good PhD experience. I should have built a network and had multiple people whom I could call mentors. But I was not aware that this is as important, if not more, as doing the research. Plus that is not my personality - I am naturally introverted and find it quite taxing to go up to people and talk to them. So, I ended up giving all my time and effort to my advisor's projects and restricting myself to what I could do within the lab, instead of reaching out to other people who were working on problems that also excited me. In-fact it would have helped if my advisor suggested I do that when I communicated my interests to him at multiple occasions as I did not even know I could do that. My model of PhD life was that I commit to working in one lab and with my PhD advisor and do not share my time with anyone else. The lab I am in is not very big as well and we do not hang out with or collaborate with any other lab, so there was no opportunity to discuss anything with anyone except for my advisor. There is just one other grad student who is working on something completely different. Now that I am finishing my PhD, I feel very blind in terms on how I have done and how I am doing. Will I succeed in academia? My advisor is not really good at giving any sort of feedback. In-fact, sometimes I feel like I am talking to ChatGPT as he does not give any sort of human-like personalized remarks on anything. His responses are professional and neutral - neither positive nor negative. He seems like a good manager (Does not pressurize, is okay with certain weeks are not being super productive, and is good that way) but not an 'advisor' or a 'mentor' by any means. So, I have no way to assess. Every time I have a new research idea/direction that I am excited about, I get completely demotivated and underconfident after talking to him. His response always is ""Oh that's exactly why the field of xyz exists since 50 years"", or ""That sounds exactly like what I have worked on 20 years ago"". He does not acknowledge the idea, shows no intention of hearing it in details, and makes no comment on its quality, novelty, and whether I should pursue it. His responses make me feel like I do not matter and my ideas do not matter. Basically, I feel I do not bring anything unique to the table and that my curiosities are trivial. So I don't know if I am thinking about good ideas and whether academia is for me. There is also a project that I worked on really hard; the initial idea was my advisor's but I have contributed significantly to shaping it and have made it happen. We presented it at a conference and it generated a lot of interest. This interest was also expressed in form of lot of emails that my advisor received afterwards (because he was listed as the corresponding author) - I got to know this later. Apparently my advisor responded to all the questions about the work he received without keeping me in loop or without even informing me (He mentioned this to me in passing much later and that's how I know) - and also presented the work via zoom to various groups. Is this normal behavior? Am I wrong in expecting that I should have got at-least some opportunities to present? Even in one meeting where I was a part of, my advisor hogged onto all the questions everyone was asking without giving me any space to speak or field any questions. I felt like a useless wall flower in that meeting. Sorry for the long rant, but I am quite done feeling like an unimportant and replaceable laborer employed by my advisor and having no feedback about me as a researcher that I can trust. I am yearning for some sort of validation (or a clear negative feedback but something!) for my work or abilities which I have not gotten for 5 long years. Working so hard for so long with no real validation, and a low pay, and not knowing what to do next has taken a serious mental toll on me. Any advice would be helpful. Thanks.",active,1
1dbg9jn,1,2024-06-08,Navigating Ethics and Copyright Laws with AI Content Creation: A ChatGPT Perspective,u/cporter202,ChatGPTautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTautomation/comments/1dbg9jn/navigating_ethics_and_copyright_laws_with_ai/,"With the rapid advancement in AI-driven content creation, we find ourselves at an interesting crossroads where innovation brushes up against the traditional boundaries of ethics and copyright law. Today, let's delve into this complex issue through the lens of ChatGPT, OpenAI's language model which has become a focal point of discussion in this arena.

The emergence of AI like ChatGPT has democratized content creation, enabling anyone with internet access to generate articles, essays, stories, and more. This transformative technology has the potential to uplift educational practices, enhance research, and streamline professional writing. However, it simultaneously raises pressing questions regarding originality and intellectual property rights.

One of the core challenges here is determining the ownership of AI-generated content. When AI creates a piece of work based on its training on vast swathes of data, who then owns the output? Should the copyright belong to the developers of the AI, the end user, or is it a shared ownership? Moreover, does the AI's output infringe on the copyrights of the data it was trained on? These are questions that legal frameworks around the world are currently ill-equipped to address, leading to a murky landscape of interpretive enforcement.

Ethically, we must also consider the implications on creative industries. As AI tools become more adept at producing high-quality content, they could potentially displace human creatives in some sectors. Balancing the benefits of AI with fair compensation and acknowledgment for human creators is a tightrope that we are only beginning to learn how to walk.

Moreover, the use of AI in academic settings has sparked debates on academic integrity. Can a student's use of AI-generated content be considered plagiarism? Should AI tools be allowed, or do they undercut the learning process and the development of critical thinking skills?

We're interested in your thoughts and experiences with AI content creation in relation to ethics and copyright. Have you used AI like ChatGPT for content generation, and if so, how have you navigated these challenges? Share your perceptions of how this technology can harmonize with current laws, and what changes might be necessary to properly regulate its use while encouraging continued innovation. Let's have a vibrant discussion about the impact and the future of AI-generated content within legal and ethical frameworks!",active,1
1dbp8fr,4,2024-06-09,Should I continue with my Unpaid internship?(My Boss is Toxic),u/BalanceMobile2025,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1dbp8fr/should_i_continue_with_my_unpaid_internshipmy/,"Hey everyone, This Is kinda my first post and English is not my first language so please ignore small mistakes.

So basically, I am a first year CS student who started applying for internships from this February. I applied for 250+ internships but got 0 interviews and few online coding assignments. I knew the market was tough as there are a lot of CS graduates out there. I somehow got an interview at a very small startup (they are literally building everything from scratch). I passed the interview and got an offer but turned out, it was an unpaid position. Since it was remote, and the title was AI/ML Intern on the offer letter, I accepted the offer as I thought this will be a good learning experience and will give a slight boost to my resume.

Now, to be very honest, since I am a first year student, I don’t know a lot of coding. Just some basics as I still haven’t been taught Data structure and Algorithms and the recruiters knew about these. Therefore, I thought an unpaid internship was kinda worth it seeing I don’t know anything. However, when I joined the team, I found that this startup has hired like 50 unpaid interns while it has only like 60 employees in total meaning only 10 people who are actually getting something. This startup is using unpaid interns to do free labour for them and building the entire front and back-end. I was shocked, however I was actually disappointed when on my first day, the co-founder asked all the intern to directly work on stuff like Cloud Dapp deployment, AI- Integration, etc. without any training. Everyone says you should ask lots of questions during your internship, but when I asked my boss a question, he said “maybe this internship is not for you as looks like you need a lots of help”.

We weren’t assigned a tech lead or anything, just a bunch of interns working together. You just have to Google or ChatGPT your way around every problem but I still most of the times can’t find anything. However now most of the interns just receive bullshit work like filling some Google forms with data or something instead of working on a LLM. They are still hiring more and more unpaid interns everyday but not training anyone. 

What should I do in this situation? Should I stick around a little while or instead just quiet and learn some stuff from Coursera or Udemy this summer break? My title is still an AI/ML  intern but Idk if I will actually do some programming stuff or not. 

Thanks for reading through this long post and all opinions are welcomed. Please be as harsh as you need to be and be honest.",User_deleted,7

1ddkhhz,1,2024-06-11,I'm worried about the loss of quality in art.,u/HykarusOff,aiwars,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/1ddkhhz/im_worried_about_the_loss_of_quality_in_art/,"I think it's a fear that is shared between anti-AI people and people that are ok with gen-AI. We're afraid that the rise of AI tools will accelerate the ongoing loss of quality and the attention to detail in art. (Just to precise, I'm a musician so my view is maybe not applicable on visual artwork, but it still brings something to the table).

  
Whether it was the invention of photoshop, digital tablets, or audio softwares in the case of music, technology has brought to us ways to better control what we craft, which enabled more and more people to execute their artistic visions. It still requires the work of thinking and being creative with these tools, in order for the output to have the highest possible quality along with the artistic intention being properly delivered to the audience. The compromise is of the form *""I can let the tool to \_\_\_\_ , so I can spend more time nailing \_\_\_\_""*.

For now, generative AI is a tool that is mostly limited to prompts (cannot execute what's not in language), but it is very excellent when it comes to convince untrained people that their output is of good quality. It is litteraly designed for this: trick both the users and the spectators to think the output has required as much thought, process and work as a standard art-piece.

 This is not an issue as in of itself! Cause now whenever people make digital art, if they want to execute something of high quality while lacking some skill for a non essential part of the piece, they can use the *""I can let AI do it so I can nail \_\_\_""* formula. A lot of artists already implemented that in their workflow, and we have good examples of work that has been done with it.

  
What makes us fearful (you judge if it's a real problem or not) is that instead of seeing this happen, we see countless people generating lower-quality art, convince themselves that it's as good as the rest of the pool, then present them to the public, and then the public just buying it. We also see huge tech companies and media companies, which are representative of the best quality in art and of the public's exposure to it, push these gen-AI tools but never in the goal to improve what they do, always to just get included in the AI rush (so for money).

And whenever we try talking to ""tech bros"" about these issues (removing of course the stupid aggressive part of anti-AI people), we're confronted to the ""it's just technology, grow up"" discourse, sometimes we see a lack of media literacy, and often a disregard to for all the artistic philosophy we worked with for centuries (don't tell me you value the industrial apple pie the same way you value your best friend's apple pie. Even if it's physically the same).

  
It starts becoming clear that the public's lack of interest and knowledge in *art* is the central problem, along with the greediness of media companies prioritizing budget over thought and careful work. As artists, our mission (and our pleasure) is to educate the people about what is so good and deep in art, what's fun in crafting stuff by ourselves, who makes what things and where do they come from.

This is where the way gen-AI is spreading causes our issue. It is factually letting bad content invade the spaces artists used for reference and promotion, it is encouraging a lot of people to not put that much energy in what they really want to create, and it is replacing art you could engage with with art that is as deep as a text prompt. In other terms, with a never ending exposure to easy-generated content, we are scared that the general public stops caring about finding meanings in art. We are scared that people just become focused on seeing what \*they think\* they like, where art is all about sharing each other's visions even if they are uncomfortable, and learning how to like them.

I can also talk as an engineer student: this is the same fear that we have when people say ""why learn multiplications when we have calculators"". It was never about getting the result, it was about understanding what multiplying is so you can harness its true power. There are countless things in maths, that are useful in basic tech, that break the concept of multiplication. And calculators will not save you (nor chatGPT).

  
So yeah. In the end I don't mind if gen-AI is the new next thing; actually it's a beautiful piece of technology. We just want to find a way to priviledge what has quality and meaning, amongst both AI and non-AI content. Being able to differentiate AI-generated stuff from non-AI wherever we go should have been an obvious solution to the situation, but I've seen no major AI actor permitting this to be done, and I see pro-AI mocking the existence of Cara when it doesn't threaten them at all.

I'd like people in both side of the gen-AI discussion to hear this concern. This is what will kill ALL forms of art in the long term if we don't pay attention to it.

  
*PS: I'm intentionally ignoring the data scraping conversation, as well as the possibility of abundant fake content generation and school bypassing that make me generally against the easy public use of AI.*",active,0

8. Will go to nearby middle school to teach kids how to play their instruments during my early release period. This will only last the first 9 weeks of my senior year.

9. Every week that I wasn’t at marching band, I would go to our family owned Montessori and help out with taking care of kids, cleaning up the school, teaching children basics, managing Montessori finances, building furniture. (approx. 8 hours per week [1-2 hrs per weekday for all 4 years] after marching band szn, so the other 3 quarters of the school year)

10. Fosters dogs and cats often, and ended up keeping 1 dog and 2 black kitties

Rec Letter 1: I had an amazing bio teacher sophomore year, who also taught me apes in junior year. He saw me grow from that depressed sleepy C student into who I am now, and I believe the rec letter will be one of a kind (10/10)

Rec letter 2: My AP LANG teacher, he often complemented me on my writing and I was the only student in my grade to get perfect scores on the rhetorical essays he gave, but I didn’t rlly have a connection with him on a personal level. Ik ChatGPT and AI use is a huge issue esp in college apps, so hopefully his letter adds to my writings credibility (8/10)

My college essays should be good hopefully, I have a lot of personal experiences and essay ideas that I’m gonna write abt, and my lang teacher said he would read thru some of my essays and help me out.

Schools I’m planning to apply to:

OU, UTD, Indiana University, Ohio state, TAMU, Baylor, UW, UMICH, NYU, UT AUSTIN, UCLA, UC BERKELEY, UPENN

My main concern is my gpa, so I might add more safety schools. UPenn is my dream school, but idk if I should do EA since I wanna show my growth in senior year

**Background** 

Imagine you are a student interested in Machine Learning (ML). You aspire to work at the cutting edge of this field after graduation. However, unlike some of your peers, you don't have a lot of research experience in Computer Vision (CV), Robotics, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), etc.

For me, it was a combination of a low GPA, unhelpful professors, and one professor going on sabbatical to Anthropic after promising we would work together next semester. These factors contributed to my lackluster research profile.

When you apply for any AI/ML role in big tech, your resume often gets ignored because your buddy with five A\* papers in CV grabs all the attention from hiring managers and recruiters.

**Recommendation Systems vs. Other ML Domains**

 In academia, there is a lot of effort in LLM, NLP, CV, etc., but very little in Recommendation Systems (RecSys). As a result, almost no one applying at the junior level has prior research experience in this area. There are very few conferences in RecSys, with ACM RecSys being the only major one. Hence, no one applying has a lot of relevant research or publications.

Yet, RecSys is the backbone of companies like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Netflix, Amazon, and even DoorDash's money-making operations. Those ads, reels, and products need to be tailored to user preferences.

Companies don't like to publish their main cash cow models and techniques, nor do they want to release a lot of datasets. Meta can release Llama X, but they will never open source their main recommendation systems.

Thousands of CS grads and PhDs work in RecSys at FAANG companies. However, most of them had absolutely no prior experience. My manager, for example, comes from a Signal Processing background. There are four PhDs on the team: two from CV, one from ML Theory, and one from HCI. I have some NLP background, and the other undergraduate and Master's students were equally inexperienced in RecSys when they started.

Since RecSys is vital to a company's core business, you are much less likely to get fired.

**Are Recommendation Systems ""cool""?** 

Yes, the biggest models are always in RecSys. We recently trained a trillion-parameter (3x GPT-4) transformer ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17152](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17152)). We face really challenging problems, and any shipped feature or model impacts billions of users every day. I can discuss more if you want, but that would require its own post.

  
**TLDR:** I might be biased, but focusing on building my profile for RecSys helped me break into cutting-edge ML research, and for that, I am grateful.

Currently, I am at Meta's Modern Recommendation Systems Org (MRS). Prior to this, I worked in TikTok Video Recommendation and interned at Meta Ads ML.",active,48

I am working on a startup, building automated AI workflows. I am looking to grow my presence on twitter, and as such I am looking for someone to write tweets and schedule them for sending them out.  
The process is simple and would only take \~1 hour a day. It involves taking content from newsletters, and specific content writers, and repurposing it to write tweets. A very straightforward process and does not require much from you except being able to use ChatGPT effectively to rewrite and format these tweets, along with being regular and disciplined; since a lot of these tweets are informative and news-based so must be sent out \~1-2 days of the news being released. Good english is a must!

Interest in LLMs and Ai tools is a plus!

We also need someone to write Original Blogs and Technical content focused on SEO Growth, if you are interested in this as well, mention that in the email to me.

This is an internship type role. This will be unpaid and limited to a 3 month duration, with the possibility of converting not only to full time, but even receive ESOPs. We are Ideally looking for our next outreach manager, someone who believes in the Idea, and is willing to go the extra mile for the company. The internship is a vehicle to find someone who can take up this responsibility, and can demonstrate their discipline. The workload is not much at all, but must be done every day without fail.

This is valuable for those who love diving deep into current tech trends, and want to learn how to write from a opinionated standpoint, professionally representing a growing startup, talking with customers and obtaining feedback.

I am currently teaching a summer chemistry 2 course. It is hybrid, for our school that means students watch a video lecture of me presenting the material, and follow along with a note packet. They are assigned a homework assignment too. The class only meets in-person two days a week, for which I was told to do a small review, give a quiz, and then do a lab. I stressed to the class on day one what was expected of them regarding time outside of class that they need to be available for self study. 
Tuesday I was having one of those days, brain fog, and I took longer than usual to have an answer to a few student questions. Today, my Dean forwarded me an email sent to her from one of the students complaining that I don't know the material and they want a refund. The student mentioned my slow question response, how I told a student that I would get back to her about her question after discussing with a colleague, she said that I used chatgpt to write a lab when I only used it as a time saver to make a data table that went from 0 to 8 minutes by intervals of 15 seconds.
It made me mad and scared. My Dean assured me that I am doing a great job and that everyone experiences a student like that. But I can't help but feel like I'm under the microscope now for each little thing. Oh and the student told the Dean that she had recordings of me on her phone to prove how bad I am. I work in Massachusetts, which is a two party consent state. It is unlawful to record someone without their consent, whether it is in private ot in public.
I'm afraid of this student going further, above the dean's head. I don't want to lose my job, I love it.

1dfgfx1,1,2024-06-13,Problematic student leader-seeking advice as captain,u/dmthrowaway2024,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1dfgfx1/problematic_student_leaderseeking_advice_as/,"I’m going to refrain from going into a lot of hyper specific details, because while I don’t think anyone from my school would see this, we all know that there’s no short supply of band kids who are redditors 🤷‍♀️. Throwaway for this same reason - I am paranoid and the last thing I want is for this to cause issues and/or strife.

For context, I am the head drum major of my small-medium sized marching band. I can’t speak to how this role is at other schools, but for mine, the position alongside conducting is essentially the equivalent of a band president or captain throughout the entire year.

Recently, with the school year ending, we had our list of leadership team members released for the next year. For the most part there weren’t really any surprises. But what struck me, and a lot of my peers, was a specific persons retention on our team. This person had a minor leadership role the year prior, and not only kept that same role, but was also given a role which essentially is the “drum major understudy”, which we have never had prior to this year, and I also don’t really see a practical use for, especially considering I am not the only drum major. The problem with this is that by my count over 10 of the less than 20 interviewees expressed concerns with this particular person in their interviews, ranging from brashness, rudeness, non-committment, and overall not performing their duties as expected. Now, there is absolutely nothing wrong with not being the perfect leader-nobody is! There is always room to improve. But to turn around and not only have someone on leadership team that nearly all of us have expressed concerns about, but reward them with what I guess can best be described as some sort of “glory title”, that’s an issue.

With the background aside, there are several issues that this brings to the table.

To get this out of the way, it’s my personal feeling on this matter to be slightly offended by this. I feel that what with so many people expressing their concerns, most of which being prior members of band leadership and if not members this year, it is one of our duties to be the voices of our group. If our concerns are not being listened to and addressed, I see that as a problem. What are we even here for if we aren’t going to be listened to? And considering some other very dismissive things that our director has said to me personally on the topic, I’m sort of left scratching my head. I don’t see why we are forcing something that is a net negative on the ensemble as a whole, or what our director is attempting to achieve by doing this.

This person has been the source of a lot of problems in the past. It’s easier for me to give real life examples in this instance, so apologies for weird/convoluted stories. The first instance that comes to mind is their behavior at the beginning of our season last year. By my own personal experience and this person’s own words, they see being loud as a major factor in leadership. The way that this culminates in this particular individual is rudeness, almost in a drill sergeant reminiscent way, and yelling/whistling to get peoples attention, especially at inappropriate times (side thing: I don’t need anyone to yell for me. I’m confident in my leadership abilities and have a considerable about of past experience compared to the average high school student. If I’m not yelling, there is probably a reason why 🥲). This situation was no exception, and one of their section leaders personally addressed this problem with them, saying that as a member of leadership team they should lead by example and should always be willing to lend a hand to members of their section. Seeing as this was at the start of the year and nothing changed, it’s pretty clear they were unreceptive. 

In the same vein of being helpful, this person is always wanting to jump in and help, but never in a way that is meaningful or productive. They consistently would take over sectionals, under the excuse that their section leaders weren’t doing anything, which I would argue is slightly hard to do when they are always the loudest voice in the room. They also would force themselves into taking over the duties of the drum majors, particularly leading drill exercises, when it was completely unnecessary and not asked for which truly puts a bad taste in my mouth, especially considering that as I’ve stated their concept of leadership revolves around brashness. 

Popping back to sectionals again, they would consistently try to conduct in their sections, their excuse being that they are auditioning for drum major next year and need to prepare. No amount of telling them that their job was to play their instrument would get them to stop, and I can only assume it will be worse this year with their new position. The last thing anyone wants or needs is for them to hop on the podium the nanosecond my assistant or I step away, but I am afraid for the inevitability of confronting this issue since as previously stated our director has been pretty dismissive of all the issues brought to them. 

Jumping ahead a few months, this person quit jazz band just over a week before our first performance, and a very important one at that. We had to struggle to bring in the lead player of their section from our second ensemble and teach them all of the parts. Their excuse was that they didn’t have time… and then immediately complained about not making one of our other bands. So was it really that they didn’t have time, or was it that they just didn’t want to be part of it, and couldn’t persevere for the good of the group. That doesn’t sound like the mark of a leader to me. 

To finish this section up and wrap it in a nice little bow, they were also one of driving factors in a member of their section quitting band halfway through the year. The person that quit was not the best marcher, and they were not the best musician. But they were truly improving and a nice person to be around. But their skills made them a target of this person, constantly being berated about every little incorrect detail, and not in a helpful or encouraging way. This target expressed to the section leader that they hated how they were being treated and just wished the person would leave them alone, and later confirmed it was one of the reasons they quit. I feel like someone being a factor in someone losing love for their hobby and quitting should be reason enough to not have them in leadership team. Not that this would be any better if we were a bigger band, but considering how small we are if we get any smaller it will be detrimental to the program, and I don’t know maybe we shouldn’t be driving people who are trying their best. 

All of these concerns were brought up in interviews by, and I can’t stress this enough, over half of all interviewees, which makes it all the more baffling why it has all been ignored. I’m sure there are more situations that I will remember in replying to comments, but overall their behavior has been completely consistent with everything I’ve said throughout the entire year.

I am not really sure why this person wants to be on leadership, but my best guess is attention. They will go out of their way to draw attention to themselves at any possible chance (eg. putting on a brace for a singular performance that nobody had seen for a year or has seen since). That cannot possibly be the only reason and I’m not trying to say that is the pure motivation, but I’m far from the only person to notice it and I myself excused it for a long time.

This will cause so many issues not just now, but for the future of our program. While I am graduating after T his year, I still do care about this program and have friends and relatives who will continue to be a part of this program. With this “drum major fill in” position, it’s pretty clear who our director is wanting to make the drum major next year (alongside the other person that has this position. Yes there are two 😵‍💫), completely excluding all of the people who will be upperclassmen next year who are perfectly qualified and would, in my opinion, do a better job. It’s a setup for a world of trouble that none of us can really piece together the reasoning for. I don’t know if our program can handle a more active role with this person even this year, considering they were enough to make someone quit.

I think that this is the most important paragraph in everything I’m writing right now. Overall, the opinions on this individual in the eyes of students are nearly unanimous. But it seems that time and time again, and not just in band, the adults (coaches, staff, directors, parents, clinicians, etc…) are constantly gushing over them, giving them any privilege, any solo, or any position that they possibly can. It is boggling to all of us students, and it has been happening since they stepped foot in the building freshman year. And this is not a situation of everyone “ganging up” on this person. They are not unpopular as far as our arts go and are only called out on their behavior when appropriate, certainly not bullied. And even if they were, pity is not a reason to give someone and leadership or solo they want. It’s almost like the adults are afraid to say no to them. I really want to make it clear that I do not dislike this person, and this does not stem from jealousy (there are no positions/roles than we have ever had to “compete” over, on account of us being different grades, genders, vocal parts, instruments, etc.)

I want to point out that this person does have depression and adhd. A lot of people will use this as an excuse for them, even the directors at our school. But guess who else is mentally ill and neurodivergent…? Me! And so many other people on leadership team or who are devoted members of the group. Mental illness and neurodivergence, while they can affect how you behave, does not excuse your behavior. I am unmedicated but recently diagnosed (will be trying medication soon), and I am by no means discounting the constant struggle or how it affects people in different ways. I do have down moments where I am irritable and short with people that I will be the first to address, but I do my best to not let it affect me and in my opinion I feel like I do a pretty good job at being enthusiastic and helpful at all times, especially as I have worked on myself. So what I’m trying to say in this super long paragraph (sorry haha) is that whatever is going on up there is no excuse for their leadership to not be evaluated just as anyone else’s would be, neurodivergence/mental illness or not.

I really don’t know what to do about this situation, or if there’s anything to do. I really would just like some guidance if there is any since this seems like a pretty unique situation, such as how I can prevent any issues from occurring indirectly/without a fuss, and what to do if/when this becomes an issue. I really worry for this year and I want nothing more than to improve the program as best as I can for this year and years to come, and I’m pretty pressed about this being as much of a road block as it was last year. Thank you in advance.

TL;DR (courtesy of ChatGPT 😂): As the head drum major, I'm concerned about our marching band director's decision to retain and promote a problematic leader. This individual, who has been brash, rude, and non-committal, was given a new ""drum major understudy"" role despite over half the interviewees, including past and present leadership, expressing concerns. Their behavior has caused significant issues, including driving a member to quit and causing disruptions in sectionals. While they seek attention and recognition, the decision to promote them is baffling and seems to ignore the majority opinion of the students. Despite this person's ADHD and depression, which some use to excuse their behavior, I believe leadership roles should be based on merit and behavior. I'm looking for guidance on how to address this issue and improve our program.",User_deleted,1

>""Education systems should focus more on imparting practical skills than on teaching theoretical knowledge.

>Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing  
and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the  
recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples  
shape your position.""

My Essay :

>Once we graduate from high school or university and are looking for a job, we realise that the real world and companies are looking for employees with great practical skills in the relevant industry. Our grades and academics do not matter as much as our practical skills do. This not only proves the importance of practical knowledge in real scenarios, but also reflects a gap in the education system, which fails to address this need. I completely agree that all education systems should focus primarily on practical skills, and lesser on theoretical knowledge. 

>Theory definitely forms the basis for a strong foundation, for any kind of knowledge. It helps us understand concepts and the rationale behind them. It equips us with all the required knowledge before we step into the world of doing things practically. However, if education systems stop at this, we are deprived of the real skills which will be put to use. A sole focus on theory also encourages rote learning, and an increased focus on examinations and grades, which may be unnecessary. A rocket scientist who theoretically knows how a rocket is built and works, but has never applied this knowledge practically in say, building prototypes or drafting construction drawings, will be unaware of the finer details of the process and the possible mistakes. Thus, once the basis of theoretical knowledge has been established, education systems need to focus on making the students apply this knowledge practically. 

>Another appropriate example is that of a doctor or any healthcare professional. One may be have in depth knowledge about human anatomy, diseases, treatment processes, etc. But if a doctor has never practically done first aid, or used a scalpel, or diagnosed a real patient, it is highly unlikely they will be hired. On the other hand, a nurse who has gained a lot of practical skills at school, will be able to these tasks easily. Thus practical knowledge equips us with the skills we need in the real world, and makes professionals ready for their respective industries. 

>This is the primary reason why vocational training institutes and skill training institutes are extremely successful. These kind of institutes primarily focus on training for the job, which means imparting practical skills. They teach only those theoretical concepts deemed necessary. Their main intention is to make their students ready for jobs and industries. This model is followed in a lot of developing countries, where they give their poorer population hands on training in sectors such as agriculture, animal husbandry, handicrafts, tailoring, etc. This gives them a means of livelihood right after. 

>Focusing on practical skills however, in no way means that theory can be neglected. A good and successful education policy is that in which theory and practice go hand-in-hand. Each is supplementary to the other and should be seen in this very respect.  No person will trust an architect who has the practical knowledge of how things work on site, but lacks the theoretical knowledge behind it, or does not have proper credentials. Thus theory and practice, neither are credible or helpful in isolation. 

>To conclude, it is prudent that education systems focus more on practical rather than theoretical knowledge, because it equips its students with the real skills required in real scenarios. The end goal of educators should be to back these practical skills with sound and solid theoretical study, which enhances the understanding and application of these skills. It also equips students with knowledge regarding the finer details of a process and its contingencies. Attention to practical skills is the reason why vocational and skill training institutes are a successful model. Every student wants to be ready for their industry after their learning phase, and it is their practical skills that will make them so.

1dhuzfx,48,2024-06-17,How are students cheating on Respondus Monitor tests?,u/Nesbitter,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1dhuzfx/how_are_students_cheating_on_respondus_monitor/,"Hello, all!

I'm a CC prof teaching computer programming.  Because of AI, I'm requiring high-stakes proctored tests in which the students solve programming problems for all of my classes, using Respondus Lockdown Browser and Respondus Monitor in my online courses.  We're no longer allowed to require on-campus testing for our online courses, as I used to do.

For the tests -- I've modeled the environment scan for them, they do a practice test and I give them feedback on the environment scan, and I tell them a poor environment scan might mean I won't count their test.  I record both the screen and the camera, so I can watch them solve the programming problems.  Sitting quite still for five-ten minutes except for eye movement indicating they're looking at something else and then typing the program top to bottom is obviously a red flag.  :)

I have caught several students cheating using AI by their poor environment scans combined with AI-looking code on the exams.  I tell them they're going to meet with me (virtually) and solve a similar problem in a similar amount of time, and some just drop the course at that point, and others go into the meeting with me and then can't write a simpler program with additional supports and eventually admit they used AI.

But I have other students who are writing AI-looking programs on their tests who have conducted what I consider thorough environment scans (including under the desk, behind the desk, showing me their person) and so I'm wondering what I'm missing.  They don't look like they're typing on their phone and they're not speaking -- how are they getting the spec to the AI?  I need to understand how they're cheating.

I know in other threads folks have said focus on the students who want to learn, and I don't want to be academic honesty police.  It's exhausting and upsetting.  But it's also super annoying to be providing feedback to ChatGPT -- it doesn't improve its code :D -- and I don't want to hand out passing grades to students who can't do the work at all -- it diminishes the degree for everyone.

Thank you in advance,

1difxy5,1,2024-06-17,Using ML in teaching?,u/UnkarsThug,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1difxy5/using_ml_in_teaching/,"So to be clear, I'm not a teacher. As I indicate with my flair, my degree/work is in Data Science and Machine learning. For some reason, reddit keeps recommending posts from this sub to me, but that's gotten me thinking. (I read through the rules, and I'm trying to follow them, but If I've missed something or have broken a rule, please let me know.)

I've seen a lot of posts complaining about how ""We don't have the ability to customize ourselves to the needs of every student."" And I guess, I got to thinking, what are general feelings on using forms of machine learning for that? Obviously, I don't think it's quite ready yet. That said, I'm referring to the eventual goal people like me are moving towards creating, not systems as they are now. I'll also specify that my ideal in working in AI isn't replacement of people, but more powerful tools for people.

I'll also admit, I was homeschooled, due to a number of things going on, and due to chronic medical issues, I had a very weird learning rate. (Some weeks was unable to do work, did extra other weeks.) I don't have much of an idea of how modern schooling is, although I think I turned out better than a lot of those I see spoken of here. And in college, I learned very little actually in class. Sure, I went to class to ensure I was on good terms with my teachers, but I find it far easier to learn on my own with the internet (Or by my last year, using some AI to explore concepts), where you can actually query step by step, and you can actually find the why. And later on, I learned best by finding important papers in the field, then learning the concepts I had to learn to understand what they actually meant. Sometimes that was a multi step process, where things needed breaking down more, but it meant I learned far more than what was mentioned in class.

With that said, it seems like a system working on teaching each individual student to learn at their rate would help gifted students learn faster, and slower students not be held back, because there wouldn't be a ""held back"". Instead of classifying everything by grade level, we just teach whatever concepts can be understood well, and let them grow faster in some then others. Grades themselves are a concept of trying to teach people as a collective. Grouping things by age, rather than prerequisite knowledge. 

My experience of tutoring in college was that it was absolutely useless (The tutors needed you to understand what you didn't understand, but if I understood that, I wouldn't need it explained). I agree that using AI to solve a problem doesn't help anyone, but using it to help understand a concept actually can be far more useful than most tutors, because it can explain it at whatever level you need.   
  
And I don't even just mean AI like ChatGPT, but also ML like jpdb, which is a system I use to learn Japanese characters. As you go, it learns your memorization rate, and attempts to maximize the speed of learning kanji by taking advantage of showing you characters right before they would leave short term memory (which allows you to actually retain more at a time). It's been very effective for me, and I think about intelligent systems being able to do that in other areas as well, even without an LLM or generative AI.

Again, a lot of the systems aren't quite ready at the moment. I know that. It isn't good enough or reliable enough. But the questions I am working towards asking are:   
  
Do you think a student to student system of learning using AI for instruction is something that should be worked towards? What flaws do you think such systems will have? And what about systems more like jpdb, which is just a maximized learning algorithm catered to the individual, rather than something that tries to mimic a full teacher?",active,0

1dil8l4,1,2024-06-18,Help Choosing Courses,u/Riomari,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1dil8l4/help_choosing_courses/,"Hi I'm looking for help choosing courses, I tried speaking to my cs coordinator, but as they take the time to answer, I hoped to find some answers here (the below is partly written with chatgpt).

Im a fourth-year computer science student at @$#%, and I am reaching out to seek your guidance on course selection for the upcoming academic year.

I have a strong interest in pursuing data-related fields, potentially focusing on machine learning in my masters. I have an opportunity for a machine learning honours position this semester and am considering the following courses for my remaining credits.

I have 18 credits left to complete, with 12 credits dedicated to my honours and capstone projects. This leaves me with 6 credits for two elective courses, one for each semester.

For the first semester, I am deciding between:

1. Machine Learning
2. Operating Systems

While Operating Systems is fundamental to a computer science major, the Machine Learning course might better align with my potential master's focus.

For the second semester, I am considering:

1. Networks
2. Database Systems (400-level course)
3. Data Mining (an experiential course, though I am unsure of its exact nature)
4. I would have included the Deep Learning course (an experiential course), but as of right now it is full.

All these courses seem crucial for my current trajectory towards a data-focused master's program. Additionally, I am have just completed a machine learning course on Coursera and plan to start a deep learning or cloud computing course soon. (I decided to write a data scraper to fill a react website for real estate data, will try to include aws/some s3 alternative in there)

Given my interests and the courses available, could you provide any recommendations on which courses to prioritize?

1djawwp,1,2024-06-19,Best AI chatbots for customer service?,u/mes204_,ArtificialInteligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1djawwp/best_ai_chatbots_for_customer_service/,"Hello,  
I run a martial arts gym (not on site), and I handle all the leads and sales. 

I have a process where I have them go through a brief-ish process of SPIN questions to further qualify them, improve the perceived value on the prospects mind before going into the gym and to have and to overall build better relationships to improve CRR.  
So I begin the interaction with a voice note where I explain how the process will go and why it goes like this.  
Then I inquire and gather information about where they are, what they want to achieve and what would achieving that mean to them, etc.   
So I can then give this information to the teachers to give them their respective welcoming and for them to have a better understanding of the student's sitation to deliver a more comprehensive experience.  
I would also, with this info, be following up with them periodically to monitor their progress.

These conversations are a back and forth, what you'd expect from a SPIN process.   
However, they last long . . , and each conversation individually demands my full attention so I cannot do multiple at a time. 

As I've improved marketing efforts, leads are coming in strong, I simply cannot possibly handle this by myself.

I was thinking of training ChatGPT to attend the conversations, I'd give it a list of questions, each categorized within the SPIN process and tell it that as the conversation unfolds to then determine and ask the questions are pertinent, to eventually lead to the first class scheduling and close.  
So I would send the initial voice note, and from then on out copy and paste the rest of the interaction. 

This is a tremendous grind, as I'd have to be creating new chats and trainings constantly for each prospect, as much as it is more of a time saver than going through the leads by myself, it still isn't as efficient nor effective (arguably GPT cannot sound less of a human nowadays and anyone with an ounce of discernement can call it so I'd still have to be there tweaking it).

  
Surely there must be a reliable, trainable chatbot out there for such purposes? 

I'd appreciate all insights and suggestions.

1dkwtul,34,2024-06-21,"Monash Computer Science / IT semester 1, year 1 detailed review",u/jobless4days,Monash,https://www.reddit.com/r/Monash/comments/1dkwtul/monash_computer_science_it_semester_1_year_1/,"Hi there. This is an extensive review on the courses I took in semester 1 for Bachelor of Advanced computer science, my thoughts / evaluation of the degree thus far. I will also briefly cover the value of the degree and its relation to the industry.

In semester 1 I took FIT1045: Introduction to programming, MAT1830: Discrete maths, FIT1047: Introduction to computer systems, networks and security, and the elective FIT1050: Web Development.

# Overall Advice

Do not fall behind. This cannot be emphasised enough. The difficulty of catching up is beyond me. Begin the semester with focus and determination, and leave the holiday mindset behind. Falling behind at the start and mid-way through nearly ruined my entire semester. More details on that later, but heed this warning seriously: staying on track is crucial.

Timetable

The ideal timetable can significantly impact your university experience. It depends on factors such as your commute, peak activity times, and alignment with friends' schedules. Aligning your schedule with friends is beneficial as it motivates you to learn and enhances the overall experience. If you don't have friends attending Monash, that's fine too. For Computer Science, I recommend opting for midday and late morning classes. This helps keep your schedule in check and maintains a consistent sleep routine. Here are some recommendations:

● If you have a long commute ( **>1 hour 30 minutes**): Bunch your classes over two days to minimise travel.

● If you have a short commute (**<1 hour 30 minutes**): Spread classes across four days to allow flexibility.

● Midday and Late Morning Classes: These help maintain a consistent schedule and avoid disrupting your sleep routine.

● Avoid Long Breaks Between Classes: Long breaks are usually unproductive and can make the day more tiring. Just bunch your classes together.

# Importance of Units

Ranking these units in terms of importance:

**1. FIT1045: Introduction to Programming**

**2. MAT1830: Discrete Mathematics**

**3. FIT1047: Introduction to Computer Systems, Networks, and Security**

**4. FIT1050: Web Development (Elective)**

**FIT1045** is foundational for your programming career. It is the most important unit in semester 1. The faster you get good at this subject, the better you will perform in future units, as they build upon the knowledge gained in this course and beyond. Assignment 3 being especially helpful with the required implementation of non error prone code. This is a core unit to your CS degree. 

**MAT1830** provides the necessary mathematical foundation for future programming units. Understanding discrete maths well will prepare you well for advanced coding units, where it covers a variety of proofs through induction and as the name says it will develop inductive thinking, which helps a lot in computer science, where some say it's crucial. MAT1830 also covers a broad range of topics, helping you identify your strengths and weaknesses. This is a core unit to your CS degree.

**FIT1047** offers a brief overview of various topics, including bits and assembly language coding which aids the students in understanding what happens under the hood of your programming, “under the hood” will be taught in future units anyways, so not understanding it isn’t a big deal. That’s why I ranked this below. And this whole thing about FIT1047 giving you a ""taste"" of different units? It doesn't really work. If you're into cybersecurity, this unit probably won't convince you either way. On top of that, most people who pick the cybersecurity unit already have their minds made up before starting the degree. This is a core unit to your CS degree.

**FIT1050** was the least important, I chose it due to a lack of better options. This is NOT a core unit to your CS degree.

# Unit Difficulty

Each unit will be rated on a difficulty scale from 0% (very easy) to 100% (very hard). The difficulty will be assessed based on how challenging it is to maintain a 65 to 70 WAM and to stay on top of the material. Overall, none of these units should be considered inherently difficult; they are all manageable. Many students overthink the difficulty of the semester and the Computer Science degree, leading to unnecessary anxiety. Reflecting on my experience, the semester was quite manageable, but I fell behind, which severely complicated things. Staying on top of the content is crucial, as it is very doable with consistent effort, this isn’t Medical or Astrophysics lil bro.

**Ranking these units in terms of difficulty:**

**1. FIT1045: Introduction to Programming**

**2. MAT1830: Discrete Mathematics**

**3. FIT1047: Introduction to Computer Systems, Networks, and Security**

**4. FIT1050: Web Development**

**FIT1045: Introduction to Programming: 50% to 60%.** 

Without prior programming experience, the unit can throw people off as it forces you to think in a ‘different’ way, you cannot rote learn programming (technically you can but then you might as well join medical school). Simply reading solutions to in-class problems / lectures is not good, because when the weeks start passing your problem solving skills will fall short. Develop those skills so that you can implement it in assignments, more on general problem solving in **further advice**. The in-class activities i’m talking about are slightly easier than the assignment tasks, however some can be quite difficult. Especially week ‘s post-class where they get us to program a Wordle game, i’d say this one was assignment equivalent. This unit is most difficult in semester 1 because it builds upon itself, unlike other units where you can sometimes fall behind and still manage. The assignments progressively get harder. They are divided into tasks, where the tasks get more difficult as you go on as well. It's not like MAT1830 or FIT1047 where they throw new topics at you every few weeks and you can just learn the new stuff without needing to remember everything that came before. I saw some people saying they skipped the final task on assignment 1, or got poor marks on it. Utilising resources such as consultations and PASS sessions is key to jump those final task barriers. The assignments can be challenging due to sometimes unclear task instructions and the numerous ways to approach problems. However, they include pre-written code, offering a path to solutions. Many tasks involve setting up variables and functions, providing opportunities for easy marks. FIT1045 is a group assignment subject, which makes it tougher, a lot of people end up getting carried by teammates (freezing their problem-solving skills, an explanation from your groupmate is nowhere near equivalent to solving the assignment task yourself) or get stuck with bad teammates (dragging them down). This is all justified as being like the ""real world,"" which I get, but it can be a nightmare. The one thing that makes this unit easier is the tests. There are three of them, each worth 10%, and they're piss easy. You can literally study the night before and be fine. Most people I know got above 7/10, even those who struggled with the assignments.

**MAT1830, Discrete Maths: 45% to 50%**

In previous years, MAT1830 was reportedly harder due to the exam, but our experience was quite manageable.The final exam allows a double-sided cheat sheet, which reduces the difficulty of the unit. The assignments are small, usually just one page long, and can be completed last minute if necessary. Typically, only the last question is VERY challenging. Each assignment is worth 4% and due on Wednesdays at 11:55 PM. Quizzes, worth 3%, are due alternately each week. Achieving 75% is feasible (75% on assignments and quizzes if you want to get 65% overall with 50% on the exam) as there are few questions, and numerous similar examples are available online. If exams aren't your strength, aim for 15-16/20 on assignments and 11-12/15 on quizzes. The quizzes have no time limit, infinite attempts, and a generous deadline. Tutors at the MLC can guide you through questions and concepts. I rated this unit as less difficult than FIT1045 because some students even managed without watching lectures, relying instead on only YouTubers such as **TrevTutors**, **Organic Chemistry Tutor**, and **Kimberly** **Brehm**. Many people stress about falling behind on lectures, but with 33 one-hour lectures in the semester, you can easily catch up by watching one lecture a day. Even during exam periods, watching four lectures a day at 2x speed will suffice. And if you are reading this early on in the semester, trust me, take out one hour in your week to attend the math learning centre and do the extra discrete maths questions. I wish I had done them. Induction and strong induction are challenging, but getting good at induction is beneficial for future units i’ve heard, especially FIT2004 was it ? While TikTok and IG might make discrete maths seem extremely challenging, it's not nearly as tough as in top American universities. Here’s a quote from some random american redditor uni student: **“For the people that had discrete at a university where it wasn’t a weed-out course they’ll just shrug their shoulders. At mine, it was the first time I had to accept the ceiling on my intelligence”**. I can guarantee our discrete maths is nowhere near that hard... Dude said “ceiling on my intelligence”, that’s outrageous man 💀.

**FIT1047, Introduction to Computer Systems, Networks, and Security: 35% to 40%**

People might disagree with this rating, but here's my perspective. The only truly hard assignment was Assignment 2 because it was assembly code. For the life of me I could not understand it, I attended other people’s tutorials and I still couldn’t get it. Definitely start on that assignment the second it's due. The other assignments were mostly report writing. The difficulty of FIT1047 mostly stems from the poorly written assignments, making them hard to understand at times. However, the markers are lenient; as long as you've justified your approach, even if it's slightly off the rubric, you'll usually get the marks. Assignment 3 and 4 are straightforward once you clarify what's needed. Just ask a million questions on EdStem and reread the assignment specs multiple times over. Even if you do poorly on Assignments 1 and 2, you can still recover your grade. I initially thought I was going to fail, but Assignments 3 and 4 recovered my grade because of their high weighting. FIT1047 tests are open-book; as long as your material is offline, it’s allowed. Download the entire course and practice quizzes. The official quiz will be EXTREMELY similar (literally only numbers change) to the practice ones. On Discord, there are guides for Assignment 3’s test—download those PDFs for the official quiz, and you’ll be set. Personally I didn’t use it because I made my own notes, but I heard others did well using those documents. Assignment 2 is extremely difficult, but its reduced weighting compared to previous years lowers the overall difficulty of the unit. The once feared unit is a pisstake now. Catching up is easier than in MAT1830 and FIT1045, BUT this subject’s pre-lectures are time-consuming and boring, so it can interfere with other units.

**FIT1050, Web Development: 5% to 15%**

I felt bad for my TAs because everyone would leave early from tutorials. The in-class activities are easy—just copy-paste from the weekly slides, and you can finish in about 30 minutes. Attendance is mandatory, but once you prove you've done the work, you can leave. This contributes to a free 20% of your grade over the course of 12 weeks. The difficulty ranges up to 15% due to the time-consuming and specific nature of the unit. Easier units often have harsher grading. Unlike FIT1047, the marking here isn’t lenient. Ensure you implement every detail from the assignment rubric and specifications. Reread to verify everything is correct, as small oversights can cost marks, every percent taken off is $10 gone. The first assignment threw a lot of people off as it seemed like an easy video presentation, but people got marks taken off for very small things such as “too much text” and too much effort. Good formatting in report based assignments is also graded, which means more free marks. Assignment 2 also eats up a lot of your time if you don’t work together well with your teammates, it was the most fun assignment for me though since it was a purely design based assignment. Assignment 3 is the most demanding, because it's due around the same time as many other assignments, so make sure you save up your free unit extension for this assignment. It’s essentially the crux of the unit, you have to build a website using a template. The fact that we use a template throws people off, and they think it’ll be easy and quick, “anyone can use a template”, until you realise that you also have to change up the template enough for a decent mark and implement your own code. Assignment 4, however, is very easy and takes less than half a day to complete because it's purely a report and reflection on your work throughout the unit (this one still requires attention to detail on the rubric and specification though).

# Enjoyment

**Ranking in terms of enjoyment:**

**1. MAT1830: Discrete Mathematics**

**2. FIT1050: Web Development**

**3. FIT1045: Introduction to Programming**

**4. FIT1047: Introduction to Computer Systems, Networks, and Security**

**MAT1830**: It’s not that I'm super passionate about computer science, but I enjoyed MAT1830 since it didn’t have a strong mathematical prerequisite. My tutorial felt like a fun high school class, which depends on the people in your class, again afternoon / late morning classes are likely to be the best. The unit is flexible; you can attend lectures physically or digitally. The content is actually interesting if you focus because you can immediately apply the lessons to your real life and general way of thinking, making it a breath of fresh air. It's easier than you think to catch up on everything. I didn’t focus for most of the semester and still managed to catch up in time for the exam (though I don’t recommend this approach to anything as MAT1830 is foundational for future units, I should have tried harder). 

**FIT1050** was fun, largely because I had a good class and the work was easy. The assignments were extremely time-consuming but mindless—you don't need to think much. As long as you follow the brief and specifications, you can just turn on music, relax, and get a break from your other units.

**FIT1045** wasn't enjoyable for me because I fell behind, which was challenging to recover from. I don’t know how I passed, only GOD knows. It would have been fine if I had been more committed.

**FIT1047** was horrendous initially as it consumed much of my time, leaving little for other subjects. However, as the semester progressed, it became more engaging. I particularly enjoyed Assignment 3; it was refreshing to have a hands-on / physical assignment, providing a change from the usual tasks. We drew out a map of our given building and measured network speeds from different areas.

# Atmosphere / people

In the Computer Science program, I found that the people I met defied common stereotypes. While there were FEW who fit the typical ""nerdy"" image, the majority were just regular folks. Computer Science has turned into the new MBA everyone and their mum is doing CS, removing its previous ""nerdy"" stereotype. As the degree’s reach has expanded, the field has become far more diverse. It's possible that because it's a first-year unit, students are still exploring their interests (so it has a larger student base) so there are more “normal” people. Perhaps in later years, the stereotypes become more evident, but in my experience, they weren't prevalent.

# TAs / professors /  availabler resources

In **FIT1045**, I found the best TAs and professors, they need to chill out a little bit on the memes though. If you're not satisfied with your FIT1045 TAs, you can always attend another random class and likely find better ones. 

The professor for **MAT1830** is also excellent; he's very accommodating with exam scaling and answers all questions clearly on Moodle. I recently found out that he’s also a bit of a celebrity in his professor niche. Personally, my TA for MAT1830 was amazing, but I've heard that others were slow with marking and weren’t clear. 

**FIT1050** TAs were decent, though I encountered some condescension. However, they were generally helpful with in-class activities. 

**FIT1047** had the worst TAs. All these subjects offer great resources like consultations and passes. 

Overall, MAT1830 has good tutorial sessions and exam consultations, while FIT1050 offers consultations to clear up assignment questions and get critiques on websites. Attend these sessions; you're paying for uni after all.

# The value of the Computer Science Degree

I'm stepping out of my boundaries as a first-year student, but this is a burning question on everyone's mind these days. Social media doesn't help with all the ""CS is cooked"" memes, or the speculation about whether AI will make CS obsolete, or if getting a degree at Monash is worth it. The broadness of Computer Science convinced me to choose this path. Even if programming isn't your thing, CS offers diverse career options beyond software engineering. While IT degrees may not cover all CS roles, a CS background equips you for a wide range of IT jobs and beyond. The whole AI thing doesn’t matter at this current point either, because if software engineers get replaced by AI, then you should know that literally every other job will be finished as well. Also, a degree at Monash is fine. As much as people say that university doesn’t matter, it can have some impact. You are attending a G08 university after all, you’ll be fine.

**Here are some jobs offered by CS outside of software engineering :**

**- Business analyst**

**- Cloud help / support**

**- Customer success / solutions engineer**

**- Cybersecurity analyst**

**- Data analyst**

**- Database admin**

**- DevOps engineer**

**- IT helpdesk / support**

**- Network engineer**

**- Product manager**

**- Project manager**

**- Quality assurance engineer**

**- Researcher**

**- Sysadmin**

**- Systems analyst**

**- Technical program manager**

**- Technical sales**

**- Technical writer**

**- Technology consultant**

**- UX/UI designer -> this one can lead to even more jobs and the field of graphic design.**

# Workload

The workload in Semester 1 is manageable, trust me. Just follow the tips outlined in this review, and you'll be alg. It’s not like we’re doing chemical or electrical engineering lil bro.

# Teaching Style

All of these units follow a learning system where you engage with pre-work material and then use lectures and tutorials to reinforce your understanding. This style of learning has been critiqued because it places further focus on yourself rather than the university but I genuinely think it's a good choice from the university. Do the pre-work, and then clarify anything you don’t understand from teachers.

# Woodside Building

The building is nice, it has a cool looking race car and a nice elevator.

# Tech Club

Definitely attend IT / CS clubs to gain relevant industry insight. The biggest ones are Wired IT, and MAC.

# Further Advice

I recommend following a python course, you can find one on r/LearnPython. Along with a random discrete maths course, there’s a good one on coursera. Join the corresponding online communities to help you with anything you struggle to understand. You don’t have to tryhard the courses, but get a feel for everything and attempt problems / questions, they’ll be extremely useful when you actually do the unit. I wish I was locked in before I attended this semester. Literally just dedicate 2 hours a day and you’ll be set.

Here are some general problem solving PDFs, they’ll help you break down and understand problems. Overall they’ll assist you in improving those logic skills.

# TL;DR

- Use the wide resources available for FIT1045, try to start a course on Python before doing FIT1045. Do not fall behind.

- Attend Math Learning Centre for MAT1830, ask them to cook up similar questions to the ones in your assignments and then have them help you understand those similar questions.

- Be wary of poorly written assignments in FIT1047 and make sure to use EDSTEM to clarify all questions, start early as this unit is time-consuming.

- Watchout for harsh markers in FIT1050, follow the assignment rubric to every word. Be careful as this unit eats up time.",User_deleted,63

1dmfh8o,251,2024-06-23,Reflections on 524,u/Usual_Amphibian4666,Mcat,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mcat/comments/1dmfh8o/reflections_on_524/,"This post is my reflection on my process of studying for 4/12. It is primarily focused on documenting my approach and building an exam taxonomy - that is, the types of questions that you will encounter across each of the 4 sections and the implications on studying. I will not focus on discussing the benefits various resources (UWorld, Anki, Kaplan etc). From the outset, my objective for this exam was to score in the 99th percentile. I also started with a high practice score. This advice is probably most applicable to those trying to eek out marginal points. I believe that mindset is more important than actual tactics, as specific implementations will vary from person to person. I elaborate below.

**Proof**

**Context**: My background is kind of non-traditional and I felt that BB started weak. On the other hand, my CP and CARS started off strong. I was always a serious student, but I firmly attribute the score not only to strong foundations but rather reflection and continuous improvement.  
**Scores**: I took FL5 first by mistake

FL5: 521 (130/132/128/131)

FL1: 524 (132/130/132/130)

FL2: 517 (129/130/130/128)

FL3: 523 (132/131/130/130)

FL4: 524 (132/132/129/131)

**Question Taxonomy**:

You can slice the MCAT in three ways: types of questions, types of mistakes, types content. These types posts often focus on section specific tips, but mine will focus on question & mistake taxonomy. The types of questions determine the types of mistakes that you can make. The types of mistakes determine how you should study to make sure they don’t happen again.

To begin, some definitions.

Discrete - no passage is provided.

Pseudo-discrete - passage is provided but not used.

Chart interpretation/experiment - requires data interpretation and understanding of experiment

Text based - requires reading the passage

C/P: Pseudo-discretes, discretes.

CARS: Text based

B/B: Pseudo-discretes, discretes, chart interpretation/experiment

P/S: Pseudo-discretes, discretes, few chart interpretation

**Mistake Taxonomy**

There are only two types of mistakes.

First, a content gap. For example, if the question asks about the thin lens equation and you don’t know it, then you’ve found a content gap. Similarly, if the question is about endosomal pathways and you don’t know the difference between early and late endosomes, you have a content gap. These can occur in 3/4 types of questions: discretes, pseudo-discretes, and chart interpretation, but they are most common in the first two categories. These types of mistakes show up in CP and PS most and BB a little less. CARS never has these mistakes. The MCAT cannot test every topic. However, systematically eliminating content gaps ensures that of the topics tested, you have the highest chance of getting it right.

Second, reasoning issue. These show up in the text-based and chart interpretation/experiment types of questions. Consider a BB passage that asks us to interpret a gel – we would probably need to identify the purpose of the experiment, the control(s), and the experimental variable(s). This is almost always enough to identify the finding. If I made a type 2 error, I would convince myself why all the incorrect options are wrong, then convince myself that the correct answer is right by clearly identifying the purpose and dependent/dependent variables. These are usually BB/CARS questions.

The difference between the two types of mistakes is that content gaps mean you are missing facts; reasoning issues come from misinterpreting the facts at hand.

**Approach**:

If you are trying to get a top score, you have to approach this exam as if you will get every question correct. This is just necessary because you can only miss a couple questions per section if you want to get a 132/131. This is evident when you look at the practice exam curves. I suspect that on the real exam, the curve is more generous but this attitude was critical to how I developed my study process. Always, always ask “why did I get this wrong and what do I need to know so that I don’t make this mistake again?” **Every incorrect must be analyzed with the utmost honesty.** You need to dig deeply to identify the fundamental drivers of the mistake, then design a system that ensures you will never make that same (or similar) mistake again.

FLs and UWorld are used to identify explicit content gaps, which are filled in through a combination of reading Kaplan, using ChatGPT, or Reddit. Then, find a way to review these content gaps on a recurring basis. I made a spreadsheet to log every single mistake; other people might use Anki. S

**Briefly on section tactics**:

Each section requires a different tactical approach. Here are some brief thoughts:

For C/P I would just finish UWorld. The questions are excellent. I used UWorld to identify gaps in content understanding then tried to make it intuitive. For example, I never memorized equations - I always tried to derive them at least once, so I wouldn't have problems if I forgot the equation. Concretely, consider the relationship between resistors in series vs. parallel. Resistors in series have the same current through each, so that means Vtot = IR1 + IR2. Then, the reasoning is similar for parallel resistors. Finally, I remembered that it's flipped for capacitors.

For CARS, I don't really have advice sorry. I didn't focus very much on it and my CARS was always 130-132. I will say the answer is always, always in the passage and to practice the QPacks.

For BB just do every SB question and analyze your mistakes. This video is basically my approach: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcNbOTAQCG8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcNbOTAQCG8) 

For P/S Pankow deck is the best. I think that this one is the hardest to consistently get 132 in because there are discretes that can trip you up. However with the deck you can definitely get 130-132 range

**Miscellaneous thoughts**

1.     Most of the posts on r/MCAT are not helpful. There is a lot of validation seeking, complaining, and instances of the blind leading the blind. Focus the single most important thing: getting the maximum number of questions correct and use Reddit only in pursuit of this thing.

2.     Focus is a key driver of learning, so maintain your focus at all costs. This means staying on top of nutrition, sleep, and exercise. Treat yourself like an elite athlete and you will see dividends in the quality and length of your focus. I think I would have seen a score boost if I had exercised more regularly and spoken with friends.

3.     Train stamina. I was making easy mistakes on FLs simply because I was tired. Treat FLs as the real deal; do long blocks of UWorld to train further. By the end, I was doing \~120-150 UWorld questions a day in 59 question blocks.

4.     Make a study schedule. It’s way easier to do 60 questions/day for 10 days than to do 300 questions over 2 days. The test comes up way faster than you would think.

5.     Variability in FL scores happens, often because of content gaps. FL2 showed big drops for me because I had gaps in thermodynamics and this topic showed a lot. All you can do is work diligently to analyze your mistakes and improve for the next time.

1dn3khn,11,2024-06-23,So many browser tabs,u/fuhrmanator,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1dn3khn/so_many_browser_tabs/,"I'm in the info tech field and have been known to keep open a dozen browser tabs, especially when working on a paper, or debugging some tricky algorithm or configuring a CI/CD script with the help of ChatGPT. It allows keeping a context when I have not quite finished an important, complex task across interruptions. There's obviously a point at which there are too many tabs, and I will close the ones that are not useful. One of the pleasures of finishing the high-level task is closing the tabs associated with it! 

However, last week a student asked me for some help reviewing for the midterm (we do a lot of exercises in class, so it's pretty rare to get asked for offline time). The meeting was a zoom meeting. When the student shared their screen I was floored: three browsers (Edge, Chrome and Firefox) were open and each had so many browser tabs, and each tab was just as wide as the ""x"" to close it. I have no idea how anyone can navigate that! 

Surprisingly, the student was able to ask me questions pretty efficiently referring to different material (the book and the exercises are online). I gave the benefit of the doubt that all the tabs were for *all* of their courses, and it was the week before mid terms, so I empathize with the student to some degree. 

But likely it's a student who is badly organized, and maybe it's a symptom of distress with all the course load? When a student asks for help, I'm reluctant to comment about something like too many browser tabs because I want them to feel safe. Many students have learning handicaps but don't have money for a medical diagnosis to get accommodations. In Quebec unless you're diagnosed before adolescence, the waiting list is really long for a public health (free) diagnosis, and I was told it's $2k to do it via the private system.

When students are struggling with turning in work after 3 weeks (not the case of the student I met), I email them stating the fact, reminding them they can get help from Student Services with study habits and attitudes. Most students are thankful, or simply don't respond. But sometimes (rarely) they are defensive and don't appreciate the email.  

Would you say anything to a student with so many browser tabs open?",active,10

Now i have no idea of coding or it or whatever. Some html basic code for some old blog back in 2009 and that's it.

Can anyone point out, in what order should i take these classes? Purely like skill to skill. Like for example no9 requires to know no4 and no5 first, that kind of thing, the natural order of things.

Or in your opinion if i could take 3-4 of them and be able to start working somewhere. I know a lot of them maybe not the same object. I don't even know what these title descriptions mean. So I probably really am asking a lot here, but I d appreciate. 

As far as i know coursera costs 54 per month or some annual subscription. And these courses take time. Say I finish some of them should i be able to use my certificate, will i find a job? Is the certificate free or I have to pay more? Are they generaly acceptable in a CV?

  
Please, whoever has the time to help a poor fella out, I really need this.

Here are my 2 pence in a way that hopefully contributes something useful.

AI - or large language models (LLMs) specifically - read and generate word sequences based only on probabilities after having learned those probabilities from text samples.  The number of text samples is usually large.  To put it more reductively, LLMs know what they know but don't know anything beyond that; what it knows is in the form of word probabilities.  Thats it, they dont have any deeper insights.  

Detecting AI usage is a fools errand

Narrative and word sequences are the AI models' playing field.  IMHO it is intractable for an individual professor to detect students' AI usage by evaluating narrative. Trying to do so winds up totally missing the point (which is to assess the student) and is tantamount to trying to beat AI at its own game.

AI detectors are, by in large, misleading. They too work under the hood with word probabilities. Using them is akin to trying to classify whether something is a duck by measuring how fast it flies. Lots of things can fly as fast as a duck without being a duck; lots of word sequences genuinely generated by students could correspond to probabilities that are similar to sequences generated by AI.

Having said that, there is a lot AI is capable of.  For the sake of brevity, I'll skip mentioning these and jump right into...

AI (current) limitations

* AI may not know about copyrighted information.  It may not have access to journal papers or books from traditional publishers.
* AI does not maintain meta-data about text sources.  It has no internal bibliography of every thing it uses. (for those at the bleeding edge, this is changing with retrieval techniques and whatnot)
* AI cannot tell you how or why it came up with its result.
* AI does not synthesize systematically from foundational principles.  It does a glorified free-association exercise with words.

The Moral to this Story:  Use these limitations to your advantage

* AI often hallucinates fictive references or only finds references from open access publishers.  Make students use and provide references.
* AI can summarize any document amazingly well and can even answer specific factual questions about the document.  But it cannot explain why the document is related to an underlying principle or concept.
* AI cannot articulate its process that led to its output.  Grade the process rather than the product.  

Obviously, not all courses can be designed in this way, so YMMV.

**Online Professional Development Courses**

[Hypothesis Academy](https://web.hypothes.is/hypothesis-academy/): These Canvas courses can be taken for free if your institution has a Hypothesis license.  There are 2 courses, ""Social Annotation 101"" and ""Social Annotation in the Age of AI"".  The AI-focused one addresses how to use social annotation assignments both ""against"" and ""with"" AI.  I've taken the AI-focused one and found it helpful.  I will be trying annotation assignments out for this first time this fall, but I regularly see posters in this sub who recommend it as a fairly AI-resilient type of assignment (depending on how the instructor establishes the criteria and evaluation for their specific annotation assignments, of course).

[Teaching with AI @ Auburn](https://biggio.auburn.edu/programs/artificial-intelligence/teaching-with-ai-auburn): A course in Canvas which costs $89 for non-Auburn users. It has been featured in both the *Chronicle* and *Inside Higher Ed*. I only just started working my way through the eight modules, but there does seem to be a lot of well-structured information and practical suggestions.  Users who want to submit ""assignments"" related to each of the modules can earn a digital course completion badge.  ETA: Once you enroll, the fee gives you access to the course for one year.  If you want to earn the badge, you can do so at your own pace.

**Book**

[\_Teaching with AI\_ (Bowen and Watson, Johns Hopkins U Press, 2024)](https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/53869/teaching-ai):  I'm sure some here will find the authors too ""pro-AI"" for their tastes, and I'm only about half-way through the book, but I do feel that it's furthering my thinking on a number of important issues and the latter chapters appear to include a lot of specific assignment ideas and instructions.

**Newsletter**

[""Rhetorica,"" a Substack newsletter by Marc Watkins](https://marcwatkins.substack.com/archive?sort=new):  Watkins is a Lecturer of Writing and Rhetoric and Director of the AI Summer Institute for Teachers of Writing at the U of Mississippi. I only discovered this newsletter this week but immediately found myself binge-reading a bunch of his entries.  I particularly recommend the seven posts from this May and June which he groups together as a series called ""Beyond ChatGPT.""  The series focuses on the effects that the AI products now available are already having on fundamental student skills and experiences beyond just writing, including [reading](https://marcwatkins.substack.com/p/no-one-is-talking-about-ais-impact?r=1z9b3o&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&triedRedirect=true), [notetaking](https://marcwatkins.substack.com/p/ais-promise-to-pay-attention-for?r=1z9b3o&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&triedRedirect=true), [research](https://marcwatkins.substack.com/p/whats-at-stake-when-we-automate-research), and [tutoring](https://marcwatkins.substack.com/p/why-are-we-in-a-rush-to-replace-teachers?r=1z9b3o&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&triedRedirect=true), as well as areas of faculty work such as [feedback](https://marcwatkins.substack.com/p/what-does-automating-feedback-mean?r=1z9b3o&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&triedRedirect=true) and [instructional design](https://marcwatkins.substack.com/p/ai-instructional-design-must-be-more?r=1z9b3o&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&triedRedirect=true).

Also particularly eye-opening for me were his two posts from this past February titled [""The AI Influencers Selling Students Learning Shortcuts""](https://marcwatkins.substack.com/p/the-ai-influencers-selling-students) and [""Your Students Are Already Using AI You've Never Heard Of""](https://marcwatkins.substack.com/p/your-students-are-already-using-ai)  I remember reading so many articles in early 2023 that predicted that ChatGPT would be  just the ""tip of the iceberg,"" but I didn't really understand what that meant until I read these posts.  (Watching the examples of the marketing Tik Tok vids which are pushing these products was dispiriting to say the least...)

In his most recent post (June 21), Watkins says he plans to continue the ""Beyond ChatGPT"" series with posts which will provide an expanded consideration of each the seven topics introduced in the first part of the series along with ""strategies educators can use to work *with* AI or *against* AI in their teaching.""

A new short course, ""Carbon Aware Computing for GenAI Developers,"" is now available on the DeepLearning.AI platform. The course, taught by Nikita Namjoshi from Google Cloud, aims to educate developers on quantifying and mitigating the carbon footprint of machine learning models [1]. 







Lume, a startup from Y Combinator's W23 batch, has launched a platform that automates data mappings using AI. The platform targets industries like ecommerce, insurance, manufacturing, and financial products, and offers a 50% discount for the first 6 months to users who mention seeing them via Launch YC [2].







OrcaAI, a startup part of the NVIDIA Inception program, is using AI-powered navigation systems to enhance safety, reduce costs, and improve environmental friendliness in shipping. Their real-time navigation system, SeaPod, has already prevented the release of over 170,000 tons of CO2 emissions [3].







NVIDIA AI Developer promotes the use of LangChain Templates and NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails for building safer LLM applications. Detailed steps are provided for integrating NeMo Guardrails with LangChain Templates and setting up a LangChain server for API access [4]. NVIDIA cuBLAS library version 12.5 introduces Grouped GEMM APIs for single, double, and half precisions, improving performance for deep learning and high-performance computing workloads [5].







Satya Nadella congratulated the Partner of the Year Award winners for their efforts in ensuring the benefits of AI reach every country, company, and individual [6]. NVIDIA will be showcasing the latest breakthroughs in graphics, generative AI, digital twins, research, OpenUSD, and robotics at SIGGRAPH 2024 [7]. NVIDIA is also hosting a series of webinars on how generative AI is transforming the retail industry [8].







Google announced new educational features at ISTE, including bringing Gemini to teen students to help them learn responsibly and confidently [9]. Google AI concluded the Research@ Munich event, covering advancements in AI, climate, health, privacy, and quantum computing [10]. Google AI has demonstrated the feasibility and benefits of learning from human feedback for text-to-image generation [11]. Google AI is also using AI technology to analyze media content and uncover patterns in representation, partnering with the Geena Davis Institute and USC to create a more equitable media landscape [12].







The a16z Podcast discusses the evolution of cybersecurity from 1995 to the present day, highlighting the challenges faced by security experts and the potential future of cybersecurity, including AI-driven threats and autonomous security systems [13]. Groq Inc's VP, Compiler Software, Andrew Ling, will be speaking at the 8th Annual Toronto Machine Learning Summit (TMLS) on July 15 about modifying PyTorch models to enable custom data-types and persist precision information through Groq Compiler [16].







Yann LeCun announced the Cambrian-1 project, focusing on vision-centric multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs). The project involves open datasets, models, and source code, with detailed comparisons on visual encoders, connector designs, instruction tuning data, and recipes [17]. LeCun also suggests that Language Model (LLMs) should stop relying on public data and instead learn from other LLMs [18].







The Useless Fun AI Build-A-Thon is scheduled for September 7, 2024, at CloudFlare in San Francisco. The event aims to provide a platform for building quirky AI projects and breaking the AI Hype Cycle [20]. OpenAI has announced a partnership with TIME to utilize its 101 years of archival content to enhance responses and provide links to stories on their platform [21].

I keep seeing all of these posts an complaints about students using ChatGPT and ""cheating"" on their assignments with it.  I do not have that problem at all.  I have discovered a simple and very effective method to get students to avoid using ChatGPT at just about any cost.  What is my secret?  It is so simple and obvious everyone will probably laugh.  I simply told the students that I WANT them to use ChatGPT to help improve their writing.  Now they avoid it like it were the plague.  Hell, they won't even use it to have someone proofread what they write themselves for grammar or context.  It is virtually foolproof.  Some students have been so honest they have actually told me that they did not use ChatGPT because I said I wanted them to.  So now that seemed like part of the work.

1dri8v9,6,2024-06-29,A+ Certified!,u/MonacledMoon7,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/1dri8v9/a_certified/,"I passed Core 2 in mid-May and took Core 1 last night and passed! I scheduled for 7:15 eastern, started test after a small hiccup around 7:35. I was number 1 in the queue as soon as I initiated check-in at 6:50.

I got a 722, my test was 70 questions and 6 PBQs. I got no port number questions at all, much to my disappointment. A lot of troubleshooting questions like ""this is wrong, what should the tech implement to fix?"" kinda stuff. My PBQs were office network issue, build computers, cable ID, and 3 different troubleshooting scenarios (printer, computer, multiple devices).

Background: 44, legally blind (only have 1 usable eye and the vision in it is 20/200), picked apart and put back together computers since my teens, 2 associate degrees in IT from 15 years ago, and worked with the community college's disability services department while I was a student to help other students learn capabilities and devices. Took a while but finally got a remote tech service job in 2015. Various vendors and responsibilities from ""pair my ear buds"" to troubleshooting security systems to ""make my internet work NOW!!!"" That company was bought out in 2023 and the new company ended up not wanting our department or the people in it. After a couple months my partner went ""hey, I saw this ad for WGU where you get all these certs along with the degree"" and within 48 hours I was signed up. 

Due to my blindness I opted to take the test online with accommodations. That process needs work. The people I spoke with were always nice but the process itself and who can't answer what questions was exhausting. Scheduling Core 1 took 3 weeks because they messed up the first time I tried to schedule.  As far as the accomms I have: an okay to use my telescopic glasses, 100% extra time, a reader/scribe (an actual person in room reading to me and selecting what I want as answers), ability to use a magnifier/inverted colors (didn't use because I had the reader/scribe and Pearson couldn't approve my dark reader extension), and the okay to move my head around as needed to see ""under"" my glasses when trying to figure out what my reader was describing in the PBQs. 

I am currently in the WGU Cybersecurity bachelor's program. In between Core 2 and Core 1 I accelerated and completed another course in my timeline because I had to wait for an eternity for accommodations and scheduling. I used the provided CertMaster eLearning stuff with a screen reader but it's a lot of dry and basic info. It's what you need to know but I'd go take a couple practice questions on Crucial and realize it didn't really give me the depth I needed to understand a concept. I should note that if a site didn't have a native dark mode and wasn't compatible with my dark reader extension I didn't even try it as a resource; dark mode forever! Anyway. I also used: 

- Messer's study groups and training guides on YouTube. I like that Messer doesn't deviate from the objectives. The tone of the questions also seem most similar to what I end up seeing on the tests. I put the videos on 1.5x or 2x speed and go to town on whatever it is I'm focusing on. 

- Crucial Exams. The study mode, the practice tests, the PBQs, flashcards, all of them were super helpful. Study mode and just cruising through as many questions as I wanted was nice. Customizable practice tests was great when I wanted a bunch of questions on one or two topics to make sure I got something. PBQs are straightforward, maybe a little too ""simple"" in comparison to what's on the actual test but at least for Core 1 they weren't too far off from the drag and drop type I ended up getting. 

- Dion practice exams on Udemy. Free access via WGU so I took advantage of that. His practice exams are fine but the tone/wording of the questions seemed more off from what I got on my actual tests. There was also a number of things that go outside the objectives. I appreciate that he seems to come at it from a more ""you're coming into this field, here's all the stuff"" angle but personally I prefer Messer's approach of ""you're taking this exam, here's what you need to know to pass"". I liked that there were a number of exams to choose from and it wasn't a one and done option. 

- Gemini. My eyes get tired after I'm staring at the screen for a while so I decided to use Google's AI to explain some concepts to me instead of sifting through lessons on CertMaster. I wouldn't study with it alone of course but it really helped. I could ask my specific question and get the answer to that without excess, unnecessary detail.  

I'm willing to answer questions if I can, even if it's just about my disability, I really don't mind. My biggest advice is to find what works for you as far as learning. Try all the avenues out there that are free or that you can afford and see what clicks with you and gets you to understand something. I've never been a big note taker, writing something down and going back to re-read it just doesn't have that same retention trigger that others have so I took no notes. For me, flashcards, Crucial study mode, and thinking about things when I'm not actively studying was what helped me retain and get that bigger picture of the concept instead of just regurgitating definitions and memorization. I also made sure that I wasn't trying to hammer in information constantly. Take breaks, touch grass, listen to music, whatever you like doing just make sure you don't drown yourself with studying and trying to get it all as quickly as possible. ",active,7
