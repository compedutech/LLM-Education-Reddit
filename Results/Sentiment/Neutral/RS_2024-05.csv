Please don't cheat and make smart choices as cheating can have huge consequences. However this may help students that already made the mistake. 

**Traditional (Christmas Tree)**

My high school teacher called this the Christmas tree. During a quiz, professors are able to see the action log. Basically, they are able to know when the session started, when students answered the questions (and bookmarked), how long a student looked at each question, and when students left the tab. Professors will know. 

[https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/52575iEE4F0A6DE33A4888?v=v2](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/52575iEE4F0A6DE33A4888?v=v2)

Not sure if this is true but I have been told that they are more capable in detecting split screens. They can detect when you copy/paste, take a screenshot, or control F. They can see when your mouse moves off the screen. 

**Apple Hand-Off** 

What is Apple Hand-Off?

""With Handoff, you can start something on one Apple device (Mac, iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch) and then seamlessly pick it up on another device. For example, start answering an email on your iPhone, then finish it in Mail on your Mac."" - Apple Support

""Detects the presence of Apple devices in the testing vicinity through exclusive AI-enabled Apple Handoff technology that alerts the live proctor."" - HonorLock 

*This can be found on Settings > General > Airplay & Handoff*

Unfortunately getting off wifi, using the private tab reduces, avoid using apple related logins, and turning DND mode reduces risks. 

**Canvas Activity (!)**

This is something that students don't really know, but I find it really important. I would completely avoid. 

Professors can see when and what you have accessed on Canvas. If you are using a secondary phone to access canvas, they will know. For Access Reports, they can see what was used, the total amount of times, and the last access time. Professors use this DURING or right after exams to see if Canvas was used after the exam started. Not sure if TAs can see. 

Unfortunately, the process only tracks the last accessed. So if a student accesses it during the test, but used it again after it ended. Professors will not be able to prove it. 

There is also live API. This is shown on a google sheet. Similarly, professors can see what was clicked on, IP address, if any other device goes on canvas, amount, and time. This shows a summary of all Canvas. I believe it shows the recent 10, 50, and 100? 

Both:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z83FW\_HqKrI&ab\_channel=RutgersOnlineLearningConference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z83FW_HqKrI&ab_channel=RutgersOnlineLearningConference)

In depth video of API:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Og1EjNaQtgw&ab\_channel=Instructure%3ATheMakersofCanvas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Og1EjNaQtgw&ab_channel=Instructure%3ATheMakersofCanvas)

Professors use both of these to prove that students are cheating. 

**What HonorLock Detects**

This website goes into detail what HonorLock Does:

[https://honorlock.com/blog/proctoring-cell-phone-detection-new/#:\~:text=Apple%20Handoff%20Detection&text=For%20example%2C%20AI%20flags%20when,a%20cell%20phone%20or%20not](https://honorlock.com/blog/proctoring-cell-phone-detection-new/#:~:text=Apple%20Handoff%20Detection&text=For%20example%2C%20AI%20flags%20when,a%20cell%20phone%20or%20not).

**Reflections**

There are some professors who goes to the extent to see the reflections in their student's eyes. I know someone who got caught because of their glasses. If the room or computer screen is too dim, the phone's brightness is too bright/low, or you have dark mode on, the professor will be able to see a random black spot in your pupil. Sometimes students get unlucky and their phone comes into frame or they drop it. This happens when the phone's weight isn't distributed on top of the palm and pinky. Other times, it will flag when students look down for too long (when the option for notes is disabled), when their head is out of frame, or when students look away for too long.

Unfortunately, the flaw to this technique is that if the lights are balanced, device is kept to the right of the screen, or held horizontal within the frame it is harder to tell. 

**Fake Questions**

Not sure if this is true, but wanted to include anyway. Apparently, similar questions are generated and posted to catch students cheating. There are same questions but the purposely wrong answers. 

Unfortunately ChatGPT (although sometimes wrong) and Quizlet may have the right answers and are real websites 

**Others**

Not sure if this is true, but do not use secondary monitors or cameras. 

&#x200B;

Again, please be smart, but know that being caught and the paranoia might not be it. Additionally, it seems like a lot of work. 

&#x200B;

**Additional Help**

If you have already cheated but none of these help remain calm and don't tattle on yourself. If you are contacted, don't necessarily lie (as this might make it worse), but play dumb to gain some sympathy or to seem innocent. If it is too obvious, being truthful may play in your favor but there may be consequences. Wish you the best. ",User_deleted,4

If you're in school or university, I beg that you may have heard and known about the existence of [Turnitin's software](https://www.turnitin.com/). Generally, schools, colleges, and universities use it to look for evidence of plagiarism in students' writing, maintain academic integrity, and ensure that students are not copying the work of others. But recently, the software has been upgraded to include AI detectors, where these checks were used to determine the originality of content and identify any copied material in academic or professional writings or [AI-generated.As](http://AI-generated.As) technology advances and we can not deny the rise of AI writing tools like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/),[ Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/), [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) and [Perplexity.ai](http://perplexity.ai/),… definitely a game changer. Those tools empower students, writers, content creators, marketers, researchers, …to draft essays, reports, assignments, and outline ideas at lightning speed while still enhancing the quality and diversity of the content.However, in academic places and professional fields, the value of authenticity and originality is paramount, and maintaining the integrity, honesty and credibility of the published content are key factors. And this has caused concern among students, scholars, … about the challenges of bypassing the [Turnitin AI detector ](https://www.turnitin.com/solutions/topics/ai-writing/ai-detector/)as well as plagiarism checks. But luckily, from now on, you don’t have to worry about your articles, essays or other text forms being flagged as AI-generated anymore. In this article, we will show you exactly how to bypass [Turnitin detection ](https://www.turnitin.com/solutions/topics/ai-writing/ai-detector/)as well as list numerous methods that you can use to beat Turnitin AI detector while still maintaining academic integrity in your writing. So, let’s get started!

# Understanding Turnitin AI Detection

[Turnitin](https://www.turnitin.com/) is a popular plagiarism detection software used by many educational institutions and students worldwide to check for plagiarism in their research papers, articles, essays, and assignments… The platform implemented its [AI writing detection feature](https://www.turnitin.com/solutions/topics/ai-writing/) in April 2023 to catch students who attempt to cheat by using AI rewriting tools.[Turnitin's AI detection](https://www.turnitin.com/solutions/topics/ai-writing/) feature works with AI detectors that look for Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms. It tracks grammar, syntax, structure, the words you use, and even the nuanced subtleties of your arguments to detect paraphrased work and gives you the final result or similarity score. This score will tell you the level of similarity of your writing to someone else's existing work.Its AI detector is an advanced mechanism that is trained on a large database that can scan your submissions paper by comparing them to a continuously expanding database of scholarly papers, websites, publications, and existing sources. This means that even if a report has been rewritten by using an AI tool like [Quillbot](https://quillbot.com/), Turnitin can still detect the similarities and flag it as potential plagiarism. Moreover, the indicator additionally connects to a report that emphasizes the text parts that were anticipated were composed by AI. However, just please remember that only the instructors and administrators are able to see the indicator of AI-generated.**While Turnitin has confidence in its model, the website also confirmed** [that AI writing detection mode may not always be accurate (it may misidentify both human and AI-generated text)](https://help.turnitin.com/ai-writing-detection.htm#:~:text=Turnitin's%20AI%20writing%20detection%20capability,by%20a%20generative%20AI%20tool.), so it should not be used as the sole basis for adverse actions against a student or a definitive grading measure by instructors. Its capability is just to help educators identify whether the text might be prepared by a generative AI tool or not, as well as provide data for educators to make wise decisions based on their academic and institutional [policies.As](http://policies.As) you can see, the AI writing indicator is on the right side of your panel. These sentences are highlighted in blue with a percentage between 0 and 100 on the submission text in the AI writing report. The displayed percentage indicates the amount of qualifying text within the submission that Turnitin’s AI writing detection model determines was generated by AI.Also, please note that [Turnitin AI detection](https://www.turnitin.com/solutions/topics/ai-writing/) will only work for content submitted in English, and it will not work in any non-English submissions. As well as the percentage of Turnitin’s AI writing detection is different and independent from the similarity score, and the AI writing highlights aren't shown in the Similarity Report.

# How Turnitin AI Detection Works

Before talking about all the possibilities of how to beat [Turnitin AI Detector](https://www.turnitin.com/solutions/topics/ai-writing/), we should understand how this tool works first. The scanning mechanism of Turnitin works similarly to other check tools on the market by using algorithms to identify patterns within the text that indicate potential plagiarism.When a user uploads a document, Turnitin will analyze all the elements in the article and look for any similarities with the documents available in the system. It will highlight duplicates and give an overall assessment of the originality of the article in percent. And one thing to take note and keep in mind too is that this program can also search for different types of matches defined by the settings that the professor uses.Turnitin also uses other techniques to identify AI content detection, such as text classification and machine learning. So when a paper is submitted to Turnitin, the submission is first broken into segments of text that are roughly a few hundred words (about five to ten sentences). Those segments are then overlapped with each other to capture each sentence in context.The segments are run against the AI detection model, and **each sentence will have a score between 0 and 1 to determine whether it was written by a human or by AI**. If the model determines that a sentence was not generated by AI, it will receive a score of 0. Conversely, If it determines the entirety of the sentence was generated by AI, it will receive a score of 1. By consuming the average scores of all the segments within the document, the model then generates an overall prediction of how much text in the submission has been generated by AI.Currently, Turnitin’s AI writing detection model is trained to detect content from the GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 language models, which includes ChatGPT. As for the writing characteristics of GPT-4 are consistent with earlier model versions, so the detector is also able to detect content from GPT-4 (ChatGPT Plus) as well.

# How To Get Past Turnitin AI Detection

I know that there are a lot of users out here who want to find a way to bypass [Turnitin AI Detection](https://www.turnitin.com/solutions/topics/ai-writing/ai-detector/). Although these services were born to uphold academic honesty, they can sometimes flag innocent mistakes. And if you’re weary of Turnitin marking your essays and texts as AI-generated, there are a few straightforward methods you can employ to stop this issue from happening again, as well as to bypass Turnitin’s AI detector and avoid being flagged for plagiarism.

# Use StealthGPT for AI Detection Removal

I have to admit that this is the best and the most time-saving method for you to humanize your AI-generated content and stay undetected by Turnitin and other AI detectors. Within a few clicks, you can have an article or essay that meets your desire and can bypass the Turnitin AI [Detection.Now](http://Detection.Now), let's move into how [StealthGPT](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/) can help. To test this, I posed a prompt to ChatGPT: ""An essay about the history of YouTube within 300 words.""I copied the entire text and placed it in [Stealth Bypass](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/), and then I clicked on “Bypass AI-detection” and saw that the successful score on the right side got up to 90 percent.Then I click on the ""Copy button"" to duplicate the newly written content from StealthGPT, then paste it directly into the frame of the “Turnitin AI Detector” to see if the undetectable AI text can actually bypass AI detection. After the fast-checking speed of the “[ Turnitin AI Detector](https://www.turnitin.com/solutions/topics/ai-writing/ai-detector/)” in seconds, the result showed that **ZERO** percent of AI had been detected.

Because I do believe that nothing good in life is free! Moreover, you can also feel free to contact our support team regarding to any questions you might have or if there is anything that makes you unsatisfied.However, a key message I want to mention is that ***""it's also important to use the tool responsibly and wisely""*****.** The objective shouldn't be to mislead the software but also to ensure the content reflects your authentic human intelligence and creativity. So, just leverage it as an assisting tool to work more productively as well as enhance your ability to generate creative and original content.

# Rewrite in Your Own Words

A small tip that has been used by many students recently is to express ideas according to their own understanding. This method not only helps you to refresh old ideas and develop your writing more quickly and more conveniently but is also an opportunity for you to increase your vocabulary and improve your language expression skills as well as logical thinking ability.Regarding how to do it, when you find a useful piece of content for your essay, you can re-express that piece of content according to the 3 easy step process below:

* **Step 1:** Reread the source material several times to understand the original content clearly.
* **Step 2:** Identify the main ideas and information that you want to include in the article.
* **Step 3:** Rewrite according to your level of understanding, knowledge, and language usage of your own.

# Understanding Assignment Requirements

Understanding the assignment brief is one of the most effective ways to make your text undetectable by Turnitin AI detector as well as ensure a successful submission. This gonna requires a thorough analysis and comprehension of what is being asked, including instructions, prompts, and guidelines. Before you begin, take your time to examine and read the given instructions carefully; after that, break down the task into smaller components to identify important parts such as topic areas, significant words or phrases used in prompts, and marking criteria. Analyzing any posed questions and understanding the importance of addressing the main goals of the assignment is key, as the lecturer often looks for specific things in your work.If any doubts arise, you can look for direct communication with your lecturer or supervisor to help minimize the errors as well as maximize your success rates. To excel and improve your academic writing, try to show enthusiasm about your assignment and that subject. Also, deep into the topic deeply, grasp every detail, and determine how to convey this understanding and interest in your writing. By expressing your own thoughts and ideas, I promise that you'll create content that not only passes AI detection but also stands out as unique.

# Research and Paraphrasing

Conducting wide research and understanding the topic before putting down any ideas is the solid base for all original writing. It's not just about doing lots of research and sticking ideas together. It's about diving deep into different points of view, ideas, arguments, and theories from the research and your own understanding of the topic. This process will let you pull together these different viewpoints into a piece that's exciting and truly yours.  
  
After the research part, you will need to rewrite, restructure, and paraphrase the content. This is the most important part, as it will be the main method of avoiding Turnitin’s AI detection as well as ensuring that the content remains original while avoiding any plagiarism issues.  
  
To paraphrase effectively, you will need to comprehend the context of the content that you are going to ‘reword’ and present it by using your own writing style while still retaining its original meaning; you could also use synonym words to express the ideas and meaning of the sentence. However, you should also pay attention to whether the words with the same meaning as the original word can be used in that situation or not.  
  
Paraphrasing isn't simply changing the words of someone else's ideas. It's not that straightforward. Instead, it's about truly understanding and internalizing the ideas and thoughts and then expressing them in your own unique style. But please ensure that all sources used in your writing must have credible references so readers can access them for further reading. Through these methods, your paper will have a higher ability to pass originality checks with little to no suspicion of AI detection, and it will also maintain insightful information about the overall content.

# Manual Writing

The last method I want to mention is writing by hand; it’s also an option that not many people choose to do, and it is favorable nowadays. But the best way to bypass [Turnitin AI detection](https://www.turnitin.com/solutions/topics/ai-writing/ai-detector/) or any AI detectors out there and not raise red flags or plagiarism is by using manual writing. It simply means no copy-pasting from external sources or relying on AI-written content and using simple language to express your ideas. It is a process that must ensure that your paper does not contain any phrases or sentences that match with any other published content available on the internet.Even though this method gonna take most of your time, handwriting will force you to think more about each sentence, word, and collocation to use. It’s easier for you to run on your flow and make sure each line is unique and different from anyone else. Your brain gonna work harder, but it's worth it. In a world where AI detection tools like Turnitin are upgraded and enhanced continuously, keeping it with old school with manual writing is the safest way to avoid any AI detection or plagiarism.Moreover, it also brings you a positive and proud feeling when you see your own product filled with your own handwriting, and your original content can bypass AI detection in a minute. However, please take note that to ensure that the manual writing process is successful, it is important to understand your assignment inside out, as this gonna guide you through the instructions and the approach to finish the article more easily and create amazing content that will be engaging and unique in every possible way.

# Final Words

While tools like [Turnitin AI Detector](https://www.turnitin.com/solutions/topics/ai-writing/ai-detector/) continue to upgrade by day to identify AI-generated content, the importance of academic integrity and producing unique, original content still remains paramount.As students, scholars, and professionals.., we should view AI tools as aids to our creativity and productivity, not replacements for our intellect and original thought. Whether you choose to leverage AI writing tools, paraphrase, manually write, or go with [StealthGPT](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/), remember that the main goal is to enrich your understanding and effectively communicate your ideas, and these methods should only be used for legitimate reasons to beat Turnitin’s AI detector and not to cheat or deceive. By following the strategies in this blog post, you can definitely maintain your academic integrity, creativity, and authenticity while still leveraging the advancement of AI tools.

So, just leverage it as an assisting tool to work more productively as well as enhance your ability to generate creative and original content.

### Rewrite in Your Own Words

A small tip that has been used by many students recently is to express ideas according to their own understanding. This method not only helps you to refresh old ideas and develop your writing more quickly and more conveniently but is also an opportunity for you to increase your vocabulary and improve your language expression skills as well as logical thinking ability.Regarding how to do it, when you find a useful piece of content for your essay, you can re-express that piece of content according to the 3 easy step process below:

* **Step 1:** Reread the source material several times to understand the original content clearly.
* **Step 2:** Identify the main ideas and information that you want to include in the article.
* **Step 3:** Rewrite according to your level of understanding, knowledge, and language usage of your own.

### Understanding Assignment Requirements

Understanding the assignment brief is one of the most effective ways to make your text undetectable by Turnitin AI detector as well as ensure a successful submission. This gonna requires a thorough analysis and comprehension of what is being asked, including instructions, prompts, and guidelines. Before you begin, take your time to examine and read the given instructions carefully; after that, break down the task into smaller components to identify important parts such as topic areas, significant words or phrases used in prompts, and marking criteria. Analyzing any posed questions and understanding the importance of addressing the main goals of the assignment is key, as the lecturer often looks for specific things in your work.If any doubts arise, you can look for direct communication with your lecturer or supervisor to help minimize the errors as well as maximize your success rates. To excel and improve your academic writing, try to show enthusiasm about your assignment and that subject. Also, deep into the topic deeply, grasp every detail, and determine how to convey this understanding and interest in your writing. By expressing your own thoughts and ideas, I promise that you'll create content that not only passes AI detection but also stands out as unique.

### Research and Paraphrasing

Conducting wide research and understanding the topic before putting down any ideas is the solid base for all original writing. It's not just about doing lots of research and sticking ideas together. It's about diving deep into different points of view, ideas, arguments, and theories from the research and your own understanding of the topic. This process will let you pull together these different viewpoints into a piece that's exciting and truly yours.  


After the research part, you will need to rewrite, restructure, and paraphrase the content. This is the most important part, as it will be the main method of avoiding Turnitin’s AI detection as well as ensuring that the content remains original while avoiding any plagiarism issues.  


To paraphrase effectively, you will need to comprehend the context of the content that you are going to ‘reword’ and present it by using your own writing style while still retaining its original meaning; you could also use synonym words to express the ideas and meaning of the sentence. However, you should also pay attention to whether the words with the same meaning as the original word can be used in that situation or not.  


Paraphrasing isn't simply changing the words of someone else's ideas. It's not that straightforward. Instead, it's about truly understanding and internalizing the ideas and thoughts and then expressing them in your own unique style. But please ensure that all sources used in your writing must have credible references so readers can access them for further reading. Through these methods, your paper will have a higher ability to pass originality checks with little to no suspicion of AI detection, and it will also maintain insightful information about the overall content.

### Manual Writing

The last method I want to mention is writing by hand; it’s also an option that not many people choose to do, and it is favorable nowadays. But the best way to bypass [**Turnitin AI detection**](https://www.turnitin.com/solutions/topics/ai-writing/ai-detector/) or any AI detectors out there and not raise red flags or plagiarism is by using manual writing. It simply means no copy-pasting from external sources or relying on AI-written content and using simple language to express your ideas. It is a process that must ensure that your paper does not contain any phrases or sentences that match with any other published content available on the internet.Even though this method gonna take most of your time, handwriting will force you to think more about each sentence, word, and collocation to use. It’s easier for you to run on your flow and make sure each line is unique and different from anyone else. Your brain gonna work harder, but it's worth it. In a world where AI detection tools like Turnitin are upgraded and enhanced continuously, keeping it with old school with manual writing is the safest way to avoid any AI detection or plagiarism.Moreover, it also brings you a positive and proud feeling when you see your own product filled with your own handwriting, and your original content can bypass AI detection in a minute. However, please take note that to ensure that the manual writing process is successful, it is important to understand your assignment inside out, as this gonna guide you through the instructions and the approach to finish the article more easily and create amazing content that will be engaging and unique in every possible way.

## Final Words

While tools like [**Turnitin AI Detector**](https://www.turnitin.com/solutions/topics/ai-writing/ai-detector/) continue to upgrade by day to identify AI-generated content, the importance of academic integrity and producing unique, original content still remains paramount.As students, scholars, and professionals.., we should view AI tools as aids to our creativity and productivity, not replacements for our intellect and original thought. Whether you choose to leverage AI writing tools, paraphrase, manually write, or go with [**StealthGPT**](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/), remember that the main goal is to enrich your understanding and effectively communicate your ideas, and these methods should only be used for legitimate reasons to beat Turnitin’s AI detector and not to cheat or deceive. By following the strategies in this blog post, you can definitely maintain your academic integrity, creativity, and authenticity while still leveraging the advancement of AI tools.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Turnitin AI Detection

📷**#1. Which AI Writing Models can Turnitin’s technology Detect?**The first iteration of Turnitin’s AI writing detection capabilities has been trained to detect models including GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and variants. Their technology can also detect other AI writing tools that are based on these models, such as ChatGPT, and their platform has just completed testing of GPT-4 (ChatGPT Plus), and the result will detect text generated by GPT-4 as well.**#2. How to Bypass Turnitin Plagiarism Checker and AI Detection?**You can use [**StealthGPT**](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/) to beat Turnitin's plagiarism checker and avoid AI detection. It can solve these problems with the click of a button.**#3. Is using StealthGPT Completely Reliable?**Even though [**StealthGPT**](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/) is the most powerful tool on the market, as it is also the first AI-powered tool dedicated to generating Undetectable AI Content, nothing can replace the authentic creativity and hard work of someone who has extensively researched and excelled in the writing process. Let’s consider StealthGPT as your best partner that helps assist you on the journey, not a tool meant to take your place.**#4. Will Students be able to See the Results?**The AI writing detection indicator and report are not visible to students. However, with the PDF download feature, instructors can download and share the AI report with students.**#5. If students use Grammarly for Grammar checks, does Turnitin Detect it and Flag it as AI?**No. The detector is not tuned to target Grammarly-generated spelling, grammar, and punctuation modifications to content but rather to other AI content written by LLMs such as GPT-3.5. Please note that this excludes GrammarlyGo, which is a generative AI writing tool, and as such, content produced using this tool will likely be flagged as AI-generated by the Turnitin detector.**#6. What Similarity Score is Acceptable on Turnitin?**Well, there’s not a specific percentage set in stone. Schools and universities often decide on their own frame. However, in general, anything above a 20% similarity score might catch a lecturer’s attention and be flagged as a high score.**#7. Can I check Past Submitted Assignments for AI writing?**Yes. Previously submitted assignments can be checked for AI writing detection if they’re re-submitted to Turnitin and if you have AI writing enabled for your account.**#8. Can Turnitin Detect if Text Generated by an AI Writing Tool (ChatGPT, etc.) is Further Paraphrased using a Paraphrasing Tool?**Yes, Turnitin’s AI detection capabilities now include the detection of AI-written content that may have been paraphrased using an AI paraphrasing tool or text spinner. This detection is run automatically for all submissions to Turnitin by institutions that have AI writing detection enabled for their accounts.",User_deleted,1

But I’m in education and to make quizzes where I am asking students to differentiate from good usages of the term and bad ones I need it to make non-examples too. It’s has been really difficult to prompt it to generate incorrect usages of a vocab word. I’ve tried things like “use the word ____ incorrectly in a sentence.” That didn’t consistently work. Quite often it just made a real example. I tried giving it a lengthy and explicit system prompt to explain the task. No dice. I then tried asking for the word’s antonym and prompting for an example of that which i then went and wrote some code to replace the antonym with the original term. This was a bit janky and also didn’t always match the part of speech. I’m doing this all with the GPT 3.5-turbo instruct completions API on big sets of vocab. I’ve tried messing with temperature etc. to no avail.

Seems like they’ve done such a good job targeting correctness that it’s not so able to target incorrectness.

Anyone got any ideas of a way to write a prompt (or fanagel the params) that will generate an incorrect usage of a vocab word?",active,5
1cm1gm4,31,2024-05-06,I studied how 7 Founders found their first 100 customers for their businesses. Summarizing it here!,u/adriannelestrange,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1cm1gm4/i_studied_how_7_founders_found_their_first_100/,"I am learning marketing, and so I combed through the internet to find specific advice that helped founders reach 100 users and not random Google answers.

Here’s what I found:

# 1. Llama Life by Marie

Marie founder of Llama Life, a productivity app ($51.4K+ revenue) got her first 100 users using Snowballing effect. She shared great advice that I want to add here verbatim,

*“Need to think about what you have that you can leverage based on your current situation. eg..When you have no customers, think about where you can post to get the 1st customer eg Product Hunt.*

*If you do well on PH, say you get #3 product of the day, then you post somewhere else saying ‘I got #3 product of the day’.. to get your next few customers. Maybe that post is on reddit with some learnings that you found.*

*If the reddit post does well, then you might post it on Twitter, saying reddit did well and what learnings you got from that etc. or even if it doesn’t do well you can still post about it.”*

Another tip she shared is to build related products that get more viral than the product itself.

These are small stand-alone sites that would appeal to the same target audience, but by nature, are more shareable.

On these sites, you can mention your startup like: ‘brought to you by Llama Life’ and then provide a link to the main website if someone is interested. If one of those gets viral or ranks on Google, you’ll have a passive traffic source.

# 2. Scraping bee by Pierre

Pierre, founder of Scraping Bee, a web scraping tool has now reached $1.5M ARR.

Pierre and his cofounder Kevin started with 10 Free Beta Users in 2019, and after 6 months asked them to take a paid subscription if they wanted to continue using the product.

That’s how they got their first user within 50 minutes of that email.

Then they listed it on dozens of startup directories but their core strategy was writing the best possible content for their target audience — Developers.

3 very successful pieces of content that worked were :

* A small tutorial on how to scrape single-page application
* An extensive general guide about web scraping without getting blocked
* A complete introduction to web scraping with Python

They didn’t do content marketing for the sake of content marketing but deep-dived into the value they were providing their customer.

One of these got 70K visits, and all this together got them to over 100 users.

# 3. WePay by Bill Clerico

Bill Clerico left his cushy corporate job to build WePay which was then acquired for $400M got his first users by using his app.

He got his first users by using his app!

The app was for group payments. So he hosted a Poker tournament at his house and collected payments only with his app.

Then they hosted a barbecue for fraternity treasurers at San Jose State & helped them do their annual dues collection.

Good old word-of-mouth marketing, that however, started with an event where they used what they made!

# 4. RealWorld by Genevieve

Genevieve — Founder and CEO of Realworld stands by the old-school advice of value giving.

RealWorld is an app that helps GenZ navigate adulthood.

So, before launching their direct-to-consumer platform, they had an educational course that they sold to college career centers and students. They already had a pipeline of adults who turned to Realworld for their adulting challenges.

From there, she gained her first 100 followers.

# 5. Saner dot ai by Austin

Austin got 100 users from Reddit for his startup Saner.ai. Reddit hates advertising, and so his tips to market your startup on Reddit is to

* Write value-driven posts on your niche.
* Instead of writing posts, find posts where people are looking for solutions
* DM people facing problems that your SaaS solves. But instead of selling, ask about their problem to see if your product is a good fit
* Heartfelt posts about why you built it, aren’t gonna cut it
* To find posts and people, search Reddit with relevant keywords and join all the subreddits

# 6. A Stock Portfolio Newsletter

A financial investor got his first 100 paid newsletter subscribers for his stock portfolio newsletter.

His tips :

* Don’t reinvent the wheel. Work what’s already working. He saw a company making $500M+ from stock picking newsletter, so decided to try that.
* Find the gaps in “already working” and leverage them. That newsletter did not have portfolios of advisors writing them. That was his USP. He added his own portfolio to his newsletter.
* Now to 100 users, he partnered with a guy running an investing website and getting good traffic. That guy got a cut of his revenue, in exchange.

That one simple step got him to 100 users.

# 7. Hypefury by Yannick and Samy

Yannick and Samy from Hypefury, Twitter and Social Media Automation tool got their first beta testers and users from a paid community.

They launched Hypefury there and asked if someone wanted to try it.

A couple of people tried it and gave feedback.

Samy conducted user interviews and product demos for them, And shared the reviews on Twitter.

That alone, along with word-of-mouth marketing on Twitter got them their first 100 users.

To conclude:

1. Don’t reinvent the wheel, try what’s working.
2. Find the gaps in what’s working, and leverage that.
3. Instead of thinking about millions of customers, think about the first 10. Then first 100.
4. Leverage what you have. Get the first 10 customers, then talk about this to get the next 100.
5. Use your app. Find ways, events, and opportunities to use your app in front of people. And get them to use it.
6. Write content not only for SEO but also to help people. It won’t work tomorrow, but it will work for years after it picks up.
7. Leverage other sources of traffic by partnering up!
8. Do things that don’t scale.

I’m also doing SaaS marketing deep dives over 30 pieces of content. I'm posting here for the first time, so I'm not sure if it will stay or not, sorry if it doesn't. I've helped a SaaS grow from $19K to $100K MRR as a marketer in last 2 years, and now I wanna dive deep.

1cm2x1c,2,2024-05-07,Exam Rewrites,u/TheRev15,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1cm2x1c/exam_rewrites/,"Hello fellow educators.

I had an exchange with a student today about my no-rewrite policy. Some context: grade 11 precalculus class. This is a class designed for students going in to STEM degrees. It is the most challenging class in the district outside of our IB program. Students will get about 3 review blocks prior to a test, where one of them is group work on problems I give them related to the unit. They'll typically get about 2 weeks notice prior to an exam.

I don't allow rewrites because I want to encourage proper test preparation, and it simply doesn't change their grade more often than not. I also don't have a library of different exams for every unit we cover. I also offer an optional cumulative final at the end of the year which replaces the students' grade, but students who attempt this very rarely improve their grade.

I think this approach is more than fair, but the student did raise some good points such as if they can demonstrate their learning by the end of the year, why should it matter? My concern is this promotes ""doubling up"" my course, ie. learning our current unit while studying the last one, which negatively affects their current unit and creates a chain reaction that stops at the last unit regardless.

In any case, I'm curious about others approaches in similar classes. At first I thought about requiring a completed ""review set,"" but then tools like photomath and chatgpt would trivialize such approaches.

1cnlmz2,488,2024-05-08,Planning for Distillation of Llama 3 70b -> 4x8b / 25b,u/kindacognizant,LocalLLaMA,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1cnlmz2/planning_for_distillation_of_llama_3_70b_4x8b_25b/,"Hello r/LocalLLaMA! This is your resident meme-sampler designer kalomaze.

So as of late, I was feeling pretty burned by the lack of an effective mid-range Llama 3 release that would appeal to both the demographic of single 3090 (24GB) and 3060 (12GB) users. 

Out of the blue, I was generously offered a server with 4xA100s to run training experiments on, which led me to an idea...

[4x8b, topk=1 expert selection, testing basic modeling loss](https://preview.redd.it/adtft56bkazc1.png?width=1740&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a065c1087e8c1c3104dfe9e8fcab6624c326ecf)

I decided to contact StefanGliga and AMOGUS so we could collaborate on a team project dedicated to transfer learning, in which the objective is to distill Llama 3 70b into a smaller 4x8b (25b total) MoE model.

The objective of distillation / transfer learning (in conventional Machine Learning) is to train a smaller ""student"" network on the predictions of a larger ""teacher"" network. What this means is, instead of training on the one-hot vectors of the tokens in the dataset itself (or training on the output generations of a larger model which is *not* what is happening), the training objective is modified so that the model learns to mimick **the full spread of possible next token outputs** as predicted by a larger teacher model.

We can do this by training the student model to minimize the KL Divergence (a metric of distance between two probability distributions) on the output teacher model's predictions, rather than training to minimize the cross-entropy on the dataset itself (since the ""true distribution"" is fundamentally unknowable).

# Current Progress

After about a week of studying / investigating, we've gotten to the point where we can confirm that topk=200 distillation of Llama2 13b logits is fully functional when applied to TinyLlama 1b.

With just \~100k tokens or so worth of compute on a tiny 1b model, there is a noticeable, if ever so slight trend of continued improvement:

[TinyLlama 1b, initial test of distillation loss](https://preview.redd.it/aw28w6uelazc1.png?width=2504&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8128dbac9c48a19bb75c67ab0f6f9c41057ff7c)

Right now, the objective is to get the trainer up and running on the 4xA100s for Llama3 8b, and once this is confirmed to be functional, scale it up to a larger MoE network by duplicating the FFNs as individual experts (in which the attention tensors are shared, much like in Mixtral 8x7b or 8x22b.) 

# Progressive TopK / Random Routing

In [Sparse MoE as the new Dropout](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01610), the paper authors allege that gradually increasing the computational cost of a MoE throughout the training process (in such a way that you end the run with all experts activated during inference) implicitly encourages the model to make use of more compute as the run progresses. In addition to this, **learnable routing is completely disabled** and is replaced with a frozen, equally randomized router.

By the end of the training run (where you are using all experts during inference), this technique was shown to be more effective than training a dense network, as well as the standard sparse MoE with fixed in place computational complexity (i.e, a constant topk=2, as seen in Mixtral 8x7b or 8x22b.) 

However, a dense network is still more effective in the case that the total amount of experts is limited (\~4 and lower). I plan to remediate for this by introducing a random element to the topk selection process (i.e, in order to target 1.5 experts on average, the training script is allowed to randomly select between topk=1 or topk=2 with a 50/50 chance).

I hope that this way, the typical amount of compute used can smoothly increase with time (as it does in a MoE network with more total experts) and we can see similar improvements; if not, the training methods they described are **still competitive with a dense network**, and should hopefully lead to considerable gains over the single 8b model regardless.

# Why 4x8b / 25b? 

4x8b is planned because of a few useful traits:

\- Will barely fit into \~11-12GB VRAM with a 4 bit quant (or 5-6 bit, with a couple layers offloaded to CPU)

\- Will cleanly fit into \~22-23GB VRAM with an 8 bit quant

\- Higher quantization levels + lower topk expert usage could be used to further balance the speed / efficiency tradeoff to the user's liking

\- Less risk of catastrophic forgetting compared to interleaving / ""depth up-scaling""

# What about Data?

The plan is to take randomly sampled excerpts of [FineWeb](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb) (a 15T tokens English dataset), as well as excerpts from [The Stack](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/the-stack), a permissively licensed code dataset. I am also considering adding samples from Project Gutenberg and Archive dot org; though I feel that the quality of the dataset is not as important as the quality of the teacher model's predictions when it comes to distillation.

Assuming the average computational cost across the full run is an average of \~topk=2, for 4x8b, I've already confirmed that this expert count can train about 140 million tokens in around \~8 hours \[batch size 1, 8192 context\].

In other words, **about \~2.5-3 billion tokens worth of data** can be distilled in around a week on the 4xA100s that were provisioned to me (assuming no bespoke CUDA kernels are written to accelerate the process). I am hoping that I can start this process by the beginning of next week, but I can't make any promises.

# What about *more* Data?

My hope is that the information density of the data provided by distillation is rich enough of a signal to get a smaller model within the ballpark of Llama3 70b in far less time. After all, there is theoretical evidence that even Llama3 8b was undertrained considering the continued log-linear improvement at the time the models were released; transferring the full distributional patterns of a far bigger model seems like a reasonable way to accelerate this process.

https://preview.redd.it/wiuc3s2kwazc1.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=a31f184064217c6a1f3fab3dd2020a4519d287ee

With that being said, compute is king, and I imagine the project still needs as much of it as we can muster for the results to stand out. If any group is willing to provide additional compute to distill on a larger volume of tokens (once we have empirically proven that this can improve models larger than TinyLlama), I am more than willing to work with you or your team to make this happen. I want this project to be as successful as it can be, and I am hoping that a larger run could be scheduled to make that happen.

If I am unable to secure a grant for a larger training run, which may or may not happen depending on if any offers are provided to me, the estimated cost of renting 8xA100s for a month straight is around \~$10,000. This is still a cheap enough cost that crowdfunding compute for it would be in the picture, but I'm not sure if there would be enough interest or trust from the community to support the cost.

With the (naive, probably) assumption that I can link multiple nodes together and triple the training speed with a higher batch size (and that I can avoid memory saving techniques such as grad checkpointing which reduce throughput), I guesstimate that about **\~40-50 billion tokens** should be doable within a month's time on this budget; possibly 2-3x that with optimized kernels (though designing those are outside of my current capabilities).

# Conclusion

Regardless, the plan is to release an openly available Llama3 that is as close to meeting the pareto optimal tradeoff of VRAM / intelligence as we can make it. I also believe that this project would be the first large scale (open) application of transfer learning to language models if I am not mistaken; so even if it underperforms my personal hopes / expectations, we will have at least conducted some interesting research on bringing down the parameter cost of locally hostable language models.

If there are any concerns or suggestions from those more seasoned with large scale training, feel free to reach out to me on Twitter (@kalomaze) or through this account.

This is NSWEduChat which has been officially rolled out today to beta. Myself being one of the first to try it.

It is a ChatGPT based product for AI-assisted education in the New South Wales region of Australia and it's school system.

The pre-prompt tells wonders about what it's intentions are, and as such it cannot solve basic integrals, and rather will prompt the user with a single step to solve out. It often will not provide quotes from texts where ChatGPT can, obviously the dpt of education locking this down to stop students using this for 100% of their study. This is heavily restricted and won't be available to the public for very obvious reasons, however will slowly be rolled out to students as it's perfected. Language translation and interpretation seems to be it's strongest suit, as it will do a 1:1 translation to any department-taught language in a single step.

This is weird, even for the Department of Education. Their presentation on it's use was very simplistic, and didn't go into any of it's actual behind the scenes basis; even going so far as to say that it was ""better than ChatGPT"" (despite being based on ChatGPT3 see above), and that ""it was based on a next-gen AI model that has more information available than other options""

1cozj1n,1,2024-05-10,Explain it like I'm 26 and considering shelling out for my time and money for an MBA or MD or JD,u/Dylanshackleferd,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/1cozj1n/explain_it_like_im_26_and_considering_shelling/,"Please let me explain an MBA and how it relates to other ""professional"" degrees aka Law or Physician. 

Looking at current CEOs in their 50s or 60s, it seems an MBA in the 80s or 90s, from a top school was a golden ticket to the upper echelons of corporate America. So maybe this can be you?

MBA grads back then were a relatively rare, (much lower supply than today) so they were highly sought after to fill critical management roles as businesses embraced MBA thinking. The degree paid dividends. Low supply, high career outcomes. 

Fast forward to today -You need to calculate the NPV.   

Tuition costs have skyrocketed for undergrad and graduate degrees while the skills learned have become more commoditized.

What do you actually learn in an MBA program?   I’d argue most of the classes/knowledge can be learned online for free.  (NYU, Coursera, [open.edu](https://open.edu) etc). If you want to learn B2C internet marketing, learning my doing,  through an online courses, or just online blogs, books, forums is better than a class in an MBA.   Want to learn to value a stock or bond.  There are great online classes for that too.

MBAs are revenue drivers for colleges.  They command a high tuition, with minimal expenditure. It's a profitable business and business is good. As many conformists see public displays of past performance/survivor bias and expect future performance to match.  Monkey see, monkey do.  So the NPV of the knowledge is 0 since it can be acquired for free. 

 So supply of MBAs is up, while the value proposition of an MBA has been impacted by technology and automation taking over many traditional MBA roles. Why pay for an expensive MBA hire when software can streamline operations?  So downward pressure on MBA salaries. Future revenue down, so NPV down. 

Learning “the game” “how things really work” “business”  This is intangible, and why ""the best schools"" can be worth it.  

Now let’s imagine some MBA students talking shop....

We take the widgets and figure out to sell more widgets, (optimize online advertising) ideally at a higher price, (maybe we segment the market?)  ideally while spending less money on COGS (maybe we find cheaper labor, less environmental standards?)   etc etc there are other ways, I'm just posting some low hanging fruit ;-)

Anyway, it was interesting to go to.  There’s not a secret sauce to learn.  There are tons of conformists.  Each school will have somewhat its own culture.  Go to network and have fun if you want but if you are motivated you can succeed without.  It should not be a career hindrance at all.  If it is, you have the wrong boss.

What is the role of the corporation? To maximize profits. How many MBAs does a corporation require to maximize profits? My guess is fewer than before. 

Many MBAs, whether they could get into med school or not...could certainly at least get into a bad law school.  So its fair to compare to being a doctor or lawyer...want to take someone to court, you need a lawyer. Want to get a prescription, you need a doctor (or someone else who can write a script).  This is built in demand. 

These jobs, while having low job satisfaction, are more secure.  They have a regulatory moat.  Tons of school, certifications, a board that can strip you of your practice, which keeps them inline...ie stops them from trying to do things more efficiently or at larger scale.... What are things that are very costly, that if they happen  to you, you can't avoid.   Bankruptcy, cancer diagnosis, chronic disease, divorce, lawsuits.  Who must make money in these situations? Doctors and Lawyers.  Its a good racket but not a great lifestyle IMO.

Anyway, these days, it's hard to recommend any of these options.  If you are ""debating"" any of these professional degrees, and debating whether to go, by reading online posts, I'd suggest not going.  If you have a clear plan, then any path can work out. 

Good luck! 

Final positive MBA comment. The cool thing is, there are way less rules in business. Doctors work for insurance companies, basically, and have to spend tons of time on paperwork.  Lawyers….have to spend their whole lives dealing with.....other lawyers and negotiating fine print back and forth forever.   Business people, are successful, in the true/honest/productive form (not the monopolistic/regulatory capture form), when they create value for others. It can be an art. Your career exists, like business exist, because they have an offering in the market people like.  You can experiment in many ways.  You don’t NEED an MBA.  Especially with these interest rates...and what you already had to pay for undergrad. Consider your opportunity cost.  For many many people, it has a negative NPV.

1cp4cnm,20,2024-05-10,"Forget “Spike Theory.” Follow the ""Five Cs"" of academic ECs and show that you're an intellectual.",u/AppHelper,IntltoUSA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/1cp4cnm/forget_spike_theory_follow_the_five_cs_of/,"TLDR: A “spike” isn’t enough anymore for top colleges. You need to prove that you are “intellectual.” You can do this by demonstrating **c**uriosity, **c**ompetence, **c**ommunication, **c**ontext-awareness, and **c**ritical thinking.

I hope this post is another one u/ScholarGrade will call a “banger,” like [the last one](https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/1cblgxi/ive_reviewed_hundreds_of_international_students/) I made here. I'm including a few points in this version specific to international students, but almost all the advice here is universal.

# Beyond Spike Theory: The “Five Cs” of Academic ECs

# What’s Wrong With Spike Theory?

“Spike Theory,” one of the most popular approaches to admissions strategy, is based on the idea that by accepting students with “spikes” in different areas, colleges can create a well-rounded class. Creating a spike is about demonstrating that you are extremely passionate about something, preferably excel at it, and can communicate its importance to you in your essays. But “Spike Theory” basically stops there, and **it’s not enough anymore.** With such a large applicant pool, it is very difficult to stand out with passion and excellence. The amount of time and energy required to be “excellent enough” to constitute a “spike” is likely to compromise other important parts of the application (such as academics and test scores, and possibly leadership). And if you are “outspiked” by other applicants, what’s left to make a strong argument for your admission? Additionally, from a college’s perspective, there may simply be too many spikes to choose from. Even the “longest” spike may not be the “missing piece” they’re looking for.

# Types of ECs

In helping students think about planning and describing their extracurricular activities, I use a framework of five categories:

1. Intellectual pursuits outside the classroom
2. Leadership
3. Service (community, social, or environmental)
4. Personal skill development/hobbies
5. Physical activity

I consider **the first four essential** (and physical activity highly recommended) no matter what an applicant wants to study. (Depending on the applicant’s goals and obligations, I might add the categories of “business/career-oriented” and “family responsibilities.”) My strategy is not just to make sure each of the categories is checked off, but to find and innovate activities that fit into multiple categories. **The more categories an activity covers, the more unique and memorable that activity tends to be. The “spike” lies not in the degree of achievement, but in its uniqueness.** (A word repeated often by a former MIT and Cornell admissions officer I work with is “singular.”)

In this post, I’d like to elaborate on what I consider the most important category of extracurricular activity: **intellectual pursuits outside the classroom.** (These are commonly called “academic” ECs, but my terminology implies something a little broader.)

# What Does “Intellectual” Mean?

I’ve often said that colleges are looking for applicants who are **not just** ***intellectually curious*****, but** ***intellectual***. I’ve defined “intellectual” in this context as having two components:

1. Thinking about a subject from different perspectives and disciplines.
2. Thinking about and exploring ideas and concepts rather than just facts.

I usually explain #1 by giving an example. Let’s say you’re interested in cars. You can think and learn about cars from many different approaches:

### Physical Sciences and Engineering
* The engineering of engines and motors.
* Materials science and wear analysis for gears, tires and other moving parts.
* The overall engineering design and integration of automobile components.
* Destructive testing and crash analysis.
* The basic sciences of how cars work: fuel chemistry, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, battery electrochemistry, aerodynamics, and deformation mechanics.
* The environmental impact of automobiles.
* The impact of automobiles on human physiology and health.


### Computer Science and Englineering
* Technologies and algorithms for self-driving cars and driver aids including computer vision, feedback, LIDAR, etc.
* Software and hardware for entertainment and driver interfaces.
* Programming of firmware for engine control units and other operational systems.

### Economics and Business
* Issues in international trade, including protectionism, tariffs, trade deficits, labor impact, and capital flow.
* The structure and governance of automotive companies.
* How automotive companies brand and market their products.
* Resale models involving showrooms, franchised dealerships, licensing, and the used car market.
* Labor issues such as unionization and workplace safety.
* Automotive financing and car companies as lenders and bond issuers.

### Other Social Sciences
* The effect of the automobile on urban and suburban development, population distribution, and commercial activities.
* The automobile as a status symbol and the significance of certain cars among different ethnic and socioeconomic groups.
* The effects of car ownership on teen and young-adult independence.

### Fine Arts and Humanities 
* The artistry of designing a car’s visual appearance taking into account mandatory features, ergonomics, safety regulations, and other constraints.
* 3D modeling.
* The history of automotive technology and trends in its development.
* The role of the automobile in popular culture such as movies and TV.
* The car as a place for media consumption, such as radio and drive-in movies.
* The study of the history, organization, and/or cultural significance of motorsports.

Someone interested in cars would not be able to explore *all* of the above topics in depth, but an “intellectual” would strive to learn from multiple angles and demonstrate awareness of others.
These disciplines comprise the **modern “liberal arts.”** This liberal arts approach is not restricted to liberal arts colleges. Ivy League undergraduate programs have a liberal arts curriclum, even if they are in a specific business or engineering school. There will always be humanities and social science requirements even for business and engineering students, and all top colleges (including MIT and Caltech) emphasize an interdisciplinary approach that includes humanities and social sciences.
**If you can demonstrate that you are already inclined toward this type of thinking, you will be seen as a good “fit” for a top university, particularly as an international student from a country whose schools do not prepare most students for this kind of study.**



As for #2, I’ve sometimes had difficulty articulating exactly what I mean and turning that into actionable advice. So, to integrate intellectual curiosity and intellectualism, I have developed what I call the **“Five Cs”** of intellectual pursuits: **c**uriosity, **c**ompetence, **c**ommunication, **c**ontext-awareness, and **c**ritical thinking.

# Curiosity

# What It Is

Interest in a topic.

# Why It’s Important

All colleges are looking for students who love to learn. The reason is very straightforward: colleges are first and foremost places of learning, and colleges want students who are motivated to learn. Curiosity also drives deeper inquiry and lifelong learning, which are highly valued in academic (and many professional) settings.

# How to Demonstrate

* Online classes from reputable companies, institutions, and instructors
* Academic competitions (such as Olympiads)
* Reading
* Debate and other academic club involvement
* Attending lectures
* Academic summer programs
* Research projects

# Competence

# What It Is

Being good at something.

# Why It’s Important

Except for recruited athletes, certain fine arts students, some legacies, and politically connected international students, **colleges admit primarily on the basis of academic potential.** Someone who is intellectually talented is generally more likely to succeed academically and contribute to a discipline.

# How to Demonstrate

Any form of external recognition by a qualified and competent authority: Olympiad medals, peer-reviewed papers, LORs from established academics or experienced team coaches attesting to your talents, high accolades in summer programs, international debate/MUN achievements that are judged by adults (**not student judges**), and AP scores. Your counselor and teacher LORs can effectively attest to your excellence as well if your recommenders have attended the kinds of schools you’re aiming for (e.g. T20s) and/or have gotten to know many students who went on to attend such institutions. This is a major reason “feeder” schools exist and do their job; admissions officers can trust alumni and counselors whom they have an ongoing relationship with. If you’re not from a feeder school, your grades, involvement in ECs, and school LORs will not be as effective, and you should pursue outside recognition if possible.

# Communication

# What It Is

Demonstrating that you understand something.

# Why It’s Important

Success in college depends on good communication skills. **American classrooms can be very interactive,** with group projects in STEM classes and labs, and discussion-heavy seminars in all disciplines. **Most major curricula such as CBSE in India do not prepare students for such an environment.** The ability to explain complex topics in simple terms is valued because it suggests the ability to do well on exams and serve as an informal mentor/study partner or formal teaching assistant (TA). At US colleges, undergraduates often serve as TAs for younger students, sometimes as early as sophomore year. TAs with high proficiency in English are especially valued, as a common complaint among undergraduates at Ivies and other top colleges is poor English proficiency of graduate-student TAs (and professors). If you are bilingual, you can help less advanced students understand material as well.

# How to Demonstrate

* Receiving recognition for papers, orations, and presentations from an authority familiar with the skills at the level of those who attend top universities.
* Effectively tutoring others in high-school level subjects.
* Being involved in a successful team, especially if writing is involved.
* Your essays may also give you a chance to explain intellectual concepts as you describe your specific interests.
* High scores on the Speaking and Writing sections of the TOEFL or IELTS exams or Production section of the Duolingo English Test **(even if you are from an English-speaking country other than the US, UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia, or New Zealand, and even if your medium of instruction is English).**

# Context-awareness

# What It Is

Understanding the connection of what you’re learning to other disciplines, its practical applications, and how it fits into the corpus of human knowledge.

This also includes understanding how the discipline developed and the major figures—past and present—who have contributed to the discipline.

# Why It’s Important

These things are not often emphasized in STEM curricula, especially those in other countries that focus more on rote memorization and repetition of techniques within a strict rubric. **Demonstrating that you understand and appreciate context reflects that you are prepared for future academic pursuits and a multidisciplinary, integrative approach.**

Those familiar with the principles of AI will know that context-awareness is a basic concept there too. GPTs trained on large datasets (like ChatGPT) are so good because they have a *lot* of context. In essence, the more context-aware a human or machine is, the “smarter” they are perceived.

# How to Demonstrate

ECs that combine intellectual pursuits with service, leadership, and/or personal skill development demonstrate that the subject is important to (respectively) society at large, other individuals in your community, and/or yourself and your personal growth. Those are *contexts* for learning.

A few examples of the kinds of international students and activities I’ve helped them develop are:

* An accomplished dancer designing a tactile stage to allow blind people to dance.
* Someone interested in the life sciences advocating for cancer awareness and overseeing the manufacturing of prostheses while studying biology of cancer.
* An experienced martial artist studying the psychology and physiology of sexual assault (in both attacker and victim) while teaching self-defense to women in her community.

In the last case, the young woman had only *four* ECs (out of 10) filled up in her application, but she covered all five categories: intellectual pursuits (1) by studying relevant academic disciples; leadership (2) and community service (3) by organizing and teaching the class; and personal skill development (4) and physical activity (5) by using her martial arts skills. The first three of her four activities were: martial arts accomplishments; studying and writing about the academic disciplines; and teaching the class. (The fourth EC was an unrelated volunteering activity.) She didn’t *need* any more ECs than that to create a well-rounded profile and a memorable impression. The intellectual study of self-defense and martial arts was done in the *context* of everything else.

**Your essays and LORs should demonstrate context-awareness, especially if the nature of your ECs do not immediately make it evident.** In fact, this is the **primary purpose** of any EC essays and a potential primary or secondary purpose of your main essay and “community” essays. That’s not to say your main essay necessarily *has* to be about your ECs, but if you’ve developed your ECs with a related theme across disciplines and they involve your personal skills and/or identity, it’s likely you have a lot to say about them. This will likely include unique personal feelings, experiences, and perspectives—all important ingredients in a successful essay.

Essays based on “Spike Theory” include some context-awareness with respect to personal passions and world-changing aspirations, but the strategy is generally not as nuanced, sophisticated, and multifaceted as the one I’m describing.

# Critical Thinking

# What It Is

Examining the nature of the discipline, the characteristics of the approach you’re taking, and the effect of inquiry itself on how we understand the world.

# Why It’s Important

**This is** ***the*** **goal of a liberal arts education.** You need to learn the facts, master them, communicate your thoughts effectively, and understand why something is important and how to approach a topic from multiple disciplines—all so you can learn to think critically. I won’t get into all the different forms of criticism, but there are many. You may have heard of controversial topics like “critical race theory” or “textual criticism,” but criticism includes (usually) less inflammatory topics. The classical modes of thought such as thesis/antithesis/synthesis (together “analysis"") are about understanding the facts and their context, then thinking critically to come up with novel ideas. These are the modes of thought that are taught and applied in elite colleges.

# How To Demonstrate

You can select ECs that help you develop critical thinking skills, but that’s just a start. Olympiads can do this only to a limited extent; problem-solving within a discipline is a form of critical thinking, but not quite the interdisciplinary kind colleges value most. Your ability to synthesize information and innovate ideas as part of your ECs is generally reflected in LORs and awards specifically established to recognize critical thinking.

However, **the main way to prove your critical thinking skills is through your essays.** That’s not easy to do, but you can get an early start on what your application might look like.

Whether you’re an eighth- or ninth-grader planning your extracurricular activities or a senior preparing to write about your personal passions, leadership, cultural background, and community service, ask yourself:

* Why am I doing this?
* What are the fundamental issues I’m trying to address?
* Is what I’m doing or plan to do really the best approach?
* Am I making the right assumptions, or might they be erroneous or out-of-date?
* Is (or was) my activity, cause, or project the best use of my resources? If not, what would be?

Parents, counselors, and other professionals can help teens explore these kinds of questions. **An effective EC profile requires more than checking boxes and more than creating a spike:** it involves critical planning, execution, and expression.

**The most successful applications reflect intellectualism at their core.** By developing the “five Cs” of intellectual pursuits, integrating them throughout your activities, and incorporating them into your application, you can demonstrate that you are ready for a liberal arts or engineering education at the highest level in the United States.",active,54
1cpl6vs,1,2024-05-11,Stuck between backend and ML for my upcoming internship,u/explorer_browser,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1cpl6vs/stuck_between_backend_and_ml_for_my_upcoming/,"I am a junior and I have an internship coming up with Google in the fall of this year. During the final round I got to meet my manager, who has been doing ML research for many years and she is now on the Bard/Gemini team. During our call, she explained that her team does both backend and ML work and that because the field is changing so quickly they haven’t decided on my project but it’s up to me which type of project I would like to do.

My gut reaction was go for ML since it’s the hot new field which typically requires masters or phd and this feels like the opportunity of a lifetime. I am taking an introductory machine learning course and have spent a considerable amount of time learning more modern tools and algorithms that my course doesn’t cover. It’s all pretty interesting but I can’t see myself doing ML work simply because I like it. 

In contrast, I have been doing backend work since I was a freshman. I truly enjoy doing backend work and have learned the most from working on my own start up. To give you a sense of how much I enjoy it, I procrastinate my classes by working on this backend startup way too much and my girlfriend often gets mad at how much time I spend doing it. For more context, I interned at a Amazon my sophomore year doing full stack and really enjoyed what I worked on and I have another internship for this summer at Netflix doing backend. 

I’m giving this background because one of my main 3 criteria for choosing between ML and backend is my chances at getting a return offer. I’m very confident I can get a return offer to continue doing backend work if I choose that however given my very to extremely little experience in ML (and because my manager has so much) I am unsure that I would be able to secure the return. Another criteria is how much I enjoy it which I could quantitative say backend is 10/10 and ML is like 7.5/10. Lastly is pay which currently seems very biased to ML but I also can’t find any reliable info on what it looks like for new grad because all the data I see is for phd and masters students who have done research, which I haven’t. 

I appreciate any input and I know this was kinda a long post so thanks for reading and proving advice. ",User_deleted,1

Since my career in Social Emotional and Mental Health (SEMH) alternative government institutions for kids who can't cope in mainstream education; Foster, Autism (lower, higher and non verbal), PTSD, Trans, Asperger's Syndrome, Global Delay, refugees etc. After 10 years I've wanted to renter university and research intervention methods for demographics with high risk factors to depression and suicide ideation. I've been accepted onto a Research Masters and following Research PhD at St Mary's in Sports, Health and Applied Science for September 2024. June 2024 applications start for post graduate funding.  I've got two guaranteed ideal supervisors and am extremely excited to begin.

I went to my bank after calling them on the phone and everything seemed fine to show my evidence to my local branch to convert my account to a student one.  They said that because I am not a recent graduate that there is nothing they can do to offer me a student account.

I've searched the subreddit and I couldn't find anything that enquired about what I am talking about easily.  Definitely not an avalanche of replies or specific queries. 

Below I will paste what Chat GPT said with the hope that either someone can give me some clarity with their own knowledge/experience.  Or at least I can help out someone in a similar boat.

***""CHATGPT***  
*If you're looking for a student account that is not limited to recent graduates and allows those who have been studying for more than five years to apply, your options may be more limited, as many student account offerings are typically designed for recent or current students. However, you may still find some flexibility with the following options:*

1. ***HSBC Graduate Bank Account****: While primarily aimed at recent graduates, HSBC's Graduate Bank Account might still consider applicants who have been studying for more than five years. It's worth checking with them directly to confirm eligibility.*
2. ***NatWest Graduate Account****: NatWest's Graduate Account is typically for recent graduates, but they may consider applications from individuals who have been studying for more than five years. Contacting NatWest directly for clarification would be advisable.*
3. ***Barclays Graduate Account****: Barclays offers a Graduate Account for recent graduates, but they might have some flexibility for individuals who have been studying for an extended period. You could inquire with Barclays about their specific eligibility criteria.*
4. ***Lloyds Bank Graduate Account****: Similar to others, Lloyds Bank's Graduate Account is primarily for recent graduates, but they may assess applications from individuals with longer study periods on a case-by-case basis.*
5. ***Nationwide FlexStudent Account****: While Nationwide's FlexStudent account is targeted at undergraduate and postgraduate students, they may have more flexibility in their eligibility criteria compared to other banks. It's worth contacting Nationwide directly to discuss your situation.*

*Keep in mind that each bank may have its own policies and discretion when it comes to extending student account eligibility beyond the typical parameters. Contacting them directly and explaining your circumstances would be the best way to explore your options further.""*

This is quite stressful that I could be posed with such a significant disadvantage compared to students with no career who just smashed through pre grad into doctorate.  A lot of what drives me to do this is the experience I've garnered in the last ten years and how that applies to specifically what I want to research in my case studies.  Any help would be extremely appreciated.

For those curious I am researching how Budo (Judo and Aikido) training as a form of movement meditation and posing that it trains the greatest collection of latent talents in a single discipline.  Through training grappling to children with risk factors and narrowing my demographic I aim to measure changes in self regulation and problem solving.

It accepts any combination of text, audio, and image as input and generates any combination of text, audio, and image as outputs.

There's 100s of applications it will enable. I'll cover a few of them below.

### 1. Language Learning

Duolingo Stock fell by $65 in the last 5 days. That should tell you the entire story.

[Duolingo Stock](https://i.imgur.com/YLH23KU.png)

For context, Duolingo is a language-learning app. Now GPT-4o can easily translate terms in other languages by just pointing it to the ChatGPT's Camera.

This is massive if you want to travel globally as a nomad. You don't have to know a language now. You can just translate on the fly in any random country.

The accuracy won't be 100% but it would be close enough. And the AI keeps improving.

### 2. Solving School Problems For Students

I wish I had this in school. Learning could've been more efficient and faster.

Most students fear asking questions because they feel it might be dumb. Now you can ask ChatGPT any dumb question.

It even solves math problems for the Salman Khan's (founder of Khan Academy, not the actor) Kid.

### 3. Bed Time Stories For Kids

Since ChatGPT can talk now with a humourous and sultry voice, you can use it to tell stories to kids. It can be used in the voice of their parents or grandparents.

You can even use a Soft Toy that does the talking to the kid. Earlier, there used to be toys that did that but it only spoke the same sentence. Now it can do back and forth.

You can make special toys that teach kids letters and alphabets. Target it to 2-3 year olds.

Hat tip to [Whyme-\_\_-](https://reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1crcf1l/did_gpt4o_just_kill_your_startup/l3xm9fm/) for the Bed Time idea.

### 4. Be My Eyes For The Blind

Best damn use-case for the blind. Now using a Phone is a bit too much for this but when smart glasses come, every blind person will have a walking companion.

The future is great for the blind.

### 5. Be My Friend

Too many people are lonely nowadays thanks to technology. It can be a boon for some but a con for others.

You can build a specialized app that gets you an AI Friend since you can talk to it now and it can talk back, it will be great.

I am 100% sure Therapy AI will be much better now with Audio/Video integration. In future, we will have fully featured Robots like Tesla's Optimus and Figure that will have such functionalities built-in.

I bet this comes in <2 years judging by the pace at which AI and Robotics are accelerating.

### 6. Comic Books

Now that text can be easily created with ChatGPT, why not create Comic Books easily.

Its a huge creative exercise for comic creators. Webtoons have exploded in popularity and many KDramas are made out of them like **Death's Game** and **Marry My Husband.**

This will increase the creativity exponentially.

### 7. Font Creations

Fonts are expensive. Like really expensive.

Funnily enough ChatGPT can create fonts easily now. Take the most popular fonts, tweak them a bit, and create entire new sets of fonts.

Look at the creations explode on Creative Market. Font directories like Typewolf can now create their own fonts easily as they already have distribution.

### 8. Brand Placements

It solved for [Brand Placements](https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/) too.

You can put your brand in places you never imagined without using too much effort.

Taking a prompt, copying it into ChatGPT, and then copying and pasting the output into an assignment is not using AI correctly.

AI tools are an amazing starting place for writing - but a terrible place to end.

If I were to ask you what the relationship is between Underwater Basket Weaving and the Phases of the Moon - I would expect some weird and crazy answers.  ChatGPT says: ""Underwater basket weaving and the phases of the moon are not related in any scientific or traditional sense.  However..."" followed by listing out Cultural Practices, Metaphorical Connections, and Creative Interpretation.  Great!  These are starting points for research!  But the words you put down on paper, the thoughts, and the ideas, have to come from you!

Read up on Cultural Practices related to Underwater Basket Weaving - see if there is a connection to Cultural Practices on Lunar Phases!  Maybe you'll find out the Aztecs had a robust weaving industry that worshipped the Moon!  During the New Moon they had to hide their weaving from the Moon, but they couldn't stop weaving, so they started doing it underwater!  (Side Note:  This would make a great writing prompt for a short story).

Read up on the Metaphorical Connections!  ChatGPT talks about patience, cyclality, and hidden depth.  Again, cool starting point, but a terrible place to stop!  As a student being asked this rediculous question, I expect you to go delve into these ideas and not place them before me like a masterpiece of minimalism.  Now that ChatGPT has presented the ideas, the student has to delve into them and make them personal to them.

\*Deep Breath\*

I relate LLMs to Wikipedia for research.

Wikipedia is not a citeable source - however, it is a good starting place when it comes to topics that you don't know a lot about.  Read up on it, get some general knowledge, then go to the bottom and look at their sources.  Trace the research back to its origin as much as you can.  Use what you learned to ask further questions that you can research on your own outside of Wikipedia.  If one of their sources is a really good source, get a copy, make your own opinion, and write about that.

But please, please, please... write your own words.  I don't care if it's a summary, of a summary, of a summary at this point.  Because if you write something in your own words, I know that you have at least thought about it.",active,0

Decide what to do early. 

This gives you a huge advantage. There are two common pathways for CS students. Industry, academics. 



Industry or academic?

I assume your life goal is to make this world a better place, then choose the one where you can do more important work. If you study CS and are good at it, you should not worry about money.



How to learn?

Put in the hours, you will see the result. The best study method is study. You will make mistakes, and I encourage you to make mistakes as quickly as possible. The more mistakes you make and fixed them, the better you are at CS. This is called backpropagation.



What courses to take?

Take the easiest courses possible, and spend most of your time self-studying. Since self-studying is more efficient, assume you are motivated. 



Read research papers

Read research papers every day. This gives you an idea of where the field is going. It might take you a month to finish reading and implement the paper again, but eventually, you will be able to read a paper in 30 minutes. If you don’t understand something, ask chatGPT and study it. Attention is all you need is a good place to start. There are a lot of videos about it on YouTube. 



Are you struggling and want to give up?

If you sleep less than 7 hours a day and study more than 8 hours a day. Take a step back and consider whether you are doing something you are incapable of? Learning when to give up is an important lesson in life. If CS is not for you, find something else you are good at. Passion is BS; do something you are good at.



I wish you the best of luck in your studies whether you study CS or not.

1csk8fp,55,2024-05-15,9 Use cases for GPT-4o,u/deadcoder0904,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1csk8fp/9_use_cases_for_gpt4o/,"GPT-4o is an omni model. It accepts any combination of text, audio, and image as input and generates any combination of text, audio, and image as outputs.

There's 100s of applications it will enable. I'll cover a few of them below.

### 1. Language Learning

Duolingo Stock fell by $65 in the last 5 days. That should tell you the entire story.

[Duolingo Stock](https://i.imgur.com/YLH23KU.png)

For context, Duolingo is a language-learning app. Now GPT-4o can easily translate terms in other languages by just pointing it to the ChatGPT's Camera.

This is massive if you want to travel globally as a nomad. You don't have to know a language now. You can just translate on the fly in any random country.

The accuracy won't be 100% but it would be close enough. And the AI keeps improving.

### 2. Solving School Problems For Students

I wish I had this in school. Learning could've been more efficient and faster.

Most students fear asking questions because they feel it might be dumb. Now you can ask ChatGPT any dumb question.

It even solves math problems for the Salman Khan's (founder of Khan Academy, not the actor) Kid.

### 3. Bed Time Stories For Kids

Since ChatGPT can talk now with a humourous and sultry voice, you can use it to tell stories to kids. It can be used in the voice of their parents or grandparents.

You can even use a Soft Toy that does the talking to the kid. Earlier, there used to be toys that did that but it only spoke the same sentence. Now it can do back and forth.

You can make special toys that teach kids letters and alphabets. Target it to 2-3 year olds.

Hat tip to [Whyme-\_\_-](https://reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1crcf1l/did_gpt4o_just_kill_your_startup/l3xm9fm/) for the Bed Time idea.

### 4. Be My Eyes For The Blind

Best damn use-case for the blind. Now using a Phone is a bit too much for this but when smart glasses come, every blind person will have a walking companion.

The future is great for the blind.

### 5. Be My Friend

Too many people are lonely nowadays thanks to technology. It can be a boon for some but a con for others.

You can build a specialized app that gets you an AI Friend since you can talk to it now and it can talk back, it will be great.

I am 100% sure Therapy AI will be much better now with Audio/Video integration. In future, we will have fully featured Robots like Tesla's Optimus and Figure that will have such functionalities built-in.

I bet this comes in <2 years judging by the pace at which AI and Robotics are accelerating.

### 6. Comic Books

Now that text can be easily created with ChatGPT, why not create Comic Books easily.

Its a huge creative exercise for comic creators. Webtoons have exploded in popularity and many KDramas are made out of them like **Death's Game** and **Marry My Husband.**

This will increase the creativity exponentially.

### 7. Font Creations

Fonts are expensive. Like really expensive.

Funnily enough ChatGPT can create fonts easily now. Take the most popular fonts, tweak them a bit, and create entire new sets of fonts.

Look at the creations explode on Creative Market. Font directories like Typewolf can now create their own fonts easily as they already have distribution.

[Open AI GPT-4o Text to Font](https://i.imgur.com/dv0VbL6.png)

### 8. Brand Placements

It solved for Brand Placements too.

You can put your brand in places you never imagined without using too much effort.

[Open AI GPT-4o Brand Placement](https://i.imgur.com/2N7vPkK.png)

### 9. Poster Creation for Movies or TV Series

Posters are hard to get right but as you know there are only finite variations.

[Open AI GPT-4o Movie Posters](https://i.imgur.com/G8cEUm5.png)

You can fine-tune it on popular movie posters and solve Poster Creation once and for all.

My main concern is how helpful would WGU be (like their career services and student support) if I'm applying to entry level tech jobs just starting my career, or would I be better off finding a different way to get into tech like continuing to make personal coding projects to maybe make a business out of them/applying to WITCH company contractors like Accenture? (problem with WITCH companies is they also require a bachelors degree now)

It seems like having a bachelors degree is a bare minimum to be taken seriously by employers nowadays and projects are just for talking points in interviews to keep the conversation with the interviewer going for more than 10 minutes

 

**Long Story:**

I'm in a tough spot. My current school I'm attending is called Grand Valley State University but I'm not having a good time because of their traditional 4 month semester like you have to be on pace with everyone else, I rather just get assignments done quicker but if you were to do that at my school they would imply you're being inconsiderate and rude...

I just don't fit in with their traditional teaching model, I excelled at online learning but it seems like my local schools in general are doing away with online based learning and going back to a sit in a classroom setting because they're apparently paranoid with rampant cheating with ChatGPT and stuff so much that they're making everyone required to be in class and do everything on paper now. The only strength my school really has for me is the local connection to internships, that's pretty much it...

I'm a non traditional student, meaning I'm not my state university's usual student who just graduated high school and are under 24, and Ive been out of college since 2021 just recently came back last year. The school is a 50 minute daily drive which is horrible, they do not offer online CS classes it's the typical brick and mortar sit in a classroom and listen to the lecture type school which has never worked out for me since like middle school

My school also does not offer semester-round for certain classes, so theres certain mandatory classes you have to take but it's only offered once a year so if you miss out on that class or if it becomes full and no one drops so you can't enroll, you'll have no way to take those classes, better luck next year. My school does not allow CLEP exams or competency exams to test out of classes either, their whole model is old school

This caused my graduation timeline to actually be late 2026 or ealy 2027 and there's no way in hell I want to wait that long, I rather graduate as soon as possible and get to the money now instead of having to wait like almost 4 years.

I graduated from an online community college with an associates in business technology management in 2021 but there's a problem with my state university, I have 82 credits and they classified me as a Junior but  I'm basically a freshman because all of those credits are free electives, my credits basically weren't accepted because they're from out of state even though they're all business/CS related. I couldn't find a course transfer equivelancy page on WGU's website to show what specific classes will transfer from certain universities, does anyone have information about what credits can transfer without having to call WGU? (I don't want to get spam called by them)

When I was a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, I took this course called [Intro to Deep Learning](https://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/S24/index.html). Don't let the name of this course fool you; it was absolutely one of the hardest and most interesting classes I've taken in my entire life. In that class, I fully learned what ""AI"" *actually* means. I learned how to create state-of-the-art AI algorithms – including training them from scratch using AWS EC2 clusters. 

But, I loved it. At this time, I was also a trader. I had aspirations of creating AI-Powered bots that would execute trades for me.

And I had *heard of* ""reinforcement learning"" before.. I took an online course at the University of Alberta and received a certificate. But I hadn't worked with ""Deep Reinforcement Learning"" – combining our most powerful AI algorithm (deep learning) with reinforcement learning

So, when my Intro to Deep Learning class had a final project in which I could create whatever I wanted, I decided to make a Deep Reinforcement Learning Trading Bot. 

# Background: What is Deep Reinforcement Learning

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) involves a series of structured steps that enable a computer program, or agent, to learn optimal actions within a given environment through a process of trial and error. Here’s a concise breakdown:

1. **Initialize**: Start with an agent that has no knowledge of the environment, which could be anything from a game interface to financial markets.
2. **Observe**: The agent observes the current state of the environment, such as stock prices or a game screen.
3. **Decide**: Using its current policy, which initially might be random, the agent selects an action to perform.
4. **Act and Transition**: The agent performs the action, causing the environment to change and generate a new state, along with a reward (positive or negative).
5. **Receive Reward**: Rewards inform the agent about the effectiveness of its action in achieving its goals.
6. **Learn**: The agent updates its policy using the experience (initial state, action, reward, new state), typically employing algorithms like Q-learning or policy gradients to refine decision-making towards actions that yield higher returns.
7. **Iterate**: This cycle repeats, with the agent continually refining its policy to maximize cumulative rewards.

This iterative learning approach allows DRL agents to evolve from novice to expert, mastering complex decision-making tasks by optimizing actions based on direct interaction with their environment.

# How I applied it to the stock market

Some of the interesting experiments we tried included using convolutional neural networks to generate graphs, and use the images as features for the model.

However, despite the complexity of the models we built, none of the models were able to develop a trading strategy on SPY that outperformed Buy and Hold. 

I'll admit the code is very ugly (we were scramming to find *something* we could write in our paper and didn't focus on code quality). But if people here are interested in AI beyond Large Language Models, I think this would be an interesting read.

I joined [FlowGPT](https://flowgpt.com/) through this subreddit a year ago since they offer free ChatGPT usage which at that time blocked in my country. At that time FlowGPT actually has a lot of creative and useful prompts such as jailbreaking, brainstorming writing idea, translation, python code generator/assistant or student tutoring. They even have weekly prompt-crafting competitions. It helps me a lot, make my work much easier and I learned tons of prompt-engineering in the process. Then after 3 months (around August last year) when the AI girlfriends started to appear. At first it's just some featured prompt in the homepage, then gradually it became popular and take over the platform. There's even some stuff like AI girl generator which obviously a lot of people use to generate AI porn. Then around 2 months ago they removed all general chatbot interface (without custom instructions) from the platform. ChatGPT 3.5, 4, Gemini, Claude, you name it and all of users' chat history.

I didn't try to be the friendly doormat type of teacher--it just sort of happened. And I really try to look at my students in the best possible light, I try to be stoic about things, and I tried really, really hard to make my classes almost impossible to fail (alas). I greet every student with good morning and good afternoon. I say the same things every day every five minutes. I nag and remind and wax poetic about how one must crawl before they walk and walk before they run. I remind people to keep their feet on the floor. I talk to students about their gambling (phone) addictions, using the DSM-5 criteria. I blocked Google on GoGuardian. I talk about how the human brain is a quintillion times faster than punching out-of-context questions into Google or ChatGPT or whatever. I ask people to put their phones away and somehow they text their friends the pencil and paper assignments anyway and I get duplicate answers from the quietly failing friends who have my classes at different times throughout the day. I get Snapchat AI a lot on anything that involves chromebooks, or anything that uses logical cognitive processes. I ran out of copy machine money. I made four versions of the upcoming final exam and printed them at the public library (I ran out of copy machine money).

  
So--what's worth fighting for? Cell phones? In-class discussion? Drafts and revision? Cold calling? Reading aloud?

For cellphones: My department is mostly brand new, with a couple of burnt out veterans. One idea everyone is floating is collecting cell phones at the beginning of every class. I'm not sure about it, but right now reified as a sliced-bread solution.



For in-class discussion: One idea that might actually be worth it for me is to make porpsicle storcks (tongue depressors) and enforce participation. I figured, because I was new, that people simply enjoyed silence (and darkness) in the classroom. I've discovered, though, that I had to do a zillion little things every day because I excised discussion from my slate of options.

Because High School is not college, I'm okay with making participation part of the grade next year. I little birdie told me that only work ought to be graded, but there's no other place on Earth where people can finish their work and then just sit there for 40 minutes waiting for a bell to ring. Colleges don't do it. Workplaces don't do it. So I figure the environment dictates the activity, and participation needs to be graded, otherwise people are going to pretend that using their phone under their desk with their heads on the desk makes them invisible.

For drafts and revision: Early in the year I asked students to write a paragraph and I remember clearly a student saying ""I ain't writing a goddamn fucking paragraph."" And they didn't. So I made my classroom anti-reading and pro-stupid-videos-all-the-time. And students complained about watching 5-10 minute chunks of not-so-High-Quality-Instructional-Materials. I walked the class through EdPuzzles and asked open-ended questions, and I got the selected responses and blanks. I handed papers back and got blanks again. My content area is one where writing across the curriculum is more than a stupid idea--it could actually work in a school where people write goddamn fucking paragraphs.

For cold calling: I was informed that students of low SES/academic achievement would experience pants-shittingly-bad anxiety if I asked them a question. So I would ask the whole group a question and count to 270 slowly in my head. Then I would move on to the next thing. So next year, I'm going to have a lot of people with shit all up in their pants.

For reading aloud: I was informed that the majority of the students at the High School are aliterate and illiterate, and that asking them to read aloud is like duct taping their hands and feet together and throwing them in a kidnap van. So I read everything. But I think my informants were wrong about a lot of things.

Also: My school doesn't have a phone policy. It's up to me to put on an iron coat and run my own gauntlets. I think they want to wait 5-10 years for national momentum to build. Maybe it won't. Maybe it will. 

So, all that to say: Which battles do you fight? Do you win? If not, is it worth it for you to be Sisyphus, and where in the 180 or so days does it pay off for you.

Yes, it is true that I allow students in class to listen to music via Spotify during certain designated times in class. I have found that incorporating music into the learning environment can enhance focus and create a more positive atmosphere for some students.

I would like to assure you that this is done with careful consideration to ensure that it does not disrupt the learning process. Additionally, I am always open to feedback and willing to make adjustments as needed to create the best possible learning environment for all students.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out. (I value our partnership in supporting your child's education.) <- only bit I removed before sending haha

1cw53a3,2,2024-05-19,D387 Advanced Java Additional Tips,u/Battlecode907,WGU,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1cw53a3/d387_advanced_java_additional_tips/,"Task A: You already know the drill by getting the Gitlab repository if you've done the past two courses of Java. 

[Advanced Java Walk through Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/17fnqu2/d387_advanced_java_walkthrough/)

[Advanced Java Additional Tips](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/18w0yx5/d387_advanced_java/)

Req B1: The Java walkthrough guides help provide you further insight on what you should be doing. Now I'll give a few more details about it. It's important that the html file is edited and it uses the array method or list to display your welcome messages on the main screen. It's best to build a rest controller on the backend, so that you can link it to the frontend for Angular on the app.component.ts file. You can create a second file that implements runnable and this is used to retrieve the two different locale messages from the resource bundle. And then you can use this class on your controller file which can then be used for the Angular front end. Just be sure to start the threads on the SampleCodeApplication if you go down this route. You can look at the Java guide for more details about this part. I believe that this is the hardest part of the entire project.

Req B2: You can use the documentation cited in the Java guide for B2 if you want to learn more about how to do this. You just need to edit the App.component.ts file and the html file. Add in two more prices one being CAD and the other being EUR. They can remain the same and there's no need for currency conversion here as they don't require it, but it's important to simply add these two variables to the room class. And then create a simple forEach loop through these two variables you added for the room class. You then add these beneath the price object that is on the html page and you can follow it exactly how it's done with the first price. Just use windows + . to get the emoji keyboard if you use windows and there's a symbols tab at the top and there's a currency category below. This part is the easiest one for writing code here.

Req B3: You can follow the same route as you did in B1 by creating a rest controller. You need to create three timezones and all three of them are displayed on the page. So the page should show ET, MT, and UTC. You just need the hours and the minutes for the time format. I recommend you to use the resources provided by the Java guide. This should help you out with what you need help with. 

Req C1: Right click on the root folder and create a docker file. Click on the target folder and you should see a JAR file in there. You want to copy the file path and just paste it into the docker file's file path. Then just keep target/JAR file because that's all you need. For the entry points, just copy it from the link in this article exactly the same way. Note: there shouldn't be a maintainer because there's no reason to have one for this project. 

Req C2: You need to open up the docker desktop app and make sure that the setting ""expose daemon"" is enabled on the docker desktop app. The okay button is on the top right corner in case you didn't see it. Then you use the command ""docker build -t \[d387\_student id\] ."" Just remember that this is done on IntelliJ using the terminal which is at the bottom left corner of your screen. It should successfully build it and you can verify this by using ""docker images"" in the terminal. Then use the command ""docker run -p 8080:8080 \[name of file\]"" to run it. It should work fine as long as ""expose daemon"" is enabled. 

Req C3: You can use the Java guide and follow it exactly. You're simply describing how you would deploy your current application to the cloud using AWS or Azure. But Azure is more simplistic and easier to explain if that's what you're looking for. 

D: You just need to print pdf the Gitlab branch history, a file for the screenshots and a file for C3 which can be done on Word, and then the Gitlab repository link. 

That's all you need for this course right here. I think it's less work than D288 and even D287 once you understand what you must do. However, it takes time to learn new concepts like multithreading. I've completed this course much faster than the previous two courses. You could get this course done in a matter of days if you focus and learn what's needed. You can use ChatGPT to help you understand Angular and Spring Boot concepts as well. It can help you understand the code that you're reading.

Long story short-ish:  Student turned in a lengthy research essay.  A few paragraphs didn’t quite pass the eyeball test with me.  I ran the paragraphs in particular into a detector website (Crossplag), and the three paragraphs came back as 100%, 100%, and 89% AI written.  

I gave the student a zero, she claims she wrote the essay.  Mom believes her and wants to put up a stink.  

She is a good student overall who had a very poor semester.  (Lots of procrastination and prioritizing socializing over academica). She is a strong writer, but deep down inside, I don’t think she’s THAT strong of a writer.  (She’s still a HS sophomore, after all.)

I consulted four additional AI sites, and they all but one came back with 100% AI written.  (The other said 83%.)

It was a research essay, so I’m sure the student wrote much of it (and did the proper citations), but I also truly don’t think she wrote 100% of it herself.  

My school and district have no guidelines whatsoever on this.  It’s always “teacher discretion.”

Any thoughts or suggestions?",active,1
1cwpa8q,3,2024-05-20,The Dilemma of AI-Assisted Content,u/Commercial-Ice8548,technepal,https://www.reddit.com/r/technepal/comments/1cwpa8q/the_dilemma_of_aiassisted_content/,"I've been thinking a lot about the role of AI in our daily lives, especially when it comes to writing and content creation. Whenever I need to make a post, write an email, or even draft a resume, I often turn to AI chatbots like ChatGPT or Gemini to help me articulate my ideas better, with correct grammar and proper formatting.

However, I've noticed a growing trend of developing software to detect AI-generated content, particularly in educational settings. This got me wondering: what if every sector started to develop similar detection software to filter out AI-assisted content? 

Let's take a couple of practical examples: crafting a resume and writing research papers. Imagine you use an AI to create a resume, ensuring all the information is accurate and relevant. But what if companies start filtering out resumes that were drafted with the help of AI? Similarly, think about writing research papers. Many students and researchers might use AI tools to structure their papers, check grammar, or even generate ideas. If academic institutions start rejecting papers identified as AI-assisted, wouldn't that defeat the purpose of using these tools in the first place?

This raises a genuine concern about the future of AI in assisting us with our tasks. If AI content is increasingly scrutinized and potentially rejected, what's the point of relying on AI for such important tasks?

I’d love to hear your thoughts on this. ",User_deleted,3

Students Don’t Need It Anymore,u/FrontalSteel,ArtificialInteligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1cwq6qm/chatgpt_brings_down_online_education_stocks_chegg/,"It’s over for Chegg. The company, listed on the New York Stock Exchange (market cap $471.22M), made millions by solving school homework. Chegg worked by connecting what they would call ‘experts’, usually cheap outsourced teachers, who were being paid by parents of the kids (including college students) to write fancy essays or solve homework math problems.

Chegg literally advertises as “Get Homework Help” without a trace of embarrassment. As Chegg puts it, you can “take a pic of your homework question and get an expert explanation in a matter of hours”. “Controversial” is one way to describe it. Another more fitting phrase would be **“**mass-produced organized cheating**”.**

But it's not needed anymore. ChatGPT solves every assignment instantly and for free, making this busness model unsustainable.

Chegg suffered a 95% decline in stock price from its ATH in 2021, plummeting from $113 to $4 per share.

In January, Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan downgraded Chegg, Inc**.** to Sell from Neutral, lowering the price target to $8 from $10. The slides are as brutal as -12% a day. The decline is so steep that it would be better represented on a logarithmic scale.

If you had invested $10,000 in Chegg in early 2021, your stocks would now be worth less than $500.

(Like, billionaire-building-rocket-to-space-just-because-they-can… *wealthy*.)

  
  
The premise was that white-collar workers became displaced by AI and realized that they had no idea how to do anything, especially not with their hands, and as a result — the handymen achieved world domination.

  
  
Well, they say there’s a grain of truth in every joke. So today, we’re diving into this joke’s truth.



# Gen Z’s trendy new dress code: blue collars

The Wall Street Journal is calling them “the toolbelt generation.”

  
  
But they’d probably just call themselves a bunch of smart, fed-up 18-year-olds.



Practically anywhere you look, interest in blue-collar entrepreneurship is rising among the youth.

  
  
Spurring it, in part? These trends:

* Rising blue-collar pay
* Better blue-collar tech
* Less blue-collar stigma
* The insane price of college



That last one is a biggie. Just think about the situation on the ground.



While those in business service roles make a median $78,500 compared to $69,200 in construction…

  
  
… Recent studies [have shown](https://www.businessinsider.com/half-new-us-graduates-work-high-school-level-jobs-2024-2) that the return on investment for many new college grads just isn’t there. According to the data, more than half of college graduates are ending up with high school-level jobs where their skills or degrees aren’t needed.

  
  
So put yourself in the shoes of a pre-college teen today and imagine you have this train of thought…

1. You’re using ChatGPT to cheat on a homework assignment, and starting to piece together how people might lose their jobs because of tools like it. In fact, as of last year, [56% of you](https://getjobber.com/bluecollarreport/) and your peers said y’all believed blue-collar jobs offered more job security than white-collar ones. 
2. You’re also seeing pay rise [almost twice as much](https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/gen-z-trades-jobs-plumbing-welding-a76b5e43) for new construction hires (up 5.1% to $48,089 in 2023) as it is for new professional service hires (up 2.7% to $39,520). 
3. You see the role college debt has played in depressing a generation’s potential for building wealth — and that the costs are only showing signs of rising further. 
4. You already like working on your grandpa’s old car. You like doing things with your hands. You’ve always been entrepreneurial.



So sure, it’s not for everyone, but for you, maybe a trade… might just make some sense…

  


# Now let’s dive into the data…

Remember that train of thought we described above?

  
  
First of all — that’s a problem if you don’t.

  
  
Second of all — it’s a train that’s clearly making stops at more and more young minds…



Vocational school enrollment is growing wayyyyyy faster than that of a traditional 4-year college, rising 16% last year. 

  
  
That’s despite the fact that 74% of young people surveyed by Jobber say there’s a stigma associated with going to a vocational school.

  
  
We expect that number to drop, and that’s a big deal. It’s also much needed.

  
  
Widespread shortages persist across the blue-collar workforce. The country’s roads and houses are growing old. Boomers are retiring at a rapid clip. 

  
  
As the average American’s hair grows grey (silver, to be nice), these gaps could widen.

  
  
The good news is: Efforts made to address them TODAY will pay dividends for years to come.

  
  
In some instances, we’re already seeing this play out.



While the whole country continues growing older, the age of an electrician, mechanic, and plumber is trending younger.

  
  
The question, then, is: How do we continue to encourage, support, and inspire those looking to get their hands dirty — and possibly become Main Street entrepreneurs?

  


# We educate them like nothing you’ve ever seen…

15 years from now, don’t be surprised if you wake up one day and it’s a norm across the country for your kid to opt for vocational school or small business ownership.

  
  
That much, we’re fairly confident in.

  
  
But as for kickstarting that process?

  
  
The blueprint for that may well sit at the corner of Innovation Boulevard and Inspiration Way.

  
  
No, those aren’t made up. Those are real streets in Forney, Texas — the home of an educational experiment the likes of which you’ve never seen.

  
  
It’s called [Opportunity Central](https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/education/schools/new-texas-high-school-grows-entrepreneurs-mall/287-80056171-50b0-4763-89b3-f3a1e88f4f55). And seriously, it looks like an enormous, state-of-the-art shopping mall:

… Because, just inside, on the publicly accessible ground floor, that’s exactly what you’ll find: a mall.

  
  
Inside the mall — a BBQ joint.

  
  
Right down the hall from that — a salon.

  
  
Turn your head — a home decor boutique, a bakery, and a cafe.

  
  
Around back — an automotive repair shop.

  
  
In fact, the facility houses 2-dozen small businesses like these, along with a 7,500-seat arena, space for remote workers, and more.

  
  
But right smack dab on top of it all?



A 2-story high school.

  
  
The idea is simple but profound: In return for a discount on leases, the business owners offer mentorship, hands-on education, and in some cases, paid work opportunities for these students *as part of school.*

  
  
“Upstairs are classrooms, downstairs is where students really learn,” as one reporter put it.

  
  
It’s a win-win for everyone involved. Learning becomes more practical (and fun), businesses grow, the school offsets its costs, and the community strengthens.

  
  
THIS is the kind of idea we need more of.

  
  
The kind of idea that helps people develop a wide variety of real-world skills *while* teaching them how to think.

Andrej Karpathy discusses the relationship between sensors and end effectors, emphasizing the connection between digital information and physical actions [1]. OpenAI shared a safety update during the AI Seoul Summit [2].







Anthropic AI has been working on enhancing the interpretability of large language models (LLMs). They have demonstrated that dictionary learning can break down a small model into ""monosemantic"" components called ""features"" [3]. They have extracted millions of these features from a deployed model called Claude 3 Sonnet, which encompass a wide range of concepts [4]. These features can represent the same concept across different contexts and languages, even extending to image inputs [6]. They also have a causal influence on the model's outputs in intuitive ways [6]. However, the work is preliminary and more research is needed to determine the practical usefulness of their approach [9].







Anthropic AI has also identified several features that could be relevant to safety applications, including code vulnerabilities, deception, bias, sycophancy, power-seeking, and criminal activity [7]. They have introduced a ""secrecy"" feature that activates when descriptions of people or characters keeping a secret are detected [8]. The company is hiring for their interpretability team with positions available for Managers, Research Scientists, and Research Engineers [12].







NVIDIA is hosting a session at Dell Technologies World about how their technology is powering Generative AI models for the retail industry [13]. They are also hosting an event where they will discuss the broad use of generative AI in sectors like healthcare, life sciences, energy, and transportation [14].







Stack AI, a startup founded by former MIT PhD students, offers a low-code workflow automation tool to help organizations build custom AI assistants and workflow automation quickly [15]. Scale AI has secured a $1 billion Series F funding round, valuing the company at $14 billion [16].







Distro AI, a Y Combinator's S24 startup, is introducing point-of-sale AI for industrial wholesale distributors [17]. The short course ""Introduction to On-Device AI"" teaches how to deploy AI models on edge devices like smartphones for faster and more secure inference [18].







NVIDIA and Microsoft have collaborated to optimize Microsoft's latest AI models, including the Phi-3 family of small language models, to run on NVIDIA GPUs [21]. NVIDIA AI Developer announced at #MSBuild the new R555 Game Ready Driver, which includes support for DQ-GEMM metacommand for INT4 weight-only quantization, new RMSNorm normalization methods for popular LLMs, optimized workflows within WebNN, and more [24].







Satya Nadella announced the launch of Microsoft Copilot, Copilot stack, and Copilot+ PCs to provide new opportunities for developers in the era of AI transformation in technology [28]. He also congratulated the Imagine Cup winners, team From Your Eyes of Turkey, for building an AI-powered accessibility solution [25].







Groq Inc is participating in the Vapi AI online hackathon, showcasing their LPU™ Inference Engine for conversational AI applications [30]. They have also announced a new use case featuring Vectorizeio, showcasing a powerful Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) experimentation and pipeline platform powered by Groq's real-time AI inference [32].







Cohere recently hosted its first-ever Build Day in London, Toronto, San Francisco, and New York, where developers and business professionals collaborated to bring their ideas to life [39]. They also collaborated with Borderless AI to showcase the power of LLMs in HR during a webinar [40].







Google AI is showcasing how AI is revolutionizing the healthcare and science industries in a session at Google I/O [41]. They also hosted a discussion with Lord Stern and James Manyika on realizing the full potential of AI in sustainable and equitable ways [43]. Google is promoting its AI models, including Gemini Flash and Veo, for developers to explore and utilize in their projects [47]. They also collaborated with four artists to create ""Infinite Wonderland,"" a project where they reimagined ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" in their unique styles using AI [48].







Yann LeCun will be holding a book signing session for ""Quand la Machine Apprend"" at the FNAC stand at Vivatech [49].

Met a girl at school, a year below me. We clicked, texting 2-3 hours daily, sharing interests in math, physics, and studying in the US. Both in student government – I'm president, she's treasurer.

We started hanging out a lot, even texting until my flight took off once. At the school dance, we even snuck out for Monster Energy (we always got the white one). We had nicknames for each other and lots of inside jokes. Things were great until I asked her out for coffee.

During our date, we discussed a student government project (rose sale). I suggested us older students handle ordering roses, not the younger ones. She misrepresented this in an email to the teacher, saying I wanted to exclude the younger kids entirely. I confronted her, but she didn't see her mistake.

Y Combinator has introduced LetsUnifyAI, a service that dynamically routes prompts to the most suitable Language Model (LLM) based on user preferences for quality, speed, and cost. The service aims to simplify the process of selecting the most suitable LLM for specific tasks, avoiding manual testing and benchmarking. Users can sign up, select a router, and start using the service by installing unifyai [1].







Yann LeCun, a prominent figure in AI, has expressed the importance of safer AI and suggested that funding could be obtained to build better AI [2]. He advises students interested in developing AI systems not to work on LLMs [3]. Instead, he is focusing on the next generation of AI systems and encourages others to do the same [4].







NVIDIA AI has highlighted the transformative impact of generative AI on the retail industry, with 98% of retailers planning to invest in this technology in the next 18 months [5]. NVIDIA also offers a wide range of resources for higher education and research in the field of AI, including workshops, courses, webinars, and real-world applications. The company collaborates with universities like Georgia Tech and Oregon State University to address global challenges through AI and supercomputing [6].







The concept of ""SynthAI"" represents the second wave of B2B AI applications, focusing on utilizing AI capabilities to streamline end-to-end workflows. Startups are increasingly targeting workflows with AI applications [8].







Google AI announced the upcoming launch of a new feature for Google Photos search called Ask Photos. The experimental feature, powered by Gemini, is designed to understand natural language queries and analyze visual content to provide personalized and insightful responses [9][10]. Google AI also introduced LANISTR, a new framework that enables multimodal learning by integrating structured and unstructured data, aligning and fusing them, and generating class predictions. It demonstrates remarkable improvements in healthcare and retail datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in various tasks [11].







NVIDIA AI Developer's research paper on ""Filtering After Shading with Stochastic Texture Filtering"" won Best Paper at I3D2024 [12]. NVIDIA also shared information about how NVIDIA NIM inference microservices can accelerate and simplify generative AI deployment [13]. The NVIDIA NeMo Curator is an open-source data curation framework that helps prepare high-quality datasets for training generative AI models [14].







OpenAI has announced a multi-year partnership with News Corp to enhance ChatGPT with its premium journalism [15]. Google's handling of data in relation to its Gemini Apps, including the collection of conversations, location data, and feedback, was also discussed. The company emphasizes its commitment to privacy and transparency in handling user data [16].







Groq Inc is hosting a panel on Efficient and Innovative Thermal Management for AI/ML Applications at the ECTC event, co-chaired by Zhi Yang [17]. The company will also have their Head of GroqCloud, Sundeep, participating in a panel about AI for enterprise teams at Vercel SHIP [19].

1czsdbr,52,2024-05-24,My Startup Nightmare with a Reddit Stranger,u/troutrucker,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1czsdbr/my_startup_nightmare_with_a_reddit_stranger/,"**tl;dr** Don't get into a startup with a random Redditor with a half-baked idea and no real technical skills. Also, yeah, I'm dumb for doing so.

So, a few months ago I was browsing r/boardgames and came across a post where a guy was trying to get feedback on an idea for chatting with boardgame and TTRPG rulebooks. At first, I simply let him know that boardgames would probably work since the creators aren't really seeking the rules, they are selling the games. We had a bit of back and forth in Reddit DMs and I liked where he was going so I invited him to one of my Discord servers.

He was a mobile Android dev who worked as a freelancer, so he didn't really know a ton outside of Kotlin and that world. That was fine, he seemed eager to learn and I'm an accomplished full stack engineer with more than a decade of experience and I like mentoring people. I'm also a huge tabletop gaming nerd, so this was right up my alley.

After probably a week or so of chatting and fleshing out his idea more, at some point we decided to go into business together under **Level151 LLC**, which was a business he had established for a slightly different idea but targeting video games. **The first red flag** was I found out that he actually started it with several people he had known for years and they abandoned him. At first, I thought it was because they realized there isn't much monetization you can get out of video game players since video game companies have bleeding players dry down to a science.

You might be thinking ""but the tabletop industry is magnitudes smaller though!"" And you're definitely right. **However**, tabletop players do buy a lot of games, upgrades, replacements, and other things that enhance the experience. But there still isn't a ton of money to be made in that sector. It's just something we were both passionate about and the idea was a good fit for.

**Red flag number two** was when I tried to explain how we could take this idea and use it to refine the technology so that we could use it to directly target a number of other industries with considerably more money. Industries like Medical, Law, Insurance, or general B2B where they have tons of manuals to wade through. I'm not sure how many times I had to explain this or how many different ways, but he didn't really get it until one day he sort of logged on and thought he had come up with the idea.

Cool, whatever at least he's on board now. But, he started to get distracted a little bit and wanted to shift focus to that immediately which I talked him out of. But still, **red flag number three**.

The cool thing about boardgamers is that, like any nerd subculture... and I say this with love as one of them, they are pedantic as shit. If they used our tool and received bad answers due to flaws in our search or hallucinations from the LLM, we'd hear about it pretty much immediately and probably non-stop too. For a company that consisted of two people that doesn't have the credentials that a lot of other similar ideas have, like Perplexity or even a lot of the features OpenAI is adding, this was something that was incredibly valuable to what we were building. Plus, it was serving a market that may not be the largest in terms of money spent, but it is definitely a market that spends enough to basically keep the lights on in terms of paying for infrastructure. At this point, with four red flags before we really started building something, I just kept chugging along because he seemed like a good dude who was just figuring out things in his own way.

But then we started 'building' things... or at least I did. Within a week or two working in just my free time after work, I had a Remix site deployed on Cloudflare Pages, as well as a few workers boilerplated so they would be ready, a CDN through Digital Ocean (since it's the most cost-effective), the Neo4j database set up on a Droplet, and a dockerized API. Plus, a deployment pipeline set up for all the above with GitHub actions and DO 'apps.' We were pretty much ready to rock. I wasn't a big fan of the Neo4j choice, but he didn't budge on that for 'reasons' he was never actually able to articulate. Whatever, GraphDBs are cool and I didn't see it being a bottleneck, plus we could use it for unobtrusive targeted direct affiliate marketing.

Once I had this set up to where it was working and stable, I started building a lot of the fundamentals of the site. Optimizing heavily for SEO, speed, and accessibility. **The fifth red flag** was when I realized that after him already doing this for 3-4 months at this point. His injection pipeline was still nothing more than unreadable, ChatGPT-written, random-ass Python scripts that only he knew how to use and barely knew how they worked himself. He was supposed to be taking this and either putting it into the API or at least refining the Python scripts to something that was professional in a way that at least other people could work with it or use it.

I have enough experience to know a lot of people reading this may be like ""But it's a startup and they sort of worked right? What's the problem? Get the data and ship"" And if that were the case, you'd be right. But what I mean by 'something in a way at least other people could work with it,' I am talking about a several-thousand-line set of scripts that needed parts of it to be toggled on and off by commenting out specific function calls or changing parameters.

...yeah.

On top of that, it only worked as a proof of concept. What he had could not take in content and spit out consistent results. That was part of the effort to move it to the API he was supposed to be working on. Our goal was to get documents, mostly PDFs, into Markdown syntax with a few extra syntax features we needed. This was mostly for ease of use and so that we could have a solid base to build a very accessible (as in web a11y) site.

So, I started jumping in and playing with the injection pipeline and trying to get something working. Let me tell you, PDFs are the worst fucking tech we still use daily. They are digital documents designed for print media and the people who make them (usually) are designing them FOR print media, so standards and content flow in the digital format is not something that is high priority for a lot of designers. I went through about half a dozen methods and got something pretty good by combining a PDF-to-HTML formatter with a post-script that turned that into more semantic HTML, then running it through an LLM to make sure the flow was correct. It didn't fully work, but it was a good starting place and the best and most cost-effective method I could come up with.

I showed it to him and he didn't understand. Like... at all. I don't know where the disconnect was, but in hindsight, I don't even think he was paying attention, he was just focused on playing around with Python scripts and LangChain. Not really focused on actually producing something useful, just playing around with the technology. At this point, you might be thinking we are kids or college students or something like that. But no, we are both mid to late 30s.

Where are we now? Six? **Six red flags**?

I have no idea why I didn't jump ship at this point. I guess it was because he was still enthused and more or less bankrolling the little expenses we did have (less than $100/mo).

I kept going like this until I had a very solid foundation for the part users were going to be hitting. I had alleviated most of the burden that the database was doing through aggressive edge caching and made sure all the little database and object storage duckies were in a row to receive a shit ton of content from an ingestion pipeline. This realistically only took me about another week or so of just piddling around. So I spun up a place for us to put private docs, a blog, and other stuff too. I could have jumped into the data side of things, but he just kept insisting that he had it and was almost there, and I have a full-time job that can be pretty demanding at times, so I mostly focused on that.

At some point during this time frame, he shifted focus because we were accepted into a small incubator local to him that helps startups get off the ground. It didn't have any investment money, but it gave a lot of pretty good guidance from the virtual meetings I saw. I forget exactly how long this lasted, but I want to say two months or so? But, he kept reassuring me he was working on the ingestion pipeline and I was seeing small improvements and commits sometimes, so kinda just let him do his thing.

But then we got to **the final red flag, lucky number seven**. This whole time, from pretty much the start of everything, we had had a weekly meeting at minimum. While this program was going on, every week the scope and direction of the project changed. They were small changes at first, but then eventually came to the point of him basically wanting to replicate Perplexity. But even before that ultimate direction shift, I was at my limit and more or less just in my ""fuck it"" stage and waiting him out to do whatever the fuck it was he was supposed to have been doing.

Honestly, after months of not receiving something that was a level of effort I've seen accomplished during a hackathon, I just quit keeping up with the things he was doing. Then when he started going into our project board on GitHub and creating HUNDREDS of conflicting issues that were not fleshed out at all and very reminiscent of that original Python script I mentioned at the beginning. I stopped keeping up with that, too.

Now we get to the last month or so. My grandparents are the reason I am where I am today, and they are old. I live 1,300 miles from them, and my Grandpa (91) had a heart attack but survived with a 40% chance survival rate from the surgery. But before he went into surgery, my grandma had a stroke and was also hospitalized. My Grandpa is tough old fart and he survived and only spent a week or so in rehab and my Grandma recovered as well. They live in a very rural area, so I flew down to help them when they got out of the hospital. I was there for about 3 weeks before coming home.

Shortly before I came home, the incubator program wrapped up. Great right? We can start producing shit! Finally! Let's get it done! I was also informed that he had brought a designer buddy of his back on board because that guy had kind of just flaked out somewhere in the very beginning, but this time he had a full stake in the company instead of just feeling it out. Fucking awesome, I specialize in frontend and I can get by, but I am no designer. We had our normal weekly meeting where I was introduced to ""Stash"" which was obviously the B2B version of the application. Which I was actually cool with because with what we were working on, this could have easily been done in parallel even with a minimal team. The tech is the same.

Well, this is where the story ends. The other night, he sent me a message on Discord more or less saying that he had lied about giving him the stake in the **Level151 LLC** company and that they were doing a different business with just the two of them. But he was going to be such a nice guy and raise my stake in Level151 to 50% and that he would be going down to part-time on it in favor of *STAAAASH* :jazz-hands: and that I wasn't going to be part of it.

Isn't that great? I get 50% of nothing functional other than what I had built, so I can keep building the tech to validate the tech for a business I'm not even part of!

Here's the fun part: I own the domain of the product we were building. This was never in the contract and never formally moved to Level151 LLC.

So, if you'd like, you can read our conversation on: [Tabili](https://tabili.io/#convo)

Their main goal, above all else, is seeking VC money. That's what the gener8tor incubator program was mostly about. So, if by some off chance, some VC sees this and wants to invest in these guys, do yourself a favor and pick up the phone instead, call InfoSys, invest a fraction of the money, and you may actually get a product someday. I have worked with InfoSys in the past, a nightmare to work with, and they produce the most shit products I've ever seen. **BUT**, they are actually capable of shipping products.",User_deleted,53

Current grading systems and report cards often lack the precision needed to highlight specific issues. For example, a 9th-grade student with grades of 5, 5, and 6 might showcase that he is bad at math but the root cause could be struggling with basic linear equations, which can hold them back.

I'm trying to design a platform that identifies the specific competencies where students have gaps. Based on evaluations corrected by teachers, the platform will create a profile for each student, highlighting the subjects and skills they struggle with. Additionally, it will display individual and class statistics, showing the areas where students face difficulties.

Another feature of the platform would be the automatic correction and analysis of tests using ChatGPT, as well as suggesting targeted content for the concepts students do not master.

Would you use such a platform? What features would you be interested in?

I've been messing around with LLM's the last year, and I want to be in the forefront in education in using these tools (education is notorious for being slow to adopt new technologies in the classroom).  I want my kids to have the best to prepare them for the future.  See, my goals aren't that big right?

I've been using Copilot and Gemini to generate solutions and I am impressed with how much they get right....but I want my model to be more accurate since it still is not close to 100% yet (but wow....it's getting closer every time I see an update).

  
I have messed around with Python so I can handle some coding.  Not traditionally trained but I got guts to fail and learn. I can learn on the fly....I've got VSCode ready to go...and I can even download and run a github source....just don't ask me to marge a branch (?)...but can anyone help me and point me in the right direction?  Where do I go to get the open source models?  Will they be good enough?  How hard will it be to tokenize (?) and fine tune these models.  Am I even using these terms correctly?  Lastly...am I nuts to try this for my kids?  I tell them not to let fear of failure dictate their decisions....so....what do you all think???",active,2
1d0wfso,3,2024-05-26,Essay feedback - ChatGPT keeps pushing me down,u/imallmagic,GRE,https://www.reddit.com/r/GRE/comments/1d0wfso/essay_feedback_chatgpt_keeps_pushing_me_down/,"Hey everyone,

I'd love some feedback on this essay I wrote for an issue essay topic. I can't figure out why ChatGPT keeps giving me low scores like 4/4.5. I expected something between 5-5.5 for this atleast. MBA Crystal Ball gave me a 5.7 but I don't know who to believe. The feedback from ChatGPT is to try to simplify some sentences a bit more and try to add more nuanced depth. I understand the former but I don't think I'd have time to do better for the latter, it's like 30 minutes right?

I had a few questions too:

1. Does the accuracy of facts I mention in the essay matter much? Like if I say ""recent studies suggest..."" without actually knowing those studies (hearsay)? I find it hard to believe that people actually have accurate knowledge of ""studies"" or specific facts or examples they mention. Maybe something not outlandish but something plausible?

2. Is it a problem if I restate the issue verbatim in my introductory and conclusion paragraphs?

PS: My exam is in 10 days.

  
""I firmly believe that educational institutions should not actively encourage their students to choose fields of study in which jobs are plentiful. In my opinion, the number of available jobs in a field should not be a factor that influences a student to choose that field. Instead, their interest, skill, and passion in a field should drive that decision.

I believe that skill and interest in a field is the most important factor that determines success. It drives the amount of hard work a person is willing to put in their work. A contemporary example is that of the famous cricketer M.S. Dhoni. He has won two international cricket world cups for India and is widely hailed as the best captain India has had in the past century. Ironically, before considering cricket as a professional option, he used to work as a conductor in the railways. He has claimed that it was a job he wasn't interested in but was widely considered as a popular one with many job openings. And so, to provide a stable life for his family, he took the job of a conductor in the railways but evidently failed to excel in that role. Ultimately, it was his skill and interest in cricket that drove the hard work that he put into the game. This clearly shows that the amount of hard work a person can put into a field is more beneficial than a mediocre effort put into a field with many jobs.

Furthermore, we can consider the instance of one of the greatest scientists of our generation, Albert Einstein. Recent studies into his past suggests that Einstein was particularly repelled by the field of mathematics. Proficiency in mathematics is a very crucial prerequisite that determines success in the field of physics. For a field as competitive as physics, it was highly unlikely that Einstein could ever achieve anything with his mathematical limitations. And so, he was on a modest career path that started off as a lowly patent clerk. His limitations notwithstanding, his interest in physics and penchant for learning drove Einstein to come up with theories that earned him widespread acclaim and etched his name in the history books. Thus, it can be seen that interest in a field is a far more important factor while choosing fields than the number of jobs.

I do concede that it will be harder to find a job in a field if the total number of jobs is less. The field of wildlife photography is a very prominent example of that because of its low accessibility. To be successful in this field, one must put in a lot of hard work and be willing to travel to obscure places in Africa for exploratory work. This proves to be even harder when you consider that the number of jobs in this field is too small to accommodate every aspiring wildlife photographer. Nevertheless, it can be argued that if an aspiring wildlife photographer pursued a field inundated with jobs such as software engineering, they would not be able to put in as much effort as required to retain that position. Therefore, it is very important to have a passion and interest for the field you're working in to be able to get a job as well as retain it.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that educational institutions should not actively encourage their students to choose fields of study in which jobs are plentiful. As discussed, students should make that choice based on their passion, interest, skill, and the amount of hard work they are willing to put into a field. Ultimately, it would do the students no good if they are able to get a job in a field and then lose it down the line due to lack of performance.""",active,4
1d0xckx,13,2024-05-26,Rant,u/iwannahacku,UoPeople,https://www.reddit.com/r/UoPeople/comments/1d0xckx/rant/,"I am a M.Ed. student at UOPeople, and I am almost done with the courses - to be more specific, I have completed 10 out of the required 13 courses. I just want to rant a bit; don't take this negatively. 

<rant>I am generally disappointed with the quality of my classmates' assignments (which I have to peer-assess). Almost every week, we have the usual forum assignment, a written assignment (2-4 pages) and a portfolio reflection which is marked by our instructor.

* Forum: Like many fellow redditors have mentioned, the use of ChatGPT seems rampant. I am generally ok with students using ChatGPT as a reference. The disappointing thing is that certain classmates don't even bother to clean up the answers given by ChatGPT. I see flattering responses (that could possibly be AI-generated as well) to posts that really deserve to be given fewer than 5/10 marks. I personally spend half a day just to prepare my forum post, but I can tell that some classmates really could not be bothered.
* Written assignments: the standard of written assignments is horrible on average. For example, after having written SO MANY assignments using APA7, I still have classmates making fundamental APA7 mistakes. Basic stuff such as heading formatting, missing page numbers, missing cover page etc. Of course there are well written ones (I always give these gems a perfect score), but they are rare. Most assignments I had to peer-mark don't even meet the bachelor's degree standard where I studied last time, and it's not even a language issue.
* And the group project (worth 25%): OMG. While I don't consider myself a model team mate, there will always be the free-rider. I get poor quality submissions from group members (e.g. slides with no references, references with no URL etc.) 

And I know that most of these classmates who submit poor quality assignments are going to graduate and show off the same qualification on their CV. Sometimes I wonder if I should even indicate this M.Ed. on my CV after I have completed it. The only thing that keeps me going is that I know that I have learnt a lot myself because of the effort I have invested into the program. </rant>

1d1yrxs,1,2024-05-27,A little positivity for those in the struggle,u/Due_Bet3782,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/1d1yrxs/a_little_positivity_for_those_in_the_struggle/,"I know it's hard for a lot of people in tech right now. Honestly, it's hard for a lot of people across the board. 

I thought I'd share my experience with the goal of giving someone some hope for the future.

I am a nontraditional student who went back to school much later in life. Balancing work, family, and school has been a challenge from day one. I've had to work random part-time gigs while taking full course loads and making t-ball practice. My spouse has been wonderful, and I couldn't have done it without them.

I am currently finishing my final course for my BSCS, and, once I graduate, I'll have a full years worth of full-time work experience in the field. Two years ago I ran into one of my former teachers while I was working retail at a local store. She popped up in my LinkedIn feed a few months later, so I added her. Didn't think anything of it. The entire time I was searching like crazy for internships, volunteer work, and  part/full-time jobs. I put in several hundred tailored applications. 

One day she messages me, ""Hey! There is a position opening up at one of the schools in IT, and you should apply!"" I'm thinking, yeah I will but no dice because I'll have to be on campus (an hour away) and doing my own school work during their operating hours - no way this will work out. Additionally, I the little IT experience I have is related to troubleshooting my CS labs - no way they'd want me for this role. Of course, she was super sweet to get up with me, and I couldn't pass up the opportunity at a job, so I applied. And I got an interview.

A week prior to that interview, I had another which went terribly, though I was an excellent candidate for the position. It was entry-level and they trained their applicants from the ground up. Essentially it was an outsourced to rural MSP, so someone with any amount of education and or retail experience was a good fit. My interviewers were not feeling me at all. I forgot to hand them my resume (had them with me but forgot and of course they didn't ask - I know, rookie mistake), and the whole conversation felt kind of forced, borderline hostile. What did come of it was that I realized I needed to prepare better for my next interview and learn from my mistakes.

As I mentioned, I didn't think the school job would work out, but I wanted to give it my all, so I studied hard for this interview. Analyzing the job description, I had ChatGPT quiz me on the concepts and explain/break-down other concepts that I wasn't as familiar with. I noted the VMs I had created for labs and other things I'd troubleshooted, like writing very basic scripts and upgrading old hardware so I could have a real machine to hack. I even looked up the office dress code online and adhered to it for the interview. This way I was neat without being over dressed and fit into the environment.

I went into this interview feeling better prepared, and since I didn't think I'd get the job anyway, I didn't feel as much pressure - after all, I'd still needed to work out my full time university schedule. The atmosphere was much better walking in. What's interesting is an acquaintance  had told me to get in touch with one of my interviewers a few months earlier because they may know of some jobs available in the area. This was completely unrelated to the current role, as this had been almost 6 months prior and the person whose job I was interviewing for had left quite suddenly. I had reached out to the individual in question, but got ghosted, so of course, I figured they hated me. Turns out they were super nice and just weren't on LinkedIn often. So walking in and seeing this person smiling and cracking jokes put me immediately at ease.

They asked me a variety of questions both technical and end user/communication related. I couldn't answer all of them accurately, but I talked through my thought process on everything. It was clear I had a good understanding of the concepts. My security studies helped me a lot with some of these questions. Needless to say, this interview went way better than my last one. I felt good about it, and I remembered my resume - one for each interviewer and myself.

A few days later, I got a call and a job offer. I found out later they hired me because the liked me and I was the only person that seemed prepared. I had been clear with them about my studies from the start and they were willing to work with me within reason. I had also reached out to my professors to make accommodations. I switched one course to another school to take it online, and I scheduled to make hybrid appearances in other classes. I did not wait until the last minute to do this. I was open with all parties from the beginning, showing evidence of my commitment to school and work. One of the courses was my Senior project. Three full months before the course started, I showed the professor that I had made a ton of progress on it with full write ups. I had to jump through many hoops, but in the end I was able to take one course hybrid, one at a different school online, and one online completely - one was already offered online. This made my work load larger, but it was worth it to have a job in the field. In the end, I was able to take exams and make presentations using professional development days from work and some personal time here and there.

  
I did all of this for a contract position that I knew I might lose in a years time. 

  
This past week I found out that I they wanted to extend my employment indefinitely, and I get a raise. I'm so thankful, and I hope that all of you who are looking find something soon. If you refuse to give up, and you give it everything you have, you can make it in any field. Best of luck to all of you from your friend Due\_Bet.",User_deleted,0

Here is what our team discovered during the tests,u/Inside_Rip8782,OriginalityHub,https://www.reddit.com/r/OriginalityHub/comments/1d2frzt/google_bard_gemini_generates_potential_plagiarism/,"Our team is constantly testing texts generated by AI bots in order to see how our detector recognizes the texts generated by AI.

A little background:

Our software consists of multiple features. Its primary purpose at the creation stage was to detect similarities between the texts and other sources available on the Internet and various databases. But reputable software has to cover multiple issues, which include grammar, spelling, authorship verification, etc. When ChatGPT became widely available, we reacted instantly and expanded the possibilities of our checker with the TraceGPT AI detector.

During the testing of texts generated in Google Bard, not only our AI detector flagged issues with content, but also a plagiarism checker showed similarities. Basically, our similarity detector found those similarities in Bard-generated texts that are linked to already existing sources.

Usually, an LLM (Large Language Model) takes separate words (tokens) from different sources and generates texts based on their understanding. Surprisingly, sometimes Google Bard provides sentences that look like a paraphrased version of existing sentences. Or sometimes even exactly matching content, reaching up to 40% potential similarity.

But let’s check the proofs:

We prompted Google Bard to write a 1000-word essay about the American Dream, based on “Great Gatsby,” and in a plagiarism checker, the similarity score was 26.64%.



This is the same sentence, which has slightly different wording, but the idea and word order in this sentence are the same as in the text generated by Bard. The funny thing is that this sentence is about altogether another novel ‘Never Let Me Go”, but this is the wording Bard came up with.





Regarding the AI detector, it showed that this text is 94% AI generated with different probability levels, which makes the response precise.

Another try:

We prompted Google Bard to write a 1000-word essay on “Is Being a Freelancer a Good Alternative to Being a Full-Time Employee?”



And received 36.40% of similarity. The sources are as follows, and it sounds like a paraphrasing of the original source.



Conclusions:

Our AI detector marked text generated by Bard as AI-written, which is correct. Yet a similarity checker also marked sentences as paraphrased text from other sources.

In total, we checked 35 texts, and the similarity percentage was between 5% and 45%; as we saw from these examples, some sentences could be considered plagiarism despite looking like a paraphrased version of sources.

What’s so special about this?

Many educational institutions do not accept papers containing 10% or even 5% similarity, not even AI-generated papers. Even if an educational institution does not have an AI detector to check if a piece was generated by AI, a student still can be in trouble because of possible accusations of plagiarism when submitting a paper generated by Bard.

To sum up, this can cause a lot of trouble to users, not only because many schools consider AI cheating to be academic misconduct. For all that, a student can receive possible accusations of plagiarism with indicated sources in the report.

However, as a human being is a prominent judge of a report, the matches should be checked carefully: we have just seen the cases where the similarity is obvious. If you check the matches in text generated by Bard, the real similarity score will be far below 35%.

I have a website that hosts various types of academic documents (syllabuses, exams, notes, exercises, etc.).

I'm trying to detect those that contain questions (in the form of MCQs), to extract them in a structured format (JSON) for gamification.

The problem is that there are often false positives. Here's an example:

Gemini detects that this is a valid question and that the functions are propositions... Sometimes it also detects bulleted lists in a text as being MCQ propositions.

Here is the current prompt:

`This image contains educational text for university students. Detects whether the text contains clearly detected multiple-choice questions (MCQs), if so detects the questions, propositions and answers (if present) and generates a valid JSON with the following structure: ‘question’, ‘propositions’, ‘answer’ (if populated, otherwise ‘null’). The format of the response must be the same as one of the proposals.Make sure you : Do not add any text. Correct any spelling mistakes. Ignore any other content not related to the MCQ. If the question refers to an image, diagram or any other content outside the document, ignore it. If the document does not contain an MCQ, simply return ‘false’ instead of JSON.`

2. What age group of students is this a problem for?
3. Does ChatGPT address this issue? O.O

Checking my own understanding of the curriculum problem:

1. They get outdated and no one updates them. Or rather it's not updated officially across the board.
2. Some schools have none at all. At most a pace guide.
3. Everyone's context is different and so every teacher needs to adapt it to their context.
4. For those who did bite the bullet and crafted their own, they were never paid for it.
5. Some teachers have the opposite problem where management dictate they follow a fixed approved curriculum.",active,0

The purpose of this post is to discuss the phenomenon of ethical cheating for writing as a learning process in school. Note that truly original content with great value to humanity cannot be created without significant effort, but even when writing such content is the goal, AI certainly has a place in the work.**

***Before you read on, let me clarify that however we define *cheating*, the idea is the same: There are ways to use AI to write essays, stories, reports, reviews and theses that may or may not in theory constitute cheating based on ideological or philosophical beliefs.***

***While there are certain ways to cheat in a bad way, I argue that cheating is such a complex concept that it is best understood as coming in two forms: Good, ethical and pragmatically justified cheating, and bad (“real”) cheating.***

### Background

My goal of this text is to encourage other adults to leverage the inevitable fact that students want to use AI, and they will whether or not we want them to. As intelligent and caring adults, our mission should be to enhance the students’ learning and improve academic integrity. In my opinion, the best way to do this of to simply reframe the problem: The students should definitely cheat! The question is how to cheat properly in a way that leads to transcending beyond the goals of education, becoming objectively more adept at the things we’re supposed to simply know. 

Currently, schools tests the students instead of teaching them. By cheating properly, you actually learn how to be an insanely good and intelligent author. If applied consistently and systematically in a structured way, correct cheating leads to developing extraordinarily advanced reasoning, writing and information processing skills that schools currently are not simply designed to teach anyone.

The reality is that some people understand how to use these tools to cheat, and some don’t. It’s not rocket science, but you have to take the perspective of the professor or teacher to figure out how to actually leverage the capabilities of these tools without undermining the goals of education.

### My suggestions

*These are my general ideas for cheating in a way that is both ethical and practical:*

1. First, realize this: Even if you circumvent the “detection,” there’s a good chance that your teacher or professor might suspect you cheated if they get the subtle feeling that something is not right. This could lead them to question your knowledge on the subject and test you in person to see whether or not you understand what you wrote. If you want to cheat, you have to make them believe that you did the work yourself.

1. Consider discussing the use of AI with your teacher or professor. There’s no reason why any teacher should prohibit the use of AI. There are many ways to use them that are not cheating. This includes spell checking, grammar checking, formatting help, etc. In the case of formatting, AI can use markdown language to quickly create the correct formatting of headings, lists, etc. Also, typographical errors can be fixed, such as the wrong use of different typographically similar quotes. AI can help you quickly understand complex concepts as you read about them. When you read material, you may use AI to input parts of the text and have it explain it for you in different ways. This way, AI actually teaches you something. You may then discuss the topics you’ve learned with your teacher to see if you got it right before actually writing about it. That way, your teacher can see that you’re a learner and not a cheater, and that you realize the importance of learning good AI practices that will boost learning.

1. Don’t use just one AI tool. While ChatGPT is good for writing logically coherent paragraphs, Google Gemini is good for reasoning about complex issues. Have them cooperate to build your knowledge and texts really quickly.

1. If you have a smartphone, I recommend writing parts of your texts on the bus, in your bed, or wherever. This makes your brain actually master the most important parts of your texts and creates a feeling in you that you are actually doing some of the work. Specifically, if you’re an iPhone user, I recommend using the native keyboard and turning on all the writing help features in settings. This way, you’re using exceptionally advanced handheld AI to boost your writing. The text predictions of the iPhone native keyboard are insane if you really analyze how it works. If you write grammatically correct, coherent paragraphs, the keyboard actually knows what the text is about, and some of the word predictions are eerily accurate and relevant when the text deals with a very specific topic.

1. For this one I need to declare that I pay for both ChatGPT plus and Google Gemini Advanced. Each of them is 20 bucks a month or so. So I’m NOT biased in this sense. Anyway: You don’t have to start with ChatGPT. Google Gemini is actually better at creating meaningful and interesting outlines and suggesting improvements. ChatGPT is for, well… Actually, Gemini is better for cheating. That’s the truth. ChatGPT, however, might be used to explain things to you, format text, summarize and structure data, etc., but not for the actual cheating. This is not my opinion; it’s a fact.

1. If you use Gemini from a computer, you can basically write high-quality texts by selecting parts of its output and typing in a box that appears. If you type e.g. “explain” and hit enter, Gemini will expand that specific part of the text, i.e., what you selected, and replace it with longer sentences or even whole paragraphs that make the text incorporate your request. This way, you can avoid writing stuff you don’t understand. Like, it’s impossible to not understand the text if you do this repeatedly. In my opinion, this specific feature is the most potent learning tool I have ever seen. It’s probably underestimated.

1. Know that these tools are not currently able to create a list of references. They inevitably “cheat” themselves by making up references. You can’t trick them. I believe they are not built to actually cheat. Therefore, they are very good at mimicking correct referencing and citation, but they can’t provide the sources and cite them for you. They can’t provide sources for the information they provide because they didn’t use sources to find out what to write. They simply knew it, and they are not equipped with the ability to understand why they know something. This is a fundamental insight that you have to have in order to cheat successfully. There’s a good chance that cheating is detected by realizing that the student’s bibliography didn’t really match the contents of the text. THIS is what can be detected. As other people have pointed out, there’s no way to detect AI use to write a text. However, it’s easy to spot a cheater if the task was to read something and then write about it, and the student hasn’t even handled the files that held the information they refer to.

1. Chat with the chats. This is what they are best at. If you actually chat with them about your work in an intelligent way, together you could come up with great content. They could suggest search queries or works to look into. This way, you can go find the sources that they suggest manually, and then simply upload the sources and have them write the text for you only using the content found in these sources. When doing this, make sure to explicitly instruct them not to search the web and only use the files you provided, and—importantly—always tell them to quote the material so you can manually check that the information actually exists in the material! Here’s a pro tip: if you create a “custom GPT,” you can upload lots of sources to it and uncheck the option “search the web.” This will ensure that the custom GPT only uses the uploaded material.

1. When you build a text, especially if it has many parts, work with one part of the text at the time, BUT always let the models know the context. So if your work is 5 pages long, work with one page at a time, but first paste/upload the entire text so that the model knows what it’s all about. Context is always key when working which these language models. They are built to understand things.

1. Continuously let the models summarize your texts. To do this, always create a new chat first, upload or paste your text and ask it to explain or summarize the text. Pro tip: Always do this two times, in two different chats. In one of the chats you state that the work is another’s, and in the other chat you state that the work is yours. The reply you get will will sometimes heavily depend on what context the model works with. If it’s your texts, it will be more likely to find ways to improve the work. If it thinks that someone else wrote it, it will obviously not suggest improvements. Rather, it will focus on a deeper analysis, finding different ways to interpret and understand the text.

### Concluding remarks

Finally, perhaps the most important insight that we have to internalize is that within a decade, we will experience a phase where a new phenomenon of social division emerges that creates a new layer of social structure, where we start to discern classes based upon what we may call AI proficiency. 

Certainly, in the future, AI will be so advanced and present that such classes will only be determined by large socioeconomic differences in the world. However, during a short period time, there will be a gap between those who did leverage AI in education beyond what schools taught, and those who did not. Let us not be oppressed by arbitrary moral theories about what constitutes ethical education. 

Please feel free to share your thoughts below. A good conversation on this subject is critical to maximizing the potency of these subreddits.

This post is to give people hope that it’s possible to obtain these certs with very little money, and very little time. Keep in mind this is not for everybody, you might not fully retain everything you learned. My motivation was to get these certs as fast as possible so I can get real world experience where I will really learn things. I didn’t want to spend 6-12 months learning information through videos/reading to fully retain it. I want to get the fundamentals down, but more importantly learn through hands on experience.",User_deleted,0

Many months ago I worked on a Custom GPT to help me learn material for my University classes faster. I realized that not many students are willing to pay $20 for access to ChatGPT Pro, so many students wouldn't even be able to benefit from something like this. However, now that OpenAI has allowed all users to use Custom GPTs, this has motivated me to work on this GPT again!

  
You can try it here: 

[https://chatgpt.com/g/g-2CTzVOVLV-learnflowgpt](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-2CTzVOVLV-learnflowgpt)



Throughout the semester, I have figured out how I learn best (it is kind of complicated) and wanted to streamline the process as I believe others can benefit from it. 

The general process: 

1.  Read the content (like a textbook chapter) 
2. Draw a mindmap for the subject
3. Create flashcards to review

I ran into an issue where I would read a chapter from a textbook, have my mindmap, but then would review weeks later and would have a fear of missing something. I find it kind of daunting to open up a textbook in the first place, so I would end up putting off my review sessions. To fix this, I started to incorporate linear note-taking to act as a sort of ""index"" for a chapter. 

  
Now, for everything I learn I would have my mindmap, flashcards, as well as an index of sorts for that material. I didn't want to waste my time typing out these linear notes, so decided to use large language models to do this grunt work for me. I use obsidian, so I wanted the generated notes to incorporate some obsidian (markdown)-specific syntax. 

  
These generated notes look like this in Obsidian:

  
[https://imgur.com/a/eTPI5bK](https://imgur.com/a/eTPI5bK)

These notes were fully generated using LearnFlowGPT, I linked the chat below. They were then directly copy and pasted into Obsidian. 

  
I know some of you are thinking about how stupid it is to ""learn"" from AI, and this is not what this is. I would still do all of the encoding on my own, and would just use LLMs to create the secondary set of notes. 

  
With this out of the way, this is LearnFlow:

# LearnFlowGPT

LearnFlowGPT is a custom GPT designed to streamline the learning process for students (academic or otherwise). Currently, it has three functions:



**1. Note Set Generation (/notes):**

Creates structured notes with titles, keyword tables, diagrams, and summaries. This is not meant to act as your sole set of notes, but rather as a good ""refresher"" or index of the material.

**2. Problem Set Generation (/problem):**

Generates three levels of questions to test understanding. Level 1 questions focus on foundational concepts of whatever you are learning. Level 2 questions cover supplementary details that reinforce foundational concepts. Level 3 questions are considered higher-order questions that typically require more than surface level knowledge of the material to answer correctly. 

It then grades answers, identifies knowledge gaps, and recommends study material.

**3. Flashcard Set Generation (/flashcards):**

Creates flashcards. Follows principles of clarity, conciseness, and card independence.

**4. Question Decomposition /question):**

Breaks down complex questions into smaller parts. Provides step-by-step answers and links to more advanced GPT for difficult questions (the other GPT is a WIP). The other GPT that is currently being worked on will attempt to utilize some basic form of ""Tree of Thought"" to answer questions! 

# How It Works:

* Users provide content and use specific slash commands (/notes, /flashcards, /problem, /question).
* LearnFlowGPT generates the requested material based on detailed instructions.

# Example Chat and Process

Example Chat:  
[https://chatgpt.com/share/31662f58-9a71-40fa-86c5-aad11fce51d0](https://chatgpt.com/share/31662f58-9a71-40fa-86c5-aad11fce51d0)

**Recommended Process:**

You are studying chapter 4 for your Operating Systems Concepts class. The first thing you do is skim the chapter, write down keywords that stick out to you. Then, draw out a mindmap of these keywords. If you come across a keyword you don't know, feel free to research it for up to a minute. The goal is to get a very basic understanding of what you will be studying. 

Then, actually dive into the material. As you read, your mindmap will naturally be expanded. Try not to write too much, simplify the mindmap where you can by grouping keywords together and relating groups. As you read the chapter, make note of anything you believe would be better off on a flashcard than a mindmap (formulas, facts). Now that you have finished reading the chapter, and have some sort of mindmap, its time to use AI to help your learning process.   
 

First, access LearnFlowGPT:  
[https://chatgpt.com/g/g-2CTzVOVLV-learnflowgpt](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-2CTzVOVLV-learnflowgpt)

  
Then, type /notes and attach the material you are studying (either by copy and pasting or attaching the chapter as a PDF). Hit enter and LearnFlowGPT will return to you a beautiful set of Obsidian-ready notes. Read these notes, and modify anything you think needs to be modified, or add any details you believe would be important.  (remember, you already have studied the material from the source)

Now, it's time to test your understanding. Type /problem. The GPT will generate a problem set for you to answer. Return your answers to it, and then see what questions you missed. Use the identified knowledge gaps to focus your revision on the concepts you are struggling with. 

Finally, run the /flashcards command and review them. I personally use Anki, and just copy and paste the text into a text file and import it into Anki. Of course, I review each card as not every card will be a good card for me! 

# Try for free!

Since all users now have access to GPTs, you do not need to be a Pro member to use a custom GPT such as this one. Give it a try:

[https://chatgpt.com/g/g-2CTzVOVLV-learnflowgpt](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-2CTzVOVLV-learnflowgpt)

# Who is this for?

Anyone who considers themselves a student! That can mean that you are a high school student, university student, or just a passionate individual self-teaching something. 

Warning: make sure you are actually learning. It is easy to fall into the trap of just attaching the content you should be learning into a LLM and saying you ""learned it"". You are cheating yourself by doing this, instead, use these tools to help you learn faster.

I do not go to any of the universities where you'd find these top programs (MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, CMU, etc.) if that makes a difference.

I just finished my freshman year of undergrad and I'm taking a couple courses over the summer before the start of my sophomore year. I'm double majoring in CS (BS) and Math (BS) with a minor in linguistics. I entered with 61 credits of Gen. Ed. courses from high school, and it is unclear if these are included on my final GPA, so I'm going to assume they won't be for the sake of argument. My GPA at the end of my freshman year was a 3.6. I currently work part time at a computational linguistics lab working on language disambiguation toolkits for large language models, and have been for about six months now. I am making novel contributions to research and picking up an increasing amount of responsibility, but it is unclear if I will be named as an author (if so, my name would be lower on the list). I'm looking at a prospective honors thesis that I ultimately would author and publish in an undergraduate journal, but that is still in the air.

Moving forward, I have my courses mapped out in a way that I \*think\* will be manageable and keep my GPA sufficient. Once the project I'm working on at the lab is complete I will attempt to jump to a different group that is more similar to the research I want to do long term and is led by a more acclaimed researcher who's recommendation will be heavier (from what I can tell her strongest connection is MIT). Outside of research, I have an internship at a private research company lined up next summer if I choose to take it, but I'm unsure if that would be the right move.

Would sticking with a single lab be worth more than jumping around even if it is comparatively weaker? Would working in a company environment be weaker than staying in a university one? Any general tips to point me in the right direction?

Any input would be greatly appreciated, thanks!!",active,1
