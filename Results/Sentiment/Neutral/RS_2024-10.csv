1ftcnn5,6,2024-09-30,Entire Section Seems Apathetic - What Am I Doing Wrong? ,u/Uptightcatlady,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1ftcnn5/entire_section_seems_apathetic_what_am_i_doing/,"Context: This is my first year teaching full-time, though not my first time teaching. I teach composition at a rural CC with a 5/5 load. I have 4 sections of English 101 this semester. They are all in-person. 

While each of my classes has their own quirks and issues, I have one class that just seems incredibly strange. None of the students act like they care to be there, and many of them just outright don't listen to instructions, tune out during lecture, etc. Of course, there are always a handful that do this in every class every semester. But this particular section seems to have a majority of students just straight up not listening and not doing their work. I can only think of about three students in this class who actually seem to care at all, and even that group has given me problems on a more minor scale. 

It may help to add that the class includes several athletes and ESL students. On the surface, I try not to let the demographics of the class influence my teaching, but I can't help but feel like it might be playing a role? Many of the students are just turning in absolute garbage written by what I suspect is ChatGPT (and those who are doing this are not currently passing the course). I have a very high number of D's and F's in this class, and the students just seem completely apathetic. Many of them only come once a week or once every two weeks, most of them turn work in late (despite a 10% deduction per day), and many do not follow instructions. Despite mandatory tutoring, feedback on drafts, in-class conferences, and giving them time to work in-class, I just cannot seem to get them to care about their shitty grades. 

Anyway, I guess I'm wondering to what extent this is normal, and what I can do to help mitigate such a high level of apathy? My other classes are nowhere near this level of bad. Other classes have a few problem students, but nowhere near as many as this particular section. I teach generally the same content to each of my 101s because we have strict departmental requirements for what we are supposed to assign and how we are supposed to grade 101 students (due to accreditation); however, I have tried to vary my instruction so that it is a bit more explicit for this class given the demographic. It does not seem to be working, lol. In fact, it might be getting worse. 

What can I do to help this class of seemingly apathetic students who won't do their work and won't ask for help? ",active,6

Despite how people may say ChatGPT makes mistakes and is not to be trusted, it hasn't had any problem for me. Plus it helps me understand an entire lecture in 3 seconds. 'Chatgpt, I didn't get that, explain it to me like a preschooler'. I've never been good at my maths, I was always into the other subjects. It's good to have a tutor that teaches me faster than any teacher could.  
But what are the drawbacks of this? What's the monkey's paw  
I feel guilty for 'cheating' but honestly, if ChatGPT is cheating then tutoring is cheating as well. They're both intelligent figures that tell you to try it by yourself first and then they give you an explanation on how to do it right (granted that's if you're trying the question first before GPTing it) (Which I'm doing).  
Also I rather cheat than get an F.  Again, is it really cheating if I'm reading a lecture's worth of paragraphing and solving the problem that is of trying to understand what ChatGPT is explaining to me? It's just a teacher. ",User_deleted,0
1ftkh2t,234,2024-10-01,Problems That I Encountered While Trying To Make A Game With Some Friends,u/Single_Investment64,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ftkh2t/problems_that_i_encountered_while_trying_to_make/,"Hello, I just wanted to share my mistakes and experiences in this post, maybe getting some feedback/criticism about it. Also sorry for grammar mistakes since English isn't my native language.

Firstly I think I should introduce myself a little bit, before the main theme of the post. I am a medical student in a different country then USA, currently in my last year of school. When I was in highschool, I caught interest in programming and started it as a hobby and it quickly turned into a passion. Since then, I made a couple of toy projects, a couple of abandoned not-toy projects and a reaaly big/time consuming fullstack project when I was part-timing in a job. Still to this day, I am working on my personal projects as a hobby in my little to no free-time. 

Let's get to the main topic then. Some months ago, in the beginning of April, I was chatting with a long friend of mine from my middle school. Let's refer him as ""Friend A"". He is currently doing masters on game design and also finished a game design major. He is currently unemployed so he suggested making a game with me and I gave a serious though about it. I've made a toy game with Unity while watching Brackeys tutorials in the past and I had a lot of fun. I also am somewhat experienced in coding. *Also I should note that getting instant feedback about what you make/code while making games gives a lot of satisfaction to me. Ah, and i thought maybe I can learn a lot of valuable things from my friends about making games.*

Here is the first mistake I made. I trusted my friend's knowledge without checking his previous experiences making games, and I trusted his major. I mean working with a person that getting a masters degree on game design is a great thing I thought. I was wrong :)

It seemed he had this though in his mind for a while. We talked about making a game that has a quality at least worth to publish on Steam. Then we came to the team. I told him that I can handle the coding part, most of it, but I don't have any knowledge on game design and game art, that he could do the game design part but we strongly need a person to handle the 2D art part. He agreed and we found a friend (Friend B) that can do a simple 2D art for us. Also this friend has a friend that could help in the game design aspects (Friend C), also majoring a game design degree. I said ok, then we got to planning.

  
Since we don't have any real experience making games, we decided on a simple roguelike  game with some money management properties. Small, simple, 2D pixel graphics. Then we decided our roles. The game designer friends will handle the game design and planning (they also offered help with coding, I said okay for the times when I would be unavailable due to school), I will handle the major coding part, the first mentioned friend's girlfriend and my other friend will handle the 2D art part. We were total of 5 people, I had high hopes.

  
Having unrealistic expectations and high hopes for this team was my second biggest mistake.

  
When we started making the game, I figured my teammates have no knowledge/experience working as a team. They never even used version control systems like git, GitHub, they don't know how to communicate and synchronize (idk if this is the correct term). So first, I taught them about simple things like this. No problem. 

  
Then we came to planning part. We brainstormed about a couple weeks. Everytime we make a discord call, Friend A has never have serious ideas about game itself, not a thing like ""I think this should be like this, we can't make this like this, this feature should be in our game."" but more like ""Hey guys, I heard about a few incubation centers for indie game developers. "". Friend A's girlfriend always mutes herself, never says anything. Friend B says okay to all things, Friend C says we should start a company. There is no idea coming from anyone. Then I talked about what kind of game was in my mind and told them. They accepted all of my ideas, never adding anything to it. I said okay, that's fine. I asked Friend A and Friend C to document what we talked about all these talks on Discord. To this day, we don't have any written things about our game's style, features, etc. Also, man, please put some ideas. If I had a solid game idea in my mind, I've probably already started to make it.

When there is no documents about the design, any plan, I don't know what to code. So I asked about a GDD, not like a huge one. I asked one like goes through general aspects of our ideas, I also asked them to open issues on github to give me opinions about what to code. The documentation part is still wonders but they created some issues. We started to work on them.

  
For the first 3 issues, they were player movement, one melee enemy and one ranged enemy. Friend A and C wanted to make melee and ranged enemies so I completed the movement scripts. Then Friend A asked for help for melee enemy so I helped him and waited for more open issues to come since we don't have any written requirements/documents about what the game should be like. Friend C finished his issue and sent it to me for a review. His ranged enemy worked wonderfully, there was some small/unsignificant errors on his part no problem, I told him about those things and he understood and thanked me. Then Friend A said he finished his issue. Sent me to a review, nothing works. I look at the code, the code is a mess. I asked him ""Did you write this code by yourself using some tutorials or did ChatGPT wrote all of it?"" He says chatgpt. I fixed the code for him, tought him about how he should have written this code for it to work.  He said ""I always use ChatGPT, it always worked! IDK about what I did wrong this time but I will not stop using chatGPT! I even made my graduation project using ChatGPT!"" lol. He doesn't even know what a single line of his code does. I always use github copilot as a helper so I am not against LLMs in coding but for someone who doesn't know how to code, I guess using LLMs for everything is a big no no.  There was a couple issues about Friend A like this so I told my friends that I will hande \*all of the coding part\* myself, they accepted it. Friend A wrote really shitty code that it was faster if o wrote it myself then refactoring his code.

  
After some time, i closed like 10 issues. Then we went to a 20 day long overseas vacation with a group. Friend A was also in this group so our progress for the game is halted. When we returned from vacation, i closed all issues on github and asked for news. One week passed, no issues, two week passed, no issues. On the third week returning from vacation, i gathered the team for meeting. I told them I have nothing to work with, I have to know what to code, there is no progress on the design part of the game since the first meeting, that they need to try to pay more attention. Also I asked for a project plan. Maybe a simple GDD. Maybe a simple list of the game features. Friend C says he is leaving. He says he expected more from Friend A. Yes, he was right but he as a game designer didn't do anything about the design. He left. Okay, we didn't lose anything from him leaving. Since then i completed like 30 issues, some of them are opened by myself. Still there is no documentation. We can't see ahead. We don't have a clue what to do next. If I could have handled all the game design and game art parts of a game, with the coding knowledge I have, I could have made the whole game by myself too but neither i have time for those parts nor any knowledge/ability. 



I again asked Friend A for a project plan, 3 days later he sent me a single .png with a 10-11 orange colored bars named Gannt chart. Nothing more. Then I left too.

  
I guess in our universities' game design departmens, they don't teach students anything or my beloved Friend A somehow passed his lessons with cheating/copying/chatGPT. From the start of the project, he played LoL for stable 8 hours a day. Probably has a worked on the game like a total 10-15 hours. I wasted a lot of time doing hours of pointless coding sessions, we still don't have any assets for the game. Everything is a placeholder box. Later I learned Friend A didin't checked any finished mechanics even once. Maybe he didn't opened the game folder even once. What did I wasted my tens of hours for?

  
So I learned if I wanted to start a serious project, I have to find serious people as at least as me. Also please, do not trust friends. In my mind, game design degree is reduced to nothing, choose whom to work with with a great consideration.",active,249

I’m currently taking Biology HL ( grade 12 ) i have almost 7 months left till my externals. I’m aiming for a 7, but I feel like I’m just an average student in bio. In my final school exams, I usually score around 30/40, so I know I need to work harder for the IB.

I typically take notes based on the IB guide, and I’ve started restudying the material I covered in Grade 11. My teacher mentioned that the best way to get a 7 is to memorize the content, but I’m not quite sure how to do that effectively. My usual study method is studying the content ( from my notes ) first and then solve some past papers like revision village or the question bank, but I’m looking for a resource—like a book or notes—that covers everything I need to memorize especially from the guide ig like actually everyything. i just think it'd be easier to just memorize already made notes or whatever instead of making my own but I'm always scared to trust someone's resources o the ones online like what if they missed something.

I’m definitely planning to solve past papers and write down what I remember, but if anyone has tips or resources that ACTUALLY HELPED them get a 6 or 7, I’d really appreciate it!

I also let ChatGPT help me plan my studies, so my plan for the next 30 weeks is to focus on one new subtopic each day ( that i take in class ), and on the weekends, I go over two subtopics from Grade 11 like restudy and solve pp. Right now, I’m using Kognity for my studies, but honestly it suckks it has too much info in some subtopics and in some too little. btw i have a total of 40 subtopics like A1.1,A1.2 .

1fv5g33,15,2024-10-03, From Dropping Out of School to Launching an AI Startup: My 15-Year Journey,u/sgasser88,SideProject,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1fv5g33/from_dropping_out_of_school_to_launching_an_ai/,"Fifteen years ago, I was a pretty lost student. School just didn’t click for me, and I eventually dropped out. Fast forward to now, and I’m running my own AI startup. It’s been a long and unexpected journey, and I thought I’d share some of that with you all—just in case anyone else out there feels like they're not following the ""traditional"" path.

# School Didn’t Work, But Coding Did

To be honest, I hated school. I wasn’t good at it, and it didn’t feel like it was leading me anywhere. But then I stumbled into coding, and everything changed. I got into PHP and started learning frameworks like Symfony and Laravel on my own. That was really the beginning of everything for me.

Here’s a rough timeline of how things played out:

* **2009–2012**: Web Developer at R3 GIS – My first coding job.
* **2012–2020**: Backend Web Developer at ADDITIVE – I was the first developer, building the infrastructure and core software from the ground up.
* **2019**: Launched *AutoIdle* as a side project – My first step into entrepreneurship.
* **2020–2022**: Team Lead at ADDITIVE – Managed the development team and oversaw product builds.
* **2022–2024**: Head of Software at ADDITIVE – Led the entire software department.
* **2024**: Launched *MailWizard* and left ADDITIVE to focus on it full-time.

Looking back, it’s been a long, winding road with a lot of trial and error. It took me a while to realize that the traditional route wasn’t for me, but finding something I actually enjoyed—coding—completely shifted my mindset.

# The Road of Many (Failed) Side Projects

Before *AutoIdle*, there were a lot of failed side projects. I spent years trying out different ideas, hoping one of them would take off, but none of them ever really got users. I built *Zebrello*, a news reader that was supposed to deliver articles based on your interests. There was also a recipe app I thought could help organize meal planning, and an app to sell used items on multiple platforms like eBay and Facebook Marketplace. But despite my efforts, these projects never made it beyond a small group of supportive friends.

Honestly, it was frustrating. I'd work on these side projects during weekends and vacations, only to hit roadblocks when it came to getting them out there. But I learned something from each attempt, even if they didn’t go anywhere.

One thing I’ve found: vacations and stepping away from work are often when the best ideas come to me. In fact, *AutoIdle* itself was born during a Christmas vacation when I finally cleared my head and saw things from a new perspective.

# Turning a Side Project Into Something More: AutoIdle

When I built *AutoIdle* in 2019, I didn’t expect much. It was a Heroku add-on that idles unused apps to save resources. The idea was simple—useful for some people, but not groundbreaking. I threw it together over a holiday break, and at first, it seemed like just another side project that might fizzle out.

But over time, *AutoIdle* slowly started gaining traction. It wasn’t an overnight success, but people found it valuable, and by 2021, it had started turning a profit. It wasn’t huge, but it was enough to show me that I could build something people would pay for. After years of failed attempts, *AutoIdle* was the first side project that felt like it had real potential.

More than anything, it gave me the confidence to keep going and the belief that I could build something on my own terms.

# The AI Experiment That Turned Into MailWizard

Earlier this year, I was getting really fed up with how much time I spent writing emails. I tried using some AI tools, but nothing really worked the way I wanted. So, I figured, why not just build something myself? That’s how *MailWizard* started.

At first, I just saw it as another side project, but the more I worked on it, the more I felt like this could be something bigger. I eventually decided to quit my job and focus on it full-time. It was scary as hell, but sometimes you just have to take that leap.

# The AI Learning Curve: From GPT-4 to Claude

When I started building *MailWizard*, I was using GPT-4 like a lot of people, but after a while, I realized it wasn’t the right fit for what I needed. That’s when I found out about Claude from Anthropic, and after testing it, I made the switch. It’s been a better fit for the app, and it’s helped me take the project to the next level.

I actually wrote a blog series about the whole process, if you’re curious about the details: [From GPT-4 to Claude: Building MailWizard](https://mailwizard.ai/blog/gpt4-to-claude-building-mailwizard-solo-developers-journey).

# The Toughest Part Isn't the Code

One thing I’ve learned is that the technical stuff, while challenging, isn’t the hardest part. What’s really tough is marketing and getting users. With *AutoIdle*, Heroku’s marketplace handled a lot of the visibility. But with *MailWizard*, it’s all on me to find users and get the word out. It’s been a huge learning curve, and I’m still figuring it out.

# Reflecting on 15 Years

If you had told me 15 years ago, when I was failing at school, that I’d be running an AI startup one day, I wouldn’t have believed you. I’m still learning, still figuring things out, but the fact that I’ve gotten this far feels like a win in itself.

At this point, *AutoIdle* provides me with a stable income, which is a relief, but my main focus is on growing *MailWizard* and seeing where I can take it.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that you don’t have to follow the ""traditional"" path to succeed. If you're into tech but feel like you're not fitting into the usual career boxes, it's totally possible to carve your own way. Just keep going, keep learning, and don’t be afraid to take risks. You never know where it might lead.

That’s it! Just thought I’d share in case anyone else is on a similar journey. Would love to hear if anyone else has made the leap from side project to full-time!",active,21

Major Factor in selecting my college is amount of aid I will get, I want to ED in a college which gives out generous aid for international students. My parents can at max pay $16K USD per year for my studies, other I will manage via education loan and working on campus and in my startup. 

Here's a sheet I used to know about AID offered: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQnvgb3sTpNvOijvcrALM2JrTF7o4ydrjeSVpe5CnUZoNLFhywcMnKxVX5E4lF0UVa1x1oJpSHhVmDL/pubhtml?gid=689728477&single=true](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQnvgb3sTpNvOijvcrALM2JrTF7o4ydrjeSVpe5CnUZoNLFhywcMnKxVX5E4lF0UVa1x1oJpSHhVmDL/pubhtml?gid=689728477&single=true)

Questions I'd love to get answered:

* I understand Northwestern and Johns Hopkins are crazy with acceptances, since I would also be applying for Aid, are there any chances of getting in?
* Where should I ED into where I get aid also?
* Any schools I should look into adding/removing? I was thinking of adding UMich as a reach
* Can I get into atleast one of my reaches? I don't really have high expectations. I see incredibly talented students getting rejected so I really have no clue.
* Do I submit my 3 on ap physics?

*Throw Away Account Because All My Friends Have My Original Account*

I (25F) am studying for my MBBS (Medicine) and recently married my boyfriend (27M) of five years. We had planned to get married after he could move to the States for work, so I could focus on finishing my degree and starting my career without traditional pressures. My in-laws come from a very orthodox background where men are expected to work and women stay home. To avoid those expectations, we wanted to wait.

However, my parents emotionally blackmailed me into marrying earlier, using lines like “What will people think?” and “You’re embarrassing us by delaying.” So, I gave in and married earlier than we wanted.

Now, I’m living with my husband’s joint family while continuing my studies. This includes not just my husband and me, but also his parents, his aunt and uncle, his brother (cousin) and sister-in-law, and his grandmother. My father-in-law, mother-in-law, and brother-in-law have been incredibly supportive—they treat me like their own daughter and sister, and they respect that I’m pursuing my medical degree. But my SIL (30F), BIL’s wife, along with my FIL’s brother and his wife, and especially my husband’s grandma (80F), have been making things difficult for me.

SIL seems jealous that I’m still studying, and she constantly throws passive-aggressive remarks my way, saying things like, “Not everyone can be lucky enough to have people support their little career dreams.” It’s clear she resents that I have ambitions outside of marriage, and that jealousy shows every chance she gets. But grandma is the worst. She keeps pushing the idea that I should prioritize being a good wife over my education. It’s always something like, “Women who don’t focus on their home will never be respected.” I’ve been holding it in for months, but last night was the breaking point.

I came home exhausted after a long day at the hospital, and grandma immediately started up with her usual criticisms. But this time, she crossed the line. She said, “Why are you wasting your time studying so much? No one’s going to respect you for thinking you’re better than your husband’s family. You’re just trying to make yourself feel important. Maybe that’s why your parents forced you to marry—they knew you’d fail otherwise.”

That comment was the last straw. I snapped and yelled at her. I told her she had no right to speak to me that way and that I wasn’t going to give up my education or dreams just because she had outdated views about a woman’s role. My husband, to his credit, immediately backed me up, telling his grandma to stop, but she just kept going. My FIL, MIL, and BIL tried to calm things down, but it was a mess.

After the fight, my husband didn’t say anything to me. He just stayed by my side, which I appreciated, but I felt guilty about causing such a big scene. I figured things would calm down after that, but a little while later, my SIL came into the room with her usual toxic energy. She said, “You know, you really embarrassed us all today. Just because you’re ‘educated’ doesn’t mean you can disrespect an elder. Maybe you should start focusing on being a wife instead of a student—it’s not like you’re going to work after all this, right?” Her words stung, and it’s clear she enjoys seeing me upset.

It Currently 2:40 am and I’m torn. I do feel bad for losing my temper, especially at an elderly woman, but grandma’s words were so hurtful. I’ve been dealing with so much emotional pressure from both sides of the family. I just couldn’t hold it in anymore, I feel I may have crossed a line and ruined my husbands relationship with his grandma.

Also my english is bad so I used chatgpt to improve my writing.

1fwbmw6,11,2024-10-04,Ideas to make AGI,u/greenray009,ArtificialInteligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1fwbmw6/ideas_to_make_agi/,"Hello! I’m a 4th-year computer science student with a background in intelligent systems, machine learning, and a bit of deep learning, graphics computing, and data mining. I’ve noticed a lot of hype around AI, but it seems that most of the focus is on scaling up existing models like transformers or neural networks (RNN, CNN, ANN), which largely mimic human neural systems.

While we’ve seen exciting developments with generative AI models such as GANs, VAEs, and Diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion), I feel these approaches still feel lacking to me or they fall short. The main issue is that they’re inherently biased due to the datasets they’re trained on and the architecture itself. To truly move towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), I think we need to make fundamental leaps in our understanding of knowledge representation and intelligence itself.

One area I find particularly intriguing is the role of tokenization in building large language models (LLMs). By assigning weights and embeddings to words, we create a form of context representation, which is a step in the right direction. But even with this progress, it’s clear that our models are just approximations - that they don’t have a real *understanding* of the world.

From what I’ve read in some research papers, one proposed path to AGI is to map and mimic a person’s brain at a much deeper level, incorporating elements of consciousness and self-awareness. However, this is more speculative and far from feasible at the moment. To achieve true AGI, I believe we need a new paradigm—a breakthrough in our understanding of intelligence that goes beyond merely scaling up neural networks or refining architectures.

My gut suggests that companies should focus more on the field of knowledge representation and transfer. Basically going back to the basics of information theory. And I think some of the techniques related to this are applied to deep learning but I felt like we needed more like a breakthrough.

This is why I suspect we might be heading towards another AI winter. Historically, when AI research failed to produce expected breakthroughs, it led to reduced funding and enthusiasm like in the early 70s I guess. We might see this again unless a revolutionary discovery occurs. But I’m curious to hear others’ thoughts on this. Do you think we’re close to such a paradigm shift, or are we still stuck at the stage of refining what we already know?",active,13

I’m aware there have been quite a few similar posts to this recently and that it’s frustrating to see and to think we’re asking qualified teachers to do our research for us; it’s frustrating for us to have this as a requirement.

 I am a Statistics 1st year undergrad student (have not started classes yet).I have spent last 3-4 months on machine learning.


 What I learned is: 

 Python
 Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn
 Data preprocessing + feature engineering
 Data visualization
 Machine Learning Algorithms
 ML metrics, hyperparameter tuning etc. 

 Learned from:
 1)Machine Learning specialization (includes 3 courses)- By Stanford on Coursera
 2) 100 days of machine learning (playlist)-By CampusX on Youtube 

 3)Machine Learning with Python and Scikit- Learn-Full course(18 hours)- By FreeCodeCamp.org on Youtube 

 I will learn more in the future + I am thinking of revising what I have learned and doing projects on kaggle. 

 Problem:
 The problem is that I didn't learn math and statistics separately for machine learning.
 I do understand how most of the algorithms work but have skipped all the mathematical proofs . I know scikit learn for the applications of the algorithms, but I find it difficult to build them from scratch. 
 Besides, in most cases I cannot hardcode Python, I have to take help of chatgpt. 

 The things I seek advice on are:
 1) Should I learn Stats or Maths before starting doing projects? 

 2) Should I learn to build algorithms from scratch? (Eg: linear regression, logistic regression, xgboost etc) 

 3) What can I do to improve hardcoding? 

 4) What or how many projects I should do? 

 5) On what,I should more focus right now?

1) clearly AI generated essay and emails in which the students admits to   
2) using ChatGPT to create examples in a personal narrative (!) (that was not all ChatGPT did, but okay)   
3) admits that sources were used but were not documented (hastily throws a Works Cited at me---still more questions about why that's in a narrative essay, and still constitutes academic dishonesty for not citing sources in the first place)   
4) student finally admits that the paid version of Grammarly did all the writing, so that's probably why it sounds like AI (because it *is*)

The chair: well, I can see that the student has a passing grade so far. Will assigning a 0 mean that she won't pass the class? If so, can you use this as a teaching moment and reassign her the essay?

Bruh, the student admitted three times that they didn't write the assignment and tried to lie about it, and you want them to pass the class? Yeah ... not the sort of teaching job I was looking for here. 

Not sure if anyone needs this context, but, yes, students have had academic honesty drilled into them in the first six weeks, which also includes a lengthy lecture on using online tools to write for them.

A kid today stole another kid’s hat and then ran through my room and threw a stool to the ground behind him. I gave him the textbook assignment right away. I followed through. 

He threw the textbook down on the desk and started yelling at me that it was so unfair and he shouldn’t have to do it. I calmly explained that he could not yell at me and that it was so inappropriate to yell at a teacher. He then leaned back and told me he wouldn’t do the assignment and that I couldn’t make him.

I agreed and told him that it was worth the weight of his original assigned project and that he would just have to take a zero. 

I gave one to another student who pushed someone. He began telling me why he should be allowed to chatgpt his response. I explained again that the assignment was on paper written by hand without the use of Chromebooks. He started yelling at me.

I went home crying today. I wish they were not in my class. I don’t know what to do other than try to be positive again on Monday and stand firm in the decision to assign that work. But I also went home crying because I feel like the rest of my class is suffering over two students who can’t get their behavior in check.

   although I spent a lot of time writing the prompt words, because in order to derive these formulas I needed to integrate knowledge from multiple papers, but the latest ai agent's information is hot, I think everything I do now can be automated by having a powerful ai agent and then collecting the information from the papers I provide him with and then automatically deriving and completing the code according to my instructions, if this technology matures in the next few years, I think everything I've done so far can be done in less than an hour, so where is the value in that for me?

   Also I'm learning C++ now and in the future I want to become a programmer in the future, but I think AI can drastically reduce the number of programmers in the future, AI has powerful computing power, almost unlimited memory and powerful enumeration and almost limit-less chain of thoughts, I think this AI will be able to outperform human beings in writing C++ code without memory leaks and high concurrency C++ codes, this AI will be able to learn all the code bases and all the coding experiences in the world. AI can't do it now, but what about 5 years from now? transformer architecture was proposed in 2017 and then 5 years later there was an explosion of AI applications like chatgpt, who knows what will happen in the next 5 years?

It is foreseeable that with the rapid development of AI, the importance of knowledge will become less and less, some people may say that the results of the AI still need to be checked by human beings, but fewer and fewer human beings are needed,  And now that AI is already an asset-heavy industry, massive GPU cluster are more important than human resources, and if AGI is born, what will this mean for countries that don't have AGI? I've already thought about it, first there will be massive unemployment then all the foreign exchange reserves will flow into the big foreign tech companies, then there will be total collapse and famine, a lot of people will die in the process and then others will become slaves of the big companies because these people don't have any economic value any more, I don't know what skills I should learn right now, it's likely that my programming skills may be rendered useless in a few years, I'd like to learn blue-collar but I have nearsightedness and astigmatism, I can't see even close things when I take off my glasses, I don't know if I can adapt to drastic exercise, maybe it's a good idea to kill myself when AGI is born or my skills are completely obsolete, I bet there won't be a UBI for a few decades and for those countries that haven't gotten a handle on AI they'll be even less likely to have a UBI

This one student used AI to craft their paper and did not even bother to format according to the template given or check the citations. 3 out of 5 citations were completely fabricated out of the air and the work was nowhere close to the template. After receiving this 0, the student emailed me. This email came not from their institutional email, not the LMS system,  but from their personal email. (Think gmail/aol/yahoo). But what really set me over the edge was that this email was created using ChatGPT and asked how they could improve their paper and thus their grade. That this student ""held a sincere commitment to their studies"" and wanted to make sure they were getting graded fairly. All generated bullshit. 

How in the holy hell am I supposed to critique a work that you yourself did not even write? How can you genuinely press send on an email that details your ""commitment to study"" when you didn't write the paper or the email?

“It is understood that AI programs have become popular among students. However, you should note that all AI generative tools are prone to making up incorrect facts and fake citations, and image/art generation tools

the development of your work, you will be responsible for any inaccurate, biased, offensive, or otherwise unethical content you submit regardless of whether it originally comes from you or an AI tool. If you use an AI tool, its contribution must be credited in your submission. The use of an AI tool without
acknowledgement is cheating and constitutes a violation of the University’s Code of Academic Integrity.”

1g57nfd,6,2024-10-16,A direct approach to understanding CS employment,u/I-am-ALIVE--,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1g57nfd/a_direct_approach_to_understanding_cs_employment/,"

First and foremost, for about 20 years, there was an extraordinarily high demand for computer science majors. In fact, this demand was so high that coding camps popped up across the country.

At one point, coding was the best way for people to get out of homelessness. Coding camps in the Bay Area would accept homeless individuals who went from being homeless to making $80,000 in six months.

This could be referred to as the high point of the market.

Then came the grifters—a bunch of people promising this kind of prosperity to gullible individuals.

This includes people like ""Profit with JavaScript."" Some of these people promised that you could make six figures just by learning HTML or JavaScript, leading to a flood of low-level coders entering the market.

By the way, pretty much all of those jobs can now be automated with AI, so the low-skill positions in the the west have been heavily impacted and can now be automated or outsourced offshore.

This caused a major changein the low-level computer science job market around 2022.

This outcome was inevitable—those repetitive jobs are now easily handled by artificial intelligence. Unfortunately, people who bought into the idea that they could make six figures in three months were completely misled. Many of these low-level positions were also internships, leaving many college students and graduates struggling to get internships, as the entry-level roles that used to provide a way in have disappeared.

This issue is compounded by the fact that someone with a PhD in computer science in India can be paid $25,000 a year. This is not to suggest that the work is equivalent to that of a Western coder—such comparisons won’t be made, nor is this meant to encourage toxic arguments in the comment section. Discussions around this topic often devolve into accusations of racism, resulting in unproductive debates that should be avoided.

Regardless of how high-quality the overseas work may be, the reality is that the competition for computer science jobs has become fierce. Most of these jobs can be done remotely, meaning an American who needs to earn $150,000 to survive (given how absurd the cost of living in this country has become) is competing with someone willing to do the same job for as little as $15,000. This is not to say the two workers are equal, but the competition is real, and most CEOs will opt for the cheaper employee.

Another major factor is artificial intelligence. Whether AI will fully automate these jobs or not, the promise of automation has led many companies to reduce hiring, hoping to save money by using large language models to replace significant portions of the workforce and increase profits.

Whether this will actually materialize remains to be seen. Regardless, the possibility has already encouraged companies to scale back hiring.

The final factor is increasing investor hesitancy due to fraud. Scandals like the Theranos debacle, along with other overhyped promises that never materialized, have made investors more cautious. Many have pulled back their money, demanding profits from companies that were never profitable. This has resulted in reduced hiring, as there is now less free capital to support bloated workforces.

Taken together, these four factors have created significant challenges in the West. It’s a nightmare situation for many tech workers or aspiring tech workers. For those just entering the industry from college, landing a job is not impossible, but the competition is fierce—and it may require some serious butt-kissing to succeed.

There it is—a streamlined, direct, no-BS overview of the situation.

I knew I had to make up a good rep as my predicted grades were in my teachers' hands I worked tirelessly and my school grades were improved slightly, which somehow made my teachers happy. So I was working towards this dream in secrecy of my parents. I prepared my essay, dug through old extracurricular certificates or anything extra to mention.

I'm working with carpentry students, and I need them to understand the formula for finding the area of a triangle: 1/2 base × height.

What I’m noticing is that they’re calculating base × height and then dividing by two, which is essentially finding the area of a rectangle and then halving it. We did a few examples today, and they all got the correct answers.

ChatGPT explained that both methods are equivalent. When students multiply the base by the height first and then divide by two, they are performing the same calculation as 1/2 × base × height. This approach is more intuitive because it follows a simple multiplication and division process. As long as they consistently divide by two, either method gives the correct result.

Here’s where I’m a bit confused: Is there a difference in dividing just the base or dividing the whole calculation by two? Math was never my strong point, and I’ve told the learners I’ll help them figure out if their approach is correct for pricing.

This is important for gables on houses since they often have different cladding (like cedar feature cladding), and accurate pricing is key.

Recently, I have been working on an Llama 3.1 and Ollama based tutoring system for my research project. In our design, we have 3 agents (or as I understand them) with their own system prompts describing tasks, behaviour and other sets of instructions. TeacherBot, QuestionBot and EvaluatorBot. Currently my intention is they should work sequentially, more like a  *Teach-Quiz-Evaluate-Repeat* cycle.

One of the key factor that we want to introduce is **Progressive Difficulty**, which is in short to gradually introduce complex lessons on a particular topic. Just like a human teacher would teach 1D matrix, then 2D and then more complex stuff based on his/her interaction and performance evaluation of the student being taught. 

My current challenge is to how to prompt the LLM to introduce such manners, where it will understand the student performance and level up the next complex lessons. I have a plan to invoke the mentioned cycle in the 2nd paragraph to understand the student's current situation via the Evaluatorbot, based on the interaction with QuestionBot. Thus I could tell the TABot to upgrade or downgrade the lesson to teach in the next cycle.

My supervisor asked me if I could make the QBot and EvalBot simultaneously interact with each other while quizzing the students, and to level up the question difficulties gradually just like a interviewers would do in a viva. 

I am finding this is the hardest part since that would do the handing off between two agents frequently, leading up excessive compute resources and thus breaking down the whole system.

I am seeking help in this regard what to do? What agentic approach to follow to serve this automation? I saw videos on CrewAI but that doesn't serve my purpose. OpenAI's swarm has the near perfect solution to my case, but we want our work to be based the Open source LLMs as our novelty.

- July 2021: HSK5: listening 86; reading 75; writing 88.  (total 248 = 82%)  Postmortem [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/omq7cw/today_i_took_the_hsk5_exam_heres_my_postmortem/).

- October 2022: HSK6: listening 56; reading 55; writing 45. (total 156 = 52%)  (I didn't to a postmortem for the second time; it was quite upsetting getting worse marks after 8 months of full-time study.)

Two years of full-time Chinese study later, this was my third time taking the HSK6.


**How did I do?**

I did as good as I could hope for in the reading and writing sections.  The reading section I timed to perfection (doing the sections backwards: 4, 3, 2, 1)---the lady announced there was 5 minutes left when I had 3 语病 questions unanswered.  The writing section this time was much easier than the last two times I took it (I think there was only one proper noun in the whole exam, and it wasn't essential to narrate the story), so that was just pure luck.  The handwriting was not an obstacle for me; normally, if I forget how to handwrite a character, I can switch to a synonym and/or rephrase the sentence, but there wasn't really any characters I needed to handwrite which I couldn't handwrite.  (The real problem with the handwritten exam is editing.)

My listening section was not ideal, but that's expected as it's my weakness.  Occasionally the audio contained the answer word for word, but usually you have to understand what was said and infer the correct answer.  There were two ""不 questions"" in the listening section (which option is incorrect).  This time, there were no technical difficulties with the recording.

For the HSK6, I feel like my marks this time are as good as I can achieve at my current level.  I was considering taking the HSK6 again (just in case), but I do not believe I'd get better marks just through luck.  (If my marks are poor, I think next time I'll take it in Australia, and see if there's any truth to the notion that it's easier outside of China.)

This is my third time taking the handwritten HSK6 in China, and I'm yet to see anyone who didn't look east Asian.  The exam in Qingdao took place at a Korean school, so most (maybe all) were children with Korean passports.  (There was a lady from El Salvador in the HSKK高级, however.)

It was also my first time taking the HSKK高级, which I did absolutely disasterously on.  For the first two 复述 (""re-narrate"") questions, I basically said a few key words and gave up.  The HSKK高级 audio seemed to be harder than the HSK6 audio.  I spoke with 4 students who took the HSKK高级 with me, and they also said they had no idea what was said in the 复述 section.  Maybe it's just sour grapes, but this seems like a poorly designed exam.  Certainly, my marks on this exam won't reflect my oral Chinese level.

*My HSK6 mark predictions*: listening 65%, reading 80%, writing 70%.  [The marks will be published: 19th of November.]  Last time I overestimated my marks significantly, so maybe I'm doing the same this time (maybe -10% from all three estimates to account for this).


**How did I prepare this time?**

I took something like 20 classes on iTalki with [Jenny Chen](https://www.italki.com/en/teacher/1294454) who helped me with the HSK6 and HSKK高级 specifically.  (I used 并 and 于是 on today's exam because of her feedback on my writing.)  I had several other iTalki teachers along the way too.

As usual, I studied multiple textbooks.  I studied the New Practical Chinese Reader 5, from start to finish (spending something like 8+ hours per chapter).  I also re-studied all 40 chapters of the HSK6 Standard Course textbooks (digging much deeper than before; usually I spent 10 hours per chapter).  I tried 《新汉语水平考试教程》 but I couldn't find the mp3s, so it wasn't much use for me.  (Out of curiosity, I tried doing the listening section without the mp3, and got 38/75 = 50% before I got bored, which is a bit unsettling.)

Two years ago, I thought the HSK6 Standard Course Workbook exercises were too hard.  Here's my marks this time around (only including the listening and reading sections; not under exam conditions):

上: 1. 83% 2. 75% 3. 75% 4. 83% 5. 89% 6. 86% 7. 78% 8. 89% 9. 95% 10. 86% 11. 92% 12. 95% 13. 75% 14: 56% 15: 75% 16: 72% 17: 83% 18: 75% 19: 89% 20: 83%

下: 21. 72% 22. 78% 23. 67% 24. 69% 25. 72% 26. 78% 27. 75% 28. 64% 29. 67% 30. 78% 31. 83% 32. 81% 33. 69% 34: 58% 35: 81% 36: 69% 37: 75% 38: 86% 39: 83% 40: 94%

Note the inconsistent marks (e.g., in section 14 I got 56% and in section 40 I got 94%).  Some of these questions felt unhelpful, and even demotivating (especially when they deliberately set ""traps"" rather than help you learn Chinese).

There's a mock exam at the end of the HSK6 Standard Course Workbook; I got: listening 78%, reading 88%.  I did the writing sections throughout too, but they were unmarked (ChatGPT gave me feedback though).  I usually found I mis-handwrote two or three characters, and made some poor word choices and clunky grammar choices, but there's not much I can do to improve this without additional years of practice.

I did the 汉语水平考试真题集 HSK 六级 2018版 Official Examination Papers of HSK (Level 6) again, but untimed this time.  It contains 5 HSK6 exam papers from 2018.  My marks this time:

1: 听力: 86% 阅读: 88%  [2022 marks: 听力: 66% 阅读: 64%]
2: 听力: 90% 阅读: 90%  [2022 marks: 听力: 74% 阅读: 68%]
3: 听力: 88% 阅读: 90%  [2022 marks: 听力: 64% 阅读: 76%]
4: 听力: 84% 阅读: 92%  [2022 marks: 听力: 64% 阅读: 70%]
5: 听力: 78% 阅读: 80%  [2022 marks: 听力: 64% 阅读: 70%]

I tested my handwriting with the 3018 simplified characters in Heisig and Richardson's *Remembering Simplified Hanzi* (which splits into two volumes, the first with 1500 characters); I turned it into a handwriting printout (posted [here](https://www.chinese-forums.com/forums/topic/63251-handwriting-practice-with-heisigs-character-list)).  I think I did this 3 times over (I did 100 characters each morning for a few months).  I estimate I can handwrite maybe 85% of the first volume, and maybe 40% of the second volume.

The other major change in my study was ChatGPT.  ChatGPT has massively increased my reading volume.  ChatGPT was especially helpful for actionable feedback in the writing section.  Nowadays, using headphones and a lapel mic, I talk with ChatGPT (the free version) for 2+ hours straight, and it barely feels like I'm studying.  ChatGPT is also rather encouraging.

I read all sorts of things, such as 《锐阅读》 (which contains articles suited for Chinese middle-school students), or news articles on Sohu (I feel some of the HSK6 contents are copy/pasted from sites like this), or I'd get ChatGPT to convert r/todayilearned posts into HSK6 reading material, or I'd just read novels.  I make sure I have no ""I've read nothing today"" days.

It seems when studying vocabulary, I've gone through three phases: (a) initial study of the word, (b) becoming more familiar with the word through input, (c) studying the word to exhaustion.  This way, if you tell me an incorrect meaning of a word, I no longer think ""maybe it's a rare usage I don't know"", and now think ""no, I know all the meanings of this word, that's not one of them"".  This helps a lot with sections 1 (""faulty sentence"") and 2 (""fill in the blanks"") in the HSK6 reading section.

I also got into Genshin Impact, and some of its stories are quite entertaining (Kachina's storyline especially), which provided a fair amount of listening practice.  And the characters actually react to what is being said, which helps understanding.  I feel the small subtitles on my phone are unpleasant to read, so I'd rather just listen.  This game is a bit of a double-edged sword though, because a lot of the time you're not learning Chinese, and you're saving primogems to pull for Nahida in the 5.2 update.


**Did I improve over the two-year gap?**

Absolutely!  When studying the listening section, I often repeated what I heard in the audio into English in my YouTube videos, which I would not have been able to do if I were just listening for keywords.  I listen with the aim of understanding what they're saying.  My reading speed has increased to the point where I didn't feel rushed in today's exam (although I didn't have time to dilly dally).  Having read lots, I've become familiar with collocations, so I zip through part 2 in the reading section (I can sometimes deduce how to fill in the blanks without even looking at the answers).  My writing has improved, but the HSK6 writing section is just one silly ""abridge"" task and nothing else (sometimes I call it the ""second reading section""); my improvements in writing are more like building suspense, conveying emotion, character developement, pursuasive writing, plot twists, etc., which does nothing for my marks in the HSK6 writing section where I'm instructed to mentally copy/paste some uninspiring story.  ([Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WriteStreakCN/comments/1frwapc/i_wrote_a_satirical_mock_hsk6_question/)'s an example of my writing.)

There was an important change in my study mindset: **I'm not learning Chinese to take the HSK6, I'm taking the HSK6 to help me learn Chinese.**  So...

1. I didn't practice under exam conditions, but studied past/mock exam papers with the goal of learning as much as possible (I can get 80%+ with unlimited time; I just need to get faster [I have the theory, but not the practice]);

2. when I was in the exam, I didn't feel stressed because the HSK6 is merely a tool to help me learn Chinese, and my Chinese has objectively improved regardless of my HSK6 marks;

3. the reduction in stress led to better concentration during the exam;

4. and if I want better HSK6 marks, then I will genuinely improve my Chinese skills, which will have long-term benefits.

I wish I had had this realization years earlier.


The first time I took the HSK6, I wrote:

> If I had a time machine, I would go back and tell myself not to think about the HSK6 until (a) my vocabulary is above 20000 (characters above 3000), (b) I've read 10 million characters worth of input, and (c) my reading speed is 160+ characters per minute.

What about now?  My (passive) vocabulary is in the ballpark of 15000 words, and I probably know a bit more than 3000 characters (it becomes meaningless to count words at this level: you know so many variants of words, and so many proper nouns, your vocabulary size is determined by your choice of dictionary).  So 20000 words is too many.  While 15000 words doesn't guarantee I know every word on the HSK6, I read with relative ease today's HSK6 exam (although there were some unknown words on the HSKK高级), so I don't think 15000 words is necessary.  Still knowing 15000 words helps a lot on the HSK6 exam.

Did I read 10 million characters worth of input?  Over 2 years, that's 13700 characters per day, so probably no.  I'd guess in total I've read more than 10 million characters by now (but it's not like I keep track [I wish there were a browser extension that just counted how many characters you've read]).

PS. I have noticed there's a HSK7-9 exam where I live (in three weeks).  Do you think I should ""YOLO"" it?  I will almost surely not pass, but it might be worthwhile getting an idea of what the exam is like for a future, more serious attempt.",active,216

Given the condition of this labour market I am wondering if its even worth it to look for jobs. Most people will give advice along the lines of:

- Network: Takes time to build relationships (4-6 months, or more) and even then that ""network"" might not translate into a role.   
- Shoppers: Okay without, but I have student debt.

It's fine if I can land something by applying to 3-4 roles every day but so far it has not been working, I have a good boring resume (ones that work) minimal white space and good pointers. I need something immediately and at max have a 6 month (I have been burning cash for around 6 months now applying to jobs) 

Take me as greatest noob, but I am just looking for some advice. 

I need to learn flask of django along with postgresql, aws rds, and a few other aws services like auth, cc, etc. and Kubernetes. 

Sounds like a handful and if you haven't laughed by now I'd ideally want to learn them enough to build an app within 2-3 months. Cherry on top is I don't even know how to code and will probably go youtube and chatgpt route, for both building and debugging. 

I did identify a really good niche problem and don't think it would be tough to hit 2K monthly once I have it built out.

What should I do?   
Get a co-founder while I make calls to potential clients?  
Build it out myself and just take the leap of fait?

All I know is keeping applying to jobs blindly (even the ones I am qualified for) isn't working out.",User_deleted,1
1g8czej,12,2024-10-20,I passed both D317 (A+ Core 2) and D316 (A+ Core 1) in less than a month each. Here's how I did it.,u/LimeWire34,WGU,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1g8czej/i_passed_both_d317_a_core_2_and_d316_a_core_1_in/,"Hey there fellow Night Owls. I just wanted to give back to the community by sharing the strategies and resources I used to be successful on the CompTIA A+ exams.

First of all, DO NOT use the reading material on CertMaster Learn's lessons content as a learning resource. The content on CertMaster Learn goes way outside the scope of the certification and you'll be overwhelmed with information that isn't even within the exam objectives. It's also very dry. I'm the type of student that prefers learning by reading as opposed to learning by watching videos, and even I was put to sleep by CertMaster Learn. Seriously. Do not use it.

What you should instead use is Professor Messer's CompTIA A+ playlists on Youtube. He is a CompTIA Authorized Partner and he has two playlists on Youtube for both Core 1 and Core 2. I used his videos as my primary learning resource and it worked wonders for me. His content is very professional and to the point. I watched about ten of his videos each day to prepare for the exams. I also watched each playlist three times over to completion to prepare. 

Also, go on [www.professormesser.com](http://www.professormesser.com) and buy his notes for Core 1 and Core 2. They're only $30. Review the sections of the topics that were covered from the videos you watched for a given day. This will help with your understanding of the material and your retention of the material as well.

To further increase your retention, obtain the exam objectives sheet for both Core 1 and Core 2 and create flashcards for each term. I used ChatGPT to write these flashcards for me. Review the flashcards of one of the Domains of the exam objectives each day. 

Once you have watched the playlist twice over, it's time to take a practice test. I used Jason Dion's practice tests for Core 1 and Core 2, which are provided free of charge by the school through the Udemy platform. Dion's practice test questions are phrased similarly as the questions on the exam. Aim for at least an 80% on the first attempt on the practice exams. After you have achieved an 80% or higher on four of Dion's practice tests, then you're exam ready! It's time to set up an appointment and pass!

And that's all she wrote! With the above strategies, I passed A+ Core 2 with a 754 and A+ Core 1 with a 769. I also finished both A+ exam classes in under a month using these strategies and resources. I hope this post was helpful to you. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!",active,40
1g8fwlw,9,2024-10-20,SOLID TIPS since im done with my SAT's 😇,u/Substantial-Skirt-58,Sat,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sat/comments/1g8fwlw/solid_tips_since_im_done_with_my_sats/,"I took the October SAT and I got 1410 (770 maths & 640 r&w), it's my first & last test

okayy I might not be the excelling sat taker like other ppl here but I'm talking from personal experience

I was quite a failing student in high school ngl, my first practice test was abt 2 months before the test (1130)

for math:
- I honestly don't really find question bank that useful (I'm sure lots of questions come out from there tho) as I don't have the patient to do it and mark it one by one *me problem im sorry*

- khan academy is the GOAT for me, I finished the course & repeated the course challenge about three times per day (helped so much)

- after you finish ur practice test, please review it, it is really important (if you're impatient like me just look at questions u got wrong/was hesitating in test, and look up tutorllini test prep's practice test vids, and review the questions u got wrong)

- write notes of the formulas you encountered frequently when you do questions, so you can read them before ur sat's 

- if you don't know how to do a question, try and use chatgpt to explain it (if you cant find it anywhere on the internet explaining it) and make sure to write the question down, and redo it before your SAT !!!

- may not be the most accurate but some of the questions in those ""questions in the XXXX month SAT"" youtube vids actually came out, so you should try them out

- LEARN DESMOS THROUGHOUT, it helps and saves alot of time (but make sure to check ur answer again with ur calculator if you aren't sure)


for reading and writing:
- honestly I find memorising vocabs hard-to-do for me, so instead, I just remember the prefixes, suffixes and roots (and also do a ton of vocab questions on khan academy)

- ok for reading and writing defo do use the question bank & khan academy together (more questions)

- finish khan academy's standard english convention course, and do a ton of standard english convention questions because they are the easiest to learn and it SAVES UR SCORE (I went from 490 in my first practice test -> 640 in my oct SAT's r&w) 

- start from q15/q16 and finish them, then go back to q1 for the vocabs

- for notes questions, although most of the times you can get answers by reading the question, some questions would require you to kinda skim through the notes (so it depends)

- while many people would say you can just read the question fast, but I would recommend to read the question slowly and comprehend it. You wouldn't wanna read the question again and again quickly then ending up not understanding it

- repeating khan academy course challenge helps too

- KEEP THE TIMER ON so you can kinda keep track of the time and get used to the flow & speed of the exam

lastly, good luck for your SAT!
hopefully it'll help out, I'll reply if u have any questions ^^",active,11

1g8nusm,185,2024-10-21,Caught 2 students cheating and they continue to deny,u/Straight-Stay3830,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1g8nusm/caught_2_students_cheating_and_they_continue_to/,"I teach an English language course to foreign exchange students from non-English countries. Today we had a test and I caught 2 students cheating (in different sections) as clear cut as any cheating case could ever be. Yet, they both vehemently deny any wrongdoing.

For context, they take tests on their electronic devices, mostly because I’m an underpaid adjunct who doesn’t have time for grading and because they find it easier than writing by hand. Plus I can test them on more content if it’s not handwritten. The questions are fairly similar to the questions in their textbook although I do change them up slightly or throw in a few curveballs.

During the listening portion, one student was behaving very suspiciously. She had her tablet on the lowest brightness setting which is odd considering it’s a dark room and I can’t read my own phone or iPad on that same setting. She also positioned herself against a wall and pivoted her tablet screen toward the wall so it was hard to see what she was doing. I was immediately suspicious and monitored her closely. Lo and behold, I caught her looking at a screenshot of a page from our textbook which conveniently was exactly the page that the video I was playing happened to be about. I immediately confronted her and she denied having cheated. She said she was doing something unrelated and that just happened to be something she had open (that doesn’t even make sense). She says she had the photo from a day she forgot her textbook so she took a photo of her friend’s. First, you shouldn’t even be navigating away from the Canva test interface in the first place. Second, it’s obviously not a coincidence considering she had that page open right while I was playing a video about that exact page of the textbook AND she was behaving so strangely during the test.

As for the student in my other section, he was also behaving strange so I casually approached him from behind. I caught him recording the audio of the listening test using the speech to text function of ChatGPT. I assume it was either because 1) a lot of my Asian students (he was of Asian background) have trouble with listening but are good at reading so he probably wanted to read the dialogue rather than listen to it, or 2) he intended to interact with the text once it was produced and ask ChatGPT to answer the related questions. The point is I literally caught him WHILE he was recording the audio with ChatGPT RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. I saw EVERYTHING clear as day. He vehemently denies all. HOW?!

It just amazes me. I will be giving them both zero but I’m just baffled how they can deny it with such confidence despite so obviously cheating. I admit I actually laughed while hearing both their excuses but they were completely serious. How? How can you actually say this with a straight face?

I think the problem is that first year students are so immature and childish, when any sort of problem arises they go into damage control mode. How can I get out of this? How can I avoid consequences? They don’t have the maturity, experience, or wherewithal to realize that when you are caught with your pants down, it’s going to be better in the long run to just admit your wrongdoing, apologize, deal with the consequences, and do your best to move forward. That’s what they need to learn the most.",User_deleted,190

I am an associate professor in Software Engineering and I am trying to create content for a workshop on Python programming. The workshop is a self-study, and the evaluation criteria is a simple pass/no-pass.

Until recently, I would have created the workshop around a major exercise, like implementing tic-tac-toe in Python, but seeing as that is a simple task to instruct ChatGPT to do, that is not a route I want to do anymore. Instead, I would like to embrace the possibility of turning the workshop away from being a learning experience on the fundamentals of Python and instead having the students doing prompting and having to evaluate/adjust the generated responses. The students are already well familiar with Java syntax and programming paradigms in general, so I judge there is no need to learn this again with Python. As long as they can recognize the programming structures they know from Java in Python, I am good.

But I am struggling with how to formulate the exercise; if I make it too detailed and technical, students will simply throw these instructions into ChatGPT and have no reflections at all. I get the sense, it must be formulated in a way, that makes it approachable for the students, but cannot be directly prompted to ChatGPT, but then I am speculating if that is even possible at all.

Any suggestions from human peers will be welcome, as I have already tried asking ChatGPT and it cannot grasp the issue.",active,0

I (23M) have been working professionally for 3 years and returned to uni to pursue a new career. I recently had a midterm in a management course where the professor didn’t provide a rubric for the long-answer questions, only stating that 3 questions were worth 15 points total. I asked her during the exam how the points were split between questions, and she said she wasn’t sure but the first question (which was much longer) would count for more. I ended up getting zero on the last two questions, which were worth 8 points total (27% of the entire exam). Nearly half the class also got zeros. It’s also not a curve based system.

I emailed the professor afterward, asking about the point distribution and expressing surprise at the weight of the last two questions. I didn’t think they were worth as much based on her answer during the exam. She responded by saying she was shocked by my email, and we arranged to meet in person.

At the meeting, I explained that I wanted to learn from my mistakes and understand the exam better. She seemed frustrated with all the questions she was getting from students and repeatedly expressed surprise that so many people got the last two questions wrong. When we discussed how she distributed the marks, she said those two questions were the most important. I was confused since they only took up one slide in the lecture and weren’t emphasized much.

I asked if she was open to constructive criticism, and she said yes. I started by saying I liked her lectures, but maybe more time could’ve been spent on the important questions in class. She cut me off, saying my feedback was an excuse and that I had no right to criticize her because she’s taught the course for years, while I’d only taken it once.

She then went on a long rant, saying I was rude and disrespectful for questioning her in the email. She said that in the “real world,” I’d be seen as unprofessional for questioning a superior like that. I apologized multiple times, explained that I never meant to be disrespectful, and told her I just wanted to learn.

Now I’m confused. Did I go too far? or did she go too far? Is this okay for a professor to say things like that? Although I think what she did is wrong I’m still questioning myself if I’m the asshole and I’m just not understanding it since she’s a management professor and the head of the masters in management department. Surely she knows a lot more about management and teaching than me. I’m also trying my best not to offend her any further because she does mark my exams so  I don’t want to jeopardize my grade.

TL;DR: My professor called me disrespectful for asking how she graded an exam, then said questioning a superior is unprofessional. 

Note: I had a very detailed version but I thought it would be too long so I asked ChatGPT to make it short for a reddit post",active,3

TL;DR by ChatGPT:

The Ministry of Education (MOE) in Singapore will introduce new device management applications for students’ Chromebooks and iPads starting in November 2024 and January 2025, respectively. Lightspeed Systems will be deployed on Chromebooks by the end of November 2024, while Jamf will be introduced for iPads in January 2025, requiring a guided onboarding process at schools. Windows devices will continue using Blocksi.

This update follows MOE’s removal of Mobile Guardian after a cybersecurity breach in August 2024 that affected 13,000 users. MOE confirmed legal action was taken against the contractors involved in the breach.

The new applications were selected for their mobile device management, usage management, and classroom management capabilities, as well as their compliance with security standards. Schools will receive training in November to ensure smooth deployment, and MOE will provide ongoing support during the transition, acknowledging that some initial challenges may arise.

\---------------------------------

SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Education (MOE) will roll out new device management applications to students’ Chromebooks and iPads from November 2024 and January 2025 respectively. 

Lightspeed Systems will be centrally deployed to Chromebook personal learning devices by the end of November 2024 with no additional steps required by parents or students, MOE said in a statement on Thursday (Oct 24). 

For iPads, Jamf will be deployed in January 2025 because students will need to go through a guided onboarding process in school, said the education ministry. 

Windows devices will continue to use Blocksi. 

The update follows MOE’s decision in August to [remove device management application Mobile Guardian](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mobile-guardian-application-remove-cybersecurity-incident-moe-4526676) from students' devices the day after a global cybersecurity breach

Mobile Guardian suffered a cyberattack on Aug 4 that affected 13,000 users from 26 secondary schools. In September, Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing confirmed that MOE [took legal action](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mobile-guardian-cybersecurity-breach-attack-legal-action-contractors-chan-chun-sing-4597791) against ""relevant contractors"" after the breach.

For parents who want “greater say” over how their children use their devices at home, MOE will continue to provide them with options to manage the devices after school hours, it said. 

Noting that no software solution is “entirely foolproof”, the education ministry said it has taken steps to ensure that the new applications “meet schools’ needs effectively”. 

The new applications were selected for their ability to meet “core technology requirements”, including mobile device management, usage management and classroom management, said MOE in its statement. 

They also comply with security standards, including independent third-party security attestations and certifications, said the ministry. 

To prepare to deploy these applications, schools will be trained on how to use them in November, said MOE. 

“MOE will provide resources to schools to guide them through the deployment process as well as to engage students and parents,” the statement read. 

Both schools and parents will need time to familiarise themselves with the new applications and may encounter “some teething issues”, MOE acknowledged. 

“MOE will provide the necessary support throughout the transition period and address any issues that may arise.”

An In-Depth Review,u/gptgabe,stealthgpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stealthgpt/comments/1gbepz3/are_openais_o1mini_and_o1preview_truly/,"read here: [https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/are-openai-s-o1-mini-and-o1-preview-truly-undetectable-an-in-depth-review](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/are-openai-s-o1-mini-and-o1-preview-truly-undetectable-an-in-depth-review)

Since its inception, StealthGPT has understood that the most optimized form of AI content is humanized, undetectable AI content. Detectable content has no utility as an output than informing the user.

For the longest time, this undetectability is what was lacking from OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other mainstream llms. All the easily decipherable watermarks of bad AI writing were present in what ChatGPT users were delivered as outputs. If a student dared use ChatGPT for their schoolwork, any AI detector would immediately flag the text.

However, [with new AI models, o1-mini and o1-preview, being released to the public today](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/openai-previews-o1-ai-model-212105543.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADjyIPmLqZauF1QYsDT4MSEje1cFg-yq3l_RmaWxerdw4pig0q2PndnPBvif0vMgYdWqfqidqNscFMHU0rvm6NQ_ko39UCHjDBv_zlOGK0MUOA_goo-3mu2GoFHQbWNE3nJ1sQCIE47455SpjY_yRyKem73NgBPnDeLg73-TBSdj), the OG’s of AI content might’ve finally wised up about the future of AI and optimized their text to bypass AI Content detectors. That’s at least what we’re going to find out in this review.

# What is OpenAI’s o1-preview?

OpenAI’s o1-preview is the first of a slate of new AI models that take more time thinking so they can take on complex tasks and solve harder problems. New levels of reasoning have been input into the process of how these models generate their answers so that like the human thought process, o1-preview will try different strategies and recognize its own mistakes.

This makes for longer time generating outputs, but also more correct answers. o1-preview still does not have the capabilities of browsing the internet as GPT-4o, but for advanced reasoning, o1-preview touts itself as the new benchmark.

# What is OpenAI’s o1-mini?

OpenAI released two new AI models today. The first of which, o1-mini is a cost-efficient reasoning model meant to take on all the demands of STEM, specially math and coding. For 80% cheaper than their o1-preview tier 5 users of OpenAI’s API can o1-mini as a lower latency of o1-preview. Testing for speed against o1-preview and GPT-4o, o1-mini was 3-5x faster in delivering outputs.

After undergoing human preference evaluations, like o1-preview, o1-mini was determined to outperform GPT-4o in reasoning-heavy domains but gets outperformed in language-focused domains, something that spells doom on the detectability front.

# What is Undetectable AI?

OpenAI made these two models to address the STEM fields and made note of their capabilities in math, science and coding, however English or linguistics was largely amiss from their analysis and most likely from the new model’s machine learning.

Odds are it’s just as detectable as GTP-4o. That said, you may still be wondering what Undetectable AI is then. Undetectable AI is AI writing that has been made to feel like human writing by fine-tuning the language and removing the watermarks of AI writing such as low [perplexity and burstiness](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/how-do-perplexity-and-burstiness-make-ai-text-undetectable). Those watermarks of AI writing are the exact elements that AI detection tools use to flag content as being AI generated.

AI tools like ChatGPT might have some use cases, but the only way to make it useful as an essay writer or blog writer is to run the text through an AI humanizer, the likes of which are usually available from tech startups like the best, StealthGPT.

Now that you understand what undetectable AI is and [how to make ChatGPT undetectable](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/make-chatgpt-undetectable), lets see if the new AI models are worth using or if they’ll be detected.

# Are OpenAI’s o1-mini and o1-preview Truly Undetectable?

The only way we can determine whether these new Open AI models are undetectable is by passing them through AI detection tools like Turnitin, Originality, and GPTZero. First, lets see our outputs from each model.

Here is o1-preview’s essay about Los Angeles and San Francisco:

As you can see, the output now includes the duration of the AI’s thought process. When you click on that duration, an analysis of the AI’s thought process will drop down for you to see. More insight into this should open up new possibilities in terms of prompt engineering for more effective outputs.

At 7 seconds, we should expect o1-mini to be faster. Lets see:

o1-mini thought for only a second and didn’t provide a drop down menu of its process. With these two outputs, we’re gonna determine how detectable they really are.

# vs Turnitin

Running o1-preview through the most popular and widely-used AI detector, Turnitin gave us this result:

Turnitin immediately detected this was 100% AI generated content with 10 instances of plagiarism found. Here’s the result for o1-mini:

Slightly worse, 100% AI generated content detected with 11 instanced of plagiarism found. Not good. These new AI models need to come with a disclaimer about its actually utility.:

>“Only use this content it to inform yourself, not actually for anything useful.”

It should read.

# vs [Originality.AI](http://Originality.AI)

[Originality.AI](http://Originality.AI) came up with the same conclusions:

o1-preview was detected as 100% AI-generated content.

o1-mini was also detected as 100% AI-generated content. This exercise has become a closed case of low expectations.

# vs GPTZero

Lastly, before I move on to less obvious questions than the new ChatGPT’s detectability, lets run it through one last detector, GPTZero:

Same as the others. GPTZero detected o1-preview’s text to be 100% AI generated content.

And as for the new AI-model’s little brother, GPTZero detected o1-mini’s text to be 100% AI generated content.

# Conclusion

Nothing is new under the sun. ChatGPT’s ambitions in automation never included using their content in professional or academic settings. Thus, their new models are as completely detectable as GPT-4 turbo.

If you’re a student, thinking about using o1-mini or o1-preview to write your essays, don’t. You will need an undetectable AI software if you don’t want to be accused of academic misconduct. You will need StealthGPT, the most undetectable AI writing tool in the game. You can visit our [pricing](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/pricing) here, where plans are tailored to your needs and discounts are abundant to make sure everyone has the opportunity to use the most optimized AI-content on Earth.

# FAQ

# Can OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4 Be Detected By Plagiarism Checkers?

Yes. Absolutely. Though we tested their new AI models, certainly their old one is just as unable to bypass AI detection tools as the new.

# How to Avoid AI Detection

You will need to humanize your text by removing the watermarks of AI writing such as low perplexity and burstiness. Undetectable AI services like StealthGPT humanize text by making it feel like human writing with high complexity and randomness in the text’s word choice, sentence structure, and sentence length.

# Is StealthGPT Undetectable?

Yes. We’ve proven it time and time again, against AI detectors large and small. No matter if it’s the largest tool on the market, or some free tool in some dark corner of the internet. We’ve tested our software against the best of the best to prove no AI detector or other undetectable service compares to StealthGPT.",active,1

# What is an AI Content Detector

Because generative AI like OpenAI’s ChatGPT became so popularized for use in professional and academic settings, AI detector tools were developed and integrated into the each institution. These AI detection models are able to spot the watermarks that come with large language models.

# How Does AI Detection Work?

AI writing from ChatGPT utilizes machine learning that makes its writing low in perplexity and simple and precise in word choice, sentence structure, and sentence length. Meanwhile, human writing features plenty of randomness and complexity in word choice, sentence structure, and sentence length. AI content detection just looks for this simple, precise features and identifies it at AI-written content, often mistakenly flagging human-writing that is just simple and precise too as false positives.

The most popular examples of AI detectors are Turnitin, [Originality.AI](http://Originality.AI), GPTZero and more. And these all still generate false positives, with a 4% rate on the sentence level by Turnitin.

Once you understand AI Detection and how AI writing tools work, you can understand [how to bypass AI Detection](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/bypassing-ai-detectors-stealthgpt).

# What is AI Detect: The Free AI Checker?

If Ai Detection is going to be an inherently flawed process, you might as well not be paying an arm and a leg for it which is what more prominent AI Writing Detectors expect from their subscribers and our educators. To solve this problem and offer AI detection that neither shames AI writing tools, nor abandons academic integrity, AI Detect offers a service open to everyone.

Students, content creators, educators, professionals, you should all use AI detect whether you want to check if your humanized essay will be detected, or if you want to check a student’s work for AI plagiarism.

# How Accurate Is AI Detect in Identifying AI-Generated Text?

There’s only one way to find out if an AI detector works, by testing it against various content creation tools. The first LLM we’re going to test is the original generative artificial intelligence, ChatGPT:

This is our ChatGPT essay about the best actors of all time. Now, lets run that through AI Detect to see how human this essay really is:

At 1% human, AI Detect knew right away that this was AI-generated content. Now lets compare AI Detect to Stealthwriter’s detector and to ChatGPT’s detectability.

First, here is what our ChatGPT essay looks after it was humanized by Stealthwriter.

The less words that pass through an AI detector, the more unreliable the result, however the words allowed by the stealthwriter’s free trial were enough to seal its fate.

With a 44% human score, AI Detect successfully flagged Stealthwriter at its most undetectable setting. AI Detect is much more than a ChatGPT detector, whether you’re using GPT-3, GPT-4 or undetectable AI, AI Detect has your number dialed in.

# Ethics of AI Detect

As the ethics behind academic integrity and academic misconduct are beginning to shift in lew of AI technology, AI Detect is here to embrace both users of AI content checkers and users of generative AI.

AI Detect is for everyone. It is not the essay police like Turnitin. With AI Detect’s ethics integral to its mission, content creators can feel comfortable supporting a technology that doesn’t jeopardize their process.

[Using AI isn’t exactly plagiarism](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/is-using-chatgpt-plagiarism-academic-dishonesty-in-dishonest-academia) in the first place. Because they generate original content, generative AI doesn’t usually get flagged by old school plagiarismcheckers. That’s why academic institutions have coined the use of AI writing tools in school work as “AI plagiarism”.

This is why if you’d like to use AI writing, you need undetectable AI tools to make your AI-generated text feel like human-written content.

# Conclusion

If you need a powerful AI engine to check your content for detectability, AI Detect is the Free AI Checker that will change your process forever. Whether you’re generating undetectable AI and need to see if it’ll really bypass detectors, or if you’re just reviewing work handed in to you, AI Detect is the most user-friendly, best-value, most effective tool to find AI writing in any piece of text.

# FAQ

# Who uses AI Detectors?

Everyone from students and professionals, anyone that deals with text-based content has a use for an AI detector. Whether it’s a blog moderator or a teacher, these positions deal with so much content that to ensure the content’s integrity, they need to implemenet AI detection software. AI Detection is utilized in content creation for social media and blogs, for SEO to ensure the best content climbs to the top ranks of search engines, and more.

# Do AI Detectors Work?

Although their process is flawed enough for [MIT to declare AI Detectors don’t work](https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/teach/ai-detectors-dont-work/), they’re the best technology people have to ensure academic integrity isn’t completely leveled. As a whole though, they’re an imperfect tool because they don’t even claim to be the final word on a document’s origin. Software like Turnitin that has a 4% false positive rate at the sentence level, only claims to point reviewers in the right direction, whether a document is AI-generated or not.

# How is AI Changing Academia?

Beyond integrating AI detectors into the submission process and a reported [86% of students using AI for schoolwork](https://campustechnology.com/articles/2024/08/28/survey-86-of-students-already-use-ai-in-their-studies.aspx), academia has implemented AI at nearly every level of the institution.

Currently finishing up my first 5 exams. I didn't have a tutor. DM me if you have more questions. Hopefully this isn't too long lol

\*series = anytime during the year that exams are held. May/Jun, Oct/Nov and Feb/Mar (India Only)

  
1) There are no mandatory subjects. Typical number is 7 but you can do less or more (I'm doing 5 this series)

2) You will need to find a centre to sit your exams. You will have to pay. And they ain't cheap. 

3) You already said this but download and print off your syllabuses. Tick off what you already know and are confident with. The exam board can only ask your questions related to the content in those documents.

4) (IN THE UK ONLY) You need to decide if you want to do GCSEs or iGCSEs. I stands for international, typically sat by students outside the UK. iGCSEs are considered harder and they are more expensive to sit. GCSEs are what UK 15/16 years olds will do.

5) You then need to decide on an exam board. Look the the syllabuses, the paper formats and find a centre for that exam board near you. I was stuck with either CIE or Edexcel for my exams but I went with CIE becasue I struggled too much with the Edexcel maths papers. fyi, you can pick different exam boards but it's unlikely that you will be able to do this in the same series. Decide off those factors. DM me if you'd like the list of centres that I've found. 

6) You can 100% homeschool iGCSEs and GCSEs. I'm doing mine without tutors. Find teachers on YouTube that you like for your exam board. Have websites you go to for notes for each subjects. Get some second hand text books (pretty cheap, £4 or less per book.

1. Print off your syllabuses, preferably in checklist form. Tick off what you know. The thing with the syllabus is that the exam papers can only ask you about content on those syllabuses.
2. Find YouTube teachers you like for each of your subjects. These will be your main teachers.
3. Gather up as many resources/websites as you can. Quiz websites, flash cards, websites with notes, pdfs of books, ect.
4. GET YOUR ENTRY TO SIT THE EXAMS IN EARLY. DON'T PROCRASTINATE.
5. For me I find it's best that I don't stick to a fixed study schedule. I'll just pick whichever subject I feel like doing on that day and do it until I'm bored. That might be 20 mins or in might be 2 hours.
6. Have a space for studying that is only used for studying. Have a desk. Keep it 'tidy' with only school materials. How tidy is just personal preference.
7. Read through this website: [https://he-exams.fandom.com/wiki/IGCSEs](https://he-exams.fandom.com/wiki/IGCSEs)
8. Motivate yourself if you're teaching yourself. It's hard but I had to learn at a pretty young age. 'Ban' yourself from your phone until you've at least tried to study. Switch it off. Don't use Instagram/Discord, ect on your tablet/computer. Only associate it with study.
9. Past papers are your best friend. Do as many as possible.
10. Watch videos for fun. Documentaries are great for geo and bio. Goof around a bit a watch Marc Rober or CrashCourse for physics.
11. For sciences, watch as many people doing practicals on YouTube as possible, even if they aren't in the syllabus. You need to be prepared for semi-random ones.
12. Don't rely on ChatGPT to mark your English. It will give you great feedback but the mark will be very inaccurate even if you give it the mark scheme.

TLDR: I left teaching after 1.5 years due to overwhelming workload and stress from handling all curriculum planning alone in a one-form entry school.

I’m concerned that the same challenges might resurface, and I’m seeking advice from others who’ve returned to teaching after leaving. What did you change, and was it better the second time around?

I taught primary (elementary) school for 1 1.5 years, back when I was 22 - 23 years old. As I’m sure many of you can relate to, my training didn’t prepare me for the realities of having my own class. The added responsibilities that add up over, e.g. setting homework, spellings, reading books, marking, the endless paperwork. I also only worked in one form entry schools (one class per grade/year group), so curriculum planning for the whole grade was overwhelming and I felt alone. I crumbled under that stress and so I left teaching.

I’m now 26 and feel like I have a bit more life experience behind me. I don’t crumble under pressure as easily and I follow some teachers online who showed me some tools to save time as teachers, e.g. Teachermatic, ChatGPT (controversial), etc.

I just really miss working with kids and I was wondering if teaching would be different if I taught A-Level English (AP English), where the students actually choose to be in class. Maybe it would make my life a little easier. Plus finding a job in the industry I want has been tough. But I’m scared that if I go into teaching again, the same issues I had before would resurface.

So I’d love to hear your opinions, fellow teachers! Have any of you gone back to teaching after leaving? Or transitioned from younger to older kids? What was it like?

Thanks in advance for your help and understanding!",User_deleted,2

1gdqiio,2,2024-10-27,Career Advice Needed: Struggling to Find the Right Path ,u/Apprehensive_Share93,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1gdqiio/career_advice_needed_struggling_to_find_the_right/,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently a junior in college, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in New Media Arts. Lately, I’ve been sitting down and contemplating what career would be most suitable for me. I’ve been thinking about this for years, starting back in high school, but I had a hard time envisioning myself in any specific career path. None of the subjects I was exposed to in school really sparked my interest in terms of my future.

Since then, I’ve done A LOT of questioning and introspection to figure out what I actually enjoy. Choosing a career to commit to has been daunting, and even now, as a 21-year-old college student, I still find myself sorting through my likes, dislikes, and personality traits.

Here’s what I’ve narrowed down so far:

# What I Like:

* **Writing**: I enjoy writing anything—essays, stories, ideas—whatever comes to mind.
* **Arts**: I love the creative problem-solving aspect of art and thinking deeply about the meaning and purpose behind artwork.
* **Psychology**: I'm fascinated by how people think and how the human mind works. I’m interested in understanding mental disorders and how relationships affect us. However, I don’t want to be a therapist or psychologist because dealing with others’ emotions sounds draining.
* **History**: I find history fun, especially when I get to understand how the world was built and how people thought in the past.
* **Art History**: Since I love both art and history, it’s a natural fit.
* **Graphic Design**: I’ve always wanted to learn Adobe tools, and I’m fascinated by how people use visual design to communicate ideas.
* **Pattern Recognition**: I get excited and proud when I recognize patterns that help me solve problems or make predictions. This skill made me think I should pursue Computer Science since I notice patterns in numbers and coding, but I’m not passionate about it.
* **Aesthetic Sensitivity**: I have a good eye for what looks visually appealing, not just in art and design but in clothes, music, and patterns of any kind.
* **Music**: I’m deeply passionate about music—it feels like it affects my soul. I used to play piano but stopped for personal reasons.

# What I Don’t Like:

* **Physics**: I’m not a huge fan of physics or memorizing all the formulas. I’ve always doubted myself in this subject. Hence, why I crossed out being an engineer. 
* **Math**: I don’t hate it, but I’ve never been passionate about it.
* **Biology**: It’s never sparked any interest in me. 
* **Chemistry**: I was good at it in high school, but I wouldn’t want it as a career.
* **Finance**: I was originally a finance major and after taking microeconomics and macroeconomics, I wanted to shoot myself (not literally, but you get it).
* **Statistics**: Nope, not for me.
* **Law**: No interest in being a lawyer.
* **Medical Careers**: I don’t want to be a nurse or spend years getting an education in medicine.
* **Dentist**: Cleaning people’s mouths just doesn’t appeal to me.

# My Personality:

* **Empathic and Emotionally Intelligent**: People tell me I have a great personality and that I’m in tune with others' emotions.
* **Shy and Withdrawn**: I’m not much of a talker, and I worry this might make certain careers (like psychology or therapy) difficult for me.
* **Analytical and Detail-Oriented**: I like breaking concepts down and understanding everything on a fundamental level.
* **Imaginative and Fantasy-Prone**: This is where most of my creativity comes from and why I’m a good creative thinker.
* **Cooperative and Collaborative**: I prefer teamwork and collaboration over competition.
* **Deeply Self-Aware**: I’m always mindful of my thoughts, feelings, strengths, and weaknesses. I would love a career that encourages self-improvement.
* **Strong Moral Compass**: I’ll fight tooth and nail for the people and causes I care about.
* **Even-Tempered**: I’m pretty easy to get along with.
* **Intellectual**: I’m curious about the world and don’t want that side of me to die as I get older.
* **Cautious and Deliberate**: I like to think things through before committing to anything.
* **Achievement-Striving**: I love earning the things I want in life.
* **Self-Efficacy**: I have confidence in my ability to accomplish things, it’s just about prioritizing.
* **Modest and Humble**: I have a realistic self-image and never put myself on a pedestal.

# My Flaws:

* **Self-Doubt**: This is my biggest flaw. Logically, I know I’m smart, kind, and hardworking, but emotionally, I act like I don’t believe it.
* **Perfectionism**: I struggle with this.
* **Thinking without Acting**: I tend to overthink and let decisions slip by without taking action.
* **Fear of Commitment**: I fear being stuck in situations I can’t escape, whether that’s a bad relationship, a career I don’t like, or a toxic environment.
* **Sensitive to Criticism**: I take criticism to heart.
* **Procrastination**: Classic flaw.

# Things I Want in a Career:

* **Work/Life Balance**: I want to live to work, not work to live.
* **Decent Salary**: I don’t need six figures, just enough to pay the bills, live comfortably, and have some peace.
* **Remote Work**: This is a bonus, though not a necessity if the work/life balance is there.
* **Non-Toxic Work Environment**: This is non-negotiable. I’ve struggled with social anxiety and fear of bullying, so I won’t tolerate toxic environments. Good communication and collaboration are essential.

# So, Any Advice?

What career paths should I look into based on my interests and personality? Any guidance or thoughts would be really appreciated. Thanks!   
  
P.S. And yes, I did use ChatGPT because I wanted my post to be coherent and organized. Just so that more people can understand it better. But my question and the meaning of my post remains the same. ",User_deleted,2
1gdz3w9,2,2024-10-28,I am triggered too much when people copy in assignments or tests in college,u/an_underachiever_,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gdz3w9/i_am_triggered_too_much_when_people_copy_in/,"So I've been brought up as an honest guy and I pride myself on my honesty. But when I look around me and I can't help but do it, almost everyone in college cheats/copies in literally every assignment or test or project. It riles me up so much. In assignments, few assignments of students do the rounds in the student groups and everyone copies from it. Very rarely I do that. And some people are smart enough to take the best parts of different assignments doing the rounds. In tests, people hide phones in their dresses, even females, bring materials into the examination room, talk to neighbour's when no one is looking and what not. I know it's not possible to have eyes on everyone all the time but still even if caught no action is taken since the higher ups are all corrupt. There's no one to complain to. Projects are downloaded straight from the net and so on. Even in contests, people use chatgpt and Google and what not to get answers. Now, I can't sleep generally if I do such things and hence I live up to my values. But I can't help to wonder where the hell is everyone's ethics and honesty ? This is absolute nonsense. I'm getting so mad, I feel like I want to complain but I also don't want to ruin someone's life because it's not like I'm perfect in every way or haven't done anything wrong. Sure, I may have done less cheating than most kids if not all, but still I feel like this could backfire on me if my name is known. This happens every single day. The worst is when the teacher compares my work and their work and shows me how great there's is compared to mine. It's so damn awkward and frustrating",User_deleted,2

The more AI technology advances, the more students are using it in their every day lives. Most people are well aware of students using AI to write their essays and do their homework, but this isn’t the only use students are getting out of these AI tools.

Studying and reading is subject to AI integration just as much as academic writing. Generative AI is able to read the assignments either from an uploaded document or the web and create summaries, pinpointing relevant quotes and points so students can quickly get all the necessary proof that they did their assigned reading.

The use of AI in studying and reading has caused higher education institutions to rethink how they assign reading, signaling larger changes on the horizon for academia.

# How Are Students Using AI to Study?

For the longest time, college students have looked for ways to skirt this schoolwork, either by reading Cliff's Notes, web summaries, watching YouTube summaries, or simply skimming the material and crossing their fingers that they glossed over the material that’ll end up on the [quiz.Now](http://quiz.Now) though, with advanced artificial intelligence at their fingertips, students only need to ask these AI chatbots to read the material for them and generate a summary.

Many of the caveats of using generative AI tools to create essays aren’t present when summarizing pdf’s. For instance, misinformation that an AI-generated essay might have aren’t present when the AI is tasked with simply reading a piece of text. This was once one of main hallmarks of AI writing for plagiarism detection, however in this case this fatal flaw is lacking from AI-powered studying.

AI powered studying takes many forms. With students even asking AI to generate flash cards, so they can educate themselves the right way.

Still, professors are not convinced that academic integrity is not being tarnished with this less intrusive use of AI tools. If students use AI to read everything assigned to them, professors will have to change what, why, and how they ask students to read in the first place.

# How is Academia Rethinking Reading Assignments

Unlike high school students, some college students have anywhere from 100 pages to 300 pages a week for varying fields of study. Whether because they deem the reading unnecessary busywork, they just don’t have the bandwidth to juggle the load, or for their own mental health, there has been a larger decline of reading for Gen-Z and younger students than previous times in academia.

You can look to [studies from the 90’s and see a steady decline in reading](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2000-07173-017) begin only to dip further and further all the way up to [70% of students saying they don’t read the texts their professors give them in a 2021 study](https://theconversation.com/up-to-80-of-uni-students-dont-read-their-assigned-readings-here-are-6-helpful-tips-for-teachers-165952).

Where most professors take issue with the refusal to read and use of AI to take on reading assessments for students, is that such practices deprive young learners of the student learning experiences that are required to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

The solution as many professors have found, is conducting more in-class assignments, including in-class reading that teaches them how to read larger loads in a given period of time. Cognizant of declines in reading, some professors assign large reading loads for homework with intentions to quiz students on such hyper-specific material that no chatbot could possibly prepare the student for the quiz.

Other solutions may involve explicitly advocating for using AI as well as changing the way students read. One of the many factors as to why students aren’t reading is surely changing technologies and mediums from which student derive information. Some professors advocate for joining this trend and assigning material to watch or listen to, in the form of YouTube videos or podcasts, instead of traditional reading.

# Why Are Students Studying Less?

Technological advancement holds a large share of fault for the decline in reading by college students, however, there are numerous factors beyond these advents. The Coronavirus pandemic served a large role in changing the way Gen-Z students learn, from shifting school to fully-remote settings and making mental health play a larger role in academia, students were tasked to read less and became used to these behaviors.

With social media, podcasts, streaming services, and an infinite amount of media choices available to them, people have shorter attention-spans than ever, constituting a threat to reading at large, beyond school work. Even English students, who love to read and write, are using AI to complete and summarize the reading their assigned from less interesting classes.

Lastly, economics has a role to play in why students read less. More students are working simultaneously to doing college work and this limits the bandwidth for school work they’re able to take on.

This isn’t just students that need to work at the same time as they study to afford tuition and other bills, it’s student taking advantage of job opportunities that have been made available to younger candidates with remote capabilities that allow them to work anywhere and anytime. In our changing world, young people don’t see graduating as a pre-condition to starting their hustle, and studying often gets in the way.

# AI Solutions to AI Problems

Artificial intelligence is unique from previous Edtech advances that have changed the world. Any problem is subject to new solutions with unlimited capabilities to improve student learning experiences without having to sacrifice academic integrity.

AI tools will soon be able to customize curricula down to each professor’s student and address all of their personal needs, whether they have jobs, mental health concerns, or simply prefer other media to text to get their information. Once curricula are personalized towards students, learning experiences can be crafted that ensure students acquire the skills they need to truly educate themselves, that students don’t just consider boring busy work, and that professors approve of.

# TL;DR

More than half of students are using AI tools to study. Some reports suggest it’s up to 86% of students, meanwhile as previously cited in this article, 70% of students are refusing to read. Obviously, if we truly care about student learning experiences, AI is not the issue. Students are already being deprived of learning experiences simply because they don’t care.

AI should be considered an opportunity to reengage students in academia. AI’s impact on academia has yet to materialize, but we can already expect that it will be responsible for more positive results than cases of plagiarism. [OpenAI’s updated versions of ChatGPT](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/are-openai-s-o1-mini-and-o1-preview-truly-undetectable-an-in-depth-review) alone are capable of more computing power than ever, making it essential in scientific fields. When the humanities become subject to such advancements, they will make AI essential to educating yourself in a field.

# FAQ

# Is Using ChatGPT plagiarism?

[Using ChatGPT or any other generative AI software to do your homework is not traditional plagiarism](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/is-using-chatgpt-plagiarism-academic-dishonesty-in-dishonest-academia). It may be considered academic misconduct, but plagiarism is defined the theft of words or ideas without proper credit, which is not what AI does when generating text. Generative AI creates original content, so having it ghostwrite your essay is not plagiarism but the newer classification of “AI plagiarism”.

# How Many Students Use Generative AI?

A recent [Digital Education Council survey reported that 86% of students use AI](https://campustechnology.com/Articles/2024/08/28/Survey-86-of-Students-Already-Use-AI-in-Their-Studies.aspx) at varying capacities for their studies. Given that using AI for schoolwork is often prohibited, some students may have felt pressure confessing that they use AI as well. Meaning the actual percentage of students using AI may even be higher than 86%.

# What Are People Using Generative AI For?

Students use generative AI for homework but professionals also use these AI tools for all sorts of tasks from writing blogs, to SEO, to social media posts on platforms like LinkedIn and X. Using tools like Stealth Writer and SEO Writer give digital content writers huge advantages for making content personalized to any audience.

# What Other Generative AI apps are People Using?

I've read many threads here about AI, cellphone policies, laptops, etc., but I am currently burnt out this semester, and I'm at a loss regarding what to do about my classes regarding AI and class conduct. (I apologize for the long post/rant!)

I am an adjunct teaching two courses at a good state school while completing my PhD. Both my courses are 60 students each, which is an interesting size—not quite a large lecture and small enough that you can have discussions, be mindful of class conduct, etc. I'm usually known as the ""approachable"" professor. I'm fairly young (mid-30s), very accommodating, and have flexible deadlines. (I'm also a woman, so sometimes, female professors get the ""nice"" label.) I teach gender studies and religion. They are lower-level courses that I try to keep easy and fun. 

My courses usually go well, but this semester has been a struggle. I grade attendance because my chair advised me to do so post-COVID. I have added a strict no-cellphone policy this semester because cellphone use was terrible the previous semester. I also have other course conduct policies on my syllabus. I implemented a ""syllabus quiz"" this semester, which tested them on these policies. I also have a strict no-AI policy. In one of my courses, their class conduct has been very distracting—cellphone use, exiting excessively during class, being distracted by their laptops, etc. While meeting with the dean of students last week about another issue, she told me it's good to reset expectations for the rest of the semester, which I sent to my students last Friday in an announcement (I reminded them about cellphones, told them there's been too many class disruptions and class exits, and reiterated that these policies are on the syllabus.)

In my other course, I have several quizzes throughout the semester. This last quiz, I noticed use of AI and so, I audited their first quiz and found A LOT of AI that I had missed. I'm talking bad AI--copied and pasted from Gemini or Chat GPT. These take-home quizzes should be easy because they're open book/note, so using AI for a 150-word short-answer question is appalling to me.

Today, I lectured both classes about AI use and gave both classes an in-class essay to write on the spot. I was pretty hard on them and warned them that I might ban laptops for the rest of the semester and change our assignments to in-class essays. This semester, it all just feels so demoralizing—I have a lot of good students, and I have others who have tried to bully me this semester, have terrible attitudes, and now the rampant AI use. I'm definitely going to get tanked in my evals, because one student just complained on my Rate My Professor: ""bothered about students leaving early, being on your phone, and is very strict about attendance. It's really annoying because it's not that deep.""  (This is all they care about 🙄) 

I'm a former writing teacher, so I used to do fewer lecture-style classes and more classes on close readings, discussions, in-class work, etc. I switched to lectures because lectures seemed better suited for these intro courses, but I fear that lecture-based courses just fuels this behavior...

I'm wondering if anyone has had success with 1) banning laptops and 2) going back to in-class essays / BlueBook exams? Do you think it would be excessive to ban laptops? Do you have any tips on redoing your assignments because of AI or in-class behavior?",User_deleted,0

When ChatGPT was creating content in a vacuum, without AI detectors to rain on an AI writer’s parade, there was no way of comprehensively concluding that any piece of text was AI-written text. These days, that’s still not completely the case, you can’t ever be 100% sure that any writing is AI but when it comes to ChatGPT, most AI Detectors have no trouble analyzing ChatGPT’s output and declaring that it comes from an AI writing tool.

So, how does AI content detection work exactly? By knowing the watermarks of a large language model’s writing style, you can pinpoint the presence of AI writing on the sentence level. Artificial intelligence is programmed to write for utility and precision, meaning it uses simple, precise word choice, sentence structure, and sentence length. AI checkers simply measure for the perplexity and burstiness of a piece of text and from those metrics determine its source.

# What is Undetectable AI?

To bypass AI Detection so you can actually use AI-written content in academics or professionally, undetectable AI tools were developed to make AI text to feel like human writing and beat AI detection systems.

Among the many undetectable AI services, no software is stronger than StealthGPT.AI at generating high-quality humanized text with its Stealthwriter tool and its AI humanizer tool. StealthGPT has proven it can bypass Turnitin, bypass Originality.AI, bypass GPTZero, Content at Scale and more frequently and comprehensively than the competition.

Just as AI-generated text from ChatGPT has certain watermarks that can be picked up by AI content detectors, the way StealthGPT humanizes its text is simply by flipping those watermarks on their head. It makes text human-feeling by making it more complex and random in its word choice and sentence structure and in doing so, the text can bypass AI Detectors and beat Turnitin or [Originality.AI](http://Originality.AI), all while increasing the text’s readability and quality.

Furthermore, undetectable AI services like StealthGPT offer much more capability than beating popular AI detectors. StealthGPT works for all sorts of purposes, from inserting essay citations to ensure your work isn’t flagged by plagiarism checkers, to chatting with pdfs, SEO writing, and more.

# Testing Originality AI Against ChatGPT

Now that you know the players, lets begin our game. OpenAI just released two new models of ChatGPT, so I’m going to run the new o1-preview against [Originality.AI](http://Originality.AI) to see who prevails. Here is our essay from ChatGPT about ninjas and samurais:

Now, lets paste this into Originality's content scanner and see what it finds:

As I suspected, Originality.AI was able to detect the text was 100% AI generated. ChatGPT should never be used to generate essays you intend to directly hand in because whether it’s against Originality.AI, Turnitin AI, or any detector, chances are you’ll get [caught and punished severely for academic misconduct](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/professor-catches-students-plagiarizing-with-ai).

# Testing Originality AI Against StealthGPT

I want to show you the power of each of StealthGPT’s tools, it’s AI humanizer and it’s Stealthwriter. First, the humanizer. Simply paste ChatGPT’s output into the bypass tool and in moments you’ll get humanized text as you can see below:

Now let’s input that text into Originality AI’s content detector and see if we can ninja past their radar.

With a 98% human score, Originality AI determined StealthGPT’s AI humanizer’s content was likely original content.

With the AI humanizer proven to be as sharp as ever, lets rev up the Stealthwriter to give us a ninja/samurai essay from scratch and compare the results.

First, here's our essay:

Now, lets input that Stealthwriter essay into Originality:

With an even better score, Stealthwriter has slashed through Originality’s defenses to bypass their detection system with a 100% originality score. Meaning it was found to be likely human and likely original.

If you want to pursue AI content creation without fear of consequences, only StealthGPT can guarantee your safety.

# Conclusion

No AI Detector is safe from StealthGPT. Stealth AI is simply too powerful for the likes of Turnitin, Originality, Copyleaks, GPTZero, Content at Scale, Quillbot, Winston AI, or any Detector you can name.

For content creation, no other undetectable AI software has more functionality and can generate higher quality, human-like content. We understand human writing, its style, flow, rhythm and randomness better than other AI chatbots. With dynamic writing style in StealthGPT’s machine learning, our AI becomes a better English scholar with every undetectable essay it generates.

# FAQ

# Does StealthGPT bypass Turnitin?

Absolutely. As important as it is to be functional against Originality AI, if StealthGPT couldn’t bypass Turnitin AI, then it wouldn’t truly be undetectable.

[StealthGPT has always beaten Turnitin](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/bypassing-ai-detectors-stealthgpt), no matter how often they update, they simply can’t compete against us. And since Turnitin is integrated into [Canvas](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/what-is-canvas), the most popular online student submission portal, if you plan on using AI writing for academic work, you’ll need StealthGPT to be able to bypass anything.

# Is Using AI For School Plagiarism?

Using AI to ghostwrite your essay is considered “AI plagiarism” and academic misconduct. It is not however, traditional plagiarism. Traditional plagiarism is the stealing of words or ideas without proper credit. When you use AI to generate your essay, you’re creating original content, not stealing someone else’s.

Many schools are changing their policies and implementing [more progressive codes of AI ethics](https://teaching.cornell.edu/generative-artificial-intelligence/ethical-ai-teaching-and-learning) in accordance with the changes in how people use the technology. It is safe to assume that the use of AI for school work will have a changing stance as the technology reshapes academia as we know it.

# Do AI Detectors Work?

You’ve seen for yourself how poorly Originality AI fared against StealthGPT. Given most students have wised up to undetectable AI when it comes to submitting work, can it really be said these detectors even work? The answer is no.

Even [MIT declared AI Detectors don’t work](https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/teach/ai-detectors-dont-work/) given that Turnitin has a 4% false positive rate at the sentence level and that many detectors show bias against non-native English speaking students. They’re a flawed technology implemented by an institution that has run out of options. Academia can either change or die, and it’ll do everything it can to avoid changing.",active,1

Uploading a PDF to ChatGPT and asking questions doesn't help, I need something I can just talk to that answers me based on the content of a book or document I upload. This helps me study, prepare for interviews, learn new stuff much faster than reading (or ""chatting"" with a PDF). 

VoiceDocs allows you to upload any document and start ""talking"" to it instantly. Ask questions, get insights, get summaries, learn new concepts, jump back and forth with easy. It's my dream tool. 

I made it completely free so you can use it yourself as well! It's still early though so if you have any feedback or suggestions please let me know. 

An open question I have is who would be an ideal ""niche"" for this product that could benefit from it and would be prepared to pay? I initially thought students but someone told me students don't like paying for such tools and look for free options.
