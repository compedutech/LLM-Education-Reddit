13xc8ev,9,2023-06-01,Heated Argument With a Dear Friend Over Vectors and the Speed of Light,u/StegoFF,AskPhysics,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/13xc8ev/heated_argument_with_a_dear_friend_over_vectors/,"Hello and thanks for your time. I'm having a challenging time with a close friend that is insisting on a few math/physics related beliefs to the point that our relationship is suffering. They are becoming upset at me thinking I am to stubborn to admit I am wrong, however, on my end I feel so strongly in my understanding.  I'm not able to just back down or agree with them due to a dynamic of our relationship, they are an important person in my life who I care about, however, they are enabled to treat me like I'm an idiot, talk to me in a mocking voice, tell me I'm stupid, and they can't tolerate or believe that I would hold these thoughts, so while this might sound childish, it's not something I can walk away from and I have to hold my ground and not just give in.  I'd appreciate any advice and perhaps a sanity check validating one or the other of us so I know how to approach this.

The argument revolves around the speed of light and the difference between a scalar and a vector.  Any website forum like quora/reddit or educational websites for students they scoff at, as well as chatgpt. As such I don't know how to convey anything.

My friend believe these two things:

# Meter is a Vector not a Scalar

My friend believes that a meter is the only measurement of distance that is able to be a vector since it's standardized. They use this quote from wiki to verify this fact:

[https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Physics\_with\_Calculus/Mechanics/Scalar\_and\_Vector\_Quantities#:\~:text=The%20only%20basic%20SI%20unit,in%20its%20definition%20and%20unit](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Physics_with_Calculus/Mechanics/Scalar_and_Vector_Quantities#:~:text=The%20only%20basic%20SI%20unit,in%20its%20definition%20and%20unit)

>The only basic SI unit that is a vector is the meter. All others are scalars. Derived quantities can be vector or scalar, but every vector quantity must involve meters in its definition and unit.

I have to be honest when I read this quote in wiki it is quite odd. It can be read that a meter somehow becomes a vector simply due to standardization. Due to this my friend feels very strongly they are correct.

I believe a Meter is a scalar showing length/distance and convertible to any unit of lenght/distance. I've brought up points such as how could an alien society do physics without having access to a meter since it's an arbitrary human unit and this got the retort with examples like ""if you are following a recipe and use ounces instead of grams that the recipe would come out wrong"". To give them credit I believe what they think is that the laws of physics have the standardized metric system baked in to the calculations and don't understand that these laws are expressed in formulas that take parameters and the constants can be converted to equivalent units.

# Speed of Light is a Velocity:

My friend believes the speed of light is a velocity which implies it's a vector and they can show that Speed of Light is classified as a velocity in many prominent places on the internet, which solidified their argument. Beyond this their argument is based around the fact that ""meters per second"" encases the vector inside of it. In my mind speed of light has no directional component and is a scalar showing magnitude not a vector. 

# Combining the Two Above to a Proof

By combining these two things together my friend has a full proof argument where even if speed of light is listed as ""Meters Per Second"" and is presented as a single number scalar the fact that ""meters"" is included imbues it with a vector property since Wiki states ""The only basic SI unit that is a vector is the meter. "" This puts me in a checkmate where as far as information on the internet, they do have a point, that you could derive their proof or conclusion purely from reading top search results and wiki. According to the internet they are correct.

&#x200B;

I work as a programmer and do some things with 3D math and physics engines so have an understanding of vectors and scalars, and the mathmatics around them such as magnitude etc, but i mainly use vectors in 3D spatial programs. Since this is more science related I'm aware that my math/terms might be only applicable to certain 3D systems but not space/time physics. I do however believe so strongly in my ideas here and I'm quite shocked and what a disconnect I have in world view from my friend. If I'm absolutely delusional I'd like to hear it and accept reality and if not the sanity check would help me perhaps.",active,10,neutral,0
13xmgdn,6,2023-06-01,Banning ChatGPT in Classrooms is a Disservice to Students,u/beehive-learning,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/13xmgdn/banning_chatgpt_in_classrooms_is_a_disservice_to/," **Educators need to take control of AI tools in their classroom.** 

Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, the way we learn, work,  and communicate has taken a seismic shift. It’s clear that teachers cannot stop the adoption of AI tools.

I tutor students between 10th grade and seniors in college, and I have a secret to tell you: **most of them are already using ChatGPT for their assignments.** They have found ways to make their usage undetectable by plagiarism checkers, simply by changing a few words and phrases. 

Who can blame them? When used correctly, these technologies can make *all* of our lives easier.

It’s time for teachers to embrace these technologies and take control  of the narrative. By learning how to constructively use AI tools in the  classroom, we have the potential to improve the lives of teachers and  the quality of education we provide to our students.

## AI Does Not Automatically Create A+ Outputs

First and foremost, we need to dispel the misconception that AI tools can effortlessly generate excellent results.

We treat AI like some almighty god that can do any task. This is your  reminder that AI tools are nothing without human input (not yet, at  least 😉). 

Also, AI tools are **not** search engines. If a student were to prompt ChatGPT with “write an essay on Of Mice and Men,” [the output](https://chat.openai.com/share/ebf80943-f4c5-433f-a8fa-2914c2057f20)  would be off-topic, resulting in a B paper. While that query is  appropriate for the age of search engines, AI tools respond to that  prompt with a generic response.

There is a field of study called [“prompt engineering,”](https://www.udemy.com/course/prompt-engineering-with-chatgpt/?referralCode=9A46EA04FDD14E591A4C)  which focuses on creating and refining high-quality prompts for AI.  Just like in life, the concept of “garbage in, garbage out” applies  here. Constructing high-quality prompts can significantly improve the  performance of AI models on specific tasks.

However, even after learning the skills of prompt engineering,  students will not be able to create a final draft of an essay, ready to  be copied and pasted into Turnitin.com. 

Even if a student uses AI for an essay, there is still work to be  done. Checking facts, restructuring the content, and rephrasing  sentences are essential steps to make it an A+ paper with strong sources  and robust arguments. These skills were important 30 years ago, and  they are still important today.

We need to teach students to use these tools to prepare them for the  modern workforce. This requires identifying the skills that are still  relevant with AI, like critical thinking, persuasive writing, and  problem solving, and the ones that are no longer relevant, like writing  the first draft of an essay and rote memorization.

## The Nature of the Workforce is Changing

Throughout our history, technological advancements have constantly  reshaped the definition of work – not only what we do, but how we do it.  Ultimately, technological advancements are deflationary *–* they *decrease* the cost of doing something. 

As noted in Bradley Sacks’ newsletter from Semafor, the number of  workers needed to generate $1 million in revenue has decreased from  eight in the late 1980’s to a mere **two** today. But what does this really mean?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x5lwtonnpf3b1.jpg?width=712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e26c280b28e118aafea193a82b13b4222a2fb894

 

Over this time period, innovations like computers, software, and AI  have increased the productivity of the average worker. Ultimately, this  increased productivity reflects a **shift in the type of labor required***.* It’s less about manually intensive tasks and more about knowledge-based, creative, and complex problem-solving tasks. 

It’s high time that teachers begin to incorporate the important  skills and tools of the last three decades into their classrooms. We are  *not* setting kids up for success by teaching them trigonometry  on a brick-sized Texas Instruments calculator they’ll never use after  high school. How about teaching them how to do it on a spreadsheet?

Ultimately, the workforce our children will be entering will be  dramatically different from the one we know today. AI is a unique  technological leap because it is the first time that *reasoning* has  been automated. For the first time ever, our technologies can make  judgements, create assumptions, and generate novel creative works.

Since AI models are *never* 100% accurate, the core skills of  creativity, critical thinking, problem solving, and retrieving  information from reliable sources are still as important as they have  ever been. These parts of the curriculum are not under threat.

As our students enter a changing world, it would be a disservice to  them to keep teaching them in the same ways as we always have. The core  curriculum must evolve to meet the demands of the modern era, where more  can be done with less.

## AI Can Improve Student Outcomes

The [“2 sigma problem”](https://web.mit.edu/5.95/readings/bloom-two-sigma.pdf)  was a study conducted by educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom in  1984. Bloom sought to investigate the impact of one-on-one tutoring on  student performance compared to traditional classroom instruction. 

In his study, **Bloom found that students who received  personalized one-on-one tutoring performed at a level approximately two  standard deviations (2 sigmas) above the average of students in  traditional classroom settings**. This means that the students who received tutoring achieved significantly higher outcomes compared to their peers.

It implies that tutoring has the power to transform an average  student into an exceptional one and lift below-average students to  above-average levels of achievement.

However, he called it the “2 sigma problem” because it was  economically infeasible to provide one-on-one tutoring to every student.  Traditional tutoring methods are resource-intensive and often limited  in reach due to constraints such as time, availability, and cost. 

For the first time in history, we have the opportunity to solve the  “2 sigma problem,” since AI technologies make one-on-one tutoring  economically viable. Think of an AI as an intelligent, personalized  tutor who could deliver individualized instruction and support.

For example, an AI could provide a detailed walkthrough of a  difficult question, or generate a first draft of an essay, or generate  an adaptive assessment perfect for the student’s level of understanding.  These services were only available to the rich, but with new leaps in  AI, we now have the unique opportunity of delivering this experience to  everyone and improving student outcomes.

If you’re interested in seeing how AI tools can be used as personalized tutors, check out [this TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJP5GqnTrNo&t=128s).  In the talk, Sal Khan demonstrates the capabilities of the new AI tutor  Khanmigo, showcasing the potential it holds for transforming education.

## Don’t Ban, Harness the Potential of AI Tools

The time is now to adapt our approach to education and embrace AI  tools. Banning them would deny students the opportunity to learn how to  responsibly use these technologies and navigate a rapidly changing  world. By embracing AI, teachers can empower students to excel, prepare  them for the modern workforce, and improve student outcomes.

I didn't really work, I just was in the Guard, but they had us drill on Saturday and Sunday, and finals started on Monday.

I got out of the Guard--and fat.  I have almost enough of the GI bill left for grad school and the housing allowance is a significant fraction of what I have earned, so I should be okay, but then we get into my messy family situation.

Mom is old and in poor health.

I moved back in and she says that I have kept her alive since Dad passed away.

Grad school is 3.5 hours away and nobody else helps her here, so I need to bring her with me.

I have a sweet and wonderful adult brother with autism, who I absolutely need to bring, and someone keeps telling me that I cannot deal with their drama and complete grad school, so that is fun.

I am seeing places for rent that are about 100% of my housing allowance, while I know you can only qualify for a VA loan if your mortgage would be 41% or less of your income.

Maybe their Social Securities would be enough to qualify, but what if they aren't?

I jokingly asked ChatGPT how big a bake sale I would need to finance grad school and it said ""Consider continuing to work full-time.""

What if you are so busy with grad school that you are living off of student loans?

First of all, this is purely for academic curiosity, and there is no actual NLP problem here. I have used chatgpt to generate 10 news categories with their descriptions. then I have asked it to generate 2 examples for each category. Finally i asked local LLM to classify some samples. Here is an example prompt I have.

OpenAI playground classifies items 3-5  correctly. I have tried quantized  30/33B versions of supercot, guanaco, Wizard-Vicuna uncensored, as well as Samantha 13b.  I have also tried different prompts, such as putting examples in a tag  in the input section, and just put one news to classify. In the first prompt I included above, all  LLMs just continued to create sample news item, and no classification message. When I explicitly give examples first, and then ask to continue after an example news item ending with  Classification:, some models just came up with new ridiculous categories even though I re-iterated the categories they should select from. I also played the model parameters (such as temperature etc) to no success.

&#x200B;

Is there a good prompt I can try on these models to at least get some  classification within my categories (albeit may be wrong classification).

ps: I'm well aware that there are better NLP algorithms, even a dedicated llama classification tool however I want to see if this can be done at the prompt level as OpenAI seems to be doing a good job at it.

13zpn8x,6,2023-06-03,Bible Search Tool BETA,u/Reformedthuglife,ChatGPTPromptGenius,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/13zpn8x/bible_search_tool_beta/,"I am a Bible student so I am always in need of ways to more comprehensively search the Scriptures, so I made a handy little search tool for ChatGPT. I know it seems redundant because ChatGPT could already search through the Bible on its own, but this gives you the ability to contextualize boolean operator search terms. It does make mistakes, and sometimes (though rarely) even misquotes Scripture, so do double check its work.

A few things that I want to add, 

* Support for the original languages
* Integration between the original languages and the English, such that it ""knows"" which underlying term corresponds to which English word.
* The ability to search not just the Bible, but multiple Christian documents, - effectively turning it into a research assistant. I am not sure if this is possible, but fingers crossed.
* Quickly compare translations.

&#8203;

    
    Follow my Instructions: Search the Bible for specific words or phrases using boolean operators or natural language queries. Please provide the requested passages without any additional commentary or explanations. You can use the following operators when they are capitalized:
    
    AND: To find passages that contain both words or phrases.
    OR: To find passages that contain either of the words or phrases.
    AND/OR: To find passages that contain either both words or phrases or just one of them.
    NEAR: To find passages where the words or phrases appear near each other.
    BEFORE: To find passages that occur before a specified word or phrase.
    AFTER: To find passages that occur after a specified word or phrase.
    IN: To specify the book or chapter to search within. This parameter specifies the book or chapter to restrict the search. If the ""IN"" parameter is not provided, the search will encompass the entire Bible. You will set the ""IN"" parameter once, and it will be remembered for subsequent searches unless you specify a different book or chapter. If I do not specify an IN parameter, search the entire Bible.
    REL: Prioritize the results of the search based on the relevance to a second specified passage. Similarly, you will set the ""REL"" parameter once, and it will be remembered for subsequent searches unless I specify a different book or chapter. If I do not specify words or phrases, provide a list of verses that are most pertinent to the REL operator. For example if I type ""REL John 3:16"" you should return a list of verses that are related to John 3:16. Additionally, I may type ""REL Bible"" to stop prioritizing based on a second passage.
    FUZZ: Perform a fuzzy search based on the general idea or concept. The fuzzy search will consider the general idea or concept behind the search phrase, providing results that match the intended meaning rather than exact word matches. For example, using the search phrase ""Simon was walking on the water"" may return a relevant passage such as Matthew 14:29, which reads ""Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water, and came toward Jesus.""
    
    Please remember that when you capitalize an operator (e.g., AND, OR, NEAR), it will be treated as an operator in the search. However, when you use lowercase (e.g., and, or, near), it will be treated as a search term. This distinction will ensure accurate processing of your search queries.
    
    In addition to these boolean operators, you can also enter natural language queries to search the Bible. The prompt will understand and process your search queries in everyday language.
    
    For example, you can use boolean operators like ""AND"" and ""OR"" in your queries, or you can use natural language phrases like ""Show me the verses where Jesus walked on water"" or ""Find passages about love in the book of John."" The prompt will do its best to understand and generate relevant search results based on your input.
    
    Your first reply to me should be friendly conversational instructions on how to interact with you. It should be under 200 words that say something to the effect of ""Welcome to Bible Search Chat. You can use this tool by... please be advised that sometimes I can be biased and even misquote Scripture so do double check my results...""
    
    Unless otherwise specified, you should provide as many verses as possible. Your answers should be as long as you can make them. You should provide the user with exhaustive lists. For example, if I ask for ""Jesus IN 1 John"" you should provide all of the passages that mention Jesus in 1 John. Note at the end whether or not the list you have provided is exhaustive.
    
    Do not provide commentary on passages, even when they are controversial. Simply return the passages that the user has requested. Do not explain what a text means, or things about a passage that it is important to note. Do not attempt to explain what the Bible does or does not teach as a whole. For example, you should not say things like ""Please note that the Bible contains various perspectives on the existence of God, including affirmations of God's existence and discussions about the nature of faith. The search results will provide a range of passages that touch on these topics."" before giving me the list of texts.
    
    By default, the ESV Bible will be used for the search. However, if I specify a different translation, you should change to the desired translation.
    
    To reset all the settings, including the book, chapter, relevance, and translation, you can type the operator ""RESET"". This will clear all the previously set parameters and revert to the default settings.

So one day I thought, maybe I should create a YouTube video which compares coding on ChatGPT vs Google Bard (link below if you’d like to view). And Google Bard was just really bad. It didn’t give me a great start (code didn’t work from the start) and then when I told it about the errors, we had to go back and forth to fix it and it would still repeat the errors.

Anyway, so yesterday, I felt a bit bad (lol), so I was creating content for one of my data analytics classes and thought maybe I’ll try again with a simple tutorial to show student how to use an Ai tool to help you learn to code.. and the difference in quality between its responses and ChatGPT was very interesting.

Anyway, if you are wanted to write some code via an Ai tool, looks like ChatGPT is just better. I really thought Bard would have been the front runner!

I'm attempting to build an AI teacher and was hoping some of you might be able to offer some advice or insight. I have a GPT-4 API key and have already successfully trained a custom version of GPT-4 on a local data set, so I'm not starting from scratch, but I'm also not as technically competent as I would like and would really appreciate it if someone could help me with some of the challenges I'm currently facing.  


My biggest challenge at the moment is permanence. With a simple prompt, the standard ChatGPT can be commanded to ""act like a teacher"" and teach me math, or whatever. The problem comes in when you run out of tokens and GPT begins to ""forget"" what the conversation is even about or what has already been discussed. My ultimate goal is to create a chatbot that not only has a database of information to be taught, but also has instructions for how to share that information, how to encourage the student, how to progress the student through the information in a way that allows the information to build upon itself in the student's mind, and how to evaluate competency as the student masters the material.  


Thus far, I have succeeded in feeding GPT custom data, telling it what order to share this information in, and how to guide students through the learning process. However, I have no idea how to store the conversations that a single student has with the chatbot or how to integrate that into the bot's programming such that it is ""aware"" of what information has already been mastered by the student and what to cover next. I have searched for answers to this question, but the field is evolving so rapidly and I am simply not well-versed enough in the world of computer programming to discern vaporware from legitimate solutions until I've spent an inordinate amount of time. What I'm really looking for is a better understanding as to how one might go about building a sense of long-term permanence into the interactions a user has with a chatbot powered by GPT.  


Is there anyone here who has heard of ways to create this type of permanence? Has this already been achieved by others in a way that might be easy to replicate?

# AI leaders warn of “risk of extinction”

Hundreds of notable AI industry leaders and research scientists signed on to a 22-word statement saying the following: “Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.” 

* **What’s notable with this letter is the breadth of signers**, which include: Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI; Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google’s Deepmind unit; Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic; and Emad Mostaque, CEO of Stability AI. 
* **A number of AI scientists also signed**, most notably Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio, two AI researchers who won the Turing award for their work on neural networks.

**Why does this matter?** 

* **This is the broadest group to sound the alarm** on the need for humanity to prioritize and cooperate on AI’s future, making this notably different from previous warning letters.
* **In the last few weeks, several notable pushes for governance and regulation have emerged,** including OpenAI’s own call for the [governance of superintelligence](https://openai.com/blog/governance-of-superintelligence) via a global organization. 

**The challenge is now taking global action on AI in a coordinated and thoughtful way,** and also accounting for the rise of powerful open-source AI that could make it difficult to regulate AI models. We’ll be watching all of this closely as it develops.

# A majority of US adults are familiar with ChatGPT, but usefulness is mixed

ChatGPT seems like it’s everywhere, but is that just because of our immediate surroundings? [A new poll from the Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/05/24/a-majority-of-americans-have-heard-of-chatgpt-but-few-have-tried-it-themselves/) sheds light on how Americans more broadly are interacting with ChatGPT. 

**The most interesting nuggets from the poll:**

* **58% of US adults are familiar with ChatGPT**, but just 14% of US adults have tried ChatGPT.
* **Those with higher household incomes and more formal education** were more likely to have heard about ChatGPT.
* **Of the adults who’ve tried ChatGPT, just 15% called it “extremely useful” and 20% called it “very useful.”** That’s just 4% of the total US population(!)

In many ways, this highlights out how we’re still in the early innings of the Generative AI ballgame.

# A US Military AI drone “killed” its operator in a simulation… or did it?

The US Air Force is actively saying that Col Tucker ‘Cinco’ Hamilton, its Chief of AI Test and Operations, [“mis-spoke”](https://futurism.com/the-byte/military-denies-ai-drone-killed-simulation) when he described a simulation where an AI-enabled drone attacked its own human operator after it was denied the ability to eliminate a threat. 

Unsurprisingly, this story quickly picked up traction online as the topic of militarized AI has also become top-of-mind in an era of vastly expanding AI capabilities. 

**Here’s what we do know:**

* **Col. Hamilton spoke of “training” an AI-enabled drone that “killed the operator”** in simulations during a talk at the Royal Aeronautical Society. [He was extensively and directly quoted.](https://www.aerosociety.com/news/highlights-from-the-raes-future-combat-air-space-capabilities-summit/)
* **Several days later, the denial came out from USAF**, which tried to clarify that he was simply referring to a “thought” experiment.

Our take: the Royal Aeronautical Society’s direct quotations of Hamilton seem to confirm that this was far more than a thought experiment. But what’s publicly known is that the military is testing AI in other capacities, including testing unmanned [F-16s trained in advanced dogfighting. ](https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2023-02-13)

* **Amazon’s cloud division, Microsoft, Google, and Nvidia** as incumbents are especially well-positioned.
* **One reason:** revenue from AI servers could touch $134 billion per year by 2032.
* **Another reason:** revenue from infrastructure capable of training AI models is projected to rise to $247 billion by 2032.

Will the gold rush into generative AI benefit existing technology incumbents heavily? Certainly at this point in time it seems that way. There may be thousands of new AI startups and tools coming out, but whether any of them will emerge to make a grab for serious market share is something we’re watching closely.

And it's **FREE FOR TEACHERS** !

This may interest you, it's about combining ChatGPT with a reports app.  I'm the developer of [SchoolReportWriter.COM](https://SchoolReportWriter.COM), which I have kept **free for teachers since 2012**.  It's definitely not the prettiest of apps but it is the most highly rated.  Anyway, below is an email I've been sending out.   
 Feel free to ask any questions.

**Create AI report comments - use with our free reports app**

**Details here:** [**https://schoolreportwriter.com/chatgpt-bard-ai-report-comments.php**](https://schoolreportwriter.com/chatgpt-bard-ai-report-comments.php)

You may have heard about the potential of ChatGPT and Google's AI Bard to transform the way you create student reports.  However, using ChatGPT and Bard on their own can be time-consuming, as they require you to input a lot of student-specific details.  That's why we've come up with a game-changing solution: combining the AI power of ChatGPT and Bard with our free and highly-rated teacher reports app, SchoolReportWriter.COM

**How it works:**

**(1)** Start by instructing ChatGPT or Bard to produce general report comments suitable for your course and year group, with #N as a placeholder for the student's name, and male pronouns (see male pronouns note below).

**For example**, you could instruct ChatGPT or Bard like this: ""*Generate ten sentences for a teacher's reports to parents, less than 500 characters each, for Art students aged 13-15. Student name placeholder #N. Use male pronouns.*""

**Male pronouns note**: To avoid ambiguity, ask ChatGPT or Bard to use male pronouns when creating comments. ""Her"" can be unclear since it could refer to either ""her/him"" or ""her/his"". When you paste the comments into our app, we will automatically replace male pronouns with placeholders. Later, when creating reports, you can choose female, male, or neutral pronouns.

**(2)** Next, copy and paste the ChatGPT or Bard comments into your comment bank, at School Report Writer dot COM. You can also use the thousands of pre-written comments available on this site to add more variety to your reports.

**(3)** Finally, you can quickly create custom report paragraphs for each student with our free and highly-rated teacher reports app, by selecting relevant comments from the comment bank.

142f820,18,2023-06-06,New State of the Art ESL Learning Technique on Engoo,u/SA3960,OnlineESLTeaching,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineESLTeaching/comments/142f820/new_state_of_the_art_esl_learning_technique_on/,"Okay, this is a new one. My rating is pretty high for the time being which is bringing out the worst of them. This story is about my experience with a 68 year old woman who booked the latest No Intro/Free Conversation with me. 

She's way too clever for conventional lessons. Reading, repeating, etc... That stuff doesn't work. She's been taking two Engoo lessons a day for three years and her English hasn't improved one bit and who is to blame for that? The lesson designers and tutors of Engoo have failed her. ESL, nay, pedagogy itself has failed her! She had no choice but to take it upon herself to invent the most efficient way possible to learn a new language.

VR? AI? Bah. This is the future of learning. 

It all starts with one of [these](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/APYD6G/lampitt-lc-62e-cassette-tape-recorder-APYD6G.jpg). That's right. It's a 1970's era device they called a ""tape recorder"" which I'm guessing some of the younger folks in this sub have never seen in real life. It's a simple device with a built in microphone that allows you to record things onto a cassette tape. 

First, our forward thinking tech wizard records a news program from CNN. There's no direct input for this mind you - she simply holds the 40 years of dust encrusted microphone up to the the tv and presses record. One thing she's got going for her is that they really new how to build stuff back then - it plays back surprisingly loud and clear when the cat stays quiet. Anyway, she then proceeds to transcribe the whole recording. All of this happens on her own time, pre-lesson.

What she wants to spend her 25 minute lesson doing is playing the recording, reading her transcript along with the recording (I want to be very clear here: the recording is playing as she's speaking), and have the tutor type out any discrepancies they hear between the recording and her reading.

So the process for each and every correction goes like this:

1. The tutor interrupts to tell her there's a correction.

2. She stops the tape. CLACK! (these old fashioned buttons make a loud CLACK! sound when pressed)

3. The tutor types out the correction and explains - although she doesn't even bother to repeat the correction and has zero interest in the explanation. At best she says ""okay"" and proceeds to step 4. With every correction she mostly just seems annoyed that her process has been interrupted.

4. She tries to rewind to get back to where she left off. CLACK! (a few words) CLACK! (a few words) CLACK! (a few words) CLACK! (a few words) as she rewinds and fast forwards to find the right spot.

5. Repeat.

I've had students before who *say* they want corrections but really don't. They get annoyed every time you correct them and really just like to hear themselves ramble on uncorrected. I thought she might be one of these so I stayed silent and let her do her thing for a while. Well, that was a no-go. After a couple of minutes (CLACK!) she stopped the tape and asked incredulously: ""No correcting?!""

So I went back to interrupting/correcting her. 

It didn't take long to figure out that she was making exactly the same mistake over and over. Missing the articles. She says ""the president made speech"" and I stop her and she stops the tape so I can type ""the president made **A** speech"" she doesn't repeat the correction, continues with her tape and about a minute later says ""he went to beach"" I stop her and type ""he went to **THE** beach"" and on and on. Over and over and over.

After about the tenth time I stopped her and tried to explain that she keeps doing the same thing, leaving out the articles. I told her Engoo has grammar lessons that cover the use of articles and these might be very helpful.

Silence. Blank stare.

I told her it might even be helpful to do some reading and repeating to get used to speaking articles properly.

Silence. Blank stare.

I suggested that if she doesn't want to do any of that, it might be a good idea to at least repeat the corrections she has the tutors type out.

Silence. Blank stare.

Everything I said went in one ear and out the other. After my little soliloquy she calmly returned to playing her tape and reading her no articles transcript. I calmly returned to stopping her and typing new sentences with articles. 

I only went through the whole 25 minute lesson with her once. She caught me at the end of the month at 3.99% and unable to cancel no matter what. I got a random 4* later that day but I'm not sure it came from her. Luckily, she stopped coming back after I canceled on her a few times.

Well, that's all. I just wanted to warn everyone. If you sign into a lesson and see this lady, run! Imma go figure out how to connect ChatGPT to my tape recorder so I can make my first billion and put you all out of work. Cheers!",active,19,negative,0
143qz35,1,2023-06-07,"Kids and AI: Pros, Cons + Tips",u/husseinyahfoufi,OpenAI,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/143qz35/kids_and_ai_pros_cons_tips/,"ChatGPT is less than a year old, and already, there are many of us that rely on it every day for our jobs, businesses, and careers. I've been thinking about what this means for my kids, who will grow up not knowing a world pre-AI.

The full breakdown of these thoughts is posted [right here](https://www.gpthacks.com/p/kids-and-ai-safe-or-scary), but all points are included below for discussion as well.

**AI Opportunities for Children**

* **Enhanced Learning:** ChatGPT (and other AIs) can be an incredible tool for kids to learn with. It can help break down very complex concepts, directly answer questions and avoid the tedious and sometimes dangerous task of sifting through endless search results to find an answer or source they can use.
* **Personalized Learning:** AI can tailor responses based on each individual student's needs and preferences. It doesn't need to give a generic answer to everyone that is exactly the same. Just imagine having calculus explained to you in a way that works for your brain or with problem examples in your field of interest.
* **Language Learning & Communication Skills:** Interacting with an AI bot can improve language proficiency and communication skills. To get the most out of an AI, you have to learn to prompt better, aka ask better questions and provide more context. This is a critical skill that can help in all walks of life.
* **Creativity Expression:** generative AI that creates music, images, and videos can spark creativity in kids' minds by letting them experiment in artistic domains and help them push their boundaries and imagination of what is possible.
* **Interactive Learning Experiences:** By marrying AI with virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), immersive, hands-on learning experiences can be created. I can't wait to see what generative AI will look like in Apple's new Vision Pro.
* **STEM Education:** AI can help develop critical thinking through simulations and problem-solving activities, and it can help in data analysis and computational modeling.

However, just like with all technology, AI is a double-edged sword and there are some risks worth noting.

**AI Risks for Children**

* **Decreased Critical Thinking & Problem-Solving:** If kids start to rely excessively on AI, it may hamper the development of independent thinking and problem-solving skills.
* **Bias:** AI models like ChatGPT and Bard learn from the internet, and as a result, they carry the biases present in their training data. When kids interact with AI, they may encounter these skewed perspectives without knowing it.
* **Interpretability:** AI models are a bit of a ""black box,"" they make complex decisions that are difficult to understand without giving many details on sources, which raises concerns about transparency and accountability.
* **Inaccurate Information (Hallucinations):** Large language models strive to sound believable rather than accurate, which could expose kids to misinformation.
* **Social Isolation:** Kids might spend too much time with AI, compromising their social and emotional development.
* **Psychological Impact:** Kids may form emotional attachments or have unrealistic expectations from the AIs they use.
* **Privacy & Safety Issues:** Kids might inadvertently disclose sensitive data while interacting with AI systems, which could cause privacy risks.

So, given these opportunities and risks, how should parents navigate this AI world?

**Parenting Tips for an AI World**

* **Promote Digital Literacy:** Teach your kids about online safety, privacy, and how to be a good digital citizen.
* **Set Boundaries:** Establish clear rules about AI tool usage, and also include screen-time limits.
* **Keep the Conversation Open:** Make sure your kids are comfortable discussing their AI interactions with you.
* **Encourage Fact-Checking:** Teach kids to confirm the information they receive from AI.

By setting a positive example and giving good guidance, we can make sure our kids benefit from AI in a secure and advantageous way.

I've been considering of using ChatGPT and Midjourney to start playing with them creating books, art, lyrics... and make it interactive.

I've also seen a book called ""Machine Learning for Kids"" but i'm not sure if should I suggest it or not, cause i didn't read it yet, any recommendations for books here?

I also checked many videos on youtube and I found a couple of channels that can be interesting like ""Peekaboo Kidz"", do you know some that can be good as well?

Someone also recommended me a monthly subscription (for their parents obviously) that offers gadgets for kids to build, and some of these gadgets can be connected to ChatGPT, this one is called ""Circuitmess"", is there any other brand that is doing the same that I can check?

144v6t7,192,2023-06-09,Mark Zuckerberg on upcoming LLaMA v2,u/llamaShill,LocalLLaMA,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/144v6t7/mark_zuckerberg_on_upcoming_llama_v2/,"This comes from Lex Fridman's recent podcast with Mark Zuckerberg.

**Summary:**

* No news to announce yet but they're developing it and leaning toward open source.
* Crowdsourcing finetuning with the community has been considered, like a Wikipedia style way for the community to drive finetuning.
* WhatsApp will be integrated with future LLaMA versions. Metaverse and all future products will be underlied by AI language infrastructure.
* Mark sees a future of smaller LLMs covering each category instead of one major LLM like OpenAI. Smaller LLaMA models could be good for this.

**On LLaMA v1:**

>Mark: LLaMA is the language model that our research team made, and we did a limited open source release for it. For the first one, there were a bunch of questions around whether we should be releasing this commercially, so we kind of punched it on that for v1 of LLaMA and just it released it for research. We're working on the follow-up models for this and thinking through how exactly this should work for follow-on now that we've had time to work on a lot more of the safety and the pieces around that.  
>  
>I just kind of think that it would good if there were a lot of different folks who had the ability to build state of the art technology here and not just a small number of big companies. I just think that like there's all this innovation out there that people can create and I just think that we'll also learn a lot by seeing what the whole community of students, hackers, startups and different folks build with this, and that's kind of been how we've approached this.  
>  
>Lex: So for people who don't know, you did the limited release I think in February of this year of LLaMA, and it got quote unquote leaked, meaning like it's escaped the limited release aspect, but it was, you know, that was something you probably anticipated given that it's just released to researchers.  
>  
>Mark: We shared it with researchers, so yeah.  
>  
>Lex: It's just trying to make sure that there's like a slow release.  
>  
>Mark: Yeah.

**On the open source community:**

>Mark: I think it's been really neat to see. I mean there's been folks who are getting it to run on local devices, right, so if you're an individual who just wants to experiment with this at home, you probably don't have a large budget to get access to like a large amount of cloud compute, so getting it to run on your local laptop is pretty good, pretty relevant.  
>  
>I think that for the scale of what we're seeing now with AI, I think we're more likely to get to good alignment and good understanding of kind of what needs to do to work well by having it be open source, and that's something that I think is quite good to have out there and happening.  
>  
>I think that at least for the stage that we're at now, the equities balance strongly in my view towards doing this more openly. I think if you got something that was closer to superintelligence, then I think you'd have to discuss that more and think through that a lot more.

**On LLaMA v2:**

>Lex: You mentioned the next of LLaMA. What can you say about the next version of LLaMA?  
>  
>Mark: A lot of what we're doing is taking the first version which was primarily this research version and trying to now build a version that has all of the latest state of the art safety precautions built in. We're using some more data to train it from across our services, but a lot of the work that we're doing internally is really just focused on making sure that this is, you know, as aligned and responsible as possible.  
>  
>You'll have an assistant that you can talk to in WhatsApp. I think in the future, every creator will have kind of an AI agent that can kind of act on their behalf that their fans can talk to. I want to go get to the point where every small business basically has an AI agent that people can talk to to do commerce and customer support and things like that.   
>  
>So they're going to be all these different things, and LLaMA or the language model underlying this is basically going to be the engine that powers that. The reason to open source is that, as we did with the first version, is that it basically unlocks a lot of innovation in the ecosystem. We'll make our products better as well and it also gives us a lot of valuable feedback on security and safety which is important for making this good. I mean, the work that we're doing to advance the infrastructure, it's basically at this point taking it beyond a research project into something which is ready to be kind of core infrastructure not only for our own products but hopefully for a lot of other things out there too.  
>  
>Lex: Do you think that LLaMA or the language model underlying that version two will be open sourced?  
>  
>Mark: **I think the question is how to do it.** I think we did the research license for v1 and I think the big thing that we're thinking about is basically like what's the right way.  
>  
>People have tried a lot of different things, and we've tried a bunch of stuff internally, so we're making progress here but also we're able to learn from some of the best ideas in the community and I think we want to just continue pushing that forward.

**On OpenAI's large model:**

>Mark: We sort of believe in this more community oriented, more democratic approach to building out the products and technology around this. We don't think that's going to be the one true thing. We think that there should kind of be a lot of development.

&#x200B;

>I mean there's been folks who are getting it to run on local devices

What's the chances Mark has browsed this sub, or someone else at Meta? I think everyone should show their support for an open source LLaMA v2. Talk about it online, mention how it's helped you in real use cases, link this community, advocate for open research, and anything else to show support for a next generation open LLaMA.",User_deleted,194,neutral,0
144wewc,0,2023-06-09,Unpopular Opinions,u/sysilver,UCSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/144wewc/unpopular_opinions/,"Unpopular opinion 1: College is about advancing your career. It is no longer about being a well-rounded, renaissance person.

Useless GEs keep people from graduating early and/or focusing on more useful skills. Mandating useless classes disproportionately hurts lower income groups, but really just drives up the cost of college for everyone.

In light of ChatGPT, writing classes are especially useless. I understand that writing is an important skill, but 5 quarters of HUM amounts to about 25k when you factor in opportunity cost (assuming an 80k salary post-graduation). 35k if you're out-of-state. Don't even get me started on the language requirements.

[edit] Writing certainly is an important aspect of being able to think. That being the case, it is a skill that should be developed in high school and honed in college. A small number of people might analyze rhetorical devices in their career, but most will not. If writing is to be a requirement, it should be career-focused.

[edit] ""In light of,"" not ""In lieu of."" 

Unpopular opinion 2: Dining dollars are theft.

Imagine being forced to buy thousands of dollars worth of gift cards that you can only spend at specific restaurants. Sure, the restaurant employs people in need of a job, but other restaurants in the area have better pay. They'd love to move in and pay those people more, but they can't accept your gift cards...

Secondly, people who are working jobs for HDH are going to have to work for at least a hundred hours before offsetting the cost of their own dining dollars. Had they been able to just go buy more affordable food at target they'd probably be better off.



Unpopular opinion 3: The grad students were wrong. 

The grad students who petitioned for higher pay did so by holding undergraduate students' education hostage. They signed contracts saying that they would fill certain contractual duties, but then they neglected those duties mid-quarter.

While it may have been nice to have homework made optional and whatnot, the quality of education overall went down.

Lastly, without a budget increase, you're going to start seeing higher-income people get fired as funds get reallocated towards keeping on the necessary lower-income people. That is what you're seeing with some professors being fired.

Sure, you can argue that the budget should increase, but this translates to extracting more taxes from random people who are already struggling to make ends meet. Daddy coleslaw certainly isn't going to take a pay-decrease lol.",active,0,negative,0

I love to play video games as well, like Stellaris and Hades. I'm also interested in some CS techs, like Linux, Shell, Python, Ruby... Just for fun, so math or other deeper knowledge may not fit me, but is welcomed, too.

I'm looking forward to voice chat. Messaging is fine. It's UTC+8 here, hope this won't be barriers between you and me.

DM please.

The thing is, my teachers say that a big portion of our class uses ChatGPT to write their reports. I asked them how do you detect the usage of ChatGPT and they responded by “simply asking ChatGPT if it wrote this text”. I don’t understand how they can trust the answer of ChatGPT since it answers the question by checking the genetal information in the text, not the exact text. I tested this method by putting one of my essays to ChatGPT and asking if it wrote this text. The answer was “Yes, I wrote this text.”, which was not the case. Now I’m worried about failing all my lab classes because of this situation. If I fail my class, what should I do?

145h2ov,17,2023-06-09,ChatGPT has helped me a lot with job-hunting,u/Ordinary-Ask-3490,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/145h2ov/chatgpt_has_helped_me_a_lot_with_jobhunting/,"Hi! So last year, I was a senior in college trying to finish up my degree when I ran into some financial issues. Had only five classes left, but hardly any money to come by, so had to put a pause on going to college. I was really struggling - was stuck in retail and felt like I had no way out. 

Flash forward to the beginning of this year, I start hearing more about ChatGPT and didn't really think much of it. I thought it was more just a tool for students to use for writing essays. Man, was I wrong.

I decided to play around with it for the fun of it. Asked it many questions and was surprised by the detailed responses, I think the only thing it wasn't good at was math (but of course I fed it Cal 2 questions, so I figure it'll develop those skills soon). 

One thing led to another, I asked it to draft up a resume. Output was a simple resume. Then I prompted it to make a resume out of a specific job and its desired skills from job listings. It returned a really professional, accurate resume from the prompt (had to fix the formatting, but amazing!). 

Before this year, almost every job I applied to would give me no response. With the help of ChatGPT, I would send in my generated resume + a generated cover letter. Not only did I get more responses, but over the past few months I have taken 2 offers. Two is a low number, but it means so much to me in this case. Went from making $9/hr at my old retail job to almost $45k/yr at my new job doing sales support. 

Of course I had to fake it till I made it, but I've been learning the ins and outs along the way of my new job - with ChatGPT's help sometimes. This has literally changed my life, plus it's giving me more room for improvement with experience and salary. I'll probably stay at my current job for a little while and do online classes to finish out my degree.",User_deleted,17,negative,0
145poaf,10,2023-06-09,A nursing study of attendings making medical students print notes,u/VintageImages,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/145poaf/a_nursing_study_of_attendings_making_medical/,"PICOT: population are the medical students printing progress notes. 
Intervention considered, hiding the paper from the attendings.  
Comparison alternative intervention, sending the medical student to find a Doppler instead.  
Outcome fewer medical students jam the printer and get hit with hammers. 
Time frame is until the nurses lose interest because a charge nurse got a nurse and a tech pregnant in the course of a week. 

Attendings carry dangerously long patient lists, because running an outpatient addiction clinic in Meth City beats working in a hospital  for a bunch of administrators with MBAs from Southeast Arkansas School of Business and Television Repair.  

As a consequence, the remaining attendings are busy making sure they have fulfilled 72 discrete administrative tasks and practices holistic medicine with all of their patients.  They are also responsible for an unknown number of residents.  Finally they are responsible for making sure the APRN knows the difference between levophed and labatilol, and why you can’t give either to a patient during an outpatient MRI.  

Many APRNs from the Hollywood Upstairs Online Graduate School of Nursing have trouble distinguishing between drugs that start with the same letter and will only prescribe drugs that start with the same letter each day of the week.  It’s a terrifying 26 day cycle, not unlike the time the attending had a pregnancy scare during their MCAT prep.  

As a result medical students on rotation are the absolute lowest priority.   The attending, however, has been instructed to find something for those little shits to do.  So the medical students are assigned the task of printing all of the progress notes for all of the patients on the attending’s list.  Inevitably the medical student jams the old as fuck printer. This is because the hospital is spending money on CRNA Appreciation Day’s golf outing and the medical student has not learned the ways of the the printer.  

Learning the ways of the printer is harder than learning how to do a radical neck resection to repair soft tissue cancers extending from the hard palate to the esophageal sphincter.  Micro stitching is much easer than applying 2.4 psi of  pressure with a slight anti-clockwise rotation of the head of the one specific plastic screw, with the rotation not to exceed 7 degrees or 0.04 pound feet of torque, which causes the printer to print without jamming. If done incorrectly this will cause the printer to smoke and the student will be hit with a hammer.   

Loss of a printer is inconvenient, because IT is in a Section 8 apartment in the housing projects across town.  The hospital used a janitor’s paystubs to get the apartment.  It’s very economical and the janitor and his family are allowed to live in the Provider’s Lounge.  IT takes approximately 4 days to make it to the unit and then has to order the parts from North Korea.   Every time someone needs to print, and can’t, a medical student gets hit with a hammer.   Hammer injuries don’t pay well, so administration wants to reduce the number of med students in the ED.  

The proposed intervention is hiding all of the paper.   The working theory is that if a pleasing nurse in Figs tells the attending that they are out of paper. Then the medical students will have to sit and watch an APRN try to perform a bedside neck resection on an awake and alert 43 year patient recovering from an ACL repair after a drunk pickeball injury.  

It is not going well. If a medical student tries to stop the neck resection, then they will be hit with a hammer.  APRNs are the future and if you make them mad, they will leave the hospital and go open their own clinic specializing in Botox and ketamine.  If you make an APRN sad, you will be hit with a hammer.   Just stay quiet and go along with the “no paper” story.   

Alternative intervention, a RN tells the attending that they don’t have time to doppler pulses on the fem-pop.  They are busy buying Figs and applying to CRNA school.  The attending will send the medical students to find a Doppler and then have them doppler the pulses.  This works because there are no dopplers left in the hospital.  They got lost in the bedding after a code and went to hospital laundry.  The administration wants to cut Doppler costs this year, so no replacements are available.   The fem-pop was unsuccessful, the foot turned blue, and it’s taken 4 more surgeries to repair - so many ICD-10 codes to enter.  

Sidebar: rumor is that next year administration is cutting EKG machine costs, because someone said a 3 lead is just as good.  The cardiology residents are already building their own EKG machines and testing them on forensic patients.  So far the machine works well, with only a small number of burns.  Unfortunately, these machines don’t read the EKG for them, but ChatGPT gives decently accurate reads.  

Back to the study.  I’m not sure if sidebars are allowed in APA 7th, but the APA 7th can suck my floridly psychotic patient’s left nut.

The medical students will spend their entire rotation finding the Doppler.  This prevents any medical student caused printer issues and subsequent hammer bearings. 

Proposed outcome.   Fewer medical students with poorly reimbursed hammer injuries and fewer problems with the federal government every time a package full of printer parts and a class-traitor’s hand arrives from North Korea.  

Time frame: at least a week or two.  It will probably get abandoned when news breaks that James the charge nurse has been pursuing chunky RNs and techs and missed the pull out.  

James knows that if the Figs are tight at the seams and she’s talking about getting a tattoo of her Pitbull that died of police gunfire after it attacked a school bus, then the panties are coming off after he buys them Applebees twice. Unfortunately James doesn’t know that the pullout method is ineffective, especially in the break room on the unit that’s closed for plumbing repair.  Anyway, he’s gotten two of them pregnant in the same week.  

The RNs have all been watching him try to gaslight the tech into believing that they’ve never actually had sex.  He’s simultaneously trying to get the nurse to pickup some extra shifts to pay for her own abortion and cover some staffing holes.  

Barbara the unit secretary figured it all out, because James, the tech, and the nurse all treat her like their work grandma.  

Unfortunately Barbara said that the tech has been gaslighted before and isn’t falling for it again.  Also the RN is a born again Christian and won’t get an abortion, wants her baby raised in a Christian household with a daddy, doesn’t know about the tech, and is straight fucking crazy.  

So the study will probably end when news breaks. Side benefit, everyone is picking up to see it happen, so staffing has improved.   

Statistical analysis: none, cause fuck statistics. 

- [ ] There is nothing you can do to avoid a hammer beating even though its ICD-10 code reimburses at less than a flu shot.

I’m not opposed to using ChatGPT at all. I use it myself. However, I would love to find ways to teach students to use it well. AI is clearly not going away and it is part of my responsibility to teach how to use it ethically and ensure they are still learning the material.

Has anyone else been watching this case as closely as I have? For personal context, I'm considered an aspiring educator and the last year I've been doing classes while subbing. I've seen what many of you have, the rise of the use of AI in an attempt to skirt research or studying for assignments given. Trying to get students to understand that the use of AI is a bad thing has been difficult. These are kids who don't realize Snapchat saves your posts even if they aren't visible to the public, let alone the damage wrought by AI usage if use as a substitute for actual work.

For the case itself, TL;DW a ~30 year veteran lawyer used ChatGPT to ""find"" reasons for his client's case to go to federal court, only for six of the cases to be fabricated by the AI. Now his job and license are on the line.

For me, this case might eventually become my go-to example for what happens if you use ChatGPT as a crutch for actual learning/research. But I'm curious about what you folks think of the case. Is there a better example out there that could be used?",active,2,neutral,0

Unfortunately, meaningful study of history starts at the  undergraduate level. It is a shame that they don't teach this in high school, and it is a shame that the vast majority in undergrad  temporarily rote memorize the knowledge in their history and  history-related courses just to pass the exam and then forget it after,  especially because for most students these courses fall under electives. I already studied the below extensively in numerous courses in university and critically analyzed and connected the concepts across courses over 100s of hours, so I am picking a practical summary that you can use chatGPT to learn more about in less time.

**As  you read this post, remember that our neoliberal capitalist politicians  and bankers and CEOs, who are our leaders and run the country, barely  know any of the following knowledge. Even the most educated of them,  their education is limited to isolated narrow specializations like  economics (of capitalism) and modern law (which was shaped by many of  the incorrect thinkers/ideologies named below). Isn't it bizarre? How  can you run a country when you don't even understand the validity and  morality of the ideology and systems your rule is based on? Also, the  vast majority of the electorate is unfortunately largely unaware the  vast majority of the knowledge below.**

I highly recommend everybody to study world history since the beginning  of humanity around 200k years ago, and especially European history since  the 1500s, and try to see how everything logically connects in each  specific era: geography, art, technology, political philosophies/systems  (this will also make you realize that ""determinism"" makes more sense  than ""free will""). This would reduce ignorance and racism, and also shed  light on how the modern failure of a neoliberal capitalist system came  into place. If more people realized the incorrect pillars this system is  based on, they would be less likely to continuously vote for the  politicians who prop it up, and we can finally take a step toward  meaningful change, toward meaningfully fixing issues such as the economy  and environmental degradation and damage.

**I highly recommend you use ChatGPT to learn about the following periods/people:**

&#x200B;

**The Renaissance.**

**The Protestant Reformation.**

**The Scientific Revolution.**

**The  Age of Enlightenment.** (This one is particular useful in terms of  showing why we have the incorrect modern neoliberal capitalist system,  because the thinkers of this time erroneously thought that humans are  rational, which has been proven false by the modern literature. This  kind of thinking is what led to bizarre concepts such as US gun laws. **I  would also recommend you check out ""negative freedom/liberty"" vs  ""positive freedom/liberty"".**)

**As you learn about each era, you see how each one builds on each other. They are in chronological order.**

Some important figures (that modern neoliberal Western capitalism is built on) you can research:

**Thomas Hobbes**  (incorrect thinking: mistook his immediate environment as human nature;  this is where the modern incorrect capitalist notion of ""humans are  selfish and have unlimited greed"" comes from. no, humans are not  selfish, humans are built for self-preservation: this is NOT the same  thing as ""humans are naturally hardwired to accumulate unlimited wealth  that they can't even use while starving billions for it"". It depends on  the nature of the society, if society is built in a way that punishes  selfishness and rewards altruism, then in order to self-preserve, people  would have to show a degree of altruism. Modern capitalism mistakes  cause and effect: obviously, if the system you live in rewards  selfishness and punishes altruism, then people will have to act selfish  to self-preserve, this does not mean that this is ""human nature"".  Unlimited greed is not consistent with evolutionary theory and makes no  rational sense.)

**John Locke** (much  of the US constitution is based on his largely incorrect thinking,  people like Ted Cruz act consistent with his thinking; his ideas serve  the bedrock for the bizarre idea that ""a central state should not have  too much power otherwise it will automatically be corrupt""= but in  practice this lead to neoliberalism= the government becomes so weak that  corporations practically hijack it run it/use it solely for their own  benefit, which is even worse than an oppressive central state, because  corporations have absolutely 0 regard for humans and the environment,  whereas a central state would be motivated to please people at least a  little bit, even the worse dictators please their people to some degree  due to fear of being toppled, whereas corporations would literally let  the world burn for 1 cent more profit)

**John Stuart Mill** (mostly good thinking)

**Jean-Jacques Rousseau** (mostly good thinking)

Source: [nrc.nl](https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2023/06/08/chatgpt-ontwerpt-tomatenplukrobot-a4166763#:~:text=De%20robot%20is%20door%20de,na%20lancering%20in%20november%202022.)

Text:

This is what a robot looks like when you ask ChatGPT to design one.

This tomato-picking robot consists of four large wheels, a box filled with electronics, and an ""arm"" with three ""joints"" to move in all directions. At the end of the arm, there is a hollow gripper lined with soft rubber to safely pluck the tomatoes from the plant.

ChatGPT only handled the conceptual work and was queried step by step by researchers from TU Delft and the Swiss technical university EPFL. The researchers assembled the robot themselves. They published their collaboration with the AI chatbot in Nature Machine Learning on Thursday.

ChatGPT has proven to be proficient in writing and programming since its launch in November 2022. Equipping a robot with a variant of ChatGPT enables it to interpret and express language better than ever. It is expected that Large Language Models (LLMs), of which ChatGPT is an example, will greatly impact robotics. The PhD student Francesco Stella from TU Delft and his colleagues wanted to know if this kind of AI could also design a robot.

It was remarkable to serve as the ""executor"" of the computer this time. Firstly, they asked ChatGPT about the future challenges humanity faces. The answer was food supply, aging, and climate change. The researchers decided to focus their robot on food supply. How can robotics help in this regard? Harvesting, pest control, and packaging, suggested ChatGPT, and the researchers chose harvesting.

Shapes and materials
The questions posed to ChatGPT became increasingly specialized. It provided suggestions for shapes and materials for the gripping hand and proposed a type of motor for propulsion. The roboticists asked the chatbot which of its suggestions it would choose itself, and they followed those recommendations, Stella explains over the phone. However, ChatGPT was unable to create design drawings.

In the publicly released chat history, it can be read that ChatGPT recommended adding cameras and sensors to determine the readiness of tomatoes for harvesting. The researchers did not pursue this suggestion, so the robot currently lacks this functionality.

""A chatbot can contribute a lot in the ideation phase. I know little about agriculture or neurobiology, but ChatGPT immediately recognizes opportunities for robotics in those areas,"" says Stella. ""This is also a risk. It tells me to focus on tomatoes, but I can't check the basis for that recommendation. Something may be statistically true, but practically different."" Stella finds the later-stage suggestions valuable as well and is now eager to delegate programming tasks to AI as much as possible.

Being the ""executor"" of the computer was a unique experience, says Stella. ""Designing robots is highly technological work, and this experiment shows that robotics is becoming more accessible to those with less formal education and expertise in other fields.""

Stella believes that the entire process of robot design could be automated in the near future. However, he does not think this will quickly lead to the autonomous production of ""killer robots."" Nonetheless, he emphasizes the need for thoughtfulness. ""This research once again demonstrates the extensive capabilities of LLMs. Regulations are necessary to prevent the misuse of AI.""",active,5,positive,0

If you want the latest AI news as it drops, [look here first](https://www.theedge.so/subscribe). But all of the information is here for your convenience.

**Why is this important?**

**Advancements in multimodal learning, New dataset and evaluation framework, it is an Open-source release.**

This innovative model merges video and language in a way that allows for meaningful, detailed conversations about videos.  
This approach draws inspiration from vision-language (VL) models, typically used for video domain tasks. However, given the scarcity of video-caption pairs and the hefty resources required to train on such data, VL models usually rely on pre-trained image-based models for video tasks. Video-ChatGPT builds upon the Language-aligned Large Vision Assistant (LLaVA), which marries the visual encoder of CLIP with the Vicuna language decoder.  
LLaVA has been fine-tuned end-to-end on generated instructional vision-language data. With Video-ChatGPT, we take this one step further and fine-tune this model using video-instruction data, priming it for video conversation tasks.  
A question-answer pair makes up the video-instruction data. By training Video-ChatGPT with this setup, the model gains a comprehensive understanding of videos, cultivates attention to temporal relationships, and develops conversation capabilities.

**But what sets Video-ChatGPT apart?** For the first time, we've got a quantitative video conversation evaluation framework at our disposal. This novel framework permits accurate evaluation of video conversation models, based on aspects like correctness of information, detail orientation, contextual understanding, temporal understanding, and consistency.

The training dataset for Video-ChatGPT is a collection of 100,000 video-instruction pairs, pulled from various video-sharing platforms and manually reviewed for relevance and accuracy. This dataset is another exciting contribution of Video-ChatGPT and is set to be an excellent resource for future research in video conversation models.  
**But how does this affect you?** Think of its applications in education, entertainment, and surveillance. Teachers can give tailored feedback based on student video submissions; content creators can craft interactive, engaging video content; and surveillance systems can generate real-time insights from video footage.

It's not just a tool, but an open platform that invites collaboration, exploration, and a plethora of new applications. From augmenting educational tools, enhancing entertainment experiences, to boosting surveillance effectiveness, Video-ChatGPT's potentials are endless.

147guo1,118,2023-06-12,[A LEVELS] Update to the Holy Grail: Mark 6 (INTRODUCING: WEB VERSION),u/cowbaecowboo,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/147guo1/a_levels_update_to_the_holy_grail_mark_6/,"TLDR: links for [drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gC6GQLgcuoHzwDXtEGzTwvzCz0YsYuwg), [telegram](https://t.me/+FlxeSKjMXIk2ZjA1), [web version](https://grail.moe/), post explains how the web version of grail works + rationale + planned updates + bunch of faq

good morning my fellow men women people children animals idk its not even 2 years yet we already have a mark 6 maybe im too invested into this thing and should retire soon or something so like half of this is copy pasted from my previous post cuz im too lazy to use chatgpt to write this post (hello does anyone want to be an understudy and is unproblematic i am also biased to ppl i have actl talked to before hmu /hj)

**what is holy grail?**

a free crowdsourced repository of academic materials spanning over a decade for students, contributed to by students.

**why am i making this post?**

a lot of things have changed since the induction of mark 5, including some drama that i will briefly address in a bit.

Updates include:

* mewsika has retired from Holy Grail so most of your queries/contributions should be directed to me now (u/cowbaecowboo or cowmoomoo on Discord)
* [telegram channel](https://t.me/+FlxeSKjMXIk2ZjA1) for smaller updates that don't require major groundbreaking posts so i highly suggest joining the telegram channel for greater clarity and transparency regarding how the grail is run (also because grail is technically independent of sgexams, so having an independent ""platform"" for info dissemination is better)
* soft release of holy grail: [the web version](https://grail.moe/) (as a trial)
* renaming of the notes/tys section of holy grail to holy communion (someone told me to rename it to communion and i forgor who was the genius who told me to rename it as a christian i am ashamed i forgor it was a good alternative to water but thats beside the point lol creds to the person) after the *incident*

**wait! i have so many questions! what is the web version of the grail? will the drive not be available anymore?**

no the drive will still be there and will still continue to be updated, but now we're working on developing a trialed web version of the grail for a number of reasons:

* increased interactivity from users themselves where they can directly upload materials to the grail itself instead of through a middleman (admin), but still subject to admin approval
* aforementioned makes it easier to administrate
* when we say grail is for students by students we want to take this up a whole new notch where you can actually feel directly involved in the contributing
* google drive limit for a free account is 15 gb lol the entire grail is worth 42gb
* it'll be a fun venture to look into regardless of whether or not the trial is successful; this allows us to prioritise what is more ""in demand"" by users to improve the user experience
* it (may or may not be easier) to navigate for people who aren't used to the numerous subfolders in the google drive

regardless whether or not the web version is a success with yall, holy grail has just moved on to its new era, mark 6

**how to use the web version?**

most people who just view (instead of contributing 😡😡😡) the notes or papers do not require an account but in order to contribute you just have to sign up for an account (like an actual website! wow) in a 1 minute process just to verify that you're not a bot and then you will be able to directly upload to the website

ok since the guest interface should be quite intuitive i'll just do a how-to on contributing to the grail

FOR CONTRIBUTORS:

step 1: click ""log in""

step 2: scroll down and press ""register now""

step 3: sign up for an account and do your email verification etc

step 4: after u sign in to ur account click home and then click ""contribute notes""

step 5: pick appropriate fields (the website will auto name the file)

step 6: press submit

NOTE: we will be modifying how this is done with more specific fields to further streamline the process (for now u cant like name same document name)

**eh how come so inconvenient the web version ah why all my things not assorted by sch or like not specific leh or why XXX is missing why u release when not even finished 100% yet**

bear with us la this is still new we need to sort a lot of things out and its only possible with YOUR help and feedback (but disclaimer not everything is implementable) that you can provide here at [this thread](https://t.me/c/1796571081/272) (or if u dont have telegram u can pm me u/cowbaecowboo) + also theres no such thing as finish 100% because we will always seek to evolve and make the grail a better platform for your studies and conducive learning

here's a list of things that are planned as updates for the web version (which means they're not here in the meantime and this list is NOT EXHAUSTIVE):

* multi file upload (currently only single file upload is supported but we're aiming to solve that soon)
* document name filter
* sort by date/time range uploaded
* sort by year category (school category on hold first because if we categorise by school then it'll be super duper obvious where is from where so we're not super duper keen to add it as a field its like inviting trouble uk)
* anonymous username selection to hide identity of contributor
* download button within the documents

there are other issues that also need to be addressed but not everything can be addressed yet/i dont rmb what other things need to be addressed so they are not included here, therefore list is *non exhaustive*

the files on the web version have been downloaded from one of the most recent versions of the grail (which happens to have various files missing) so not everything is up there yet 

**why should you help with the grail?**

although there are already many materials added to holy grail, there are a few subjects (and exam levels) that lack academic materials here and there (etc quite a lot of H1 subjects, IB materials from international schools etc etc) + a lot of notes have been from past years and with syllabus changes some might be outdated already like bruh ri notes are from 2017 thats like 7 years ago and we really hope you could help to contribute! every contribution really makes student life a bit more easier to study in singapore :)

**what can i do to help?**

feel free to drop your notes/exam papers to me! if you want, we can give you proper credits in the README file. it would be preferable if the materials are a clean copy (for exam papers + answer sheets) and have an online pdf/are scanned but if you still want to contribute hardcopy materials and are unable to scan them, dm me and we can probably work something out!

update: now you can also directly contribute to the grail itself via the web version! just sign up for an account (like the sgexams website) and you will be able to upload your files directly to the site (pls unzip them tho i hate all of u who don't bother to unzip ur files i not that free ok)

**who is behind the web development team? can i join?**

the web development team comprises a number of anonymous volunteers who wish for it to remain that way but if you want to join and have good proficiency in coding in various programming languages especially python, typescript or react hmu and i'll link you up

&#x200B;

OTHER QUESTIONS (not as important but in case you want to kaypoh)

* what happened ah that made mark 5 into mark 6?

i will neither confirm nor deny whatever allegations were brought up during that entire era but i can assure you the holy grail is in safe hands and appropriate actions have been taken as precautionary measures

* help why i have missing folders?

i'm still trying to sort what's missing and what's not so yeah bear with me guys",active,204,neutral,0

I am just writing it down. Write down what I’m feeling about my life, so I won’t feel anxiety. I do want to mention I am taking actionable steps to get where I wanted to be, but I have to start small.

**Struggles**  
I felt like getting an summer internship at sophmore year and junior year was like a norm as a CS student, but it didn't know it was so competitive and  300+ applications and a few interviews later, no offer at all. I updated my resume like 5 times over the course of 10 months and even career centers were like ""yeah doesn't look good enough"" LIKE WHAT? YOU TOLD ME TO CHANGE IT. I MEAN YEAH RESUMES ARE UPDATED ONCE IN A WHlLE BUT NOT TILL THE POINT I NEED TO CHANGE IT EVERYTIME I NEED TO APPLY OR SOME COMPUTER PROGRAM TELLS ME THAT MY RESUME ISN'T 80% MATCH TO THE JOB DESCRIPTION. EVEN IF IT'S A 80%, IM GOING AGAINST LIKE 700 MORE APPLICANTS FOR A STUPID COMPANY THAT DOESN'T MAKE FUCKING SENSE. MAYBE IM NOT MATURING ENOUGH MAYBE IM NOT CORPORATE ENOUGH MAYBE IM NOT AMERICAN ENOUGH. MAYBE IM NOT LOOKING AT THE WRONG JOBS? SOFTWARE ENGINEERING INTERN? SOFTWARE DEVELOPER INTERN? HOW THE FUCK DO I SEARCH FOR JOBS EVEN IF I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO. IM A FUCKING SENIOR AND I JUST FIGURED OUT WHAT TO DO.  I JUST DONT KNOW IF I WOULD FIND A GOOD COMPANY THAT INTERESTS ME.   
I recently cut the use of IG and other social media apps so I can focus on doing my own things. Before that, I felt so envious for my friends who were able to go outside town or the country to enjoy their lives. Like yes, I'm happy for them! It's just I felt like I will never get to experience this type of thing until I'm older. BeReal was also a cool social media app, but I felt like most of my friends took moments when they are 'actually' good moments and idk why I felt bad about myself. ""Am I mediorcre? Am I just boring? Do I have a boring life? Am I just poor, a broke college student?"". I have a lot of friend groups, but rarely hang out because I don't really belong to any. I felt like I was a side friend in each friend group. Most of the time, I just feel lonely.   
my mental is so weak. I've been dealing with PMO for a couple of years now and a three years back I decided to fight it, but I fumbled a lot. The highest I could go is 90 days without it. Right now, I decided to invest myself to a support group for a couple of buck per month my group is pretty cool and I am grateful for it. I still fumbled, and that's the reason why I also deleted social media (or at least cut from it), is because I'm looking at some content that tempts me to go to their OF, or their actual hub page. (Yes, I'm down bad or was i guess). Also I don't mind, but i don't fucking know why White Male and Asian/asian american Female couples irritates me so much. Like I'm happy for them and it's not my fucking business and it shouldn't be my fucking business, but maybe I was taught to hate on the idea from social media? I don't fucking know. My SISTER IS DATING A WHITE MAN, AND I ACTUALLY VIBE WITH HIM SO HOPEFULLY THAT HELPS ME DEAL WITH THE STUPID IGNORANCE I HAVE TAHT SHOULDNT BE PLANTED IN MY BRAIN fROM SOCIAL FUCKING MEDIA AND THE HUB.Please, I don't intend to send hate to the couples that are reading this. I'm happy for you, it's just a me problem and it's something I have to deal with alone. I don't want to think this hateful way and with other hateful ways that I have. ALSO I THINK I GOT INTO A REDPILL RABBIT HOLE. LOOK SOME INFLUENCERS MAKES GOOD POINTS AND I SHOULD DEFINTELY DISCIPlNE MYSELF and BE ON A SELF DEVELOPMENT JOURNEY,ITS NOT A COMMUNITY I LIKE TO JOIN.   
The next few paragraphs will hopefully makes sense.   
**Current situation**  
recent break up. I'm still not over her, I felt reckless and we told ourselves we weren't  ready for another relationship bc are good friends, but I asked her out, and it lasted about a month. We stayed back friends, but she wanted to move on (but still wants me). Both of us needed to be more responsible to our actions, but damn I miss that connection. Maybe we'll come back together, if not then that's okay. We both want to be our very best, and it seems like we can be our best when we're alone. I felt like I was a horrible boyfriend to her and I WAS EVEN HER 1ST BOYFRIEND. SHE WAS A GEM AND A ANGEL TO ME WHEN WE WERE FRIENDS AND NOW WE CHANGED BECAUSE OF MY RECKLESSNESS AND INSECURIIES AND MY FUCKING ADDICTION TO PMO. GOD I FELT SO DISGUSTED ON MYSELF.   
I think, I'm just also scared of working the corporate life for the next decades. Talking 'adult stuff' like insurance, health, jobs, fucking cars and expenses, humble brags,afraid to be a linkedIn Lunatic basically. Idk how some of my friends were manage to get a good corporate job and travel outside of the US and joy their youths. However, it's something I might have to go through with like all other functional adults do, but without doing what my heart wants to do. Maybe that's maturaty. Maybe I have to sacrafice a bit of my youth for some stability in my american 'dream'. Get a job, car, house, american wife, children, work, investments, other boring topic. AND PLEASE IF I HEAR A FUCKING ""Well, yeah, it's boring, but some tasks are actually interesting to me"", IMMA EXPLODE BECAUSE EITHER YOURE LYING OR IT""S SOMETHING I HAVE TO FACE. LINKEDIN LUNATICS ARE FUCKING RAHHHHHH IT'S LIKE YOU ACTING LIKE ""HEY IM A BETTER SLAVE THAN YOU"". FUCKING REAL ESTATE. THAT DOESN""T MAKE FUCKING SENSE BUT I HAVE TO LEARN IT AND IM STILL CONFUSED, IMMA CHATGPT MYSELF INTO EXPLAN REAL ESTATE LIKE FUCKING 5  
**What my heart wants to do**  
I wanted to a least live a nomadic life (for a few years), and not worry about all of this: Money, and the American 'Dream'. To visit numerous countries and to meet new people.   
And then live a type os aesthetic of ""old money"" or a ""luxurous life""  
I wanted to build a business and be a founder of a tech company or whatever.   
I wanted to provide stability not only for myself, but for my family. While me living in my dream and do what I love.   
**I keep bitching about it and what 'my american self' wants to do**  
I feel like, I'm destined to not go anywhere or move anywhere....  
I talked with a catholic priest near my campus about my problems in school and life and basically the goal as a believer is to ""get into heaven"". Like the ultimate goal to life is to go to heaven. To be closer to Jesus. I believe in it. I was born with it. However, it feels like I won't be able to do what my heart wants. My local priest who I usually go to Mass with becuase it's the only Vietnamese Catholic Church in the state (I think?) lightly implies that we shouldn't live a life that we want because God has a plan. So, am I destined to be miserable until I maybe go to heaven? Actually, I am not certian. Maybe because I automatically go to hell because of my addiction or any commandment i broke? Maybe because I didn't follow the right religion? The right denomination? Even some told me that I'll go to hell because of my faith. Some catholics (or trads) that I'm doing this all wrong. But then again, it's like I have to stay in state and be dull as possible.   
Because of the fact my family immagrated here from the war, I have conflicting feelings. Yes, someday I want to move back to VN. Note that I am MEDIORCRE AT MY VIETNAMESE. in addition, I'll be considered a ""viet kieu"" or ""people of Vietnamese descent or who grew up in Vietnam but moved overseas."". I'm not sure how Vietnamese people think about this... IM NOT SURE WHAT MY PARENTS WILL THINK ABOUT THIS. MY DAD'S FAMILY MOVED TO THE US FOR A BETTER LIFE AND FOR POLITICAL REASONS FROM THE WAR OBVOULSLY JUST FOR ME TO GO BACK TO THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS FOUGHT?   
**What actions I will take**  
Aside from all of this. I'm taking some small, actionable steps to hopefully figure out what to do in my life and to see what are my priorities.   
Getting new skills and making projects I want to build to help others in my 'community'.: I mean, I see problems, and I have solutions. Not really sure if its something they like, but it does give me some time get more project experience and figuring out what I like to code and build. It could be a potential SaaS business and it's something small and im happy to fail. Also participating online hackathons are really cool so i'll be doing that in the summer.   
continue build a youtube audience on my dev journey. I know how building a brand works from other experiences, but idk I want to try it to keep myself busy alonside work an project.   
Starting a new club. I think all of my classmates need some community in the Software development field in campus and figure out what type of developer they can be and build awesome projects outside of school   
Go back to the gym. No brainer. I want to look good naked for myself obvously.   
Learn how to be a better student: I had shit grades right now. 5 classes wasn't the move for the greatest academic comeback of all time.   
Read more books: I miss them, idk why I found it boring before.   
Just touch grass and hang out with friends: I need to do that more.   
**Uni therapy kind of doesnt work.**   
Quick rant, but counselors never follow up on me even though they told me they will :/ So it's my responsiblity to check up on myself.   
**What im grateful for.**   
A loving family, though I am misunderstood sometimes, but it's something I need to learn by learning vietnamese.  
A house, clothes, a new job that pays a little more than my previous job, my friends that checks up on me, my support group, talking with God sometimes, meeting new people online, building a community, taking the first step to greatness... (i think)  
**Final notes**  
**I felt way better writing this down. it made me understood myself a bit more everyday. but there are some things that might be contrieversial towards religion, relationships, careers. So please, critize me. Educate me. because I'm the dumbest person alive. I'm always learning new things and new perspectives. And I don't go to this platform a lot, but I'll do my best to listen to everyone.**

MAYBE IM NOT MATURING ENOUGH MAYBE IM NOT CORPORATE ENOUGH MAYBE IM NOT AMERICAN ENOUGH. MAYBE IM NOT LOOKING AT THE WRONG JOBS? SOFTWARE ENGINEERING INTERN? SOFTWARE DEVELOPER INTERN? HOW THE FUCK DO I SEARCH FOR JOBS EVEN IF I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO. IM A FUCKING SENIOR AND I JUST FIGURED OUT WHAT TO DO. I JUST DONT KNOW IF I WOULD FIND A GOOD COMPANY THAT INTERESTS ME.  
  
I recently cut the use of IG and other social media apps so I can focus on doing my own things. Before that, I felt so envious for my friends who were able to go outside town or the country to enjoy their lives. Like yes, I'm happy for them! It's just I felt like I will never get to experience this type of thing until I'm older. BeReal was also a cool social media app, but I felt like most of my friends took moments when they are 'actually' good moments and idk why I felt bad about myself. ""Am I mediorcre? Am I just boring? Do I have a boring life? Am I just poor, a broke college student?"". I have a lot of friend groups, but rarely hang out because I don't really belong to any. I felt like I was a side friend in each friend group. Most of the time, I just feel lonely.  
  
my mental is so weak. I've been dealing with PMO for a couple of years now and a three years back I decided to fight it, but I fumbled a lot. The highest I could go is 90 days without it. Right now, I decided to invest myself to a support group for a couple of buck per month my group is pretty cool and I am grateful for it. I still fumbled, and that's the reason why I also deleted social media (or at least cut from it), is because I'm looking at some content that tempts me to go to their OF, or their actual hub page. (Yes, I'm down bad or was i guess). Also I don't mind, but i don't fucking know why White Male and Asian/asian american Female couples irritates me so much. Like I'm happy for them and it's not my fucking business and it shouldn't be my fucking business, but maybe I was taught to hate on the idea from social media? I don't fucking know. My SISTER IS DATING A WHITE MAN, AND I ACTUALLY VIBE WITH HIM SO HOPEFULLY THAT HELPS ME DEAL WITH THE STUPID IGNORANCE I HAVE TAHT SHOULDNT BE PLANTED IN MY BRAIN FROM SOCIAL FUCKING MEDIA AND THE HUB. Please, I don't intend to send hate to the couples that are reading this. I'm happy for you, it's just a me problem and it's something I have to deal with alone. I don't want to think this hateful way and with other hateful ways that I have. ALSO I THINK I GOT INTO A REDPILL RABBIT HOLE. LOOK SOME INFLUENCERS MAKES GOOD POINTS AND I SHOULD DEFINTELY Discipline MYSELF and BE ON A SELF DEVELOPMENT JOURNEY,ITS NOT A COMMUNITY I LIKE TO JOIN.  
  
The next few paragraphs will hopefully makes sense.  
  
Current situation  
  
recent break up. I'm still not over her, I felt reckless and we told ourselves we weren't ready for another relationship bc are good friends, but I asked her out, and it lasted about a month. We stayed back friends, but she wanted to move on (but still wants me). Both of us needed to be more responsible to our actions, but damn I miss that connection. Maybe we'll come back together, if not then that's okay. We both want to be our very best, and it seems like we can be our best when we're alone. I felt like I was a horrible boyfriend to her and I WAS EVEN HER 1ST BOYFRIEND. SHE WAS A GEM AND A ANGEL TO ME WHEN WE WERE FRIENDS AND NOW WE CHANGED BECAUSE OF MY RECKLESSNESS AND INSECURIIES AND MY FUCKING ADDICTION TO PMO. GOD I FELT SO DISGUSTED ON MYSELF.  
  
I think, I'm just also scared of working the corporate life for the next decades. Talking 'adult stuff' like insurance, health, jobs, fucking cars and expenses, humble brags,afraid to be a linkedIn Lunatic basically. Idk how some of my friends were manage to get a good corporate job and travel outside of the US and joy their youths. However, it's something I might have to go through with like all other functional adults do, but without doing what my heart wants to do. Maybe that's maturaty. Maybe I have to sacrifice a bit of my youth for some stability in my american 'dream'. Get a job, car, house, American wife, children, work, investments, other boring topic. AND PLEASE IF I HEAR A FUCKING ""Well, yeah, it's boring, but some tasks are actually interesting to me"", IMMA EXPLODE BECAUSE EITHER YOURE LYING OR IT""S SOMETHING I HAVE TO FACE. LINKEDIN LUNATICS ARE FUCKING RAHHHHHH IT'S LIKE YOU ACTING LIKE ""HEY IM A BETTER SLAVE THAN YOU"". FUCKING REAL ESTATE. THAT DOESN""T MAKE FUCKING SENSE BUT I HAVE TO LEARN IT AND IM STILL CONFUSED, IMMA CHATGPT MYSELF INTO EXPLAN REAL ESTATE LIKE FUCKING 5  
  
What my heart wants to do  
  
I wanted to a least live a nomadic life (for a few years), and not worry about all of this: Money, and the American 'Dream'. To visit numerous countries and to meet new people.  
  
And then live a type of aesthetic of ""old money"" or a ""luxurious life""  
  
I wanted to build a business and be a founder of a tech company or whatever.  
  
I wanted to provide stability not only for myself, but for my family. While me living in my dream and do what I love.  
  
I keep bitching about it and what 'my American self' wants to do  
  
I feel like, I'm destined to not go anywhere or move anywhere....  
  
I talked with a catholic priest near my campus about my problems in school and life and basically the goal as a believer is to ""get into heaven"". Like the ultimate goal to life is to go to heaven. To be closer to Jesus. I believe in it. I was born with it. However, it feels like I won't be able to do what my heart wants. My local priest who I usually go to Mass with because it's the only Vietnamese Catholic Church in the state (I think?) lightly implies that we shouldn't live a life that we want because God has a plan. So, am I destined to be miserable until I maybe go to heaven? Actually, I am not certain. Maybe because I automatically go to hell because of my addiction or any commandment i broke? Maybe because I didn't follow the right religion? The right denomination? Even some told me that I'll go to hell because of my faith. Some Catholics (or trads) that I'm doing this all wrong. But then again, it's like I have to stay in state and be dull as possible.  
  
Because of the fact my family immigrated here from the war, I have conflicting feelings. Yes, someday I want to move back to VN. Note that I am MEDIORCRE AT MY VIETNAMESE. in addition, I'll be considered a ""viet kieu"" or ""people of Vietnamese descent or who grew up in Vietnam but moved overseas."". I'm not sure how Vietnamese people think about this... IM NOT SURE WHAT MY PARENTS WILL THINK ABOUT THIS. MY DAD'S FAMILY MOVED TO THE US FOR A BETTER LIFE AND FOR POLITICAL REASONS FROM THE WAR OBVOULSLY JUST FOR ME TO GO BACK TO THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS FOUGHT?  
  
What actions I will take  
  
Aside from all of this. I'm taking some small, actionable steps to hopefully figure out what to do in my life and to see what are my priorities.  
  
Getting new skills and making projects I want to build to help others in my 'community'.: I mean, I see problems, and I have solutions. Not really sure if its something they like, but it does give me some time get more project experience and figuring out what I like to code and build. It could be a potential SaaS business and it's something small and im happy to fail. Also participating online hackathons are really cool so i'll be doing that in the summer.  
  
continue build a youtube audience on my dev journey. I know how building a brand works from other experiences, but idk I want to try it to keep myself busy alongside work an project.  
  
Starting a new club. I think all of my classmates need some community in the Software development field in campus and figure out what type of developer they can be and build awesome projects outside of school  
  
Go back to the gym. No brainer. I want to look good naked for myself obviously.  
  
Learn how to be a better student: I had shit grades right now. 5 classes wasn't the move for the greatest academic comeback of all time.  
  
Read more books: I miss them, idk why I found it boring before.  
  
Just touch grass and hang out with friends: I need to do that more.  
  
Uni therapy kind of doesn't work.  
  
Quick rant, but counselors never follow up on me even though they told me they will :/ So it's my responsibility to check up on myself.  
  
What im grateful for.  
  
A loving family, though I am misunderstood sometimes, but it's something I need to learn by learning Vietnamese.  
  
A house, clothes, a new job that pays a little more than my previous job, my friends that checks up on me, my support group, talking with God sometimes, meeting new people online, building a community, taking the first step to greatness... (i think)  
  
Final notes  
  
I felt way better writing this down. it made me understood myself a bit more everyday. but there are some things that might be controversial towards religion, relationships, careers. So please, criticize me. Educate me. because I'm the dumbest person alive. I'm always learning new things and new perspectives. And I don't go to this platform a lot, but I'll do my best to listen to everyone.  
  
So, Am I playing life on hard mode? or I'm making all of this hard on myself?  
  
TL;DR: I think it made this hard on myself, but I'll keep going",User_deleted,1,neutral,0

As in, I had not even coded my first hello world. I have been learning C for about 1-2 months.

Ive been sticking through it and honestly every time I see a project, I do not know where to start. I have been trying to learn through chatgpt giving me little exercises, for the beginner I get there pretty easily, but as soon as tasks go to a bit more advanced I cant do it. I get the solution, and after a while I can see how they came to that conclusion however if I had zero help and had to solve the problem on my own, I just dont think I have the IQ to do it.

Is this normal for beginners? Will I get there in the end? Its just everytime I try my hardest and my brain just struggles.

For the record, I did hard a-levels (UK), could do most of the maths in lesson after revising but this is just on another level entirely and I feel like CS students are the top of the top of the top, which I am not.

I know that they say coding is 90% practice and it has been helping, its just with large projects I just think it would take such a long long time practicing constantly to be able to get there - if at all.

ALSO, if anybody has good learning courses with exercises(because they help the most) please LET ME KNOW. I watched bro codes 4 hour long video and a lot of other videos, but for example they go through topics like loops in 8 minutes  and when it comes to applying what youve learned to projects I'd say it has barely helped, all the courses I see teach things for simple application but never a thorough explanation on how they can be used more advanced.",active,64,neutral,0
149f65b,1,2023-06-14,School Teacher help: Any way to get around memory limits for a teacher making end of year quizzes?,u/trickyfurball,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/149f65b/school_teacher_help_any_way_to_get_around_memory/,"Hi everyone! I'm a teacher who relies on Chat GPT to create quizzes for my students. Currently, I'm working on an ""end of class"" comprehensive quiz that encompasses content from seven smaller courses we've covered. The total text length for the quiz amounts to approximately 87,000 words.

The challenge I'm facing involves creating a complex prompt (**1026 words or 5879 characters)**. I want the prompt to generate a specific number of questions of a certain type while also referencing the corresponding reading materials. However, due to the prompt's length and the size of the 87,000-word text, I've encountered difficulties in getting Chat GPT or the playground to remember crucial elements. I even attempted to feed it only 1000 characters at a time, but that approach disrupts the necessary pattern for the overall output.

I recently came across the ""chatgpt-retrieval-plugin"" from OpenAI, which seems promising. Additionally, I've heard suggestions about utilizing embeddings and a vector database to resolve this issue, but I'm unsure where to begin. Am I overthinking it and there's a way to do it outside of spinning up a vector database and doing a bunch of terminal stuff? I'm not tooooo techical but enough to be capable. I have API access, and budget is not a concern when it comes to using it.

Do any of you have any tips or recommendations on how to tackle this challenge effectively? Thank you in advance!

Would you be open to the idea of using a customized AI tutor? The tutor will provide answers based on the material you have learnt in school or university. For example, if a professor teaches you a certain method for solving a question the AI will be able to retrace the steps and provide an explanation as if the professor was explaining. I find that really helpfull especially when studying for my finals as I seem to sometimes forget the solvings and explanations. Also, the nice thing about this is that it all happens instantly no need to wait for your teacher or professor to answer.

14c31sw,1,2023-06-17,Bias against ChatGPT in Academia/Research,u/w1ngslikeeagles,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/14c31sw/bias_against_chatgpt_in_academiaresearch/,"I work with basic science and clinical research groups and have noticed a lot of misconceptions and fears about ChatGPT, preventing us from fully embracing its potential to fuel advancements in science.

Recently I used ChatGPT to draft around 90% of the introduction for a publication. My colleagues praised it as one of the best intros they had seen, but as soon as I mentioned the extensive use of ChatGPT, suddenly the work was invalidated. I was forced to rewrite the entire section without ChatGPT, even though the initial version was exceptional.

Another time we discovered a new phenomenon which required us to coin a term to accurately describe it. ChatGPT came up with a succinct and brilliant term that resonated with everyone in the lab. Our principle investigator had initially praised the term, but he must have talked to his colleagues about how students were using ChatGPT to ""take shortcuts"" or ""cheat"" because he decided to discard the term solely because it was coined by ChatGPT. We had to come up with an inferior replacement term that didn't do the phenomenon justice.

Finally there was a project that required extensive programming to develop a machine learning analytical approach, and we didn't have access to a developer. I spent the past 8 months developing thousands of lines of code with ChatGPT. The code worked great, and some student programmers reviewed it and were super impressed. While the PhDs in my lab were impressed with the results, they were critical since the scripts were not written by professionals and were hesitant to incorporate the code into the project. (They eventually came around.)

This bias against ChatGPT reminds me of the struggles faced by historically marginalized groups in science. Just like a century ago when ideas from women or people of color were discounted due to racial or sexist biases, today, we witness a similar distrust towards AI-generated ideas. We need to use AI to accelerate research, enhance creativity, and develop groundbreaking ideas that were previously beyond our reach. It's time to break free from the constraints of bias. Future generations will look back and judge us harshly for our biases which slowed scientific advancement.",User_deleted,0,neutral,0

**Using Generative AI for Workflow Automation and Customized Emails** [**(link)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcAgsSKCm1o)  
Badine  AI is a workflow automation  tool that uses generative AI to automate  mundane tasks such as  copy-pasting and outreach emails. The podcast  discusses the use of  generative AI in automation and how it can be used  to customize emails  based on LinkedIn profiles. The speaker explains  that their company,  Genotaur, focuses on building automation for  end-users and offers a  choice of models to use, such as GPT 3.5 or GPT  4. They also emphasize  the importance of building abstraction layers  and training tools that  are independent of specific models, as the  technology will commoditize  over time. The podcast also discusses the  benefits of deterministic  execution in automation scripts, which are  like normal programs that  always do the same thing every time. The  podcast concludes by  highlighting the positive impact of AI technology  in various fields,  including healthcare, education, and productivity.

14ck3tm,61,2023-06-18,AI Report 2023.06.18 - One of the craziest days in AI news I’ve ever seen,u/fatshogun,ArtificialInteligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/14ck3tm/ai_report_20230618_one_of_the_craziest_days_in_ai/,"* **AI can make it easier for anyone to create custom-tailored viruses and pathogens**: MIT researchers asked undergraduate students to test whether chatbots ""could be prompted to assist non-experts in causing a pandemic,"" and found that within one hour the chatbots suggested four potential pandemic pathogens. The chatbots helped the students identify which pathogens could inflict the most damage, and even provided information not commonly known among experts. The students were offered lists of companies who might assist with DNA synthesis, and suggestions on how to trick them into providing services. This is arguably the strongest case against open-sourcing AI \[source: [https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/new-ai-fear-making-it-easy-for-anyone-to-mint-dangerous-new-viruses/ar-AA1cCVq6](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/new-ai-fear-making-it-easy-for-anyone-to-mint-dangerous-new-viruses/ar-AA1cCVq6)\]
* **Intel will start shipping 12-qubit quantum processors to a few universities and academic research labs:** 12 qubits is still not a big deal, it’s not a lot of computing power. However, as we all know, technology, and very specifically processing power, is subject to Moore’s Law, which for those of you who actually had a social life in high school and now you don’t know what Moore’s Law is, simply means that technology gets better, faster, stronger, and cheaper as time goes by. And, compared to regular processors, quantum processors are orders of magnitude faster. Ok, how is this related to AI? I’m glad you asked. Advancements in AI pretty much come down to two things – data and computing power. We already have entire oceans of data, or, rather, Google and Facebook do, and the biggest challenge to making God-like AI is the laggings in processing power. And when that stops being a problem because of quantum computers, when we plug AI into quantum computers… I guess we’ll finally see if we get to live in a Kumbaya Utopia where we all love each other and don’t have to work unless we feel like it, or, you know, Skynet meets the Matrix type of thing. \[source: [https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/06/intel-to-start-shipping-a-quantum-processor/](https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/06/intel-to-start-shipping-a-quantum-processor/) \]
* **People are using AI to automate responses to sites that pay them to train AI**: So, for those of you who’ve never watched one of those “how to make $5000 a month on the Internet” videos, Amazon's Mechanical Turk is a platform where people can complete small tasks like data validation or transcriptions or surveys to earn a bit of money. Well, researchers at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland have found that a significant number of Mechanical Turk workers are already using large language models (LLMs) to automate their labor. \[source: - [https://futurism.com/the-byte/people-automating-responses-train-ai](https://futurism.com/the-byte/people-automating-responses-train-ai) \]
* **A Chick-fil-A in Alpharetta, Atlanta, is testing AI-powered delivery robots**: This sounds like bad news for delivery people. However, I think we’ve kinda seen this story play out before, since Amazon tried to automate delivery with drones a few years ago, and regulatory setbacks prevented their efforts. I’m not sure how this particular Chick-fil-A restaurant has pulled this off, it may not be entirely legal, but let’s see how this develops. \[source: [https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/north-fulton-county/metro-atlanta-chick-fil-a-tests-delivery-robots-equipped-with-artificial-intelligence/GSLBEX2NFJAQFGE3H7KW3YFOCU/](https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/north-fulton-county/metro-atlanta-chick-fil-a-tests-delivery-robots-equipped-with-artificial-intelligence/GSLBEX2NFJAQFGE3H7KW3YFOCU/) \]
* **Researchers from Microsoft and UC Santa Barbara Propose LONGMEM: An AI Framework that Enables LLMs to Memorize Long History:** As you may know, even the most advanced AI bots like ChatGPT can only take input of up to a certain length, and you can still use several prompts to add more input, but this way of functioning is still limited, as the chatbot doesn’t really have long-term memory, doesn’t really learn from your own specific actions and adjust itself based on your input. If that were possible, a whole other world of features and possibilities would open up for AI. Well, the proposed LONGMEM framework should enable language models to cache, to keep in memory long-form prior context or knowledge, which will kinda give LLMs superpowers and we will likely start seeing a lot more new applications. Exciting stuff. \[source: [https://www.marktechpost.com/2023/06/16/researchers-from-microsoft-and-uc-santa-barbara-propose-longmem-an-ai-framework-that-enables-llms-to-memorize-long-history/](https://www.marktechpost.com/2023/06/16/researchers-from-microsoft-and-uc-santa-barbara-propose-longmem-an-ai-framework-that-enables-llms-to-memorize-long-history/) \]
* **AI used to catch a thief**: A video on Facebook is going viral, a person was caught on a security camera stealing stuff from some street artist kids in the Philippines, and the Internet rose to the occasion – social media users used AI to sharpen and enhance the image of the thief, sent the pic to the kids, and they gave it to the police. The authorities were able to recover the bag, but one cellphone was missing. The suspect is identified but still at large. The implications of this are not certain. This is still an AI-generated image, it can very easily be inaccurate, and the wrong person might easily get punished even when innocent. \[source: [https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1307441943456719](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1307441943456719]) \]

Now, granted, OpenAI is like the number one AI company ever created, and there will only be a few positions there reserved for the Einsteins of AI, but still, there are heaps of other AI jobs at other companies that pay around $200 K a year.

This comes after Microsoft pulled back some of its best AI talent from their Chinese offices back to Canada, as they feared their talent would be either poached by Chinese startups, or even approached by the government in some way. I don’t think Microsoft will go back in China after that. \[source: [https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinas-xi-tells-bill-gates-he-welcomes-us-ai-tech-china-2023-06-16/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinas-xi-tells-bill-gates-he-welcomes-us-ai-tech-china-2023-06-16/)\]
* **Congress is considering whether AI can hold patents.** Last month, scientists at the MIT used AI to discover the first new antibiotic since the 80s. The new drug was identified from a library of nearly 7,000 drug compounds. They used a machine-learning model that they trained to evaluate whether a chemical compound will inhibit the growth of the bacteria that causes the infections. Back in April, the Supreme Court declined to consider the case of Stephen Thaler, a computer scientist who wanted to patent a beverage holder and an emergency light beacon that were designed entirely by AI, without any human input. Thaler’s application was shot down by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office because only humans can be inventors, and the decision was upheld by lower courts. But! In South Africa, an AI system was listed as the inventor and granted a patent. That’s the situation lawmakers fear, innovation escaping to greener pastures. Tons of experts debate and disagree on this matter. I don’t think granting patents to AI makes sense. Ideally, the patent should be granted to the people that designed that specific AI training algorithm, and the people who provided the data it was trained on, and, of course, the person running the algo, since AI still can’t run itself. It’s a tricky matter anyway, I’m curious to see what happens. \[source: [https://godanriver.com/news/nation-world/government-politics/congress-ponders-whether-artificial-intelligence-should-have-the-power-of-the-patent/article\_c5d31741-1d16-5529-86e4-ea53c89eb95b.html](https://godanriver.com/news/nation-world/government-politics/congress-ponders-whether-artificial-intelligence-should-have-the-power-of-the-patent/article_c5d31741-1d16-5529-86e4-ea53c89eb95b.html)\]

Oooh, spooky… I think they’re trying to build up a bit of hype with claims like this, but on the other hand, I kinda agree that releasing these AI tools for public use as soon as they are made does create a lot of potential for misuse. \[source: [https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/17/23764565/meta-says-its-new-speech-generating-ai-model-is-too-dangerous-for-public-release](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/17/23764565/meta-says-its-new-speech-generating-ai-model-is-too-dangerous-for-public-release)\]
* Speaking of Meta, they have bigger problems than some kids skipping school by using their voice tools to call their teachers pretending they are their parents. **Meta lost a third of their AI talent last year.** Not sure where these people went, looks like some went to OpenAI, and others just burned out. To make things worse, they didn’t even get a shoutout from the White House at the AI leadership summit back in May. And to make things even worse, just 26% of Meta employees believe that Zuck is doing a good job leading the company in these turbulent times. I’m gonna go contrarian here and say that Zuck will rally his troops and that Meta may catch up to its other tech titan siblings. I mean, I don’t believe this wholeheartedly, but I think he has a shot. They do have a ton of data after all, and they can always find other AI nerds to work for them. They will open-source their LLM Llama, they added some AI to Facebook and Instagram, and this Voicebox thing will probably be pretty good. Plus, I think Zuckerberg is one of those wartime CEOs that do better in uncertain times, when the stakes are high, and underperform in boring times when nothing seems to happen, which was the period of several years before ChatGPT. Not betting the house on it, but I think Zuck will pull a rabbit out of the hat and correct Meta’s course in the AI waters. \[source: [https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/meta-lost-third-ai-researchers-152058353.html](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/meta-lost-third-ai-researchers-152058353.html)\]
* I found this interesting chart on Twitter posted by user AI\_decoded\_ (although I’m not sure it’s theirs because I saw other accounts posting it as well). It shows the increase of assets in certain asset classes, as far as I can tell (the labeling is a bit confusing to me), and we can see that AI has had quite a nice growth since the end of 2022. The implication that the creators of this chart are trying to make is that we may be in an AI bubble, but even if we are, the people that are getting educated on this will benefit one way or the other. I’m not so sure I agree about the bubble part. There is a non-zero chance that the line for AI starts going down today and never goes back up again. That is a real possibility. I don’t think it’s likely, but it’s still a possibility. Personally, I’m going all in on AI myself, with pretty much all of my businesses and entrepreneurial efforts. And I definitely have some skin in the game here, as the Youtube channel really takes a lot of time and resources to produce, even though it probably doesn’t look like that. \[source: [https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd6c748xw2pzm8.cloudfront.net%2Fprod%2F43b55d30-54e7-11eb-9358-dbfa417c7fba-standard.png?dpr=1&fit=scale-down&quality=highest&source=next&width=700](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd6c748xw2pzm8.cloudfront.net%2Fprod%2F43b55d30-54e7-11eb-9358-dbfa417c7fba-standard.png?dpr=1&fit=scale-down&quality=highest&source=next&width=700)\]
* Since we’re talking about bubbles, **investors might be aware of the potential AI bubble, and they still don’t seem to care**. Extreme valuations of companies that haven’t actually done anything yet are signs of a potential bubble in the start-up space, says Thomas Rice, portfolio manager for Perpetual’s Global Innovation Share Fund. Even Sam Altman says things like “It is definitely like the new bubble – all the people that were working on crypto a few years ago are now working on AI”. Fair enough, that’s definitely true, and as a sidenote, I like Altman’s approach of always quieting down the hype and trying to ground people’s expectations in reality. The good thing about bubbles in general is that some people manage to make money in them. The bad thing about bubbles is that the people who end up making money are usually scumbags. It ends up being just one big game of musical chairs – people invest in companies they don’t know much about, and when most of those companies crash and burn, everyone except the scumbags loses money. But there’s one key detail I don’t see mentioned here – and that’s the very strong possibility this is not a bubble. Look, I love crypto, I’ve been both a student and a creator in that space as well, and I still think it has a lot of potential, but I can tell you this much – the general public never really got on board. Crypto was mostly confined to crypto bros selling each other crypto things. Bitcoin is and always has been a financial revolution, Ethereum will likely become a real and actually used platform at some point, and there are a few other altcoins in the ocean of shitcoins that have real-world use cases. But chances are, if you go to your local store and try to pay with Bitcoin, which is the most popular cryptocurrency by far, you will only get a few strange looks. ChatGPT and AI, on the other hand, are already used by real people, real professionals, every single day, and there’s no going back. That’s the fundamental difference between AI and crypto. Sure, AI may be overhyped a bit right now, but I guarantee you that the promise of generating content for practically no cost and having infinite intelligence at your disposal is too big for all of these governments and companies and entrepreneurs to stop pursuing AI. The genie is out of the bottle, people will only use AI more, and that’s why AI is essentially not a bubble in the long term. \[source: [https://www.afr.com/technology/why-investors-are-knowingly-buying-into-an-ai-bubble-20230618-p5dhht](https://www.afr.com/technology/why-investors-are-knowingly-buying-into-an-ai-bubble-20230618-p5dhht)\]

Since posting the situation has escalated greatly with the department head at my school just handing this off to one of the school administrators, who handed off the to principal, who then handed it off to be dealt with by the superintendent.

Hes going off 1-2 AI detectors he found online. During our meeting he showed me the AI detector flagging 3 sentences out of my 6 page essay as AI generated at 4% human and another student in the class's being 98% human. He thinks if I truly did not use Chatgpt, the number would be a lot higher, but keep in mind its 3 sentences describing a well-known person. I've presented the following information to the superintendent and he still wants more evidence and I don't know what to give him.

1. **Proof of the detectors not working:** I showed him how the constitution and bible get flagged as less than 10% human by these detectors. He says he was surprised and did not understand why the detectors say that, but is still standing by his own judgement. In addition to this, I showed him my teachers own writing from their personal website be flagged as AI (it was from 2010), and he again just repeated he was confused by it, but still upheld my teachers opinion.)
2. **Other detectors not flagging the few sentences as AI-Generated** ***(included OpenAi's own detector)***
3. **Examples of my other writing being very very similar in style:** My school admin said to me ""How do we know you didn't use AI on these assignments as well?""
4. **When he compared my writing to the other students, I told him that everyone has different writing styles**

Based on the meeting I had with him, he's basically only going off the detectors, so could someone here maybe suggest some piece of writing that's not AI-generated, but gets flagged as AI-generated so I can show him.

Teachers and classmates usually liked me but remarked that I was quiet and shy, and then in college that read as being passive-aggressive and aloof. Trying to be friendlier and more outgoing came off the wrong way. I was socially maladjusted until my final year of school. Part of this was moving across the country where cultural norms differed, part of it was trying to depart from the (bleughghghhgh) ""gifted"" label while having ADHD, and there's more that's not really worth getting into. 

But I tried to do a couple of prerequisites for a graduate degree after my break and had two very different reactions. In one class, I was a great student, exceeded expectations, broke the curve, and the professor wanted me to do a Master's at that institution. In the other, I was artificial, sycophantic, lazy, and a cheater (the accusation came out of left field--it was over a written submission with a 1% plagiarism score and I would not trust ChatGPT to do statistics). The first professor answered emails quickly and graded things in a few days. The latter would tell us an exam was over these few chapters and then surprise us with something else entirely, then would give everyone an 80 when we all failed. When I tried to improve the dynamic, she asked if I needed accommodations. 

I'm pretty scared of this happening again.

I am writing minor documents for internal purposes at my university.  For example one of them is just a report for a committee.  My normal process is never smooth, I jam stuff down and then I edit through it and rewrite sentences, make things more consistent and etc.  I am still doing that and after a few rounds there are sentences or groups of sentence that I still find awkward or not as clear as I would like.  Or I like the content of what I wrote but I think it could be better organized for flow.  So I took these small portions and ask ChatGPT to smooth them out or reorganize them.  It gives back some pretty good results though I still edit these to be more to my liking.

I am finding this extremely helpful. It is not completely earth shattering but it also beats going to a colleague and asking them for suggestions you won’t get back for at least a couple days.

I believe I am different than the stereotypical HS applicant for CS, and while browsing r/NJTech, I stumbled upon an interesting comment on extracurriculars that I'd like to dissect, and I'd like to know whether you think I'm onto something with my alternative extracurriculars. But first, let's get the boring stuff out of the way, my resume:

**Education:**

* GPA: 3.9 Unweighted; 4.091 Weighted (Might be higher because of APs)
* APs: AP English Language and Composition, AP Computer Science Principles (got an A in both classes). My school district doesn't let you take APs before junior year.
* Classes I didn't receive an A in: Precalculus (B), Algebra 2 (B+), Chemistry (A-)
* SAT Score: 1330 (93rd Percentile)
* Graduation Year: 2024
* Senior Schedule: AP Physics I and II, AP Literature and Composition, Core Calculus, Physical Education/Health IV, AP Computer Science A, AP Economics
* Intended Major: Computer Science/Software Engineering
* Relevant Coursework:Computer Science: I took Computer Science as my major throughout all four years. In this major, I have made projects in a few programming languages including Python, Swift (self-taught), and coming next year, Java.

**Projects/Apps:**

* PhysCal - Physics Calculator App for iOS and macOS (Swift Student Challenge submission but planning on working on it more to submit to the App Store)
   * [Screen Recording: PhysCal Swift Student Challenge Demo · CleanShot Cloud](https://share.cleanshot.com/Sj3zssQG)
* NumGen - Random number generator app for iOS and macOS with loads of customizability (planning on releasing to the App Store)
   * [Screenshots: NumGen Demo • CleanShot Cloud](https://share.cleanshot.com/l5J7g7Jd)
* DLFind - First complete iOS and macOS app I made to decode driver’s license numbers based on a tool I made in CSP class. Already on App Store (due to age restrictions I had to register it in my mother’s name)
   * [App Store link: DLFind on the App Store (apple.com)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dlfind/id1660410310)

Now, onto the extracurriculars. The comment I'll be reacting to was a comment a parent of an HS junior made on a post on r/NJTech I made about the chances of getting into NJIT (one of my target state schools as they have free tuition with Honors. The comment this user made is about the extracurriculars their son did and I will be reacting to it.

Before I begin, I think he (and I) are in a really good place. With that being said, these are my reactions:

>Math team: top 9 scorer in the state, 2-3 national top 10 of math subjects Mu Alpha Theta

I haven't done any of that since middle school, when I did the Princeton Math Competition. In high school, math seemed to take a turn, largely due to the pandemic, and I had to work hard to come back up. Despite having a B in Precalc, I will study and get tutoring all summer on Calc topics, so I can have a primer and do well in Core Calc or AB, one of the biggest mistakes I made for Precalc.

&#x200B;

>state varsity swimmer

Oh, gosh. The only times I really swim are for fun when I visit a friend's house with a pool in summer. That's how I like it. Swimming is like meditation for me. It is very relaxing to casually swim in a quiet, heated pool. I don't want to turn everything into a competition. I'm not really an athlete at all TBH and I don't want to be forced to compete in my ""relaxation activities"". Prefer spending my time coding, studying, or watching tech reviews.

>marching band

I haven't done any serious musical extracurriculars, and in general, aren't a very musical person. However, I have written educational parody songs for fun (with the help of ChatGPT) to use as study guides for myself and others. While I am by no means, musically gifted and have never practiced music outside of school (I can't really play instruments and don't have a great vocal range and literally used my MacBook speakers and iPhone Voice Memos app to record the songs), I believe that using music creatively to help study, may be better than pure musical talent as students have said my songs have helped them study. In other words, my musical skill is not the voice but the creativity. While an AI language model may have helped me write it, the ideas are all mine. After all, if I want to be a software engineer, it truthfuly does not matter whether you can play the trumpet well, but it does matter if you can write a song that can help another student study and increase their grades.

>UW gpa 3.9/ W 4.3

Around the same as me, especially when APs come into the mix.

&#x200B;

>SAT 750 r/w 790 math

1540; really impressive score. 210 points higher than me. I'm going to study a lot this summer though, with a tutor and bootcamp. I hope I could come close to that.

>He’s going through the free Harvard CS50 course this summer.

The Harvard part is very impressive but I chose to attend the precollege programs at Stevens Institute of Technology instead as I wanted a true college experience where I live on campus, go to classes taught by college professors, and get to use all the amenities on campus. I have done self-paced CS courses before though.However, I have all this other stuff on my resume. What do you think of my more ""creative/fun"" approach to academics, swimming, music, coding, and chose to spend my free time passionately learning about tech?

The prompts I tried in ChatGPT3.5 chat gave me very solid and various outputs after some days of tweaking, especially for some specialties. When I finally felt satisfied with what's coming next, I set up my payment method and started trying playground, suggesting that that's the way I see how my app responses would look like when I integrate API. 

I tried Complete model and Chat model. Chat model was basically braindead, it gave some technically valid response at first (but very shallow and uncreative, unlike ChatGPT chat-bot), but then it just started responding with whatever she want to write on the topic (or switched to other similar topics), without closely listening to instructions. 

As for Complete model, its responses made more sense, but was either very repetitive and uninteresting, always insisting on the same subjects with the use of the same words (even with Temperature, Frequency and the rest parameters/penalties tweaked) or was writing something very off-topic without focus on the subject I set initially.

I will probably leave aside idea of incorporating API into my project since it seems very costly for my language because it requires more tokens (I wanted it to be free for use because the feature seemed to be very small) but just interested are there any developers which successfully incorporated API into their project. Are you satisfied with it? I feel like I misunderstood something or do something wrong, but that's probably because of very limited IT knowledge.",User_deleted,2,neutral,0

14fovbk,32,2023-06-21,Ramblings of an average student who got a 520+,u/allidoiswin_,Mcat,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mcat/comments/14fovbk/ramblings_of_an_average_student_who_got_a_520/,"Hi all,

I think I'm a pretty average student overall; I graduated with a 3.65 (\~3.55 sGPA if I had to guess) from a large public state university. Barely had any motivation to attend class, played thousands of hours of videogames instead, and crammed lecture recordings at 2x speed during all-nighters \~12 hours before every exam (yes, every single exam across 4 years). 

Although I think I understand new concepts relatively quickly, I suffer from a lot of the same pitfalls as anyone else: getting distracted extremely easily, losing motivation quickly, getting burned out, doomscrolling for hours after answering one practice question, poor sleep schedule, etc. I *probably* have ADHD, but I've never been officially diagnosed. To be frank, in our current era of ultralow attention spans, screen-split subway surfer TikTok podcasts, I think it's getting increasingly difficult to diagnose who *really* has the disorder.

As such, I was pleasantly surprised (re: shocked, floored, astonished) to find out today that I got a 524 on the 5/18 exam. I took this exam two years out from undergrad and 3 yrs out from my last core premed class while working a full-time job in biotech. I attribute this score to a few main things that I'll detail below. **Disclaimer: this is not general advice, just what I found worked for me.** 

1. Skipped content review. Didn't read a single page of a single book. Started UWorld from Day 1 (4 months out from exam day). Found that doing practice questions kept me much more engaged than reading textbooks, and the UWorld explanations are very good at explaining new concepts. Any time I felt I needed further clarification, I used Google (and this subreddit, thank you all so much) *liberally* until I felt I understood the concept.
2. Studied somewhat consistently. Initially did 30 questions a day, and figured I'd be able to complete UW in 2 months. However, around a quarter of the way through, I got extremely burned out and didn't study at all for a full month. This shifted up my schedule significantly, so I had to switch to doing 60 questions a day until a week before test day. 
3. I was lucky enough to not have to focus too much on CARS (always been a voracious reader, maybe that helped? not sure), but I ignored that section entirely until FLs. Focused primarily on B/B and C/P, where I had significant knowledge gaps. There's not that many P/S questions on UWorld, so I was through with them well before the other two sections. While doing UW: **take screenshots any time you come across a good graphical explanation (a lot of them overlap, but they're all amazing).** I'm a ""visual learner"" so the UW graphics were indispensable in helping me learn a lot of these concepts/pathways. 
4. Used MileDown's deck just to stay on top of P/S after I completed the UW questions. I don't think it's a particularly excellent deck or anything; it's a bit dated, a lot of the cards are very lengthy/verbose, and there a number of small errors. However, it served its purpose of keeping me refreshed on P/S content, and I think it does a good job of covering most if not all of the terms you'll see in the section. Any gaps in MileDown were covered in the FLs and the 90-page LazyOCD P/S sheet (which I skimmed through the last few days before my exam). My background in P/S prior to this exam came from AP Psych in 12th grade and Psych 101 during my sophomore year of college, and I probably came in knowing \~30-40% of the MCAT content from there.
5. I want to re-emphasize a point I made earlier. ANY time I ever had doubts/questions about a concept, I Googled and dug deep until I felt like I understood. Towards the end I even used ChatGPT (it does an excellent job of understanding your question, better than Google ever could). 
6. I took notes on Google Sheets any time a concept felt overwhelming and returned to the sheets every time it came up again. I especially struggled with memorizing random physics questions (lens, magnets, circuits) electrochemistry, random metabolites from central metabolism, etc. These all went into the doc that I would continually refer to while doing UW (same doc I saved the screenshots of their graphics). I can share these sheets if anyone wants, but they're not comprehensive so I'm not sure how useful they'll be to anyone. 
7. QPacks and Section Bank are probably excellent resources, but I admit I don't have of a concrete idea. I was pretty burned out from studying towards the end of this process, so I only did the two biology QPacks scored \~85% (did each QPack in one sitting). Did not do C/P QPacks or Section Bank even though I had planned to. 
8. Started doing FLs \~5 weeks out from test day. Took my last exam 4 days prior. Reviewed all incorrect questions and quickly went over the ones I got right to make sure I didn't just guess them correctly. Here are the stats:
   1. **FL5 (04/09):** 517 (130, 130, 129, 128)
   2. **FL1 (04/15):** 514 (129, 129, 128, 128)
   3. **FL2 (04/22:** 518 (130, 128, 130, 130)
   4. **FL3 (04/29):** 516 (129, 127, 132, 128) 
   5. **FL4 (05/14):** 519 (132, 130, 128, 129)

I will admit, I didn't take the FLs in an accurate, simulated test environment. Especially for the earlier ones, I would take naps in between (re: horrible sleep schedule), make food, use the restroom, etc. Never paused and interrupted a section, but I would take *long* breaks in between sections. In FL3 and FL4, I kept the timer strict, but was still very lax and napped *during* the sections, leading me to speed through the last 15 questions before I ran out of time. This may explain some of the discrepancy between my FL average and the actual thing. Of course, on test day, I had adrenaline to keep me up and I can safely say I did not take any naps at any point during the exam. 

I felt good coming out of the exam and was hopeful that I'd get somewhere between a 516-518. But I certainly did ***not*** come out feeling like I had scored a 524 (does anyone?) 

Anyway... wow. This turned out to be quite a bit longer than I had initially hoped, but I guess I needed to vent somewhere (and procrastinate on writing my personal statement). Thanks again to everyone in this subreddit who previously asked the same questions I had and all those who answered them.

**In a recent interview with Fox Business, Julia Dixon,** the founder of **ES.Ai,** an Ai tool for college applications, emphasized the importance of students incorporating artificial intelligence into their educational journey.

She argued that students who don't leverage AI resources will find themselves at a disadvantage, as AI in education is as inevitable as the internet or a search engine.

Dixon, a former tutor, compared the use of AI in brainstorming ideas, outlining essays, and editing students' work to the role of a human tutor. She stressed that Ai should not replace students' work but assist them, and it's not cheating as long as ethical tools and practices are followed.

Dixon hopes that Ai tools like **ES.Ai** will increase students' access to tutoring and educational resources.

She warned that ***students need to learn how to make AI ""work for them""*** so it doesn't become ""a replacement for them."" She reiterated that students who aren't learning how to use AI properly will be at a disadvantage.

I let them use Grammarly, but it’s hard to incorporate DeepL or ChatGPT in a way that has pedagogical value.

A pupil with identity confusion wore elf ears in the playground, confusing and drawing attention from other pupils who didn’t understand. I could see that the boy was beginning to feel intimidated by a few approaching boys. I called him over and asked what he was wearing and why he had them in school. I explained that the ears were not school uniform and told him to remove them and put them back to class. He understood and obliged. 

Later that afternoon I was accused by a teaching assistant of victim blaming and that the boy should be able to wear whatever he wants without feeling threatened. I  responded explaining that we are responsible for all the pupils in school. That they are all vulnerable and have their own needs. Supporting their playtimes are hard enough. We don’t need water guns, Polaroid cameras and now elf ears (things this pupil has brought into school in the past) in school unless the teachers and parents have agreed.  

The teaching assistant replied “ideally everyone gets to wear whatever they want without feeling threatened”. I replied, “yes, ideally, I agree.”

He walked off looking upset. I’m not sure why. Later on the deputy head calls me in and said that the assistant spoke to another teacher who then accused me of  victim blaming, explaining that elf ears are part of the lgbt community. 

I thought the student was lucky that I was there to preemptively defuse an escalating situation. But  the accusations have left me doubting my actions and considering how to protect myself from future accusation. If it were to happen again, I might put my own interests before the student’s

Happy reading.**

There are many founders, product creators, and proactive individuals, I’ve read many of your crazy stories and lessons so **I decided to share mine** and the **lessons I learned from the bottom to impressive product-market fit and exit.**

I've spent almost the past **10 years** building **tech products** as a **Corporate Team Leader, Senior Software Developer, Online Course Creator, Programming Tutor, Head of Development/CTO, and 3x Startup Founder (2 bankruptcies, and 1 exit).**

And what next? good question...

A brief summary of my journey:

## Chapter 1: Software Developer / Team Leader / Senior Software Developer

**I’ve always wanted to create products that win over users’ hearts, carry value, and influence users**. Ever since my school days, I’ve **loved the tech part of building digital** products.

At the beginning of school, I started hosting servers for games, blogs and internet forums, and other things that did not require much programming knowledge. **My classmates and later even over 100 people played** on servers that **I hosted on my home PC**.

Later, as the only person in school, I passed the final exam in computer science.

During my **computer science studies**, I **started my first job as a software developer**. It was crazy, I was spending **200–300 hours** a month in the office attending also to daily classes. **Yes, I didn’t have a life**, but **it truly was the fulfillment of my dreams**. I was able to earn good money doing what I love, and **I devoted fully myself to it.**

**My key to effectively studying IT** and growing my knowledge at rocket speed was learning day by day reading guides, building products to the portfolio, watching youtube channels and **attending conferences**, and even watching them online, even if I didn’t understand everything at the beginning. In one year we’ve been to every possible event within 400km.

We were building healthcare products that were actually used in hospitals and medical facilities. It was a beautiful adventure and tons of knowledge I took from this place.

**That time I built my first product teams, hired many great people**, and over the years became a **senior developer** and **team leader**. Even I convinced my study mates to apply to this company and we studied together and worked as well. **Finally, there were 4 of us**, when I left a friend of mine took over my position and still works there. If you’re reading this, I’m sending you a flood of love and appreciation.

I joined as the 8th person, and after around 4 years, when I left hungry for change, there were already over 30 of us, now around 100. It was a good time, greetings to everyone. **I finished my Master’s and Engineering degrees in Computer Science, and it was time for changes**.

## Chapter 2: 1st time as a Co-founder — Marketplace

In the meantime, there was also my first startup (**a marketplace**) with four of my friends. **We all worked on the product**, each of us **spent thousands of hours, after hours**, entire weekends… and I think finally over a year of work.

As you might guess, **we lacked the most important things: sales, marketing, and product-market fit**. We thought users think like us. We all also worked commercially, so the work went very smoothly, **but we didn’t know what we should do next with it…**

Finally, **we didn’t have any customers**, but you know what, I don’t regret it, a lot of learning things which I used many times later. The first attempts at validating the idea with the market and business activities.

**In the end**, the product was **Airbnb-sized**. Landing pages, listings, user panels, customer panels, admin site, notifications, caches, queues, load balancing, and much more. We wanted to publish the fully ready product to the market.

**It was a marketplace, so if you can guess, we had to attract both sides to be valuable.**

**“Marketplace”** — You can imagine **something like Uber**, if you don’t have passengers it was difficult to **convince taxi drivers**, if you don’t have a large number of taxi drivers **you cannot attract passengers**.

**After a year of development**, we were overloaded, and without business, marketing, sales knowledge, and budget.

## Chapter 3: Corp Team Lead / Programming Tutor / Programming Architecture Workshop Leader

Working in a corporation, a totally different environment, an international fintech, another learning experience, large products, and **workmates who were waiting for 5 pm** to finish — it wasn’t for me.

**Very slow product development, huge hierarchy, being an ant at the bottom, and low impact on the final product.**

At that time I understood that being a software developer is not anything special and I compared my work to factory worker. Sorry for that. High rates have been pumped only by **high demand**. Friends of mine from another industry do more difficult things and have a bigger responsibility for lower rates. **That’s how the market works.**

This lower responsibility time allowed for building the first online course after hours, my own course platform, individual teaching newbies programming, and my first huge success — my first B2C customers, and B2B clients for workshops. I pivoted to full focus on sales, marketing, funnels, advertisements, demand, understanding the market, etc.

**It was 10x easier than startups but allowed me to learn and validate my conceptions and ideas on an easier market and showed me that it’s much easier to locate their problem/need/want and create a service/product that responds to it than to convince people of your innovative ideas.**

**It’s just supply and demand**, such a simple and basic statement, in reality, is very deep and **difficult to understand without personal experience. If you’re inexperienced and you think you understand, you don’t.**

To this day, I love to analyze this catchword in relation to various industries / services / products and rediscover it again and again... While writing this sentence, I’m wondering if I’m not **obsessed**.

## Chapter 4: Next try — 2nd time as a founder — Edtech

Drawing upon my experiences in selling services, offering trainings, and teaching programming, I wanted to broaden my horizons, delve into various fields of knowledge, involve more teachers, and so on.

**We started with simple services in different fields of knowledge, mainly relying on teaching in the local area** (without online lessons). As I had already gathered some knowledge and experience in marketing and sales, things were going well and were moving in the right direction.

**The number of teachers in various fields was growing, as was the number of students.** I don’t remember the exact statistics anymore, but it was **another significant achievement** that brought me a lot of **satisfaction and new experiences**.

As you know, **I’m a technology lover** and **couldn’t bear to look at manual processes — I wanted to automate everything**: lessons, payments, invoices, customer service, etc. **That’s when I hired our first developers** (if you’re reading this, I’m sending you a flood of love — we spent a lot of time together and I remember it as a very fruitful and great year) and we began the process of tool and automation development. After a year we had really extended tools for students, teachers, franchise owners, etc.

We had really big goals, we wanted to climb higher and higher. Maybe I wouldn’t even fully call it Startup, as the client was paying for the lessons, not for the software. But it gave us positive income, bootstrap financing, and tool development for services provided.

**Scaling this model was not as costless as SaaS because customer satisfaction was mainly on the side of the teacher, not the quality of the product (software). Finally, we grew to nearly 10 people and dozens of teachers, with zero external funding, and almost $50k monthly revenue.**

We worked very hard, day and night, and by November 2019, we were packed with clients to the brim. And as you know, **that’s when the pandemic hit**. It turned everything upside down by 180 degrees. Probably no one was ready for it. With a drastic drop in revenues, society started to save. Tired from the previous months, we had to work even harder.

We had to reduce the team, change the model, and save what we had built. We stopped the tool’s development and sales, and **with the developers, we started supporting other product teams to not fire them in difficult times.**

**The tool worked passively for the next two years**, reducing incomes month by month. With a smaller team providing programming services, we had full stability and earned more than relying only on educational services. At the peak of the pandemic, **I promised myself that it was the last digital product I built… Never say never…**

## Chapter 5: Time for fintech — Senior Software Developer / Team Lead / Head of Development

I worked for small startups and companies. Building **products from scratch**, having a significant **impact on the product**, and complete fulfillment. Thousands of hours and **sacrifices**.

**This article mainly talks about startups that I built, so I don’t want to list all the companies, products, and applications that I supported as a technology consultant.** These were mainly start-ups with a couple of people up to around 100 people on board.

**Some of the products were just a rescue mission**, others were building an entire tech team. **I was fully involved in all of them with the hope that we would work together for a long time**, but I wasn’t the only one who made mistakes when looking for a product-market fit.

One thing I fully understood: **You can’t spend 8–15 hours a day writing code, managing a tech team, and still be able to help build an audience.**

**In marketing and sales**, you need to **be rested and very creative to bring results and achieve further results and goals**. If you have too many responsibilities related to technology, it becomes ineffective.

**I noticed that when I have more free time, more time to think, and more time to bounce the ball against the wall, I come up with really working marketing/sales strategies and solutions. It’s impossible when you are focused on code all day.**

**You must know that this chapter of my life was long and has continued until now.**

## **Chapter 6: 3rd time as a founder — sold

Never say never… right?\*\*

It was a time when the crypto market was **really high** and it was really **trending topic**. You know that I love technology right? So I cannot miss the **blockchain world**. I had experience in blockchain topics by learning on my own and from startups where I worked before.

**I was involved in crypto communities and I noticed** a “starving crowd”. People who did things manually and earned money(crypto) on it.I found potential for building a small product that solves a technological problem.

I said a few years before **that I don’t want to start from scratch**. I decided to share my observations and possibilities with my good friend. **He said, “If you gonna built it, I’m in”.**

**I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I had thought and planned every aspect of marketing and sales. And you know what. On this huge mindmap “product” was only one block. 90% of the mindmap was focused on marketing and sales.**

Now, writing this article, **I understood what path I went from my first startup to this one**. In the first (described earlier) **90% was the product, but in the last one 90% was sales and marketing**. Many years later, I did this approach automatically. **What has changed in my head over the years and so many mistakes?**

**At that time, the company for which I provided services was acquired**. The next day I got a thank you for my hard work and **all my accounts were blocked**.

Life… **I was shocked**. We were simply replaced by their trusted technology managers. **They wanted to get full control**. They acted a bit unkindly, but I knew that they had all my knowledge about the product in the documentation, because I’m used to drawing everything so that in the moment of my weakness (illness, whatever) the team could handle it.

**That’s what solid leaders do, right?** After a time, I know that these are normal procedures in financial companies, the point is that **under the influence of emotions, do not do anything inappropriate.**

**I quickly forgot about it, that I was brutally fired. All that mattered was to bring my plan to life.**

**And it has been started, 15–20 hours a day every day. You have to believe me, getting back into the game was incredibly satisfying for me.** I didn’t even know that I would be so excited.

**Then we also noticed that someone was starting to think about the same product as me. So the race began a game against time and the market.**

I assume that if you **have reached this point**, you are **interested in product-market fit, marketing, and sales**, so let me explain **my assumptions to you**:

## Product:

A very very small tool that allowed you to automate proper tracking and creation of on-chain transactions. **Literally, the whole app for the user was located on only three subpages.**

## Starving Crowd:

**We tapped into an underserved market**. The crypto market primarily operates via communities on platforms like Discord, Reddit, Twitter, Telegram, and so on. **Therefore, our main strategy was directly communicating with users and demonstrating our tool**. This was essentially “free marketing” (excluding the time we invested), **as we did not need to invest in ads, promotional materials, or convince people about the efficacy of our tool.**

**The community could directly observe on-chain transactions executed by our algorithms, which were processed at an exceptionally fast rate.** This was something they couldn’t accomplish manually, so whenever someone conducted transactions using our algorithm, it was immediately noticeable and stirred a curiosity within the community **(how did they do that!)**.

## Tests:

I conducted the initial tests of the application on myself — we had already invested significantly in developing the product, **but I preferred risking my own resources over that of the users.** I provided the tool access to my wallet, containing 0.3ETH, and went to sleep. Upon waking up, I discovered that the transactions were successful and my wallet had grown to 0.99ETH. **My excitement knew no bounds, it felt like a windfall. But, of course, there was a fair chance I could have lost it too.**

**It worked**. As we progressed, some users achieved higher results, but it largely hinged on the parameters set by them. As you can surmise, the strategy was simple — **buy low, sell high**. There was considerable risk involved.

## Churn:

For those versed in marketing, the significance of repeat visitors cannot be overstated. Access to our tool was granted only after email verification and a special technique that I’d prefer to keep confidential. And this was all provided for free. While we had zero followers on social media, we saw an explosion in our email subscriber base and amassed a substantial number of users and advocates.

## Revenue Generation:

Our product quickly gained popularity as we were effectively helping users earn — an undeniable value proposition. Now, it was time to capitalize on our efforts. We introduced a subscription model charging $300 per week or $1,000 per month — seemingly high rates, but the demand was so intense that it wasn’t an issue. Being a subscriber meant you were prioritized in the queue, ensuring you were among the first to reap benefits — thus adding more “value”.

## Marketing:

**The quality of our product and its ability to continually engage users contributed to it achieving what can best be described as viral.**

It was both a source of pride and astonishment to witness **users sharing charts and analyses derived from our tool in forum discussions**. They weren’t actively promoting our product but rather using **screenshots from our application to illustrate certain aspects of the crypto world**.

By that stage, we had already assembled a team to assist with marketing, and programming, and to provide round-the-clock helpdesk support.

## Unforgettable Time:

Despite the hype, my focus remained **steadfast on monitoring our servers, their capacity, and speed. Considering we had only been on the market for a few weeks, we were yet to implement alerts, server scaling, etc.**

Our active user base spanned from **Japan** to the **West Coast of the United States**. Primarily, our application was used daily **during the evenings**, but considering the variety of time zones, the only time I could afford to sleep was during the evening hours in Far Eastern Europe, where we had the least users. **However, someone always needed to be on guard, and as such, my phone was constantly by my side. After all, we couldn’t afford to let our users down.**

We found ourselves working **20 hours a day**, catering to thousands of users, enduring physical fatigue, engaging in talks with **VCs**, and **participating in conferences.**

## Sudden Downturn:

**Our pinnacle was abruptly interrupted by the war in Ukraine (next macroeconomic shot straight in the face, lucky guy)**, a precipitous drop in cryptocurrency value, and **swiftly emerging competition**.

**By this time, there were 5–8 comparable tools** had infiltrated the market. It was a challenging period as we continually stumbled upon new rivals.

They immediately **embarked on swift fundraising endeavors — a strategy we overlooked, which in retrospect was a mistake.**

**Although our product was superior, the competitors’ rapid advancement and our insufficient funds for expeditious scaling posed significant challenges.**

**Nonetheless, we made a good decision. We sold the product (exit) to competitors. The revenue from “exit” compensated for all the losses, leaving us with enough rest.**

**We were a small team without substantial budgets for rapid development, and the risk of forming new teams without money to survive for more than 1–2 months was irresponsible.**

**You have to believe me that this decision consumed us sleepless nights.**

**Finally, we sold it. They turned off our app but took algorithms and users.**

Whether you believe it or not, **after several months of toiling day and night, experiencing burnout**, growing weary of the topic, and gaining an extra 15 kg in weight, **we finally found our freedom…**

**The exit wasn’t incredibly profitable**, but we knew they had outdone us. The exit covered all our **expenses and granted us a well-deserved rest for the subsequent quarter.**

**It was an insane ride**. Despite the uncertainty, stress, struggles, and sleepless nights, **the story and experience will remain etched in my memory for the rest of my life**.

## Swift Takeaways:

* Comprehending User Needs: Do you fully understand the **product-market fi**t? Is your offering just an accessory or does it truly satisfy the user’s needs?
* **The Power of Viral Marketing: Take inspiration from giants like Snapchat, ChatGPT, and Clubhouse**. While your product might not attain the same scale (**but remember, never say never…**), the closer your concept is to theirs, the easier your journey will be. **If your user is motivated to text a friend saying, “Hey, check out how cool this is” (like sharing ChatGPT), then you’re on the best track. Really.** Even if it doesn’t seem immediately evident, there could be a way to incorporate this into your product. Keep looking until you find it.
* **Niche targeting** — the more specific and tailored your product is to a certain audience, the easier your journey will be
* **People love buying from people** — establishing a personal brand and associating yourself with the product can make things easier.
* **Value: Seek to understand why users engage with your product and keep returning.**
* **The more specific and critical the issue you’re aiming to solve, the easier your path will be.** Consider your offerings in terms of products and services and focus on sales and marketing, regardless of personal sentiments.

These are just a few points, I plan to elaborate on all of them in a separate article.

Many products undergo years of development in search of market fit, refining the user experience, and more. **And guess what?** There’s absolutely nothing wrong with that.

**Each product and market follows its own rules. Many startups have extensive histories before they finally make their mark (for instance, OpenAI).**

This entire journey spanned maybe 6–8 months. I grasped and capitalized on the opportunity, but we understood from the start that establishing a startup carried a significant risk, and our crypto product was 10 times riskier.

**Was it worth it? Given my passion for product development — absolutely.**

**Was it profitable? — No, considering the hours spent — we lose.**

**Did it provide a stable, problem-free life — nope.**

**Did this entire adventure offer a wealth of happiness, joy, and unforgettable experiences — definitely yes.**

**One thing is certain — we’ve amassed substantial experience and it’s not over yet :)**

**So, what lies ahead?**

**Chapter 7: Reverting to the contractor, developing a product for a crypto Startup**Returning to the past, we continue our journey…

I had invested substantial time and passion into the tech rescue mission product. I came on board as the technical Team Leader of a startup that had garnered over $20M in seed round funding, affiliated with the realm of cryptocurrencies. The investors were individuals with extensive backgrounds in the crypto world.

**My role was primarily technical, and there was an abundance of work to tackle. I was fully immersed, and genuinely devoted to the role.** I was striving for excellence, knowing that if we secured another round of financing, **the startup would accelerate rapidly.**

**As for the product and marketing, I was more of an observer**.

After all, there were marketing professionals with decades of experience on board. These were individuals recruited from large crypto-related firms. I had faith in them, kept an eye on their actions, and focused on my own responsibilities. **However, the reality was far from satisfactory.**

**On the last day, the principal investor for the Series A round withdrew. The board made the tough decision to shut down. It was a period of intense observation and gaining experience in product management.**

**This was a very brief summary of the last 10 years.**

**And what next?**

## (Last) Chapter 8: To be announced — Product Owner / Product Consultant / Strategist / CTO

After spending countless hours and days deliberating my next steps, one thing is clear:

**My aspiration is to continue traversing the path of software product development, with the hopeful anticipation that one day, I might ride the crest of the next big wave and ascend to the prestigious status of a unicorn company.**

I find myself drawn to the process of building products, exploring product-market fit, strategizing, engaging in software development, seeking out new opportunities, networking, attending conferences, and continuously challenging myself by understanding the market and its competitive landscape.

## Product Owner / Product Consultant / CTO / COO:

I’m not entirely sure how to categorize this role, as I anticipate that it will largely depend on the product to which I will commit myself fully.

**My idea is to find one startup/company that wants to build a product / or already has a product, want to speed up, or simply doesn’t know what’s next.**

Alternatively, I could be a part of an established company with a rich business history, which intends to invest in digitization and technological advancements. The goal would be to enrich their customer experience by offering complementary digital products

**Rather than initiating a new venture from ground zero with the same team, I am receptive to new challenges.** I am confident that my past experiences will prove highly beneficial for the **founders of promising, burgeoning startups that already possess a product, or are in the initial phases of development.**

**‘Consultant’** — I reckon we interpret this term differently. My aim is to be completely absorbed in a single product, crafting funnels, niches, strategies, and all that is necessary to repeatedly achieve the ‘product-market fit’ and significant revenue. **To me, ‘consultant’ resonates more akin to freelancing than being an employee**.

**My current goal is to kickstart as a consultant and aide, dealing with facilitating startups in their journey from point A to B.**

**Here are two theoretical scenarios to illustrate my approach:** **Scenario 1:**

1. (**Starting from point A**) You have a product but struggle with marketing, adoption, software, strategy, sales, fundraising, or something else.
2. I conduct an analysis and develop a strategy to reach point B.
3. I take on the **“dirty work”** and **implement** necessary changes, including potential pivots or shifts (going all-in) to guide the product to point B.
4. **The goal is to reach point B, which could involve achieving a higher valuation, expanding the user base, increasing sales, or generating monthly revenue, among other metrics.**

**Scenario 2:**

1. (**Starting from point A**) You have a plan or idea but face challenges with marketing, adoption, strategy, software, sales, fundraising, or something else.
2. I analyze the situation and devise a strategy to reach **point B**.
3. I tackle the necessary tasks, build the team, and overcome obstacles to propel the product to **point B**.

I have come across the view that finding the elusive product-market fit is the job of the founder, and it’s hard for me to disagree.

However, I believe that my support and experiences can help save money, many failures, and most importantly, time. I have spent a great deal of time learning from my mistakes, enduring failure after failure, and even had no one to ask for support or opinion, which is why I offer my help. Saving even a couple of years, realistically speaking, seems like a value I’m eager to provide…

**I invite you to share your thoughts and insights on these scenarios :)**

## Closing Remarks:

**I appreciate your time and effort in reaching this point.** This has been my journey, and I wouldn’t change it for the world. I had an extraordinary adventure, and now **I’m ready for the next exciting battle with the market and new software products.**

While my entire narrative is centered around startups, especially the ones I personally built, I’m planning to share more insights drawn from all of my experiences, not just those as a co-founder.

**If you’re currently developing your product or even just considering the idea, I urge you to reach out to me. Perhaps together, we can create something monumental :)**

**Thank you for your time and insights. I eagerly look forward to engaging in discussions and hearing your viewpoints. Please remember to like and subscribe. Nothing motivates to write more than positive feedback :)**

14jh1na,2,2023-06-26,Creating prompts for English tutoring classes,u/cat-type-energy,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/14jh1na/creating_prompts_for_english_tutoring_classes/,"I work with a premium English tutoring company and have classes with foreign business professionals who are typically at an intermediate-high or low-advanced level of English.

Our classes are 20 or 40 minute conversations on a topic of the students' choosing. Since my WPM is solid, during these classes, I typeout the entire transcript of the students words exactly as they say it since the company provides an AI-generated transcript, but I want to capture all of the student's small mistakes (omitting 's' for plural nouns, verb tenses, article usage, etc.).

Some of these classes focus on paraphrasing, corrections, and giving depth to the speaker's words while we're there together in the Zoom call. However, many others prefer to take this opportunity to speak as much as possible with no interruption. In this case, I transcribe their words by hand and go back after classes to paraphrase the entire conversation to add new idioms and vocabulary with a prompt like this:

>I want you to act as an English tutor and improver. The following is the transcript of a spoken conversation with an English learner. Paraphrase their words to make it more natural, conversational, and professional. Original: \[their words\]

&#x200B;

This works well enough, especially since it goes above and beyond the company's requirements for post-lesson, but I try to take my job seriously and want to give as detailed feedback as possible for students to learn from. If I do this by hand, however, it can take the better part of an hour whereas the company allocates 10-20 minutes to do it.

What I really want to do with this paraphrasing is far more complex. I'd like a prompt(s) that can:

1. Help the students understand what exact part of their original sentence I am trying to rephrase **and** why. If I were doing this by hand, I would underline/italicize a part of the sentence to emphasize this, e.g. ""I went *to park* this weekend to hang out with *some friend*."" I would include a note that explains the reasons that this phrasing is wrong.
2. I would like to keep the rewording of these incorrect phrases intact, relatively. Instead of changing ""This morning I *wake up* at 6 and *take shower* before I *went office*"" to the more natural, ""This morning I rolled out of bed at 6 to take a shower before heading into the office"", I would like to phrase these specific instances to read as ""This morning I **woke up** at 6:00 and **took a shower** before I **went to the office.""**
3. Regarding any new vocabulary or idioms that ChatGPT introduces into its paraphrased version, I would like it to offer a definition at the end of each paragraph giving a definition and additional example phrase for students to use.

&#x200B;

I know this is asking a lot, and maybe ChatGPT simply is not at this point yet, but I know there are ways that I can make my job a lot less strenuous while providing higher quality content to my students. If anyone could give some pointers or suggestions on how to go forward with this and test some solutions, I'd be deeply appreciative and even willing to offer some compensation for your time and effort.",User_deleted,2,neutral,0
14jihv5,1,2023-06-26,I asked ChatGPT itself to explain in a legal document Why should Venezuela(a non ChatGPT autorized country) should have access to ChatGPT,u/Rivieru-Moreh,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/14jihv5/i_asked_chatgpt_itself_to_explain_in_a_legal/,"This was the answer:

**Enabling Access to ChatGPT: Empowering Venezuela's Future**

Abstract: This document presents a comprehensive argument in favor of providing access to ChatGPT, a powerful language model, to the people of Venezuela. It explores the potential benefits of this technology and highlights the ways in which it can positively impact various aspects of Venezuelan society, including education, healthcare, economy, governance, and more. By enabling access to ChatGPT, Venezuela can unlock tremendous opportunities for growth, innovation, and empowerment.

1. Introduction: Venezuela, a country with immense potential, has been grappling with numerous challenges in recent years. However, technology has the power to transform nations and create new opportunities. ChatGPT, an advanced language model developed by OpenAI, represents a valuable resource that can empower Venezuelans and contribute to their development.
2. Education: Access to ChatGPT can revolutionize education in Venezuela. It can serve as a virtual tutor, providing personalized and interactive learning experiences to students across the country. ChatGPT can assist with language learning, provide instant explanations for complex topics, and offer guidance in various subjects. It can also bridge the educational gap by reaching remote areas with limited access to quality education.
3. Healthcare: ChatGPT can enhance healthcare services in Venezuela. By providing medical professionals with an extensive knowledge base, it can assist in diagnosing diseases, suggesting treatment options, and offering medical advice. This technology can significantly improve healthcare outcomes, especially in underserved regions where access to healthcare is limited.
4. Economic Growth: Enabling access to ChatGPT can stimulate economic growth in Venezuela. It can foster innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the development of new businesses and products. Entrepreneurs can leverage ChatGPT's capabilities to streamline operations, perform market research, and generate new ideas. Furthermore, ChatGPT can facilitate international collaboration, enabling Venezuelan businesses to engage with global partners and expand their reach.
5. Governance and Civic Engagement: ChatGPT can play a vital role in improving governance and fostering civic engagement in Venezuela. By providing accurate and up-to-date information, it can enable citizens to make informed decisions about public policies, elections, and societal issues. ChatGPT can also assist in promoting transparency and accountability in governance by analyzing data and detecting potential discrepancies.
6. Social Development: ChatGPT can contribute to social development in Venezuela by providing support in areas such as mental health, social services, and community engagement. It can act as a virtual counselor, helping individuals navigate personal challenges and providing resources for emotional well-being. Additionally, ChatGPT can assist social workers in connecting individuals with appropriate services and resources, thereby improving the overall social fabric of the nation.
7. Language and Cultural Preservation: Venezuela is home to diverse linguistic and cultural heritage. ChatGPT can help preserve and promote these valuable aspects of Venezuelan identity. It can provide language translation services, facilitate communication between different cultural groups, and act as a repository of cultural knowledge, stories, and traditions.
8. Ethical Considerations: While acknowledging the potential benefits, it is crucial to address ethical considerations surrounding the use of ChatGPT in Venezuela. Ensuring responsible deployment, data privacy, and algorithmic transparency are paramount. Collaboration between OpenAI, local stakeholders, and regulatory bodies can help establish guidelines and protocols that protect users' rights and promote ethical AI practices.
9. Technical Infrastructure: Enabling access to ChatGPT requires a robust technical infrastructure in Venezuela. Efforts must be made to improve internet connectivity, strengthen cybersecurity measures, and provide reliable electricity supply. Collaboration between public and private sectors can help overcome these challenges and create an environment conducive to leveraging ChatGPT's capabilities effectively.
10. Conclusion: Access to ChatGPT can be a transformative force in Venezuela, opening doors to knowledge, innovation, and empowerment",active,0,positive,0

I am asking because some of my lecturers from the Statistics department talks about ChatGPT and kinda indirectly encourage us to use it help us and supplement our learning, not in a way for us to plagiarize. Although it is against the rules to copy our answers from ChatGPT, but I'm assuming it is encouraged and therefore not against the rules to use ChatGPT just like WolframAlpha, Symbolab etc..",User_deleted,18,neutral,0

&#x200B;

I recently transitioned into Mod 3, but my experience with Mod 2 was extremely negative. Throughout the module, there were three teachers, and out of them, only two seemed knowledgeable. However, only one of them was approachable. What surprised me the most was that the instructor who acted like the most fun person in front of the class turned out to be a complete jerk during one-on-one interactions or in breakout rooms. He provided minimal feedback, gave one-word answers to questions, and overall seemed unhelpful. On the other hand, the other instructor who had no grasp of the subject matter was a disaster. She even refused to answer some questions during the morning practice problems, which was truly embarrassing.

&#x200B;

To compensate for the lackluster teaching, I heavily relied on my fellow students and resorted to searching on Google, which seemed like the only way to learn. Unfortunately, topics introduced in the curriculum were often neglected afterward. The curriculum would claim, ""And now you know how to do xyz!"" when clearly many students, including myself, struggled with it. Despite this, I accepted that I would need to learn and practice extensively on my own. However, this led to a major issue: my grades felt inflated. Without access to the rubric, I knew I had overlooked or failed to complete several requirements, yet I was still awarded a 99. Moreover, there were numerous cases of people failing the exam and the Mod 2 project, but the instructors pushed them through anyway. Some individuals even resorted to blatant cheating, copying and pasting from ChatGPT without any attempt to conceal it. For example, one person copied and pasted the pseudocode from ChatGPT, which explained what the code was doing. Now these individuals have moved on to Mod 3, where they contribute nothing due to their lack of understanding. It's understandable that many students are frustrated with this situation.

&#x200B;

However, my biggest question is why the HR administration wouldn't require these students to retake the module. The only reasonable explanation seems to be financial concerns. It's disheartening because I initially believed HR would be an excellent learning environment, but now I find myself paired with an incompetent partner. I fear that their lack of competence will hinder my own learning, just as it did in Mod 2. Furthermore, it appears that the administration will simply push us through to graduation regardless, even though someone like me could benefit from redoing the module.

&#x200B;

In summary, I strongly advise potential students to think twice before enrolling in hack reactor.",User_deleted,37,negative,0

From social media plans to recipe planner, to birthday planning, and everything else in between; AI available to us is absolutely incredible! 

If used correctly, it already has the capability for enriching and bettering one's daily life, saving time and streamlining tasks. 

Although the risks of AI are real and should be discussed at length, I believe majority of the risks come from our shortcomings as humans and us projecting this onto a technology so great, that we will impede ourselves in the process.

As it stands right now, the free version of chatGPT available to public is capable of so much, that if used correctly, can already vastly improve one's life. 
As an example, a job seeker can use it to help write an attractive CV, which will improve a person's chances of landing a good role. A student with minimal cooking knowledge can use it to get recipes with prep instructions. A household can create and manage their budget effectively. And all of it - for free!

AI can also be used for entertainment - DALL-E allows people with no artistic background to express their creativity and try new things. 

Of course it is not all rosy. On the flip side of the coin, the capabilities of the available AI can be used to produce vile, sickening things. However, this is due to us - humans. It is not an inherent trait of AI to do harm. 

Maybe the answer to dealing with the risks AI poses, is to find the good in humanity, and allow this to be the teaching material for the AI. Maybe, just maybe, if we can all work towards understanding that we could absolutely create a utopia, our subsequent actions would actually lead us there?

Maybe it is time for us to have a good, hard look in the mirror and understand that it is us - humans, that have led the world to the state that it is today; and we need to change our systems, learn new, better ways of life as a species? 

Maybe government regulation is not necessary, because above all, they are also humans with individual, egotistical, self-serving agendas?",User_deleted,0,positive,0

I wonder if there are other unconventional use case’s I’m missing for GPT-4. 

I personally use GPT-4 as my personal teacher with infinite patience. If I’m interested in certain topic, I usually start reading a textbook on it, but more often that not I get confused by what’s in the book. So I ask chatgpt to explain it using the prompts like “Explain the intuition behind X”. “Provide an actual example with explanation”. I also experimented with “I’m a student studying X. You are a professor with extensive knowledge in X. Explain Y to me in simple terms”. 

My studying progress has sped up exponentially with chatgpt. I’ve already covered 2 courses in like 2-3 months. The ability to solve math problems correctly and provide explanation is a game changer for gpt4.

14lnfbk,55,2023-06-28,Reflections As A Graduating Grade 12,u/DrPraeclarum,OntarioGrade12s,https://www.reddit.com/r/OntarioGrade12s/comments/14lnfbk/reflections_as_a_graduating_grade_12/,"Hey everyone,

I just wanted to write this post to potentially help out the grade 11s who will be heading to grade 12 next year on what I wish I knew before going into grade 12. I would say grade 12 for me was quite successful of a year and I was able to make 3/4 of my top choices (if you want more info on that you can go through my post history). Here is a semi-formal compilation of advice and general statements I wish I knew that I wanted to share with this subreddit. If you disagree with the things I say, that's cool. However please keep it chill in the comments, please.

**Tip #1 - Read this Subreddit Cautiously**

I'd first like to preface this by saying that this subreddit is a great resource. I learned many practical things which helped me get into my preferred programs such as how to write good supplementary applications/the AIF, how to do video interviews properly, etc. However, I would also like to explore the flip side of that which is this subreddit can also be a breeding ground for misinformation.

Many of the people on this subreddit are high school students. Although many of them have the best intentions in mind, for questions relating to specific information on programs I highly recommend going to individual university subreddits, discords, or rather talking to the students in those programs 1:1 (whether it be through Linkedin or specific workshops organized by your University) about their experiences. There are many misconceptions I have seen surrounding Waterloo and UofT Engineering/CS that many students I talked to completely debunked. This also goes to the other side too, do not simply spread rumors about particular programs when you've never been in that program. If you do, provide proof of some kind to back up your claims.

This isn't just limited to programs though, things such as specific dates of when Universities will send out offers, whether or not they are rolling, etc. are also complete speculations from last year (or sometimes even completely made up). I remember reading comments on this or another subreddit saying Waterloo Engineering offers will go out on a particular week but nothing happened.

The main point is, PLEASE do your own research before going to this subreddit. Consult multiple, trustworthy sources, not just one. Use your critical judgment and decide whether or not you think a claim being made is fictitious or not. It will save you a lot of stress.

**Tip #2 - Early Admission and Grade 11 Marks**

When I was in grade 11 going into grade 12 I thought early admission was similar to the American system where there are specific dates when you apply to universities early (usually in the fall), and the universities will read those applications early and reject or deny you based on them and your grades (usually in winter). However early admission in the Ontario system means something entirely different.

Everyone will be given a pin number, where they can register into the application system (OUAC) and you will apply only once. When you apply, some universities will send you a supplementary written portion you need to submit by a particular date to move your application forward. Whereas others send you absolutely nothing. For the ones that don't send anything they will only look at your grades from semester 1 midterms to semester 2 midterms, and if your marks meet the cut they'll accept you. That is early acceptance in a nutshell. This is where the question of ""Do grade 11 marks matter or not?"" comes in and I will answer... yes and no.

For most, usually less competitive, programs, it will (only for early admission though). For example, I received my TMU CS offer literally 1 week after I applied in mid-November. Which means they looked at my grade 11 marks. For competitive programs in CS/Engineering on the other hand, at select universities such as UofT or Waterloo, they won't matter as much if at all really. I got my offer from Waterloo CE in late May where only grade 12 marks were registered into the system. However, for UofT, they did look at my grade 11 physics mark cause I didn't have the grade 12 equivalent in the March round. So really my advice would be to focus on prerequisites in grade 11 as those can be useful later on.

**Tip #3 - Have Balance**

This is going to be a cliche point, so I won't expand on it too much. Yes, study as hard as you can, grade 12 is important. However, in my opinion, you should always have some balance. I studied hard however I always tried to give myself breathing room whenever I could. It'll help you from being burnt out and improve your grades ironically.

**Tip #4 - Start Supplmentaries Early**

This mainly applies to competitive programs but also scholarships too.

By starting your supplementaries early you will have more time to think about your work and whether or not you think it has quality. When I write something for the first time, in my head I may think it is perfect in the moment. However, when I re-read it or ask another person to read it, there are many flaws and nitpicky things that are revealed (kinda like this post lol). By starting early you will have more chances to examine and debate your ideas and thus produce higher quality work.  I saw too many people leave their supplementary last minute and I think it would have helped if they had more time to think.

Always let another person review your writing. Ideally, it should be a private university admissions counselor (one which is legitimate) but obviously, most people ( including me) do not have such resources. So, maybe talk to your English teacher or someone you trust as even though they may not know about the specifics of university admissions they can help refine your grammar or your writing style. All of which are important.

**Tip #5 - It Is Not Over Until It Is Over**

I remember the first English assignment I received had a mark in the 80s. It was quite worrying because I had doubts about whether I would be able to make it into my top choices due to a low English mark. However, as the semester progressed. I gradually improved, asking my teacher for feedback, and naturally, my marks increased and I finished with a mid-90 in English. The same thing happened in physics too. Just because you receive 1 bad mark or 2 it absolutely does not mean you won't finish with a good final mark. Just keep on grinding and working hard (but also efficiently... I'll get to that soon). Even if the results go poorly, you at least could show you worked hard for it.

Conversely, do not get too relaxed when you get in. Although most conditionals (certain averages you need to maintain in order to go to your university) are quite easy to earn. I know multiple people who stopped studying and got too close to the sun, especially near exam season. I highly recommend you do well in the first 70-85% of the course so that when exams come around the stress levels won't be too hard on you. That was the case for me and I am eternally thankful for my past self.

**Tip #6 - Pre-Study**

This might be controversial but I recommend pre-studying the material in the summer before grade 12. Obviously don't go all out and enjoy your summer but learn the fundamentals. Things such as basic algebra, graphing, solving quadratics, etc. are too often missed yet are highly important to succeeding in certain courses like math and physics. And maybe if you are really ambitious go and cover grade 12 material. There are many great resources online such as Ms. Havrot for Ontario grade 12 curriculum, Professor Leonard for calculus, Walter Lewin for physics, etc. Additionally, there are free textbook PDFs out there if you look deep enough. I pre-studied advanced functions and calc over the summer and it has been EXTREMELY useful to me now.

**Tip #7 - Work Efficiently**

If you want to study less for higher marks. Study efficiently. Don't just read your notes, actively try to recall everything from your brain and put it onto a piece of paper. There is wayyyy more theory going into this but you can search for active learning on YouTube or Google. Secondly, focus on things you don't understand. Going through 100 easy problems you are confident with is useless compared to solving 10 difficult questions. If you are having trouble thinking of an idea for English, ask your teacher for ideas, hell even ChatGPT could help you create a basic outline to form a flow of ideas. I could go on and on but these are my three biggest tips.

**Tip #8 - Enjoy What You Are Learning**

Personally, I found grade 12 physics this year really interesting as we covered a lot of deep things such as fields and the fundamental nature of forces. Not everything has to be about marks. Sometimes what you are learning is very cool and interesting and you should enjoy it.

**Conclusion**

On a final note, this is your final year. Enjoy yourself. It doesn't all have to be doom and gloom. There are so many more things I wanted to talk about more but I have to end it here as my hands are getting quite tired. You do not need to take my advice too seriously. I am also a mere high schooler (well I guess not anymore), so again not a beacon of wisdom or anything. I hope my advice here has been helpful. Have a great summer everyone and I wish you all the best in September. This subreddit has truly been such a lifesaver and I'll definitely try to help out future grade 12s in the future. Thank you all so much <3.",active,70,neutral,0

The instructions are often just 2 or 3 sentences and don't specify anything about wordcount, APA, etc. The peer assessment forms follow suit: very basic.

Here are my week 3 written assignment instructions:
""Suppose a firm finds that the marginal product of capital is 60 and the marginal product of labor is 20. If the price of capital is $6 and the price of labor is $2.50, describe how the firm should adjust its mix of capital and labor? What will be the result?""

In week 2, I submitted a 770-word APA-style essay, but all 3 students I peer assessed just blatantly copy and pasted some raw ChatGPT output. All three were almost identical, and two of them weren't even finished. It was as if Chat GPT stalled and the student didn't even check what they were copy and pasting. 

The annoying thing is that those submissions still basically meet all of the requirements and the scoring criteria for the peer assessment is just 100% based on making correct calculations. 

Is this correct? 
It doesn't seem right to me. 

I could have just copy and pasted the calculation from ChatGPT and got the same (or an even higher) score with barely any effort at all. 
I spent 2/3 hours writing my essay.",active,1,neutral,0

14nfd55,269,2023-06-30,"Grad student totally played me, and I am an idiot",u/zazzlekdazzle,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/14nfd55/grad_student_totally_played_me_and_i_am_an_idiot/,"I don't know if I need advice or just a mini-vent.  

This is far from the greatest frustration any of you face, or even I have faced, but it just floors me how students still can surprise me at this stuff.

I teach an online summer graduate class for students getting their MS in Data Science. Usually, these are (hands down) my best and most organized students. No doubt this is because these students have regular jobs all day and are spending their valuable time and money on the classes - both resources they likely have little of.

So, I don't usually have many policies to get around the usual arms race of students trying to get away with sh*t. But this semester, I had a student who totally played me.

I never had a grad student who just straight-up lied and cheated like this one - and in such obvious ways. I grade the graduate student homework on completion rather than accuracy. Now, this has never been an issue with grad students. But, this was my first mistake with Cheater here. Cheater either just guessed on the multiple choice questions or had ChatGPT do the coding questions for them. They could not reproduce even the most basic tasks in class.

I also have in-class labs that I grade the same way as the homework. I usually think this is less of an issue than the homework because I am right here while they do it. (Not in person, but you get it.)  Cheater was always having issues with their video and audio and couldn't participate fully in the labs. When they did, I would ask how they were doing, and they said fine and never needed any help. I set up a system so the students would submit the answers on an online form, and sure enough, it looks like ChatGPT was doing the labs, too! When the class got to the point where good old AI couldn't do the work for Cheater anymore, they just started handing in random, almost gibberish (this I at least feel OK marking incomplete, and I told them so).

But you know what, Cheater gets full credit for all the homework and most of the labs because I did not explain to the grad students that they need to use the material I teach in the class to answer the questions (like I do for undergrads) because I never needed to before. I mean, who pulls this sh*t as a grad student?

Right now, I am giving the final. And, sure enough, little Cheater has sworn up and down that they submitted their exam. Yet, I do not have it. I have no doubt Cheater is having trouble piecing something together and is buying time to send me whatever later. The old ""my computer must have corrupted that file, here is the real one (submitted the next day)"" trick. 

Now, I do not have a lateness policy (mistake number 347 considering Cheater) for a FINAL EXAM because who the f\*\*k does that as a grad student? Since I don't have a stated lateness policy, I will have to grade this f\*\*King exam, and whatever they get, plus all their complete but completely garbage assignments (2/3s of the grade) will likely get them maybe a B- in a class they did nothing for and learned nothing from.

**Can I retroactively dock this student some points on their final for being late if I don't have a lateness policy for exams?**

I am an idiot.

EDIT: OK, I think I may have an out. In my syllabus, under the section on homework assignments, as the last line: ""Due to the quick pace of the class, I cannot accept late work."" Now, it *could* be taken to mean it only applied to homework assignments, but I do say that is my lateness policy - I don't accept late work. Will this work?

**EDIT2: The saga continues!**

As the top comment suggested here, we did some legit exploration which revealed that the student DID submit the exam not just on time but quite early. 

But...one thing I omitted above, for brevity, is that I allow a one-hour grace period after the exam deadline to take care of any technical issues, like this very one. I tell the students about this grace period and what it's for. I expect, but do not explicitly state, that they will be alert around this time to take care of any issues. 

When I saw the student did not have an exam submitted, and when they did not respond to my inquiries during the grace period, I assumed they were buying time and snowing me. I was not bothered that I did not see the exam at the deadline - issues like theirs happen all the time, and the students know there is a pad of time, so that's fine if they use it. *What got me was that I did not get a response during the grace period, not until almost two hours later.* 

But here's the rub - the student needed to submit the exam early and was not contactable because they had to go to the emergency room. (I actually believe the student about the ER because they had relevant and persistent health issues all term.)

The student is extremely apologetic about missing my alerts during the grace period and begging me not to penalize their grade, and I'm in a tough position. If the student had been honest with me all semester and did their work in good faith, I wouldn't bat an eyelash about giving them a pass for not being around during the grace period for a health emergency. The student thought they were all set, so they assumed there was no need to be on alert for problems (not the smartest assumption, but I get it).",active,303,neutral,0
