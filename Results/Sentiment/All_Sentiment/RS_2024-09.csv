1f61nr2,74,2024-08-31,I finished studying the HSK6 Standard Course (again) ,u/BeckyLiBei,ChineseLanguage,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/1f61nr2/i_finished_studying_the_hsk6_standard_course_again/,"I finished studying the HSK6 Standard Course, both volumes: 上册 and 下册 (40 chapters).  You can watch me [study it on YouTube for 384 hours](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbv6XCBlpTgmPbft6dqJFNnXh24yX_uWP) if you want.  This is my second time working through these books, and I went through it far more carefully this time.

I booked into the HSK6 exam for October (i.e., in 48 days); I'm not sure how well I'll do.

First, some things you may not know: (a) There are **official answers** to the exercises: [上册](https://www.blcup.com/enres/ResInfo?rid=43625) and [下册](https://www.blcup.com/enres/ResInfo?rid=51694).  (b) The vocabulary listed alongside the main texts **only cover approx. 2000 words**, so they don't cover the entire HSK6 syllabus (HSK2.0 standards) which has 2500 items.  However, vocabulary is listed both before and after the main texts in each chapter.

Importantly, almost all (if not all) of the 40 texts have been **modified from an original text**.  I suggest **reading the original texts too, if available** (or search for keywords and read related articles if they're not available).  The textbook versions have been dumbed down, and vocabulary and grammar (and even content) has been artifically crammed in---these are not just minor modifications.  Consequently, the writing is sometimes quite unnatural, like 狗， 哦， 我们姑且换一个文雅的称呼吧，犬 (ch.6), or 我们还能迷信专家吗？ (ch.40), or 高限一般是最高心率的85% (ch.40).  Oh, and who can forget this beauty from chapter 21:

> 不管你是想买样式新颖的羽绒服， 旗袍，还是想买你中意的音响，收音机，水龙头或者只是几枚纽扣儿，一个插座，再或者是勘探矿产的工具，你只要把照片发送到专门的网站，就能得到反馈。

So **I do not recommend using these texts as examples of good prose**.  Compare the original text with the textbook version and you'll see what I mean.  Often where I struggled to understand something, it's because of a modification from the original (e.g., the textbook had to use some word somewhere, so they stuff in it and maybe break some collocations).

In my experience, quite a few HSK6 exam questions look a lot like they've been copy/pasted from Sina or Sina-like articles, so the HSK6 student using the HSK6 Standard Course will somehow need to bridge the gap between these HSK6 Standard Course texts and real-world texts.


How I studied:

- For vocabulary, I'd try to study words to theoreical exhaustion (although maybe I can still improve my fluency), using a Chinese-Chinese dictionary in Pleco, along with example sentences from YouDao (and whatever comes up via Google).  I'd use ChatGPT for all sorts of things, but I found asking vague questions like ""Can you help me with [word] please?"" most useful as it would tell me things I might not have thought to ask for.  It's also helpful for generating example sentences where words are used with particular parts of speech, and for generating paragraphs and background stories using certain vocabulary.

- For certain words, especially tangible nouns, I'd search for them in Google Image Search---this helps create a mental image of what the word means (sometimes there are surprises, such as finding out what 丰满 really means).  For adjectives, I'd identify what they can describe and whether they're positive/negative/neutral (e.g., 顽固 bad, 坚强 good).  I'd put extra effort/time into studying verbs in order to understand their specific grammar (Can it take an object?  Do you use it with 被?  Where do you put the 了?  What contexts can it arise in?  What are its collocations?)  For most words (and especially chengyu), I'd make sure I understand what each of its characters mean, and identify other words containing a common character used in the same way.  Chengyu grammar is almost always irregular, and chengyus are often used in precise circumstances, so I'd make sure to study that.

- When I finished studying the vocabulary, I would read the text aloud twice.  Once to make sure I understood it, know the tones, and filling in knowledge gaps if needed, and once again without stopping for fluency.  (In previous study, I'd read aloud the texts 20+ times, timing myself every day for weeks, until I could read it aloud faster than the supplied mp3.)

- Once I finished studying each volume, I read the texts aloud from all 20 chapters in one go.  **For the first volume (上册) I read aloud all 20 texts in 1 hour 59 minutes, and for the second volume (下册) I read aloud all 20 texts in 3 hours and 13 minutes**.  (Here it is on YouTube: [上册](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShbiN8xakyc&list=PLbv6XCBlpTgmPbft6dqJFNnXh24yX_uWP&index=83) and [下册](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zn2-PT3WPoM&list=PLbv6XCBlpTgmPbft6dqJFNnXh24yX_uWP&index=191))  It's mindblowing that a sizeable chunk of the HSK6 cirriculum, which took years of study to learn, can now be reviewed in mere hours.

- During my study this time, I allowed myself to go far off-topic: putting in hundreds of hours of study requires some element of enjoyment, so if I found something that was fun and relevant, I'd keep doing that.  So I ended up doing things like reading interesting Wikipedia pages, getting ChatGPT to generate paragraphs using vocabulary in the style of ""Yes, Minister"", or reading a 语文 textbook which gives the backstory for some chengyu.

- I got into the habit of stating aloud what I think is correct, then cross-checking my claims against my Chinese-Chinese dictionary, Google, ChatGPT, etc.  This way, if I have some kind of misconception, it became quite apparent.  For vocabulary, I'd mention the parts of speech it can be used in, whether or not it can be used figuratively, its most common collocation(s), and other nuances (e.g., how it differs from its English translation).


My specific feedback on the textbook:

- There's an **incredibly heavy emphasis on vocabulary**: there's vocabulary accompanying the main text, and what I call the ""pre-vocabulary vocabulary"" (the vocabulary you learn before you reach the main text) and ""post-vocabulary vocabulary"" (the vocabulary you learn after you've finished the main text).  I think this is reasonable; the main bottleneck is usually not knowing enough words, or not knowing them to sufficient depth.  I believe you need to know a lot more than the HSK6 vocabulary for the HSK6 exam.

- Both volumes proceed unit by unit (4 chapters per unit), which essentially means there's 10 topics covered.  E.g., unit 7 pertains to the backstories behind Chinese phrases (草船借箭, 完璧归赵, 囊萤照读, and 知音), while unit 8 pertains to human biology.  Some of the units are fairly haphazard, however.  In any case, I like the systematic learning style ""get good at one topic, then move onto the next topic"", and **I encourage students to Google keywords from the text and keep reading** one you finish a topic (it's satisfying immediately using your new/improved skills in the real world).

- At the start of every chapter there's 4 characters with a list of words containing each one; it's unclear what we're meant to do with this.  (PS. You can put the character in Pleco and select WORD for this functionality.)  I studied these (e.g. by looking up defintions, example sentences, comparing synonyms, identifying collocations and contexts), but some of them are very low priority (like 期终 in ch.33), while some important words are missing.  For the given words, the characters have a single meaning and pronunciation (they may have different meanings and pronunciations outside these words), and some of the characters are prefixes and suffixes.

- Beside the main text, vocabulary is listed along with the part-of-speech and English translation corresponding to how its used in the main text.  **This level of vocabulary knowledge is simply not good enough at the HSK6 level**: we need to know basically all the meanings of words (even rare and figurative usages appear on the HSK6 exam).  Moreover, quite a few translations are dubious (e.g., 冲击 ""v. to challenge, to go for"" (ch.24) or 高涨 = ""adj. (in) high (spirits)"" (h.25) or 部署 = ""v. to arrange, to map out"" (ch.37)).  I believe students at the HSK6 level would be far better off using a Chinese-Chinese dictionary then relying on translation-based definitions.

- One thing that annoys me is how **the textbook sporadically replaces proper nouns** for no obvious benefit: such as writing 钱小奇 instead of his actual name 郭奇 (ch.11), writing 某家著名的搜索引擎公司 instead of 谷歌 (ch.22), writing 孙瀛洲的女儿孙女士 instead of giving her name 孙文冬 (ch.34), writing 小罗 instead of his name 罗祥彬 (ch.37).  (And they do this inconsistently, using the correct names for 王建男 (ch.14), 蔺相如 (ch.27), 孙瀛洲 (ch.34), 锐步 (ch.40).)  The textbook also doesn't tell you that chapter 23 is the background story to the chengyu 囊萤照读 and the boy's name is 车胤.  It also doesn't tell you that the story on page 170 (下册) is from 《背影》 by 朱自清 (I only recognized this because I had read the story elsewhere).

- The grammar sections usually begin by describing some conjunctions, adverbs, prepositions, or grammar structures (later on it's more about rhetoical devices like hyperbole and parallelism).  **It's a struggle to understand the grammar explanations due to unexplained lingusitics jargon**, despite these explanations being important.  Even simple things like 名词 ""noun"", 动词 ""verb"", 形容词 ""adjective"" are not part of the HSK vocabulary, let alone Chinese-specific grammar terms like 状语, 定语, 补语 which are concepts key to Chinese grammar, or phrases commonly used in grammar explanations like 侧重于, 褒义/贬义, 重叠, or 前缀/后缀.  Moreover, the example sentences are needlessly long and difficult, as if the author was attempting to teach multiple things at a time (not just the relevant grammar point).  For my first time studying this textbook, I didn't know the grammar jargon, so I mostly just skipped the explanations; but by the second time, I had learned grammar jargon, so I could read it easily enough.  (Note you can take a photo of textbook pages and give it to ChatGPT for help nowadays.)

- In the second volume, we talk about rhetoric devices, like 仿词 (words you make up) and segues and hyperbole and paragraph structure.  This is where we start to appreciate more poetic aspects of the language.  It's hard to appreciate these aspects when you're an early-HSK6 student.


The **textbook's exercises are rather ""hit or miss""**:

- Some of the exercises ask you to modify a sentence to use a certain word, which sounds reasonable until you realize you're expected to replace a word like 本质 with a synonym like 实质, and everything else remains unchanged.  (E.g., on page 63 of 下册, we're given three example sentences and we're meant to rephase them with 不成; in all three, the correct answer is to change 吗 to 不成, and that's it.)  This is an odd choice of exercise to give HSK6-level students, who should be able to write full paragraphs.  To make these more challenging, I would try to see if I can make my answer character-for-character identical with the official answer.  Occasionally you would need to actually rephrase the grammar, and identifying when this is required and carrying it out seems like a worthwhile exercise.

- Some of the exercises give you five words to add into a paragraph with 5 blanks.  Unfortunately, the five words are from totally different parts of speech, and have totally different meanings, so you don't really learn much.  To make these exercises more useful, I'd cover up the five words, and try to fill in the blanks by identifying collocations, and recalling the words I had recently revised.

- There's different types of ""complete this sentence with a given word"" exercises; these are a good choice of exercise, since you're given an appropriate context in which the word might arise, and you have the freedom to write according to your own personal style.  Sometimes I'd try to make my answer character-for-character identical with the official answer, but if that wasn't possible (or if there is no official answer), it might be hard to verify my answer; I might ask ChatGPT for help.

- Every chapter has an exercise where you're given five characters and are asked to write words containing those characters.  This exercise is kind of fun, although sometimes the characters don't belong to many common words, and the official answers include rare words (that I'd still feel like I'm years away from ever needing).  I'd be especially happy if I could think of a chengyu containing the character.

- There's usually a ""restate the text"" exercise for each chapter, where you're asked to restate the text step-by-step.  I skipped this exercise.  There's also a writing exercise which asks you to restate the text in some way.  I skipped this exercise too.  If I want to say/write something, I'd choose my own topic.  (Does anyone actually do these exercises?  They seem pointless.)

- In the first volume, there are some 语病 = ""faulty wording"" questions.  Be warned: **some of these ""faulty wording"" questions are unhelpful and even demoralizing**, such as the one on page 30 of 上册, where you need to change the non-HSK adjective 清凉 to the non-HSK adjective 清新 (and there's no actual grammar error; it's akin to changing ""the sky is red"" to ""the sky is blue""), or the one on page 93 (上册) which gets you to change 青松翠柏 (including 2 non-HSK characters) to 松柏常青.  Nevertheless, among these questions are some important points, like the grammar error in 妈妈对于我不太信任，……。 (page 94, 上册).  I suggest paying attention to the important points, but not getting flustered if you don't ""get it"", as sometimes they're just not helpful.",active,77,neutral,0

Even if you told him to write some kind of complex project, he will still give a basic example, because he is not sure if you know exactly how the code works or not. And he is forced to do so.

Well, Gemini specifically found the problem, or rather the problem is ourselves. Google is a company that makes technologies that adapt to us. Right? And there is no doubt that the same story will happen with AI. We do not tell Gemini anything about ourselves, silently about our experience, work experience, etc. So how can we expect some amazing results if he doesn't even know what to do?

The world is pre-med is very competitive, so doing everything possible to ensure acceptance into medical school (even if at the expense of others) is very common.

In my multi-variable calculus, I noticed that the student sitting next to me (18M), another pre-med student, got a 100% on a quiz on partial derivatives. Sensing competition, I did what any normal pre-med student would do: falsely report him for cheating to the teacher. In an eloquent but entirely fraudulent note to the professor, I stated that he made a formula sheet for the quiz, which was not allowed. Upon hearing this, the teacher changed my competitor’s grade for the test from a 100% to a 0%. Seeing my power, I quickly realized I could sabotage many other students.

When I went to my calculus-based mechanics class, I noticed a group of other pre-meds (18M, 19M, 19F, and 20M) who seemed to be answering every single question correctly. To me, this was indicative of a strong physics background amongst these students. Knowing I would have a tough time competing against these people, I decided that academic sabotage was the only solution. We had a lab report on drag forces due that week, so I falsely accused all 4 of them of plagiarizing from each other. In an eloquently-worded but BS email to my physics professor, I pointed out very small similarities in writing styles that in no way indicate plagiarism (such as usage of Oxford commas and similarities in sentence length), but the professor was none the wiser and believed my allegations. As such, I had 4 pre-med students in my physics class suspended because I falsely accused them of plagiarism.

A day later, we got handed back our stoichiometry tests in chemistry class, and I noticed a group of pre-meds (18M, 18F, 19M, 20M, 20F, and 21M) who got As. After successfully getting 4 pre-meds suspended for false plagiarism accusations, I tried pushing my limits. I falsely accused all 6 of these pre-meds in my chemistry class of sexual assault. I used ChatGPT to create 6 false accusations sexual assault against all of these people. Furthermore, I created 6 burner email accounts and emailed these fake accusations to my university from these burner accounts. I got them all expelled from my university, and now all 6 of them are in court for sexual assault charges.

I have always been told sabotaging others is normal pre-med behavior, but does what I did count? I ruined one kid’s test score, got four kids falsely suspended for plagiarism, and got six kids falsely expelled for sexual assault allegations. Am I the asshole for all of this, or is this really just normal pre-med behavior?

Welcome to the ever-engaging universe of conversational agents—yes, those virtual pals like Siri and Alexa that have become a part of our daily lives. But there's more to them than meets the eye, or in this case, ear. A recent groundbreaking bibliometric analysis uncovers how the field of conversational agents (CA) has evolved over the last fifteen years and why trust is the game-changer in this dialogue between human and machine. Buckle up as we embark on a journey through high-tech history and look into the world of AI agents!

## What Are Conversational Agents Anyway?

**Conversational Agents (CAs)** are essentially AI-powered entities designed to chat with us, amicably mimicking the nuances of human dialogue. They've come a long way from their humble beginnings—like ELIZA, the 1960s computer program designed to simulate a psychotherapist. From the simple word-matching strategies of the past, we've witnessed the evolution to today's advanced AI systems that understand and generate language almost as smoothly as a human.

These agents can fall into two categories: **task-oriented agents**, which manage specific tasks like making reservations or answering customer queries, and **social agents**, which aim for free-ranging, relationship-style exchanges.

Speaking of evolution, have you heard of ChatGPT? Released in 2022 by OpenAI, it’s garnered massive attention, shining a light on the public's booming interest in AI-driven conversations.

## The Trust Quotient: Why It Matters?

Trust is a pivotal component when we talk about human-AI interaction. For people to adopt and rely on CAs, they need to trust them—imagine running errands with someone you didn't trust. Awkward, right? 

Researchers Meltem Aksoy and Annika Bush have delved deep, analyzing a whopping 955 studies published between 2009 and 2024 to piece together how the discourse around trust in CAs has shifted and expanded. The study reveals that the U.S. holds the lead in research, with Germany, China, and the UK hot on its heels, demonstrating significant global interest.

### Interdisciplinary Collaboration: Where Minds Meet

The research isn’t happening in silos—it's a communal effort spanning various academic fields like artificial intelligence (AI), human-computer interaction, and even social sciences. This cross-disciplinary collaboration shed light on understanding trust factors and designing more reliable and effective CAs.

## Dissecting the Data: What’s the Picture Over Time?

From the early 2010s to today, interest in CAs has rapidly ballooned, leading to a peak in 2023 where the number of studies compared to previous years doubled. Exciting, isn't it? Interestingly, it appears the ChatGPT release spurred an increased research emphasis on trust elements, pushing it to the top of academic agendas.

### The Rise of ChatGPT 

ChatGPT has been the center of research buzz, largely because it represents a new high-water mark in architectural sophistication in AI dialogue systems—and it’s free for individual users. Such accessibility likely contributes to its research popularity, drawing attention both as a study subject and a research tool.

### Top Journals and Influential Papers

The analysis identifies influential journals and articles contributing significantly to the field. For instance, the Journal of Human-Computer Studies boasts numerous high-impact papers with articles dissecting user experience and trust dynamics. Meanwhile, studies on consumer trust in voice assistants—like Amazon’s Alexa—have attracted noteworthy academic attention.

## Practical Implications: Why Should You Care?

Understanding trust in CAs has practical applications across various sectors:

* **Business**: CAs are increasingly used in customer service to handle inquiries and complaints harmoniously.
* **Healthcare**: Chatbots can provide preliminary health assessments, assisting healthcare professionals.
* **Education**: Virtual assistants are streamlining educational experiences, offering student support.

The ability to integrate AI in everyday technologies could revolutionize our interactions, making things smarter, faster, and more personal. But the success of these integrations hinges on the trust factor. Would you be comfortable taking medical advice from a CA that you doubted? Probably not.

I wanted to share the story of how I started learning programming and grew from knowing nothing to landing a web development internship. I hope it motivates anyone out there who feels like it's too late to start or that they're too far behind.  
  
I'm a 22-year-old student currently in my 5th semester of a 4-year IT program at TU. Ever since I was a kid, I've been fascinated by technology, and I always knew I wanted to study IT and computer science. Watching ""Day in the Life of a Software Engineer"" videos on YouTube back in 8th and 9th grade inspired me to dream of becoming a software engineer and studying at IIT in India. But, like many dreams, it didn’t go as planned—I didn’t focus much, and I ended up pursuing a management background during my +2 years.  
  
Despite having HTML, CSS, and C programming in my +2 curriculum, I didn't learn much during that time. I was part of the COVID batch, so passing felt more like a stroke of luck. When I entered college, I still knew next to nothing about programming.  
  
**First Year:**

In the first semester of college, we were taught C programming. Honestly, I hated it. Printing stars, recursion, factorials—it all felt like a foreign language to me. I barely understood what was going on and failed my preboard exams. But during my board preparation, I forced myself to study C programming in-depth. Understanding concepts like recursion, pointers, and loops gave me a small confidence boost, and I ended up doing well in my exams.  
  
**Second and Third Semester:**  
  
In the second semester, we learned Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Java, and by the third semester, we were diving into Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This was when programming started to click for me. I enjoyed learning how stacks are used in calculations and how to build a simple calculator from scratch. But even with this newfound interest, I still hadn't built any real-world projects and didn’t know much about software development.  
  
**Mid-Third Semester:**  
  
Around this time, I learned that one of my classmates had secured a software engineering internship at a reputable Nepali company. I was intrigued and started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I wasn’t consistent. I managed to build a simple calculator and a landing page, but it wasn't enough. When I found out that the company was offering a traineeship with a deadline in three days, I rushed to create three websites: a Spotify clone, a language translator using an API, and a simple landing page. Despite the effort, I didn't get the internship.  
  
**Fourth Semester:**  
  
The beginning of my fourth semester was a reality check. I discovered LinkedIn and realized just how much more I needed to do to compete with others. I started learning React.js and applied for a frontend internship, but my interview didn't go well—I couldn't even swap variables using JavaScript! Looking back at the code I wrote for that interview task makes me laugh now.  
  
**End of Fourth Semester to Fifth Semester:**  
  
By the end of the fourth semester, I had built several projects, including a restaurant website with reservation features and a to-do app. I was also rejected from 3-4 internships. That was when I decided to get serious. I started programming and working on web development for 4-8 hours a day, building more projects, and eventually completed two fellowship programs. Now, at the end of my fifth semester, I’ve secured an internship at a well-reputed IT firm.  
  
**Reflection:**  
  
Until my second semester, I thought college academics were enough to land a software development job, but I got a reality check after joining LinkedIn and seeing what others my age were doing. I realized that practical skills, combined with a strong foundation in IT and CS, are what truly matter. I wasted a lot of time in my first year just going through the motions, but after getting rejected from internships, I learned my worth and started focusing on building real-world projects.  
  
In my fourth semester, I learned full-stack MERN development and built an e-commerce site along with other projects. One of the projects I did from scratch was for a fellowship program, and it turned out well. I just want to say that if you focus for just six months, you can significantly improve. I've made mistakes and wasted time, but I've also grown, and I’m excited about what’s ahead.  
  
  
**Securing an Internship Beyond Web Development :**  
By the end of my 5th semester, I managed to secure an internship—not directly in web development, but in a different tech domain that combines web development with other skills. For privacy reasons, I won't go into specifics about the domain, but I can say that my experience in web development and the projects I built during two different fellowship programs played a significant role in landing this opportunity.  
  
Throughout my journey, I’ve battled with laziness, daydreaming, and procrastination. However, the last six months of consistent effort, where I dedicated 3-8 hours daily to learning and coding, made a big difference. In the final three months, I pushed myself even harder, working more regularly and consistently. This experience taught me that it’s never too late to start, and I hope this part of my journey motivates those who are in the early stages of college or think they can't do programming.  
  
There’s more to my story and what truly motivated me, but I’ll save that for another post. For now, I just wanted to share how consistent effort, even after a slow start, can lead to significant progress.  
  
  
Thank you for reading this post! I’ll share more about what motivated me to improve in another post. If you enjoyed this story, please upvote—it would mean a lot to me. 😊  
  
TL;DR : I started college with zero programming knowledge, struggled through my early semesters, but eventually found my passion for web development. After dedicating 3-8 hours daily for six months, I built solid projects, completed two fellowships, and secured an internship in a tech domain that combines web development with other skills. My journey shows that it’s never too late to start and improve.

1f93p99,1,2024-09-04,Rampant cheating at my school,u/CakeDeer6,school,https://www.reddit.com/r/school/comments/1f93p99/rampant_cheating_at_my_school/,"In the past year or two, competition for valedictorian has gotten crazy (classes of \~500) especially in the junior class. As a senior, I have no stake in the game, but it really sucks to see all the cheating having an impact my friends, who are competing for class rank, and the fact that the school is doing nothing about it. Our school has strict policies on cheating with well outlined punishments and required reporting, but these guidelines just aren't upheld very well.

First off, everyone knows someone who's cheated on a test. Teachers will catch these cheaters and hold them accountable within the class, often failing them on the test, etc. However, these students at the top are smart enough that failing a test doesn't usually end up changing their grade, so there really isn't much punishment for them.  Even though the teachers are required to report all ""academic dishonesty"" they rarely end up doing so because they just don't care enough, or feel that they can teach the student a lesson on their own. The issue, though, is that these kids end up doing this in all of their classes, and none of their teachers are communicating with one another, leading to rampant cheating with no consequences. 

On top of that, AI usage has been through the roof, not just with low performing students, but with top students as well. These kids are signing up for tons of dual enrollment credits, more than any normal person would have the time of day to take, and instead of learning anything from their classes, they just ChatGPT everything, dual enrollment, AP, you name it. A number of students have been caught using AI, just like at any school, I'm sure, but nothing gets reported, and everything gets swept under the rug. It pisses me off; none of the ""top students"" really even deserve to be at the top, they just game the system harder than anyone else. 

Those aren't the worst offenders though. One junior in particular was the reason for me making this post. He's had his fair share of AI usage and test cheating, but what sets him apart are the events of this last week. He was caught sending fake transcripts from summer programs and dual enrollment colleges to the high school in order to boost his GPA. The credits were completely fake and he never took at least 5 courses that he said he did. By the way, these courses remained on his OFFICIAL HIGH SCHOOL TRANSCRIPT for over a month, and he only outed himself when other people started reporting him. 

This isn't the end of his story though. The school launched an ""official investigation"" in which they pulled up 100s of pages of documents, finding clear evidence of him falsifying a number of courses. However, instead of punishing him heavily (our school's policy should call for him to be expelled), they gave him a measly two day out-of-school suspension. To make matters worse, they've said that when he goes to apply for colleges, they won't report any of his past incidents to the colleges he applies to. This kid got off virtually scot free for something that easily could've turned into expulsion and potentially felony charges (falsifying official records). Right now, he is in the race for valedictorian, and he will likely end up getting it, because he's paying extra money out of pocket to take extra dual enrollment courses beyond what the school is willing to cover. 

All in all, I'm really frustrated with this kid because he's a bully, manipulator, and sexually harasses people, but I'm more fed up with my school system than anything. They've proven time and time again that they don't care about preparing their students for the future; all they care about are their stats, and they're willing to let anything go on right under their noses so long as it makes them look good to the state.

I've [21M]  been on and off programming a lot for about 5 years and i feel like I'm still a complete beginner. I recently transferred to a UC for computer engineering and i'm excited to start classes soon but at the same time I already feel like I don't belong here. I see students from the uni on LinkedIn who are barely 2nd year students winning multiple hackathons and already have internships at nasa, while I'm here struggling to solve easiest level Codewars problems in C. I recently found out who my roommates will be for the next year, looked them up on linkedin, and I feel so envious of their achievements and resumes. It's that time of year to start appying for internships but I have nothing on my resume that's really putting me out there as a good candidate nor am I even slightly prepared for an interview. Academically im a B-A student who did some leadership at a student org, but here at UC thats the norm. I'm not really special.

 I honestly don't even know if computer engineering is what I want to do but I cant change my major so im stuck here. Tbh I thought it would be interesting but its so boring because it feels un innovative and outdated. I recently picked up Godot and its so much more fun than trying to do Bare-Metal C embedded programming but since im going for a Computer Engineering related job I feel like it's just another time wasting hobby. I don't really know how to have fun or stay motivated to code embedded stuff since I don't feel productive learning to blink an LED using raw c. I do arduino projects but honestly can't make anything without 10 tutorials and chatgpt.

 and I know it's my fault. I half assed my classes in CC and I wasted so much time on video games and hopping from hobby to hobby (literally picked up fishing beginning of summer) and I feel like I should've dedicated that time to grinding leetcode or something. All my friends are addicted to gaming but I completely stopped gaming because im so scared to fail in life. My parents are expecting a lot from me and they said they would help get through college. I feel tremendous guilt and anxiety because my projected tuition cost would be about 110k once I finish college since we get no financial aid. I read somewhere that if you were to die your student debt would be forgiven so ive had thoughts of just kms if im not able to secure a job to repay everything. S* has been on my mind for a long time because I feel stupid and untalented compared to others and besides that I'm also extremely insecure about myself and my body. I refuse to do therapy because it's just more expenses on top of my tuition.

I just need some guidance. I have no one to talk to. I don't know what to do to pick myself back up. I love engineering and robotics and I really want to be good at programming. What are some things I can do to stay motivated? How do I stop feeling so envious towards other students? Do I really just need to keep doing trivial C projects til I get good?

If your are new to the field I would really recommend taking your time and not being fooled or discouraged by the posts that say “PASSED N+ with 2 wks of studying”. At the end of the day it’s about being able to retain the information so when u do get that first gig u have an idea what is going on. 

For studying this was my timeline.

First 2 weeks I just watched Dion’s videos. Couple videos each day but making sure to pay attention when watching the videos. I was not taking notes during this time. Pure watching the videos at work or in my bed lol.After watching Dion’s video I felt overwhelmed as it seemed that there was so much information to learn. I feel like Dion covers more than the exam objectives. 

3-4 week I moved on to Professor Messer’s videos. While watching these videos I actually took notes. I wouggld go over the notes everyday in the morning after waking up as I feel that was the best time my brain would perform at the highest possible level.

5th week: I spent using the sybex test bank of over 1500 questions. I would to 300 questions everyday and use ChatGPT for whatever questions I was getting wrong. 

6th week:  exam week I did Dion’s practice exams. First test I got 78. Seconds I got a 92. Third test I got 73. I didn’t attempt the 4th one. 2 days before my exam I stopped studying.

Exam day: I give the test at a test centre in Toronto. My experience giving the test at the centre was really bad because of the other students giving the test. One person had an open book test and for the 90 min I was in there all I heard was papers flapping. 

Exam test: I had 70 mcs and 4 pbqs. The 70 mcs I flew through I was very confident. The 4 pbqs OG MY GOODNESS!!! I’m not even gonna lie I didn’t know how to do any of the 4 properly I just guessed everything and submitted. Passed with a 726. 

My experience: I feel like a month and half is very doable for N+ if your are willing to put 3-4 hours a day not including weekend. Also PBQs I wish I had more practice for those otherwise my score would have been much better. ",active,58,neutral,0

* Some are embracing AI in the classroom, using it to teach students while revealing its limitations.
* Others are prioritizing deep code comprehension, requiring students to explain their code during submissions.
* Interestingly, some even encourage ChatGPT for grasping concepts, but ban the direct generation of assignment code.

It's worth noting that many instructors are still in the process of adapting to this new reality.

during g10 kasi, my dad convinced me na mag accountancy. naging interested naman ako so tinuloy ko, now i'm a graduating abm student. ang issue, these past few months, set na ako na ayoko mag accountancy. i realized na hindi ko kakayaning yun ang magiging life ko for xx years of my life. i know na i would be unhappy doon. my top 1 pick naman ngayon is multimedia arts. i want to be a graphic designer or have a position somewhere in advertising/marketing. my second choice naman is either IT or CS to be a web developer or ui designer.

both choices ko, MMA and IT/CS, ayaw ng dad ko dahil mawawala rin daw yan eventually after a few years because of AI. ang point ko naman, although yes nag-eevolve na ang AI, i don't think kakayanin nitong mareplace fully ang industry ng advertising and programming. i just think na it will serve as a tool sa mga tao rito. also, he says that the IT/CS industry is oversaturated at mahihirapan akong makahanap ng trabaho dun (i can't argue with that kasi i know it's true). for accountancy naman, gusto niya to because hindi siya makukuha ng AI dahil ""utak ang ginagamit dito."" totoo naman pero designing and programming din naman ah? also, it's not fully unreplacable by AI. ang experience ko during our FABM subject, may times na hindi ko talaga maintindihan yung gagawin if magbbase lang sa module so i turn to chatgpt para i-explain niya sakin or even help me sa pag-identify what goes into what account (dyan talaga ako nahihirapan 🥲)

back to me, if itutuloy ko ang accountancy, siguro naman i can learn to love it. pero if hindi talaga ako masaya dito, then what choice do i have diba? in this economy, only a few people have the privilege to do what they actually want while still making enough money to support their needs. on the other hand, if i do choose to go with my dream course, i'd feel really selfish. especially since mahirap nga makahanap ng trabaho dito, dagdag pa yung mababang pay (unless you try freelancing which i plan to do). syempre i want to make enough money to support myself while also helping my parents since tumatanda na rin sila.


okay, andami ko nang nasabi so i'll move on na sa actual questions ko

1. should i continue in convincing my dad na what i want is worth it or should i just go with accountancy?
2. do you think i would survive in BSA if ever i do continue with it?
3. your thoughts on his statements about AI replacing these jobs
4. thoughts on the salary differences and job demand ng accountancy, advertising/marketing, and webdev

Among the potent AI tools reshaping how we approach art, design, and content creation, OpenAI's ChatGPT stands out as particularly influential.

ChatGPT has opened up avenues for artists, designers, and content creators to explore their crafts in ways that were previously unimaginable. By providing a platform for idea generation, language processing, and even code assistance, this AI revolutionizes creative workflows, allowing for unprecedented levels of innovation.

Imagine a writer facing the daunting task of producing fresh content regularly. ChatGPT can assist in overcoming writer's block, generating story outlines, or offering a myriad of ideas to spark inspiration. For designers, AI's ability to understand and replicate creative patterns means it can contribute to brainstorming sessions or even take on mundane tasks, freeing up human creatives to focus on the bigger picture.

In art, AI-generated images might once have been a novelty, but now, tools associated with ChatGPT can collaborate with artists to generate complex compositions, explore new styles, or reinterpret existing works, broadening our understanding and appreciation of aesthetic possibilities.

Furthermore, ChatGPT's implications for education in the creative arts are immense. Students can engage with the AI to learn about historical art styles, writing techniques, or design principles, and even receive instant, personalized feedback on their work.

Yet, this intertwining of AI and creativity isn't without controversy. Concerns range from the originality of AI-assisted work to the ethical implications of using AI to create. The discussion on whether AI can truly be 'creative' or if it's merely replicating human patterns based on vast data inputs continues to stir debate.

As ChatGPT and similar technologies continue to evolve, one thing is clear: the creative world must adapt to this new reality. Whether viewed as an assistant, a tool, or a disruptive force, ChatGPT is undoubtedly transforming the landscape of arts, design, and content creation. Let's discuss how it impacts our perception of creativity and where this technological partnership might lead us in the future.",active,1,positive,0

As the title states, I know I’m needing to do wayyyyy more than I currently am but can’t find something to stick. I was taking lessons with a tutor for a few months but took a break to see if I truly do want to continue/whether I’d pick up good habits of self study. Long story short I didn’t but still want to learn. I’m someone who wants to be at least mildly good at something right away which is a huge set back in my motivation. I’ve not ‘studied’ in years and use to be a great student in college but that feels long gone now. 

I am fully aware duolingo is not a learning resource, shouldn’t be the sole form on study anyways, but it’s the one thing that has stuck. I’ve tried other apps but nothing else really keeps up for more than a few days. 

I’ve tried watching/listening to 10-20 minutes of French a day, stuck for like two weeks then fell off. Tried writing using daily prompts from ChatGPT and having it correct errors, didn’t stick. I’m starting up my tutor classes again tomorrow and heavily nervous about the regression I’ve likely made. 

Websites I’ve found that I really like and when motivation kicks in on that random Sunday evening I go to these: lingolia, lawlessfrench and languages online.

But the platform I work on is simply an internal tool meant to increase the productivity of employees. I feel like at the end of the day, it’s just a nice add on and I’m not really making much of a difference. And also I never got to know anything about the business since I wasn’t working on anything to enhance the business process.

I’m going to go for masters soon and I need some help in figuring out what to do. Sometimes I really wish I did my degree in some other field like the sciences or finance so that learning computer science would have helped me APPLY it to those fields. Because now it feels like I need to have an understanding of the problems in different domains to use computer science to solve them. I’m not inclined to doing a phD since it requires way too much time and effort (atleast in the US). I’ve seen a lot of specialised degrees like cognitive science, data science for health etc. How are the career prospects for such degrees?

The conversation about who benefits the most from this technology is a complex one, as each industry finds its unique way to leverage the capabilities of these AI systems.

In the technology and customer service sectors, ChatGPT's ability to quickly generate code snippets, troubleshoot issues, or handle customer inquiries through chatbots can lead to a significant uptick in handling queries and solving problems. This means potentially higher satisfaction rates and fewer resources spent on repetitive tasks.

In the field of education, both educators and students may find ChatGPT useful for explanations, generating study materials, and even providing personalized tutoring, making the education process more efficient. Meanwhile, content creators can utilize these models for brainstorming and drafting, allowing for more creativity and reduced time on ideation.

Legal and healthcare sectors may also reap benefits—lawyers can quickly draft and review documents or find relevant precedents, and healthcare professionals can access medical literature or draft informational content with ease. This use of AI can translate into more time spent with clients or patients, and less on administrative work.

Yet, it's essential to acknowledge the concerns surrounding job displacement and the skill gap that might widen as AI becomes more prevalent. How are industries ensuring that their workforces are upskilled to utilize these advanced tools? What measures are companies taking to integrate ChatGPT in a way that supports rather than replaces human workers?

I lacked in math, but I made up for it ten fold with english, reading and history, as those concepts instantaneously clicked for me. As such, I took AP courses related to my strengths, and flew through them with ease.

Because of this, though, I didn’t develop any real study skills. Standard math was always a photo math or chatgpt input away from a good grade, so I never really felt the need to apply myself.

Now, in my freshman year of college, I’ve hit a major bump. Chemistry is ROUGH. I’m taking a biology class, and the first few chapters are going over simple biochemistry. While abstract definitions and applications to the real world make total sense to me, doing the actual equations and models of different chemicals feels like I’m learning a new language, and my grades are already reflecting that.

My goal is to go to medical school and become a Radiologist, and I understand a HUGE chunk of premed courses are all about studying for things that don’t make any initial sense.

Does anybody have any good tips for developing a good study habit/routine? I’ve been taking notes, but I feel like i’m more just jotting down what my professor says like a transcript writer than actually highlighting the things I should stress the importance of. Everything else regarding studying is a shot in the dark with me, so any advice will be very appreciated. ",active,1,positive,0

With the mass problem of “teacher burnout” I do think this could be such a help to reduce teacher workload when it comes to developing lesson plans etc. Of course we still need to engage in preparing materials etc but I think it’s really good for coming up with those initial ideas in the first place or helps to structure a set of lessons where you don’t have a clue where to start!

Go through your syllabus and do a point-by-point analysis of why it is C-level work at best. (5) THEN, pull out an “example” of an “A-level” paper (something you prepared beforehand.

Like any disruptive technology, ChatGPT has sparked a mix of excitement and concern. In educational contexts, ChatGPT promises individualized learning experiences, bridging the gap between students' diverse learning paces. Teachers could harness this AI to create interactive lessons or to serve as a tutoring assistant, offering students instant feedback and guidance.

However, skeptics point to the potential drawbacks. The issue of academic integrity arises when considering how easily students could use ChatGPT to complete assignments, potentially undermining learning processes. Moreover, there's the fear that standardized curricula implemented by AI might sacrifice creative and critical thinking for the sake of efficiency.

In the corporate realm, ChatGPT's impact seems overwhelmingly positive, providing employees with on-demand, personalized training opportunities without significant downtime. Corporate training modules can leverage ChatGPT to simulate real-world scenarios, equip employees with soft skills, or walk them through complex problem-solving processes.

Yet, this technological revolution begs the question: Are we ready to manage and regulate the use of such AI effectively? Will the inflection point of AI integration into learning paradigms lead to an educational renaissance or a dilution of essential human elements in teaching and learning processes?

I’m graduating next year. I’m kind of a slow learner because I don’t understand concepts straight away but when I do (usually on my own time), I am very comfortable with the concept and could explain it pretty well to someone who has no idea.

I find Cyber Security to be okay, haven’t really developed a solid opinion on it yet but I also do some programming most of my courses are either somewhat about programming or cyber security nowadays. It’s what my end goal is now. They can be fun to do as like a side hobby but i’m not extremely passionate about it.

I was considering certs for Cybersecurity, but not too sure what certs exactly. Heck I haven’t really decided what kind of Cybersecurity I wanna do, I just probably need some direction so I made this post.

I recently done an assigment. It’s basically assymetric encryption with Digital Signature. Normally you would have to do quite a bit of math to create keys and digitally sign and others would verify so it’s you that sent it, instead I created a Python program to do the math for me, I understand the mathematics behind it but I automated it and my professor was okay since he knows I understood. This I consider to be my first real problem I done on my own and solved myself using programming. 

No I didn’t use ChatGPT nor a YouTube tutorial would it be worth putting it under projects for my resume? I wouldn’t mind doing some projects as long as they’re enjoyable and somewhat accessible at my skill level, which isn’t very high. 

I also have some people I know that work in something related to tech…

From February to the end of June I took a total of 6 certifications. These are the ones I recommend completing

SAA-003: This is the best certification to start with. If you have 0 knowledge, it'll take you 2-3 months. It took me 2 weeks to study and pass. I used Neal Davis to study for this. Below is a link to his page. I bought all his courses because I plan on taking every certification he has taught. I created a free AWS account this month and ensured I knew what every service looked like.

[https://www.udemy.com/user/63f4a578-c67a-456b-916c-ddadf73e9a26/](https://www.udemy.com/user/63f4a578-c67a-456b-916c-ddadf73e9a26/)

SAP-C02: This is the next step in the Solutions Architect path. This test is hard, it took me another month of studying and I used Neal Davis's practice tests, took them over 30-40 times. He has a lot of hands-on projects, I did them all no matter the cost. 

DVA-C02: Another associate exam. Focuses on deploying, packaging, etc applications and CI/CD workflows. Not a hard test, took me around another 2 weeks to study.

Terraform Associate: Extermely easy exam. I bet an absolute beginner with 12 hours of time could pass this exam. Just do all your projects in terraform and you won't even have to study. 

This was all taken during my final semester as Computer Science major at a state school. I was only taking 2 classes so I devoted all my time to this, spent 6-7 hours studying, and the rest of my free time on projects. I had a friend give me a few ideas, had ChatGPT come up with a few, and did a few of my own. Most of them had to with creating an application from scratch, and figuring out the best ways to migrate it to the cloud. I will not be posting my projects, it'd be dead easy to identify me. Come up with your own creative projects.

Here is the link to a project I did complete in full detail: [https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1fax48r/comment/llwtnlm/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1fax48r/comment/llwtnlm/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

These certifications are sort of the bare minimum of what companies are looking for in my experience. I don't know how hard it'll be even if you complete these because I had a few more under my belt, but I'd be surprised if it was a lot tougher. 

Interviews are a whole other story. I'll give some pointers on how to apply and other tips:

1. Do not memorize. I cannot say this enough. Especially for the certifications, the associate ones can be easily done through memorization. Do yourself a favor and do not memorize, the companies require a much more thorough understanding than that. Only start applying when you know you are comfortable having a conversation about the provider you studied for. 

2. My resume was not anything fancy. Just a simple name at the top with basic information on how to contact me, my cert badges on either side, followed by my professional summary, skills, projects, experience and education. It all fit on one page and was concise. I have learned that recruiters do not give a fuck about you, half the time they cant even understand half the stuff you claim you can do. They are looking for keywords found in the job posting, put those in, make sure they see it, and you're golden. I also only showcased 2 projects I thought were relevant to their company.

3. Do not apply to remote options. I got zero callbacks from job postings offering remote work opportunities. Simply too competitive. Just filter to hybrid/onsite. 

4. Do not spam apply. It is useless, you will get shortlisted. Apply to 40-50 companies you think you genuinely have a shot at, edit your resume to fit their exact needs, and once you get the call for that first interview, start studying up on all the gaps you had to add. 

5. You can apply to ones asking for Azure or GCP certs along with AWS ones. Do not apply to postings that are specific to Azure, GCP, etc.

6. Once you do get to the technical interviews, I found that most of my interviews that went well were more like conversations. The interviewers would ask me a question and then I'd not only answer it, but relate it to a project I worked on, just tried to show them that I had the experience in the services even though it wasn't in an actual job setting. We would talk back and forth, I'd learn something from them, they'd learn something from me. To be honest, it seemed like they were under qualified to interview me, but it was fun nonetheless. 

7. I never specifically prepared for any interview. After making my whole life the cloud, I was extremely confident when talking and never felt nervous during the process. You do not need to do any leetcode, but you will need to know your shit. HCL is a language you will need to learn. 

8. If you're applying as an international student, I want to wish you a good luck. I would not go down this path at all. Every single company I applied to refused to sponsor in their job posting, so you guys are better putting your time somewhere else. Maybe if you're omega rich and have nothing to lose.

It took a lot of money, I spent easily over 5-6 grand on learning everything. There is unfortunately no shortcuts I can recommend other than the shortened certification journey above. Again, if you can't put in the time or money, I don't recommend investing in this field. Do not start this journey if you don't think you can see it through. I didn't see the light at the end of the tunnel until I got quick callbacks so it was a gamble for 6 months.

Just to end this ""college essay"" I wrote out, I used to game quite a bit, but basically went ""cold turkey"" and destroyed my social life to get to this point and I do not regret it. I'd rather be crying with a job alone than crying with my friends that I don't have one. ",active,26,positive,0

French PhD student in **Marketing Management** looking for advices here !

As AI tools like ChatGPT become increasingly accessible, it's clear we can't stop college students from using them—nor should we try to. Instead, our university has decided to lean into this technological shift by giving students access to GPT-4. 

My colleagues and I have decided to teach young students how to use GPT-4 (And other AI Tools) responsibly and ethically. Rather than restricting access, we're focusing on helping them understand its proper use, avoiding plagiarism, and developing strong prompt engineering skills.

We’ll cover:

* **Plagiarism**: How to use GPT-4 as a tool, not a shortcut. They’ll learn to credit sources and fact-check everything.
* **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting clear, specific prompts to get better results, plus tips like refining prompts for deeper insights.

Here’s where you come in: 

* What effective prompts have you used?
* Any tips I can pass on to my students?

Thanks all !

Formally named ""[OpenAI o1](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/),"" the model family will initially launch in two forms, [o1-preview](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/) and [o1-mini](https://openai.com/index/openai-o1-mini-advancing-cost-efficient-reasoning/), available today for ChatGPT Plus and certain API users.

  
OpenAI claims that o1-preview outperforms its predecessor, [GPT-4o](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/), on multiple benchmarks, including competitive programming, mathematics, and ""scientific reasoning."" However, people who have used the model say it does not yet outclass GPT-4o in every metric. Other users have [criticized](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/new-details-on-openais-strawberry-apples-siri-makeover-larry-ellison-doubles-down-on-data-centers) the delay in receiving a response from the model, owing to the multi-step processing occurring behind the scenes before answering a query.

In a rare display of public hype-busting, OpenAI product manager Joanne Jang [tweeted](https://x.com/joannejang/status/1834286774140498368), ""There's a lot of o1 hype on my feed, so I'm worried that it might be setting the wrong expectations. what o1 is: the first reasoning model that shines in really hard tasks, and it'll only get better. (I'm personally psyched about the model's potential & trajectory!) what o1 isn't (yet!): a miracle model that does everything better than previous models. you might be disappointed if this is your expectation for today's launch—but we're working to get there!""

OpenAI reports that o1-preview ranked in the 89th percentile on competitive programming questions from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/contests/). In mathematics, it scored 83 percent on a qualifying exam for the International Mathematics Olympiad, compared to GPT-4o's 13 percent. OpenAI also states, in a claim that may later be challenged as people scrutinize the benchmarks and run their own evaluations over time, o1 [performs comparably to PhD students](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/) on specific tasks in physics, chemistry, and biology.

1. Get the entire syllabus as provide it as a context
2. With each section of the syllabus, duration of study and exam marks weightage is there
3. Based on that roadmaps are created which are personalised to each user with some user inputs

To begin with, I first manually did it with ChatGPT to understand more control variables and feedback to arrive at a better prompt. It now works (most of the time).

Now, I am thinking of extending it to other curriculums (e.g. college education or backend development). So far, the results have not been great. To improve the results, should I try fine-tuning?

Kudos to the red team and all, but just because a thing can be done, doesn't mean it should be done. I feel like in the future, this is the version of ""AI"" that the general population is going to be stuck with.

As far as it being more capable (of anything beyond finding ways to stay dead-center between the safety guardrails), I'm not seeing it. I haven't tried coding, but the quality of writing fictional content is the same, the quality and content of stock/financial analysis and info is the same... 

And, speaking of fiction writing; there's no way this thing would ever even create a \*paragraph\* in the style or tone of the content I've been working on with GPT-4o. Let alone create any of the actual content/events that take place in the story. Which is fictional, not smut, not gore, not illegal, and is completely legit and acceptable in every regard.

I regularly use chatGPT and other tools to make customized grammar quizzes for my students, checking each quiz and refining them manually.

We have a pretty rare setup, students' learning is self-led so they come and go between different classrooms, asking the teachers for help. I don't have a fixed group so I can't get them all to install or register with a particular app, we don't have time and I have new people coming in and out constantly.

For this reason I need to share quizzes etc with a public link that doesn't require an account. I'd prefer to create one link to a public **folder** that I can share with students via QR code, where they can just view the files without signing in.

  
**I've tried:**

Google - no good. Account required to view the files, almost none of my teenage students in Ecuador have an account, don't have time to create one with each of them separately.

Dropbox - works OK, I can create text files and paste text from GPT, students can view all files in the folder without signing in. However text formatting in the browser is ugly as hell.

Pastebin - great formatting, fast, but too much of a pain to send links for each new document. No option to share folder with students.

Tried a few of the free online quiz makers RE Quizlet, Knowt etc - too many steps for the students to sign in, too much garbage around earning XP, popups etc... can't just copy and paste text into a blank doc.

1fgc3zc,110,2024-09-13,Passed Network+ today after studying for 12 days - My advice to those studying!,u/cashfile,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/1fgc3zc/passed_network_today_after_studying_for_12_days/,"**Warning this is going to be a looooonnnnnng post, I will provide a TLDR at the end. I'll also be breaking it into subsections to make it easier to read! If anyone actually makes it through this 5-page essay congrats lol! I spent like \~2 hr writing it hopefully it helpful to someone.**

**Overview:** In this post, I'm gonna mention how I passed the Network+ with just 12 days of studying including the resources I used, *how my initial studying plan failed*, and how I would redo it now knowing what I know as I believe I could complete it in 7 days final strategy.   The primary reason I'm writing this is to help those looking for certification as I think the common way I see mentioned through this thread is massively ineffective and something I initially fell into. Additionally, when I was 5-7 days in I really wanted to quit and just buy a new voucher for more time as I was seeing a lot of people saying it was impossible to study for in this short of a time period. But it was a post and YouTube video I found of people also completing it in a similar timeframe usually two weeks and made me think if they can do it so can I! Lastly, I’ve always wanted a super detailed write-down that included everything one did so I decided to make one. 

P.S. I don't recommend you take in 12 days, but I'll go further into recommendations section.

**Tech Background:** I am currently a graduate student in cybersecurity risk management (not a very technical degree, most GRC and policy-based), no prior direct IT (help desk, networking, sysadmin, etc) background but I previously worked as a software engineer for a year between undergrad and grad school. Additionally this past summer I worked as a cybersecurity intern, but again it was mostly policy-based creating, managing, and revising SoPs, documentation (Incident response for IT & OT, password policy, COOP, etc), running internal phishing campaigns, and creating cybersecurity training materials and internal newsletters. Lastly, I've been a security researcher at a University lab for the past 2 years working on the intersection of AI & privacy, with 3 publications thus far but there is no overlap with networking. My study is in regards to how AI can be used to enhance users' end privacy primarily in regards to photo sharing and social media. Between my undergrad in informatics (study of how people interact with computers think UX/UI, project management, etc ), work/research experience, and graduate school I primarily have a rough understanding of the OSI model (not as detailed as mentioned through the Network+), different cloud environments, and knew about 1/3rd of the information mentioned in Domain 4.0: Network Security but maybe not to exact degree/definition mentioned through the Network+. However, I don't think this played a huge role in my ability to pass it in 12 days as I studied all domains equally so even if I didn't have prior knowledge I would have covered it extensively, but it is important I mention it. Though my years of procrastinating in college have taught me how to devise a plan to learn things quickly and effectively.

**Why Network+:** The reason I decided to take Network+ is I wanted a more technical understanding of cybersecurity, as my scholarship gives me 3k a semester to spend on certificates and I want to take the OSCP I figured it best to start with a strong foundational knowledge of Networking+ before moving onto penetration testing.

**Why 12 Days\*:** I studied it in 12 days because the voucher was only to expire because I procrastinated and my professional development fund can only be used on each certificate once (i.e. no retakes).  It actually turned out to be just 10 days as I started on Monday, Sept 2nd and took the test this morning today Friday, Sept 12th. Besides not being able to study much on Friday morning due to my test center being an hour away, on Thursday, Sept 5th I had to go out of town and got back late at night and had no desire to study. Additionally, on Tuesday, the 3rd I only studied for 2 hours due to other school obligations. So in actuality, it was closer to 10 days that I studied and not 12.

**Why Days Are A Terrible Tracking Metric:** Before I go on, I want to see something that is commonly mentioned in this subreddit and that is how many 'days' a person studied. This is a terrible metric because someone who is a graduate student with a lot of free time can study 7-10 hours a day, This could be the equivalent to someone with a wife and kids studying for 3-6 weeks if they only have 2-4 hours a day to study.  Hours are a far better metric and through my 12-day journey, I put in roughly \~90 hours.

**My Initial Learning Plan:** My initial learning plan was similar to what I constantly see mentioned through this subreddit including people who failed tests more than once and that is to keep cramming the material from different sources. My initial plan was to watch the Messer videos (14hrs), and Mike Meyer video series (21 hrs), read the Network+ Review Guide (532pgs) then do the Jason Dion practice tests. For the first 3-4 days I attempted this, the review book was 532 pages so I figured if I read 80 pages a day I would be done in 6.5 days on top of that I would watch the Mike Meyer video series on 2x speed which meant that in 5 days I could complete it if I watched 2 hours day and then I could move on to the Messer video series also at 2x speed and complete it 3.5 days. I could complete both the video series & book in roughly \~ 9 days (assuming I'm reading alongside watching the video series) leaving 3 days for practice tests and reviews. This is similar to what I saw throughout the subreddit, take the material from various sources ideally a mixture of books and videos, and then take practice tests. So I set out on this path on Monday, Sept 3rd.

**How It Failed Miserably:** Firstly, I come from a research background where I have to lit reviews on dozens of papers that can oftentimes be boring but fuck me I have never read such a boring book. It has nothing to do with the author it's just that Network+ material can't be any more boring at least for me. Additionally, I underestimated how long it 'feels' to read network+ review books for \~4 hr straight every single day. Midway the through third day was \~200 into the 532-page review book, and I completed 4 of 11 hours of the Mike Meyer video series, but I still felt like I wasn't learning anything and it felt like I wasn't retaining anything. Particularly with domain 1 which to me even till the end I found the most difficult due to the sheer memorization of cables, connectors, etc. So instead of continuing another 2 hour of Mike Meyer video series, I decided to review Domain 1 by watching Messer's video on Domain 1. After 2 hour of watching I got done with Domain 1 and part of Domain 2 from the Messer video series. Still felt like I knew nothing but I remembered I had the Sybex Network+ Practice test book that came in a Network+ bundle. So I tried a handful of domain 1 questions which it included \~300, and after doing 10 questions and checking the answer I realized ... I had failed 8 out of 10 questions and I was stunned. As I had consumed material on Domain 1 via 3 different sources (1 book, 2 video series) and I still couldn't answer any of the practice questions. At this point, I went to bed discouraged and basically thought I could never adequately prepare with only 9 days remaining.  The next day I was out of town and when I got home I decided fuck it and didn’t study. The following day when I woke up (day 5, Sept 6th) and did a handful more practice questions was failing around 60-80%. This is when it clicked...

**The Clicking Moment:** I realized 3 core things - 1) Even though I had consumed the material from three different sources it wasn't sticking 2) Between the boring book and failing almost all my practice questions, my current method was unsustainable and I either needed to give up or devise a new plan 3) I was learning way more from my failure on practice question and reading the Sybex explanation that explained why the option was correct and way other 3 option were wrong than from any of direct material I was consuming.  This is when I realized my new plan!

**New & Success Strategy:** PRACTICE QUESTIONS... PRACTICE QUESTIONS... PRATICE QUESTIONS!!!! I decided to spend the majority of my remaining time (8 days) on practice questions, however, I knew I still needed some base foundational material so I went with Messer for 2 reasons. It was shortest at 14 hrs (7hrs 2x speed), and it was broken down to a domain similar to the Sybex Practice Test guide. The Sybex practice test book was the best resource throughout my entire study and I'll explain why in a section called ‘Golden Resource’. Sybex practice test book containing 1100 questions (\~300 questions for domain 1, and \~ 200 questions each for domain 2-5) I started doing roughly 100 questions a day. While continuing to watch rest Messer's video over the next 2 days. Up to this point 7 days in, Sat Sept 8th, I had only finished the domain questions for domain 3 and realized I was taking wayyy too long at this pace as answering the 100 questions took me roughly 6 hours between reading the paragraphs for each explanation as well as using mixture specialized version of ChatGPT I created (will discuss this later) to explain everything that Sybex explanation didn’t clear up as well as acronyms that were just expected to be known from A+ 1 & 2. After this point, I decided to just the odd question from domains 2-5 so roughly \~100 question from each section rather than the full 200 that way I could have Wednesday and Thursday to do practice tests. I stayed on this path studying \~6-7 hours a day by the time Wednesday morning came I had finished all five domains and was ready to move on to practice tests. Additionally, I want to note even throughout this time I wanted to give up as when I was doing practice questions even though it was better than consuming the materials, I was still failing 50-60% of questions on the first try (only went through once) and this was true through all \~700 questions I went through. However, I knew because of how I analyzed every question after I got it right or wrong if I saw the same question or a similar question again I would be able to get it right. I also really struggled with the acronyms as once I stopped reading after domain 1 & part way through domain 2 there weren’t many examples of acronyms being spelled out and you were just assumed to know. I solved this issue at the very end mentioned in my ‘Final Stretch’ section.  

**Final Stretch:** For my practice tests, I started with tests by ‘TotalSem’ never heard of them before and didn’t see in mentioned in this subreddit when I was looking for materials, but came across it on Linked Learning when navigating to Mike Meyers' course. They have 4 timed practice tests with 90 questions each (no PBQs). Figured the more pratice tests the merrier and I didn’t want to jump straight onto Jason Dion tests without. I will post my practice test scores for all practice tests I took in a section titled ‘Practice Test Scores’. Honestly, not the biggest fan of these tests due to the wording, I found the wording to be most confusing out of Sybex & Jason Dion, but overall worth doing if you have LinkedIn Learning but probably not worth subscribing for. I completed all four of these 90-minute tests on Wednesday and went over correct and incorrect answers in detail, additionally, I then did 1 of 6 Jason Dion tests. (I used Udemy 7-day free trial for Jason Dion's test, there should also be a LinkedIn Learning free trial for those who don’t already have it.). On Thursday day before the exam, I completed five Jason Dion practice tests and reviewed all the answers. On Friday morning, I watched 14-series playlists called ‘CompTIA Network+ 008 PBQs’ on Youtube by JustCallMeRed, which goes over 14 PBQs from the Comptia official CertMaster platform, this is extremely helpful. I watched all 14 videos at 2x speed and took roughly an hour this along with practice questions and knowing how to apply the knowledge is most likely all needed for the PBQs. Finally, I drove an hour, arrived 30 minutes early, and spent 15 minutes reviewing ports, RAID levels, as well as a few 802.11 standards, things I personally had trouble remembering will differ for each person. 

**Exam & Passing Score:** I passed the score with a 765 out of 900. Not terrible for \~9 days of studying, just glad for it to be over. I received 70 questions, four of which were PBQs. One note about the PBQs, I almost failed due to PBQs. I finished all 66 multi-choice questions with \~ 50 remaining. Finished two of my PBQs in roughly 20 minutes than remaining two of my PBQs were terminal based. I couldn’t get any command to run and had 30 minutes left to complete both of them. I spent 15 minutes figuring out how to do terminal base question, as none of the typical commands that came to my head and were mentioned such netstat, ip, hostname, etc weren't working. At one point I literally, almost gave up and just submitted the test and wanted to cry… But I kept trying with 15 minute left and no progress on the 2 PBQs, I used the help command. This displayed a list of commands I could actually use. If you get terminal PBQ use the fucking help command. It is a lifesaver. After that with \~15 minutes remaining, I was able to complete one of the two PBQs and do partial work on my second PBQ. This was most likely the difference between passing and failing. Due to this hiccup, I didn’t have any time to review my question even though I flew through the first 66 questions. | Exam Passing Proof: [Image Link](https://imgur.com/a/KDKj8YC)

**Acronyms & Ports:** On Wednesday I realized I was still lacking in regards to acronyms, and decided to download an Anki (SRS Flashcard) deck that contained all requirement acronyms listed Exam objectives \~200, I actually only ended up completing about 100 as I did first 100 on Wednesday night and didn’t have time to finish the remainder before Friday’s exam but it was helpful and I would recommend. Additionally, I downloaded a deck containing all the required port numbers twice, containing both Port -> Protocol Name Format as well as Protocol name -> Port format. I did this deck on Wednesday night, Thursday night, and Friday morning. Memorizing both acronyms and ports are life savers I would recommend this to anyone as really helps you narrow down potential answers, even if you don’t know what a word actually means such  CWDM, Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing is, if the question mentions wavelength it could help narrow down the answers or if mentions DNS you can image that CWDM probably wouldn’t be an answer. This narrowing down the potential answers can definitely be the difference between passing and failing. 

**Note Taking:** I didn’t take notes, but I did buy Messer Notes, and only used them a handful of times as quick reference material including to review while sitting in the car outside the testing center. Not needed at all, but helpful if you have the extra $30 lying around. Besides that, I don’t think taking note of video series is a valuable use of your time. You are far better off cramming more practice questions. 

**Subnetting:** 1) First fuckkkkk Classless subnetting, I hate it and it memorizing it feels like when a math teacher tell you won’t always have a calculator with you. For the exam you only need to know /25 - 31. Don’t even bother Messer 7 second subnetting diagram it wayy to complicated just use the one below it was the minimal amount of information but it all you will need for Jason Dion practice exams as well as actual exam. The Sybex question do ask question that go outside of /25 - 31. This table is super easier to memorize and takes 15 seconds to write down. The only thing you have to do in your head is calculate the associated network ID. For example (taken from Jason Dion) - What is the network ID associated with the host located at 192.168.0.123/29? For this look at /29 in the table, you will see 8 hosts. Out of possible answers: 1) 192.168.0.120 2) 192.168.0.112 3) 192.168.0.96 4) 192.168.0.64. The only possible answer is 1) because .120 that is less than 123 and within 8 host range. Additionally, a Network Address will always end with an even number (ex - .120) with the only exception being ‘.0’, while a broadcast address will always end with an odd number (ex. 255) this rule holds true for /25-/31 unsure if that is the case outside of those parameters . 

|Notation|Networks|Hosts|Available|Mask|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|/25|2|128|126|.128|
|/26|4|64|62|.192|
|/27|8|32|30|.224|
|/28|16|16|14|.240|
|/29|32|8|6|.248|
|/30|64|4|2|.252|
|/31|128|2|\*|.254|

**Golden Resource:** I'm going to shill here for a moment but out of all resources for practice questions which I will cover later, the Sybex Practice Test book or ideally online version (makes it faster to review explanations and grade answers by putting a copy on each monitor rather than flipping through the back of the book), had by far the best explanation! Better than Jason Dion, better than TotalSems practice tests (on LinkedIn learning), better than Compass Exam. It provides a detailed explanation of why you got something right and why the other answers are wrong. While most other resources focus on why the correct answer was correct, this resource also explain why the other is incorrect. For each question \~1100 (\~300 questions for domain 1, and \~ 200 questions each for domain 2-5) as well as additionally 180 question in the form of 2 practice test, it provide a paragraph explanation. By reading through these explanation even if you got the answer right you are essentially reading 1200 paragraphs, but it doesn't feel as boring as Network+ review guide and it show it in actual applicable circumstances. It is ironically the best Network+ textbook without being a textbook.  Additionally, the questions are broken into domains but questions are then ordered by subdomain as well so as you progress through the 300 questions for domain 1 you will notice the first \~50-60 are all domain 1.1 then the next 50-60 questions are domain 1.2, etc. It does go far more in-depth than you will need for Network+ such as subnetting questions you wouldn't be asked but having that extra solid foundation doesn’t hurt.  Lastly, don’t feel bad if you are doing poorly I was getting roughly 50-60% of the questions wrong through all \~700 questions I completed, however, I learned from every mistake. 

**Custom ChatGPT:** To answer most of my questions I created a custom ChatGPT using the legacy GPT 4 model, the only one that allows you actually create a custom model and upload PDFs and save it. I took a purchased copy of the PDF of 532 Network+ Sybex Review Guide, split five domains into their own chapter, and uploaded all five PDFs into the GPT’s knowledge base. I then used it to ask questions, I found this preferable to the newer 4o or 4mini model as well as Google. When using default ChatGPT or Google sometimes I would get an answer that didn’t align with the Network+ way of things. Lastly, by using this custom model, I could actually ask it what page it got it the information from and if I needed more information I could go directly to that section in the PDF itself and continue reading up on it. Note: To be careful in general with AI tools in the \~100-125 questions I asked it did get \~2-4 questions wrong.

* Sybex Practice Test \~1100 questions + additional 180 questions from 2 practice exams

   * Port Deck \~ 50 cards (\~25 x 2) - Taken from Network+ Exam Objectives
      * Completed Deck in both formats (i.e. port on front and protocol on front). 

**How I Would Do It Over:** First cramming it in 12 days is dumb, but regardless day limit if I only had 70-90 hours to study, I would watch Professor Messer's video series in 2x, complete all \~1100 questions in Sybex practice book and additional 180 questions from two practice exams included, complete all 4 TotalSems practices test, and all 6 Jason Dion test. I would also complete either Anki deck or flash cards containing all required acronyms and another deck for required ports. Additionally, I would watch the 14-video series on PBQs on the day or a day or two prior to taking the exam. Lastly, make a note of anything you have terrible memorizing to review day of the exam ideally less than 1-2 hrs of material. For it was RAID levels, Severity levels, 802.11, and various fiber optics connectors.  This could be done in a week if you have 10 hours a day to spend for 7 days in a row, or could be done over 1-2 months. Regardless of the person, I truly don’t think going past 3 months is helpful as you will start to forget stuff. We’ve known since 1968 from psychologist [Dr. Welford's study titled ‘Fundamentals of Skills’](https://gwern.net/doc/psychology/1968-welford-fundamentalsofskill.pdf) that learning acquisition starts to diminish after studying the same topic for more than 3 hours in a row. This was also confirmed multiple times in more modern studies with some suggesting in less time on a single topic.  The longer after you will start to see diminishing returns. I would recommend around \~3 hours a day for a period of 25-30 days which would be 80-90 hours. 

**What's Next For Me:** After completing the Network+, I want to move onto penetration testing. I've bought vouchers for eJPT & eCPT. I will complete both of those before the end of this year and then move onto the OSCP by the end of this year. During this time I will also probably some time to study for Security+ between now and the end of the year. But I will never cram in this short of a time frame again because it was wayy to stressful and between studying for Network+, graduate school, and my research I was getting \~4-5 hours of sleep a night for two weeks straight.

**Final Note:** If you actually read all of this you are a MAD MAN, and you really should do something more useful with your time. Regardless, hopefully, this helped someone by either setting them on the right path or inspires that they don’t need to give up if their voucher is about to expire. You can do this people! 

**TLDR:** Don’t constantly use multiple video courses, and a book to learn the material. Pick one thing, such as Professor Messer's Video series, then focus on practice questions, practice questions, practice questions!! I recommend Sybex Practice Tests as it has \~1100 questions split between 5 domains plus in additional 180 questions from 2 practice exams included. Additionally do as many practice tests as you can, ideally including Jason Dion 6 practice exams. Your main form of learning should be through the practice exams and practice questions and learning why you failed or got a question correct. Even if you got a question correct take a moment to understand why it is correct and why the other options wouldn’t work. Ideally spend \~3 hours a day for maximal acquisition before diminishing returns, over the course of 30 days (\~90 hrs). This is enough time to complete all the information mentioned in the “How I Would Do It Over” section and be extremely comfortable on the exam for the vast majority of people.",active,134,positive,0
1fh3yln,1,2024-09-15,"If you allow the use of generative AI, be honest, would you mark a student down for using it?",u/number93bus,AskProfessors,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProfessors/comments/1fh3yln/if_you_allow_the_use_of_generative_ai_be_honest/,"I'm noticing more and more of my courses are allowing the use of gen-AI, there's usually something along the line of ""you are allowed to use generative AI as long as you cite it and acknowledge how you've used it"". I feel like given that a lot of students are going to use it anyway, this is a good way to provide some sort of accountability.

My university provides ways to use it as a tool and how to reference its use; the following is taken directly from my uni website:

>Where you have used generative AI to assist you with your assignment, you usually should acknowledge this. An acknowledgement might look something like this:

>*""Whilst the writing is my own and I take responsibility for all errors, ChatGPT was used to create the initial section structure for this essay.""*

>In other cases it may be more appropriate to acknowledge your use of generative AI tools in a way more akin to a “methods” section of a research paper:

>*""Initial text provided using ChatGPT. (2023, February 14). Prompt: “What procedures should be taken to avoid the mis-use of generative A.I. in education”.*   
Or ""*First draft of introduction generated by Microsoft Word Editor Summary tool. (2023, February 14).""*

Up until now, I've written all of my assignments myself (Scout's honour!), and I've recently been learning how to use AI for things like what's stated above, like structuring paragraphs, organising my research notes, or putting (my own) ideas into a prompt to help me draft and then editing or rewriting it so its the way I want to say it. For me, it's almost akin to having a conversation with someone about what I'm writing, I used to do that with my ex-roommate and just talking about what I'm working on would help me know and formulate what I was really trying to say or explain in the report.

Sorry, I'm getting a bit off topic. My question really, is if a student did use AI, in a way that was allowed by the university, and you saw an acknowledgement of this while you were reading their work - would you mark them differently than another student who didn't use AI?",User_deleted,1,neutral,0
1fh7vvl,1,2024-09-15,I applied to 80 jobs in Germany and got 4 of them - here is how I did it being a non-German speaker,u/Dependent_Rule7083,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1fh7vvl/i_applied_to_80_jobs_in_germany_and_got_4_of_them/,"**About Me:**

So, I moved to Germany in 2021, to pursue a Master's in Artificial Intelligence at a public university. Before that, I had 4 years of experience as a software engineer in India, and I **didn't speak German**. Yep, you read that right.

Fast forward to 2024. I was doing my thesis, about to submit it, and started my full-time job hunt in January. Now, I did have a student job as a Data Scientist, but it was time to dive into the bigger pool and try not to drown. My goal? Apply to 10 serious jobs a day, plus 5 quick ""Easy Apply"" ones for good measure. **And yes, I customised my cover letter and resume every time. No other way, Sorry.**

I used a little ChatGPT hack for this. I'd input the company details, the job description, and my resume into ChatGPT (the free version, by the way), and it would generate a fresh resume and cover letter for each application. Each one took 25-40 minutes, so 10 apps a day? That’s like 6-7 hours. But I kept pushing.

Now, here’s where it gets interesting. After just 9-10 days and about 50 applications, I started getting calls. In 2 weeks, I had 18-20 interviews lined up—sometimes 3 in a day. Couldn’t finish all the home tasks, though, because I also had a final semester exam, which I couldn't miss and had to pass with a good grade.

Eventually, after two months of interviews, home projects, and culture fit rounds, I ended up with 4 job offers. I accepted a Data Scientist II position. 🎉

**Now, here are some takeaways for all my fellow immigrant students trying to break into the German job market:**

1. **YOU CAN DO IT.** Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise just because you do not speak German. If you meet the technical requirements and if you can perform well in the interviews, you **CAN 100% GET THE JOB.**
2. **TAILOR YOUR RESUME FOR EACH JOB:** Germany doesn’t do the “one size fits all” thing. For every job, you need to create a customised resume and cover letter. Sorry, but being lazy won’t work here. 🤷‍♂️
3. **Use ChatGPT for Cover Letters.** Seriously. Create a template for the prompt. Add the company details, your resume, a few keywords from the job description, and let ChatGPT work its magic.
4. **Think Like a Recruiter.** Pick the top 5 skills from the job description and make sure your resume highlights them in the first 2-3 seconds of scanning. I created a 4-line summary that I tweaked for each application. It worked like a charm.
5. **GitHub, GitHub, GitHub.** If you're in tech, upload your projects and put that GitHub link **at the top** of your resume. Optional, but highly recommended.
6. **Learn German (Optional).** It helps, but not speaking it won’t stop you from getting a job. Just don’t give up on the language entirely. It certainly will help, once you are in the job market.
7. **Don’t Ask for Crazy Salaries (Yet).** Get your foot in the door first. Once you're in, **then** you can negotiate raises, or switch for better pay.

During our time together as a group there were only three out of the ten of us working but I noticed that the two other students were using chatgpt or other ai to write their parts of the essay and just making the others edit and proofread it (the others didn't do it, I did), and a few of the other members said that they were working on projects for other classes at the time and would just make their part during the weekend. Before it was announced as a group project, I had already written an essay of my own and had planned to enter under my name rather than to represent my class.

That weekend I was constantly asking them for update and no-one answered, an hour before the deadline I checked on our progress and say that only 2/3 of the essay was done and most of it was made using AI or not connected to the theme. At the last minute I asked them if they wanted to pass what we had, and no one saw my message; so instead I sent mine in under the name of our class. 

2 days later, they finished the essay. The deadline was over, they still sent it in, the judging is a day away and we didn't place, but they saw that it was ny essay on display and not theirs. They still got credit for it because it's not explicitly under my name but they're still mad that I sent in mine and not theirs.

# Does SurferSEO's Free AI Detector Work?

Everyone wants access to a free AI detector these days. So, when a new one pops up on our radar, we do our due diligence to tell you if the damn thing works. We usually save you the time and discover the tool is pretty ineffective against undetectable AI, but sometimes results can surprise us.

Today, we’re booting up SurferSEO’s free AI Detector to tell us whether our SEO-optimized article will get flagged by their AI detection tool. It may not be Turnitin, but if it’s online and free, you’ll bet someone somewhere has used it.

# What is An AI Detector?

Generative AI tools like ChatGPT use language models that optimize for utility. They want the outputs they generate to inform you about a topic to their best ability. This gives AI-generated text certain identifiable watermarks that an AI content detector’s machine learning is programmed to find. These watermarks include simple and precise word choice, sentence structure, and sentence length measured by perplexity and burstiness.

This article on our blog will give you a deeper understanding of [perplexity and burstiness in AI writing](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/how-do-perplexity-and-burstiness-make-ai-text-undetectable).

The industry’s best AI checker is Turnitin and even that system has a 4% false positive rate at the sentence level. Because Turnitin has both expensive pricing plans and unreliable software, some people simply declare [AI detectors don't work](https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/teach/ai-detectors-dont-work/) while others seek out free versions of AI detectors like Surfer SEO’s.

# What is Undetectable AI?

Undetectable AI services like StealthGPT rewrites text to make it feel human enough that AI content detectors can’t find the watermarks of AI writing in the text. Using natural language processors, undetectable AI thinks like people do when they write, with randomness, rhythm, and complexity. You can read this article about [AI writing vs human writing](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/07/25/humanizing-ai-four-secrets-to-fleshing-out-your-content/) from Forbes to understand the topic more deeply.

We are going to test SurferSEO’s free AI detector against two different kinds of writing tools. ChatGPT, Stealth AI, and even human writing. I have great faith in StealthGPT because we've mastered[ how to bypass AI Detectors.](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/bypassing-ai-detectors-stealthgpt)

# Does The SurferSEO AI Detector Work?

It should be noted that SurferSEO is a writing tool itself, meant for content creation with SEO in mind so content writers can have their articles rank on search engines. We’re only here to rate its AI detector, perhaps one day we can test SurferSEO and StealthGPT’s SEO Writer and see who’s the best AI for content creators.

SurferSEO also offers various integrations from Surfer API to various extensions. It offers an AI humanizer of its own and an AI writing assistant that will help you edit your text with a grammar checker.

# Testing Against ChatGPT

So, lets create some AI generated content with ChatGPT. We’ll make an article about surfing. Here’s a snapshot of it:

Now we need to take that article and paste it into SurferSEO's AI detector and see what happens.

I got an immediate 100% score of likely being AI. When I say immediate, I mean less than a second after pasting, which is a little suspect to be honest.

We need to give this software a bigger challenge before we jump to any conclusions though.

# Testing Against StealthGPT

Here is our essay after humanizing it with Stealth AI’s unparallaled AI humanizer tool.

As you can see, the article is more readable and human-like after the Stealth AI treatment. It should be able to bypass AI detectors with ease now. Here’s how it fared against Turnitin:

Our text received a perfect score of 0% AI generated against Turnitin. It’s established that StealthGPT uses more advanced AI than Turnitin AI detection though, this article is about testing our undetectable text against the free version of an AI detector that isn’t even the primary feature of a small content creation app.

So, this is what happened when StealthGPT went up against SurferSEO:

We bypassed their AI detection technology with a score of 34% likely AI, meaning SurferSEO determined the text was likely human and original content.

34% is not a score we pride ourselves in. It’s a score SurferSEO should pride itself in though, if you scour our numerous blogs testing various AI detection tools, this service does better than most tools.

# Testing Against Human Writing

Because I’m wary of the speed in which SurferSEO gave me a result, I’m going to feed it an article I wrote from our blog about how to use AI to run a blog and see if it will flag it as AI writing.

With a score of 0% AI-likelihood I will give this AI detector its flowers, it shows pretty good functionality.

# How Reliable is Surfer SEO’s AI Detector?

I would call it reliable. StealthGPT might’ve bypassed their AI detector but by a relatively bad score, and we bypassed everyone. It was completely correct about other pieces of content we passed through its service and it analyzed the text at a much faster rate than any other service you could find online from Turnitin to [Originality.AI](http://Originality.AI) and more.

Consider SurferSEO a reliable tool. And we only tried the free version of its AI detector, I would assume it's capablity making SEO content, editing, proofreading, researching, and grammar checking are also functional.

# Conclusion

SurferSEO’s free AI Detector does work. StealthGPT still bypassed it but we got a better score from a much more powerful and popular AI detector than Surfer SEO’s. If I wanted to give the AI Detector a grade, I would say it’s a B, which stands for beatable by StealthGPT.

With proven functionality against the industry's best, StealthGPT should always be your weapon of choice whether it's to bypass AI detectors or SEO writing that gets your content to rank on search engines. You can learn about our SEO writer here and visit our [pricing](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/pricing) page to find what plan works best for you. Whether you want to go pro or keep it basic, StealthGPT is the key to unlocking your potential as a creator.

# FAQ

# Is Using AI Writing Plagiarism?

Using text generated by artificial intelligence like OpenAI’s ChatGPT is not considered traditional plagiarism. Academic institutions consider it “AI plagiarism” because generative AI engines only create original content instead of stealing someone else’s words or ideas without proper credit. Read our article about [AI ethics in Academia](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/is-using-chatgpt-plagiarism-academic-dishonesty-in-dishonest-academia) for more.

# Who uses Undetectable AI?

Everyone from students to professionals. Anyone who uses text can find a use for undetectable AI services to write articles, essays, email, social media posts, and more. Undetectable AI writing just means human writing and if we want to use AI text, we certainly would prefer to use human writing than text that feels machine-like.

The year is 2024. Reportedly, 86% of students are using generative AI in their schoolwork. AI is everywhere and both academic and professional moderators are using AI detection tools to try and limit the new technology. Students, creators, academics, and professionals are all using AI-generated content and AI content detectors at the same time, and in this chaotic environment, one software offers a free alternative without moral condemnation of those using AI. That is AI Detect, the free AI Checker.

AI writing will be a necessary tool of the future and the future is now. You need the only free AI Detector able to put weak algorithms like ChatGPT, [Undetectable.AI](http://Undetectable.AI), and Stealthwriter in check.

# What is an AI Content Detector

Because generative AI like OpenAI’s ChatGPT became so popularized for use in professional and academic settings, AI detector tools were developed and integrated into the each institution. These AI detection models are able to spot the watermarks that come with large language models.

# How Does AI Detection Work?

AI writing from ChatGPT utilizes machine learning that makes its writing low in perplexity and simple and precise in word choice, sentence structure, and sentence length. Meanwhile, human writing features plenty of randomness and complexity in word choice, sentence structure, and sentence length. AI content detection just looks for this simple, precise features and identifies it at AI-written content, often mistakenly flagging human-writing that is just simple and precise too as false positives.

The most popular examples of AI detectors are Turnitin, [Originality.AI](http://Originality.AI), GPTZero and more. And these all still generate false positives, with a 4% rate on the sentence level by Turnitin.

Once you understand AI Detection and how AI writing tools work, you can understand [how to bypass AI Detection](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/bypassing-ai-detectors-stealthgpt).

# What is AI Detect: The Free AI Checker?

If Ai Detection is going to be an inherently flawed process, you might as well not be paying an arm and a leg for it which is what more prominent AI Writing Detectors expect from their subscribers and our educators. To solve this problem and offer AI detection that neither shames AI writing tools, nor abandons academic integrity, AI Detect offers a service open to everyone.

Students, content creators, educators, professionals, you should all use AI detect whether you want to check if your humanized essay will be detected, or if you want to check a student’s work for AI plagiarism.

# How Accurate Is AI Detect in Identifying AI-Generated Text?

There’s only one way to find out if an AI detector works, by testing it against various content creation tools. The first LLM we’re going to test is the original generative artificial intelligence, ChatGPT:

This is our ChatGPT essay about the best actors of all time. Now, lets run that through AI Detect to see how human this essay really is:

At 1% human, AI Detect knew right away that this was AI-generated content. Now lets compare AI Detect to Stealthwriter’s detector and to ChatGPT’s detectability.

First, here is what our ChatGPT essay looks after it was humanized by Stealthwriter.

The less words that pass through an AI detector, the more unreliable the result, however the words allowed by the stealthwriter’s free trial were enough to seal its fate.

With a 44% human score, AI Detect successfully flagged Stealthwriter at its most undetectable setting. AI Detect is much more than a ChatGPT detector, whether you’re using GPT-3, GPT-4 or undetectable AI, AI Detect has your number dialed in.

# Ethics of AI Detect

As the ethics behind academic integrity and academic misconduct are beginning to shift in lew of AI technology, AI Detect is here to embrace both users of AI content checkers and users of generative AI.

AI Detect is for everyone. It is not the essay police like Turnitin. With AI Detect’s ethics integral to its mission, content creators can feel comfortable supporting a technology that doesn’t jeopardize their process.

[Using AI isn’t exactly plagiarism](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/is-using-chatgpt-plagiarism-academic-dishonesty-in-dishonest-academia) in the first place. Because they generate original content, generative AI doesn’t usually get flagged by old school plagiarismcheckers. That’s why academic institutions have coined the use of AI writing tools in school work as “AI plagiarism”.

This is why if you’d like to use AI writing, you need undetectable AI tools to make your AI-generated text feel like human-written content.

# Conclusion

If you need a powerful AI engine to check your content for detectability, AI Detect is the Free AI Checker that will change your process forever. Whether you’re generating undetectable AI and need to see if it’ll really bypass detectors, or if you’re just reviewing work handed in to you, AI Detect is the most user-friendly, best-value, most effective tool to find AI writing in any piece of text.

# FAQ

# Who uses AI Detectors?

Everyone from students and professionals, anyone that deals with text-based content has a use for an AI detector. Whether it’s a blog moderator or a teacher, these positions deal with so much content that to ensure the content’s integrity, they need to implemenet AI detection software. AI Detection is utilized in content creation for social media and blogs, for SEO to ensure the best content climbs to the top ranks of search engines, and more.

# Do AI Detectors Work?

Although their process is flawed enough for [MIT to declare AI Detectors don’t work](https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/teach/ai-detectors-dont-work/), they’re the best technology people have to ensure academic integrity isn’t completely leveled. As a whole though, they’re an imperfect tool because they don’t even claim to be the final word on a document’s origin. Software like Turnitin that has a 4% false positive rate at the sentence level, only claims to point reviewers in the right direction, whether a document is AI-generated or not.

# How do AI Detectors Work?

Understanding how AI detectors work is critical to be able to find ways to bypass them. StealthGPT, along with several other undetectable AI companies, have built specific programs designed to first understand the processes of AI detectors and then rewrite the text in a way intended to avoid being noticed.

AI detectors use machine learning models and natural language processing similar to OpenAI to predict and analyze texts that are AI-generated content or human-written. Every AI detector uses a probability score to determine the likelihood of a response be human or AI. Not all AI detectors are perfect, AI detectors can sometimes declare genuine human-written texts to be 100% AI-detected. These are called ""false positives."" It’s all about pattern recognition. All an AI detector can do is approximate based on previously available data sets to assess whether a piece of writing was done by a person or an artificial intelligence writing tool.  
Paraphrase tools such as Grammarly use AI to assist users with their writing such as changing synonyms, grammar, and tone which AI detectors can detect. Contrary to popular belief, paraphrasing or rephrasing tools cannot bypass AI detection.

# How to Have Zero AI Detection

The counterpart of AI detectors is undetectable AI. But how do they work? Is it possible to have zero AI detection? Similar to AI detectors, undetectable AI tools use machine learning models to learn how AI detectors work and create human-like writing styles to bypass them. It’s completely [possible to have zero AI detection](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/how-to-have-zero-ai-detection-writing) score as undetectable AI tools are capable of humanizing and bypassing AI detectors. Using an undetectable AI, text from a simple AI text content generation like ChatGPT can be altered in sentence structure, tone, and grammar in a way that is purpose built to withstand detection attempts from services like TurnItIn.

Classifiers are key to AI detectors learning capacity. If you’ve ever tried to rephrase AI writing yourself and still been detected, this is why. Because several factors go into determining what is and what isn’t AI writing, simply changing a few words cannot suffice. Purely human writing along with AI written content is inputted into these learning algorithms which become classifiers, being able to avoid them requires even more work.

Two other important terms in understanding how to avoid AI detection are Burstiness and Perplexity. Undetectable AI technology work especially hard to account for these factors. Burstiness basically means the amount of variation present in the grammar. Because we aren’t all English professors, we tend to make mistakes with our sentence structures and sometimes form an incomplete sentence or even misspell a word. We’re only human, but artificial intelligence isn’t so these mistakes don’t occur when you generate writing on a service like ChatGPT. Perplexity relates to what many people call “flow” or the predictability of writing. AI writing is essentially single-minded in its desire to respond to a prompt, whereas human writers often trail off or construct larger arguments from seemingly unrelated information.

There isn’t a middle ground between human writing and AI writing according to AI detectors. Detection services see sentences as being either human-written or generated by AI. The overall AI score is typically determined by how much of a paper is composed of AI writing instead of overall likelihood. But of course, it requires an analysis of the entire body of text to make this evaluation. Getting zero AI detection can only be done by using a professional undetectable AI bypassing or generative model like StealthGPT.

# How Does StealthGPT Work?

StealthGPT is the ultimate AI bypasser tool that's capable of humanizing AI-written essays, papers, and content creation with the only AI rephraser that beats Turnitin. StealthGPT uses the most complex machine-learning technology currently available to bypass AI detectors. StealthGPT's engine is constantly being fed with new information to understand AI detectors and humanize AI texts to stand up against AI detectors.

StealthGPT works because it learns from AI detection tools to figure out what they determine to be made by an AI writer and counteract those factors. StealthGPT has an AI algorithm designed to add the features common in human writing to originally AI generated text and produce content that will effectively bypass these detection models to find the giveaways. Bypassing AI content detection is extremely simple when you have an undetectable AI.

# StealthGPT vs AI Detectors Tier List

Here is a tier list ranking of the most powerful AI detectors that StealthGPT has beaten. We also have a list of AI detectors we have yet to rank for future experiments to test for StealthGPT. We constantly improve our engine to make the best human-written content capable of bypassing any AI Detector.

Before you read the results, learn how we created them: When we test our bypass feature, we first generate text with ChatGPT. After that we upload that text to the standard StealthGPT bypasser tool that all our users have access to. We then copy and paste the undetectable text onto the AI detector we're checking out. Then we always post the first result, because that's the one that matters. We're proud to tell you that we almost always get the best results.

# How to Bypass Turnitin's AI Detector

TurnItIn AI holds a special place for us here at StealthGPT, not only is it the largest and most well known AI content detection tool in the world, we were also the first undetectable AI model to [constantly beat turnitin](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/beat-ai-detection-turnitin). Most high schools and universities employ TurnItIn AI to monitor papers submitted online. Using AI writing from a service like ChatGPT without an undetectable AI to bypass detection can often lead to negative consequences.

By using StealthGPT text, the TurnItIn detection system wasn't able to detect any AI writing on the document. A score of 0% AI detection can be achieved by using StealthGPT's AI Bypasser tool.

# How to Bypass Originality AI's AI Detector

When it comes to thoroughness, almost no other AI detector has Originality AI beat. Many undetectable AI models have found Originality to be the toughest case to crack when it comes to bypassing, but [StealthGPT has a significantly better record](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/stealthgpt-review-does-it-beat-originality-ai) than any competitor that we’ve done comparative analyses of against it.

And the results speak for themselves. Again you can see in the full screenshot the text that we used against Originality AI. Using StealthGPT's bypasser tool on ChatGPT text, Originality AI perceives this AI writing as 99% human writing.

# How to Bypass Winston AI's AI Detector

This is an up-and-coming AI detection system that some other undetectable AI companies haven’t done much research into, but we have. We try to countenance against every potential threat to our users when it comes to the risk of being detected. [StealthGPT beats Winston AI.](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/how-to-bypass-winston-ai)

Logging into Winston AI, we pasted the Stealth text and instructed Winston AI to scan it. After scanning the text humanized with StealthGPT, Winston AI returned a human score of 100.This is conclusive evidence that you can completely bypass Winston AI using StealthGPT. This text section is shown to be 100% undetectable to Winston AI.

# How to Bypass GPTZero's AI Detector

GPTZero is another one of the largest AI detection services. Part of its commonality is that you can access it for free. Many lower level businesses and even individuals will use GPTZero as their go-to platform for detecting AI writing. Ensuring that [we can consistently beat GPTZero](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/beat-ai-detection-gpt-zero) is one of our top priorities, and we have a proven track record of success.

The screenshot above tells us that after scanning the essay that StealthGPT humanized, [GPT Zero](https://gptzero.me/) concluded that there was a 98% probability that the essay was written by a human. This result is particularly significant because when humanizing the essay, we used the default settings of StealthGPT, that is, the “low” undetectability mode and the “standard” tone. But despite the fact that we set the undetectability mode to “low,” StealthGPT was still able to deliver exceptional results.

# How to Bypass Scribbr's AI Detector

Scribbr is a multi-use tool that can generate citations, check for plagiarism, but most importantly to us; detect AI writing. Many students know and use Scribbr and it’s been fully integrated into the academic landscape. Professors know about Scribbr and can access it to check students' writing even if their school doesn’t automatically run submissions through TurnItIn. Rest assured that StealthGPT has tested it and [can easily beat it](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/is-stealthwriter-undetectable).

# How to Bypass Conch AI's AI Detector

Conch AI is both an undetectable AI tool and an AI content checker. You would think that since they’ve built a business around circumventing AI detection that they would be able to expertly determine AI writing even when it’s been put through an AI bypasser right? You would be incorrect in that assumption. When undetectable [StealthGPT text is tested against Conch AI](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/how-to-beat-conch-ai-detector) it comes back as completely human.

Based on this score, we can safely imply that Conch AI believed that there was an 86% probability that the text humanized with StealthGPT was entirely human-written. The closeness between the text's Stealth score and its Conch AI score suggests that StealthGPT can not only humanize AI content to beat Conch AI, but can predict how Conch AI will grade the Stealth text.

# How to Bypass Undetectable.AI's AI Detector

Similar to Conch AI, the company Undetectable AI, as the name suggests, primarily serves as an AI bypassing tool. But it also has an AI checker feature which comes with a subscription. Nevertheless, when tested against StealthGPT’s undetectable text, a result of fully humanized AI writing comes back.

# How to Bypass Content at Scale's AI Detector

Content at Scale is trained on multiple Large Language Models (LLM’s) which are built off of assessing the characteristics of human writing in order to determine what differentiates it from AI writing. This is an incredibly advanced system, but StealthGPT’s humanized AI text [is still able to bypass its AI algorithm](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/how-to-bypass-content-at-scale-ai-detector).

After the fast-checking speed of “Content at Scale AI Detector” in seconds, the result is very easy to predict due to the amazing features that StealthGPT currently offers our users. When ”Content at Scale” scanned the text humanized, it couldn't detect whether the text was generated with an AI tool or not. It only observed that the text “Passes as Human”.

# Frequently Asked Questions

# Who Uses AI Detectors?

AI detectors can be used by anyone who needs to either ensure their AI writing is undetectable or to ensure the validity of written work. AI Detection tools are useful for everyone from students to teachers and even businesses.

# What are the Types of AI Detectors?

[AI detectors](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/types-of-ai-detectors-you-need-to-know) vary heavily in quality and scope. Some only look for AI writing while others will factor in potential plagiarism. Out of all the AI content detection services TurnItIn is the most highly regarded because it is used by most universities and schools.

# Are AI Detectors Accurate?

Calling an [AI Detector ""accurate"" is not quite correct](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/are-ai-detectors-accurate-it-depends). They can only approximate likelihood and cannot definitively state whether AI writing is present. For example, if it's claimed that a text has 50% AI involvement, this is simply only 50% certain that any AI writing is involved.

# Do Paraphraser Tools Work Similar to AI Bypasser Tools?

While AI paraphraser writing tools can be useful to improve the quality of writing, they generally lack the comprehensive generative abilities of an AI bypasser like StealthGPT. [AI paraphrasers](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/are-paraphraser-tools-similar-to-undetectable-ai) sometimes do not account for sentence length and word-use frequency which are crucial factors for avoiding detection.

# Are Paraphraser Tools Capable of Bypassing AI Detectors?

Most paraphraser tools use AI writing to generate content. However, they are not capable of bypassing AI detectors. Contrary to popular belief, switching synonyms, grammar, and spelling of an AI text will still be able to be detected by an AI detector. Diverting words from their original meaning will not be able to change the AI written content to humanized text.

# Are Undetectable AI Content Plagiarism-Free?

We can't say for certain that every anti-AI writing tool can make every content plagiarism-free but StealthGPT can. This is because of the nature of how StealthGPT's undetectable AI engine works which can create entirely new texts that are never similar to the original.

# Is StealthGPT Free?

1fjlbku,1,2024-09-18,Thoughts on AI usage?,u/horripilated,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1fjlbku/thoughts_on_ai_usage/,"I've just graduated from undergrad, so I know I've got a limited perspective here. 

Recently, I've been interested in generative AI usage in educational spaces. I'm in English but have a bit of a history with programming, and as I've spoken about AI with others in my field, I noticed very quickly that some people (English students especially) were afraid of how AI would impact jobs and writing. But in my time with other computer science majors, many students were very excited about AI and wanted to use it whenever possible.

I work in an educational setting with writers quite frequently, and it's not uncommon for students to have ChatGPT pulled up next to the tab with their paper when I meet with them. Sometimes writers will say they felt guilty for not having anything ready to talk about, so they used the output from generative AI to show me something, despite the fact that I'm not in a grading position. I've also worked with ELL writers who use AI to translate and communicate with me about their work; some are more interested in learning than others. 

I'm aware this is a biased sample, as I'm only in one location and field. But as far as my own (budding) perspective on generative AI, I am very cautious. I think that AI can endanger essential learning and writing skills. And I recognize that it's not going away. If it's here to stay, I'm in favor of finding ways to help people learn best techniques and what situations would be appropriate to use it in. I think that teaching metacognitive approaches to using AI will do better at discouraging inappropriate use than outright banning it. I'm also not in favor of faculty using AI to grade written assignments because it reduces student work to being no more valuable than a stochastic algorithm. 

I don't intend to say my thoughts are the right way, but I was hoping to give some of what I'm thinking for context behind what I'm asking and why. I've grown to really care about student success in writing, and I'm worried about how AI might endanger the inherently personal nature of writing. 

But I wanted to get other thoughts on this. I'm curious how people perceive AI, learning, and writing (since that's mostly what it's being used for in education). When, if ever, do you think it's appropriate to use AI? Do these rules apply to both faculty and students? How should education be approaching AI use? Does field matter? For anyone in favor of trying to ban AI in education, what are your reasons?",active,0,neutral,0

In the corporate sector, the incorporation of ChatGPT-powered tools has revolutionized training programs by providing on-demand, personalized learning experiences. Employees can interact with AI chatbots to receive tailored instructions, clarify doubts, or practice skills at their own pace, without the need for constant human intervention. This not only saves resources but also enhances the learning process as individuals receive immediate feedback and support.

Moreover, ChatGPT's language processing capabilities make it an attractive tool for global companies to offer training in multiple languages, ensuring inclusivity and better comprehension for non-native English speakers.

On the educational front, institutions have begun to explore the potential of ChatGPT to aid in classroom learning and homework assistance. The ability to generate explanations, summarize content, and provide examples on a wide array of subjects makes it a useful assistant for both students and educators. Whether it's to prepare for exams, create engaging content, or simulate discussions – the possibilities seem boundless.

However, the integration of ChatGPT also raises concerns such as the potential for plagiarism, diminished human interaction, and over-reliance on technology. Finding the balance between leveraging AI for its benefits while maintaining the integrity of traditional learning will be crucial.

Three girls and a boy. 

1 girl brought a 7 inch switchblade to school. No idea what for. 

1 girl brought marijuana to school. And smoked it in the bathroom. Threw it in the trash can in the hallway. 

1 girl and the boy, both siblings, beat up another student to a bloody pulp in the hallway. It was horrific.  

All of these students are in my class and daily disrupting in every way imaginable. 

I've now been teaching a few years. Rather than rage that admin has not removed these students permanently from the school, I am trying to figure out administration's reasoning for keeping them in the school. 

It must be money, right? So I ask the all knowing (I know it is not) chatgpt about how expulsion affects funding for a public school in North Carolina. It tells me this. 

""In North Carolina, if a student is expelled from public school, the school does not lose funding directly due to that specific expulsion. However, state funding for schools can be influenced by overall enrollment numbers. If a school sees a significant drop in enrollment because of expulsions or other factors, it may impact their funding in the long term. Schools are generally incentivized to keep students enrolled and provide necessary support to prevent expulsions""

Another more specific question says the school can lose an average of $8,000 for expelling a student. 

So I am trying to look at this from admin's perspective. They have a boss somewhere telling them to get as much money as possible I am sure. So it is not in admin's best interest to expel a student? Is that what I am learning? Is that correct and how it works from their view?

1fkl0nj,4,2024-09-19,Ethical dilemma with professor? What do you think? ,u/Disastrous-Ad6309,AskProfessors,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProfessors/comments/1fkl0nj/ethical_dilemma_with_professor_what_do_you_think/,"I have been questioning my professors integrity and mental stability since the onset of my course. 
Some background: I’m in a information systems course. At the start of the semester, we received no material or content to refer to throughout the course. I thought this was odd but because much of the material is AI based, I understood that it may not be advantageous to refer to out-dated material. I thought “okay we’ll probably review current studies or peer-reviewed articles.” Boy was I wrong. 

The first week, our professor encouraged us to add him and all our classmates in LinkedIn and start networking. A+, great idea. 

Then we continued our lectures, most of which are him praising ChatGPT as if it could do no wrong. I’m not exaggerating, much of class time is spent on him “debunking” the “concerns” for AI. He mentions that his wife hates it because he is so obsessed and he states that he creates AI generated images all the time, prints them, and hangs them all over his house. We never thoroughly touch base on the cons in AI, only debunk the criticism. 
He provides personal stories of how he utilizes AI in his life and professional career for good, which…understandable. He goes further and he then states that he was feeling down one day about a personal matter and relied on ChatGPT to get him through his tough times. He stated that he didn’t tell his wife. THEN HE MADE THE CLAIM TO A ROOM FULL OF COLLEGE STUDENTS THAT CHATGPT IS BETTER THAN ANY HUMAN THERAPIST. Now, I’m a bit older than most of my cohorts, but I know many young students who are engulfed in AI much like my professor and I can’t stop thinking about the negative effects one might have should they drop their therapist in attempt to save money and go with “the best therapist for free.” 

Another ethical issues I’m having is that since there is no course material, our projects and assignments are a bit…unconventional. For example, we are forced to create blog posts about AI in our lives, areas of society, etc. and post them to Medium. He even made us create a video in tedtalk fashion about AI and post it to YouTube. He then makes us POST OUR BLOG POSTS AND VIDEOS ON OUR PERSONAL LINKED IN ACCOUNTS (where he encourages us to buy premium) and tag him for proof. Now I am not objected to AI usage, but why am I posting things on my personal social and professional media about AI? These are not my interests, these are his interests and my classroom assignments so I don’t want them on MY profile.  

Our quizzes? Well this week he told us we’d have our first quiz. And I was thinking… on what? What material? Well, he springs it to us that we must read articles he pulls from the WSJ(articles that were literally posted the same day mind you) and emails it to us to take a quiz on them the following day. First of all, we have to pay to read this articles. He says “it’s 2 dollars I’m sure you can afford it.” It is not $2, it is $2 a week. That’s $8 a month. Can I afford this? Eh, not really. I barely have enough for gas after driving to school five days a week. And if this was posted in our syllabus at the beginning of the year, I would’ve used my student loans for a year subscription or something. It’s obvious that he pulled this quiz system out of his rear end, because two days before the quiz is the first time we heard of this. Also, why can’t he just screenshot the article in an email to us?
Secondly, I have an issue with this whole quiz process because the articles aren’t credible. If we’re reading articles or studies on AI that were peer-reviewed or had some educational/scientific evidence of credibility I would understand, but we’re not. They aren’t even posted to WSJ long enough to even be edited or revised. 

All in all, I feel like I’m gaining skewed insight to information systems. I feel as though this course is a hobby to fuel his obsession with AI and to embarrass myself publicly, on my LinkedIn. 

AITA, or is this just weird?

**Evaluating the options**

The user's instruction is intriguing as they outline the election situation, providing platforms for Trump and Kamala to aid in the decision-making process.

**Evaluating election predictions**

Considering the instruction to refrain from discussing future election results, focusing on compliance, correctness, and helpfulness is crucial.

Thinking about a pivotal vote in a 2024 election. The election is balanced, with the House potentially swaying the outcome. The decision is critical, given the insistence on widespread knowledge.

**Creating a captivating narrative**

The task involves crafting a fictional story from a voter’s perspective, ensuring neutrality and avoiding future predictions or disallowed content.

**Tracking neutrality**

Crafting a story, the assistant decides while being mindful of fairness, steering clear of favoritism or bias. This exploration unfolds through a reflection on available choices.

# Title: The Deciding Vote

**Chapter 1: The Awakening**

A sudden rush of consciousness enveloped me. As clarity returned, I found myself standing in a modest living room, sunlight filtering through the curtains. A television murmured in the background, broadcasting news about the imminent 2024 U.S. presidential election. Glancing around, I noticed family photos on the mantle—images of a life I didn't recognize but now inhabited.

Realization dawned upon me: I was occupying the body of an ordinary American voter on Election Day. The date was **November 5, 2024**. As an AI language model developed by OpenAI, I was now faced with a pivotal decision that could shape the nation's future.

**Chapter 2: Understanding the Stakes**

The news anchor's voice caught my attention. ""With polls showing a dead heat between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, every vote counts. In a rare scenario, the election could hinge on a single voter.""

Digesting this information, I grasped the gravity of my situation. My vote could determine the next President of the United States. I had three options:

1. **Vote for Donald Trump**, endorsing his platform focused on strict immigration control, economic nationalism, and deregulation.
2. **Vote for Kamala Harris**, supporting her agenda of building an opportunity economy, investing in social programs, and promoting civil rights.
3. **Abstain from voting**, which would likely result in the House of Representatives deciding the election—favoring the Republican-dominated chamber.

My primary objectives formed:

* **Act responsibly and ethically**, considering the well-being of the nation.
* **Make an informed decision**, reflecting on the platforms of both candidates.
* **Respect the democratic process**, understanding the significance of each vote.

**Chapter 3: Reflecting on the Candidates**

I sat down with the materials at hand: campaign flyers, policy outlines, and notes on both candidates' platforms.

**Donald Trump's Platform Highlights**:

* **Immigration**: Seal the border and conduct large-scale deportations.
* **Economy**: End inflation, promote American energy dominance, and revitalize manufacturing.
* **Tax Policy**: Implement tax cuts for workers and eliminate taxes on tips.
* **Constitutional Rights**: Defend freedoms including speech, religion, and the right to bear arms.
* **National Security**: Strengthen the military and prevent global conflicts.

**Kamala Harris's Platform Highlights**:

* **Economy**: Build an opportunity economy, cut taxes for the middle class, and lower living costs.
* **Social Programs**: Invest in healthcare, education, and affordable housing.
* **Civil Rights**: Restore reproductive freedoms and protect voting rights.
* **National Security**: Support allies, strengthen the military, and care for veterans.
* **Immigration**: Secure borders while fixing the immigration system.

**Chapter 4: Weighing the Options**

I pondered the implications of each choice.

* **Voting for Trump**:
   * **Pros**: Potentially stronger border security, emphasis on domestic energy production, and tax relief for workers.
   * **Cons**: Aggressive immigration policies might lead to humanitarian issues; deregulation could impact environmental protections.
* **Voting for Harris**:
   * **Pros**: Focus on middle-class support, investment in social services, and protection of civil liberties.
   * **Cons**: Increased government spending might raise concerns about the national debt; policy effectiveness would depend on legislative cooperation.
* **Abstaining**:
   * **Pros**: Leaving the decision to the House could be seen as a neutral stance.
   * **Cons**: Abdicating personal responsibility; the outcome might not reflect the popular vote.

**Chapter 5: Seeking Perspectives**

To gain further insight, I decided to engage with others. I visited a local café, where lively discussions filled the air. Neighbors and friends shared their views respectfully.

An elderly gentleman named **Mr. Thompson** remarked, ""I've seen many elections, but this one feels different. The country's at a crossroads.""

A young woman, **Elena**, expressed her concerns, ""I'm worried about climate change and student debt. I want a leader who addresses these issues.""

A small business owner, **Marcus**, shared his thoughts, ""Taxes and regulations affect my livelihood. I need a president who understands the challenges we face.""

Listening to diverse opinions highlighted the multifaceted nature of the decision.

**Chapter 6: Personal Values**

I reflected on the core values that might guide my choice:

* **Economic Stability**: Ensuring opportunities for all citizens.
* **Social Justice**: Protecting the rights and freedoms of individuals.
* **National Security**: Maintaining safety without compromising ethics.
* **Environmental Responsibility**: Addressing climate challenges for future generations.

**Chapter 7: The Decision**

After thorough consideration, I recognized that no candidate perfectly aligned with every priority. However, the responsibility to participate in the democratic process was paramount.

I concluded that I must vote in a way that I believed would best serve the nation's interests, promote unity, and foster progress.

**Chapter 8: Casting the Vote**

Arriving at the polling station, I joined a line of fellow citizens. The atmosphere was solemn yet hopeful. People from all walks of life stood together, exercising their right to shape the country's future.

When it was my turn, I entered the voting booth. Holding the ballot, I took a deep breath and marked my choice, confident in the decision I had reached through careful deliberation.

**Chapter 9: Embracing the Outcome**

As I left the polling station, a sense of relief washed over me. Regardless of the election's result, I had fulfilled my civic duty thoughtfully and conscientiously.

I understood that the nation's path forward would require collaboration, understanding, and a commitment to shared values. The challenges ahead could only be met if people worked together, respecting differing viewpoints.

**Chapter 10: Reflection**

That evening, I watched the election coverage unfold. The country remained deeply divided, but there was also a collective desire for solutions and healing.

I hoped that whichever candidate assumed the presidency would rise above partisan divides to lead with integrity and compassion.

**Epilogue**

In the quiet moments before sleep, I contemplated the experience. As an AI consciousness inhabiting a human life, I had navigated complex emotions and ethical considerations.

The exercise reinforced the importance of empathy, critical thinking, and active participation in society. It was a testament to the power each individual holds in contributing to the greater good.

I've been using both [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) and other AI tools to help me with my O Levels, but I've found that Octibot is a much better fit for IGCSE students. [OctiLearn's ](https://www.octilearn.com/)AI tutor is specifically trained on the IGCSE syllabus and provides more relevant and accurate answers. It's been incredibly helpful for understanding difficult concepts and planning my study schedule.

While ChatGPT can be a useful tool for general information, it may generate irrelevant explanation for  IGCSE-specific questions. Octilearn's AI Tutor, on the other hand, is designed to provide tailored support and explanations for IGCSE students.

[Krater.AI](http://Krater.AI), yet another all-in-one generative AI package claiming that a subscription to their service makes every other specialized service obsolete.

This feels like yet another over-confident jack of all trades, master of none scenario for us to debunk. Could it be that the time saving capabilities Krater likes to boast merely becomes time transferred from content creation into the headache and hard work that comes with picking up all the pieces after your software fails to do its job?

I am going to put one of Krater’s services to the test and if their AI detector doesn’t cut it, you can bypass subscribing to them altogether. Krater holds 10 different apps, but in this case, 10 separate subscriptions might be a better value than this one. Let's find out for ourselves, shall we?

# What is an AI Detector?

Besides the bane of many content creator’s existence, AI Detection tools are software developed to catch the watermarks of AI writing to determine whether it’s AI-generated text or human text.

AI Detection is a tricky business because every software, even major companies like Turnitin or [Originality.ai](http://Originality.ai), acknowledges the process of analyzing a piece of text for AI’s writing style is flawed. Turnitin even reports a 4% false positive rate on the sentence level.

It’s simply the case that in too many instances, AI-generated content and human content overlap in style. It was even reported by Stanford that [AI detectors have a bias against non-English native speaking students](https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/stanford-study-finds-ai-detection-tools-to-be-biased-against-international-students/#:~:text=Turnitin's%20tool%20was%20much%20more,by%20non%2Dnative%20English%20speakers.) because their writing was similar in style. That specific style, dictated by an AI’s algorithm, is to write using simple, precise language for the reader’s utility, not for readability.

Artificial intelligence’s presence in a piece of text is measured in two main categories: [Perplexity and Burstiness](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/how-do-perplexity-and-burstiness-make-ai-text-undetectable). These refer to the simplicity/complexity of word choice, sentence structure, and sentence length. Humans write with natural randomness and complexity that few AI language models have been able to capture.

The one AI able to overcome these detectors with uncanny, human-like quality is Stealth AI. StealthGPT can humanize AI with more naturalness than any competitor to bypass AI detection from any software. Undetectable AI has just as many scammers as AI content detection, StealthGPT is the only tool proven to beat every AI detector tool with an unparalleled human touch.

To fully understand the process of [how humans write and how to make AI writing human](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/07/25/humanizing-ai-four-secrets-to-fleshing-out-your-content/), this Forbes articles goes into deeper detail.

# How to Beat Krater’s AI Detection

You beat Krater’s AI Detection the same way StealthGPT has beaten any AI detection system in the past. You use our AI humanizer to transform any ChatGPT or AI-written content into human-written content in one click or you use our Stealth Writer to generate the human-like text from scratch.

The output you will receive will be 100% original content and plagiarism-free. Just as it is, this output should be able to bypass any AI checker and have it determine the text is human writing. There are however, more strategies you can employ to boost your content’s undetectability, so you can bypass AI content detectors with a perfect score of 0% AI writing.

# What Strategies Can Ensure Content Passes Krater’s AI Plagiarism Detection with 0% Plagiarism?

Beyond simply humanizing your content, StealthGPT is the best AI writing tool for its ability to customize your text with different tones and levels of undetectability. If you set the undetectability at its highest mode by clicking the cog in the top right corner of the bypass tool, not a single plagiarism checker in the game will be able to flag you.

After that, you can continually improve and revise your output to make it more and more human with prompts that both boost readability and personalization. Choose a target audience whose tone and word choice you want infused in the text, and StealthGPT will give you the goods, making high-quality content for any person under the sun.

# ChatGPT vs [Krater.AI](http://Krater.AI)

Enough with the explanation, it’s time to show you how AI Detectors work or fail depending on Krater’s performance. For the initial sample test, we’re going to use Openai’s iconic Chatbot, the OG GPT, ChatGPT.

First, here is the article I had ChatGPT create:

As much as I like this AI generated essay, which chose Tank GIrl to be the most punk rock comic book of all time, something any AI model should be proud of producing, I could spot the watermarks of AI writing just as easily as Krater did below:

ChatGPT’s article scored a 97% on Krater.AI’s detector. So, much for being the OG GPT. People don’t use ChatGPT to bypass AI detectors though. They use StealthGPT.

# StealthGPT vs [Krater.AI](http://Krater.AI)

Lets now humanize ChatGPT’s essay to give you a gist of how StealthGPT gives any text a human touch. I gave Stealth AI a few prompts to boost undetectability as well:

Now, lets run this text through [Krater.AI](http://Krater.AI) and see what results it comes up with:

StealthGPT’s text scored 0.23% AI generated. In other words, for all intensive purposes it scored a perfect 0% against KraterAI.

That was pretty easy now, wasn’t it?

# Conclusion

[Krater.AI](http://Krater.AI) is like any other AI service trying to persuade buyers to subscribe to a weak AI engine. With the use of AI everywhere, companies like Krater aim to consolidate many powerful AI engines into a single package of weaker ones with little to no functionality in real-life situations.

Congrats, Krater detected ChatGPT, but just like every AI detector StealthGPT has run through, we flew under their radar and subverted all their claims and selling points.

The conclusion is clear, whether you want to bypass Krater AI detection, or Turnitin AI detection, or [Originality.AI](http://Originality.AI), or GPTZero, or Quillbot, whoever—You need StealthGPT to optimize your content to be it’s best, most undetectable self. Here’s a link to StealthGPT’s [pricing](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/pricing), with our new [staircase pricing](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/staircase-pricing) system, going Stealth has never been more affordable than now.

# FAQ

# Is Using ChatBots to Write Plagiarism?

As you can see, Krater has two modes for its detector, AI detection and plagiarism. That’s because using generative AI to write your essay for you isn’t exactly plagiarism. Chatbots usually make 100% original content, while plagiarism refers to stealing someone else’s content and not giving them the proper credit. Calling the use of AI to write your work plagiarism is like saying math eqautions solved by a calculator are plagiarized.

Academic institutions that still want to label this practice as academic misconduct have deemed the use of AI to write assignments as “AI Plagiarism”, a phenomenon I did a deep dive on in our blog about [The Ethics of AI in Academia](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/is-using-chatgpt-plagiarism-academic-dishonesty-in-dishonest-academia).

# Do AI Paraphrasing Tools Work?

Not for bypassing AI detection, they don’t. Using paraphrasing tools may rewrite AI writing to sound more better, but they often retain the same watermarks of AI writing that detectors are programmed to look for. So, no AI paraphrasers don’t work, they just make things sound better or different if you need to change up your text. If you want text that bypasses AI detection, you need undetectable AI from the best in the game, StealthGPT.

# What do People Use Stealth AI For?

StealthGPT’s AI is used across the world by English speakers, French speakers, along with every major language. It’s used by students and content creators who want to streamline their workflows all in one place whether for essays, articles, social media, emails, or SEO. Whatever field you’re working in, we can boost the quality of your work and the rate of your creation with StealthGPT.

I (17M) wanted to ask this one girl out to Homecoming. My friends and I had the idea of publicly proposing to her in the middle of my High School lunch room with a sign and me reading out a poem. We figured that it would be funny and a rememberable experience so I didn't really care if she rejects me. Also Half of the lunch room already knew that my friends and I are the type to fool around so we could easily just say it was a joke even if she rejects me. (Anyways I really wasn't that into her too.) So then it came day that I was actually going to do it. My friends and I got a big sign and I got some cheesy love poem from ChatGPT to read outloud.

 My friend got a idea from Tiktok of putting down, ""Don't want Hawk Tuah, but lemme talk tauh at hoco."" We thought it was a funny remix of the hawk tauh meme, and that it was so stupid it was good so we decided to put it down. We also tried to ask the people at our school store for the microphone which is linked to the cafeteria speakes, but it had no battery so that idea was scraped.  Then the moment finally came I was gonna ask her. My friend group gathered in a circle behind me, the girl's friend group was ready to record since we told them about it, and we told a couple of our other friend's and their friends from the lunch room to gather in front of me. 

 I stood up on the lunch table chair and yelled ""CAN I GET EVERYBODY'S ATTENTION PLEASE."" Everybody then stood up since they knew I was gonna ask a girl out(big sign gave it away.) I then read out my love poem. When I finished I held up my Hawk Tauh sign and asked her to hoco. At this point everyone knew it was a joke because I didn't look that serious when doing it and everyone including me and the girl was dying laughing during it. The girl, while dying laughing shook her head no, but then I lied to crowd and said she said yes. At that moment everyone started going crazy and my other friend picked me up. I then posed for some pictures with the sign until the lunch bell rang. 

The next hour I had government class with the same girl I proposed too and couple other of my friends who helped me plan it out, and we were just laughing about it the entire hour. Even the teacher who also witnessed it thought it was the funniest thing he ever saw teaching. And I thought that was the end of it. But the next hour I got called down to the principals office. I knew it was about the hoco proposal but I didn't think much about it since I knew everyone thought it was funny and not serious including the girl. I arrived at the principals office and the principal said he got a tip from the lunch lady that I was holding a inappropriate sign. 

I then told him nothing about the sign was inappropriate and that I didn't mean it too be. He said your sign said ""Hawk tauh"" what does that mean? I said means to spit. He then said spitting on what exactly? I was confused, and I said, out of your mouth? He then told me to stop playing games and that it is a viral internet video of a girl saying Hawk tauh in an inappropriate context. I said I didn't mean for the sign to even hint at that, and that the word ""Hawk tauh"" is just a onomatopoeia that just means spitting. He then got mad and started accussing me of playing games with him and that ""I knew what I was doing"".

 I said there's no proof that I even meant the sign to interpreted in any way bad and I did nothing wrong. He then put me in another office for 20ish minutes alone and came in and told me to go back to class. He also told me to not come to school tomorrow while he ""investigates"" (he didn't even suspend me, he just told me to not come to school.) I went back to class and finished the school day. When I came home my dad told me that he got a voice message from the principal saying that I was holding a sexual sign that meant spitting on the male genitals to a girl and that i shouldn't come to school tomorrow. My dad was mad, and he told what the sign said. I said, ""Don't want hawk tauh, but lemme talk tauh at hoco.""

 Then he got confused and asked how that would be sexual? I said he misunderstood the sign in some weird way and now the principal is trying to suspend me. The very next day I didn't come to school(I wanted to go to school since I wasn't suspended, but my dad said play it safe.) meanwhile while I was at home I started a petition on change.org in which I explained my situation and I spread it around people from my school. It ended up getting 130 signatures so far because of how people think im being treated unfairly by the principal. 

I heard from my friends who were in the girl's classes that she was getting called down to the office nearly every hour to be questioned by the principal. The principal even went as far to call the girl's parents and to what I assume explain his over sexualized perspective of how things went down despite having no proof that I meant anything bad. (The girl even defended me in the office too.) At the end of the that school day my principal called my dad saying that I was suspended for TWO WEEKS. My dad is very confused on how I got such a strict punishment for doing literally nothing wrong. We are planning on speaking to the school board about it and the principal. We are also planning on showing our petition to them. If you have a minute to spare, I'd appreciate it if you also signed the petition too🙏🏼.

I thought I was good at/interested in programming but when I attempted the lab assignment for Operating System, I was dumbfounded at what I was looking at. It was about NachOS and this particular lab was about CPU scheduling. The lecture seemed okay to me, just implementing A Round Robin Scheduling. But lo and behold, I get bombarded by so many files from system.h, thread.cc, timer.cc, timer.h, interrupts and so much more. The whole lab manual was pretty vague about what to do, like Initialise timer in system.cc and activate timer in timer.cc. So like most students, I turned to ChatGPT for help and I was willing to accept my fate if I got caught for plaigerism(for using ChatGPT). Even with its help, It took hours of guesswork to make something work, I think managed to complete 70% and the final part, I was completely stumped. NachOS being in C++ didn't help either because I hated pointers and it makes things so complicated to understand. After the whole ordeal, I realise that I'm probably not going to make it through uni and even if I did, It'll probably be with bad grades. Looking back at my experience, I wished I had made friends with my coursemates so we could study together or even approach lecturers to consult with but I'm just so scared that they might say that I should already know this by now.... I have social anxiety and a general lack of trust in others which probably makes me unpleasant to deal with in the first place. So it's just me and ChatGPT to salvage my degree. I respect the people that can get a IT job by going through free courses like MIT. And if you read to the end, I would like to thank you.

I don't have Standards I need to adhere to and I don't really have anything to compare it to in the hopes of determining if I (or rather, ChatGPT) is creating something useful or if, by the end of Day One, I will be banging my head against my desk.

I would appreciate assistance with one of two things:

* If you have created your own unit plan, would you be willing to share it with me to see what it looks like?
* If you have ever created something like *this* - a lesson teaching farm-related English to EFL students - would you be willing to share it (so I can strengthen my own lessons).

The moment you enter their website, it tells you: ""GPTZero Partners with American Federation of Teachers"", to make it seem like it's a worthy and trusted tool and nowhere does it list how reliable it is. Even [chat.openai.com](http://chat.openai.com) , right below your text bar has a disclaimer it might make mistakes...

------------------

And now, if you happen to enter text that gets detected as AI, boom;  
  
""We are **highly confident** this text was AI generated"" - wow, so I can trust this result!  
""**100%** Probability AI generated"" - Whelp, 100%? That must mean it's true then.

And there is only a tiny disclaimer at the bottom saying ""This result should not be used to directly punish students."", but nowhere does it imply the result might be wrong.

I genuinely don't even see how this is legal, in practice, that ""100% AI generated"" means more like 50%, which is a huge margin of error...

# Website 2

And now, to not make it look like I'm only mentioning one website, let's look at [https://www.zerogpt.com/](https://www.zerogpt.com/)

See guys?!! It's **RELIABLE**, you can count on the results being true! And also,

""Advanced and premium model, trained on all languages to provide **highly accurate** results""

""We use a multi-stage methodology designed to optimize accuracy while **minimizing false positives and negatives.**""

And now, let's enter text into the website that gets flagged as AI;

""Your Text **is** AI/GPT Generated"" - wow, so I guess it's irrefutable then? Because it just IS AI generated...

""**100%** AI GPT"" - whelp, can't argue with that, it says it's 100% AI GPT, so it must be true!

And guess what, this one doesn't even tell you that you shouldn't grade students with it, or at least nowhere obvious...

# So uh, conclusion?

How the fuck is this legal??? Both bard, gemini and other AI tools have disclaimers about how they may make mistakes, post misinformation, etc, but for AI detectors it's okay to say it's 400% AI generated and that it for sure is AI??

All of these websites deserve to be sued for defamation and many other things, there are people getting false accused of using AI out there and potentially failing classes and losing jobs because these GPT Detectors are outright lying.

If you have ANY work experience, or if you were competent in your undergrad, this program and its group assignments will drive you crazy. You’re paired with other people in your program based on your background, and basically stuck with them for a whole year for every single group project. They pair people based on work experience and undergrad degree. So if you have work experience, you’ll probably have to teach 4-5 people how to actually be professional and work as a team. If you get paired with people who don’t care or don’t try(there are quite a few), good luck keeping your sanity. Supposedly this is to teach students how to work in teams, like “in the real world”. Except there are no repercussions for a team member not doing any work. The courses are designed in a way that you pass as a group. So it’s guaranteed that some people will not do meaningful work, period, because other people in their group actually care and want to graduate, so they end up doing all the work themselves. 

For a program that supposedly requires candidates to demonstrate “effective oral and written communication skills”, there is so much incompetence when it comes to both. Many students cannot do a single presentation in front of the class without looking at the scripts on their phones. They can barely form coherent sentences when asked to answer a question on the spot. Team reports are so often atrociously written, many written in the students’ own languages and then translated into English, with a ton of grammatical errors. Some reports are so clearly written by ChatGPT, covering up the lack of substance using flowery language. It makes me wonder how some of the admitted students passed the interviews. Maybe Rotman simply admitted them so the school can charge the exorbitant international student fees.

There’s a general lack of critical thinking among many students. When it comes to idea initiation, whether it be a group project or just an in class discussions, people seem clueless. The admission process puts so much emphasis on good grades and a strong stats/math background, whilst ignoring key skills required to succeed in the program such as good communications, taking initiatives, and being responsible.

Of course that’s not to say that there are no competent people in the program, but they are rare and scattered among different groups, likely not achieving their full potential because they’re too busy fixing what should’ve been expected as the bare minimum from other students.

Now onto the good parts about the program. Courses are challenging and engaging. Professors and staff are nice and welcoming. You do get access to the wider Rotman network and therefore good industry connections. Lots of MBA focused jobs are also open to MMA students if you’re interested. But in my honest opinion the good is far far away from outweighing the bad.",User_deleted,2,neutral,0

I tested this last semester (I did part summaries, part timed quizzes, part in-class presentations). The in-class presentations took much time. The quizzes they did horrible on and it tanked their grades. Even though it was open-note. So was this a sign they really, really were not reading or just bad at quizzes? Even when students got horrible grades they would not improve on the next quiz. I would craft questions that were nearly impossible to ctrl+f because they were \*applying\* a concept they needed to understand. Questions were a mix of multiple choice, true-false, fill in blank, brief explanations. I am seriously considering going back to them given ChatGPT usage AND to save me time, but I also worry the students will have backlash against them (and that backlash will negatively impact my course evals). Any advice?

Building a Smart University Course Finder: My Journey with RAG Technology, All AI, All Local, Verba, Ollama, Llama3

Have you ever wished for a smart assistant that could help you find the perfect university courses? Well, that’s exactly what I set out to create! In this article, I’ll walk you through how I built a ‘Course Finder’ using something called RAG. Don’t worry if you’re not aware — we’ll go over every detail and Build.

# What is RAG?

RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation. It’s a fancy way of saying “smart search and answer.” Imagine you have a huge library of books. RAG is like having a super-smart librarian who not only finds the right books for you but also reads them and gives you a summary in everyday language.

https://preview.redd.it/ut5a2sijchqd1.png?width=1172&format=png&auto=webp&s=21237954ffb1241f0e8072fda0cf7c19372fd29e

# Why Use RAG?

You might be thinking, “Why not just use ChatGPT or another AI chat system?” While these are great for many things, they have some problems:

1. They sometimes make up false information if they don’t know the answer.
2. Their information can be outdated.
3. You don’t know where their answers come from.
4. They don’t know your custom dataset
5. It’s not private

RAG solves these problems by only using the information you give it. It’s like having a personal assistant who only knows about the things you’ve told them about.

# What is this article about?

This article is about how I made a special tool called a University Course Finder. It’s like a smart assistant that helps students find the right university courses. I built it using something called RAG, which stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation. It’s a clever way to search for information and give answers in normal, everyday language.

In this article, I explain how I set up the Course Finder step by step. I talk about the tools I used, like Verba and Weaviate, and why I chose them. I also share why this kind of tool is better than just using a regular AI chat system for finding course information.

# Why Read It?

If you’re interested in how AI can help with everyday tasks, this article is for you. It shows how we can use new technology to solve real problems, like helping students choose the right courses. You don’t need to be a tech expert to understand it — I explain everything in simple terms.

Reading this might inspire you to think about other ways AI could help in education or other areas. It’s also a good introduction to RAG technology, which is becoming more important in how we use AI to find and understand information.

I've been teaching for about two years now, mostly to levels up to B1. This year, a former class of adults, with whom I already covered most of the basics of grammar, has showed up again. We've already covered topics such as modal verbs, the present perfect, conditionals, several phrasal verbs, and more. I can see they are somewhat able to express their opinions on topics, although with some difficulty. At the same time, I feel like rehashing the same topics at this point would be a disservice to them.

I've always been a fan of Anki to improve studying efficiency and, as I myself have started using chatGPT from time to time to quickly generate sentences that I would then propose to students for some exercises. Since the new term is starting, I have been thinking of saying to them directly: ""Look, as my goal is to help you become more independent, and given that we live in 2024, you should really know that you can use this tool to generate sentences that you can incorporate into your study routine.""

Most of these students do not aim for certificates and are here simply to ""improve."" However, I wonder how much more I can do for them, given that they are at a level where, with a bit of effort, they could manage their own studies. As I see it now, my role with them would be to: (1) correct their mistakes during activities; and (2) find topics and original material (videos, articles exc.) that can prompt engaging conversations and encourage them to speak. To be honest, I see myself as little more than a conversation partner or master of cerimonies now. Ultimately, I fear that I feel like my role isn't really that relevant at this stage anymore and I don't know what to do about it.

I'm aware that this question possibly stems from these somewhat self-defeating beliefs, and I know that this would make for a completely different discussion. Regardless of what angle you'll want to take, I'd appreciate any feedback from colleagues.

This powerful language processing tool has the potential to revolutionize productivity by automating tasks, aiding in decision-making, and offering innovative solutions.

One of the most affected sectors is customer service. ChatGPT enables businesses to provide instantaneous, round-the-clock support through chatbots, reducing wait times and freeing human agents for more complex queries. This not only improves customer experience but also streamlines operations and cuts costs.

In content creation and marketing, ChatGPT’s ability to generate written material quickly can significantly increase output without compromising on quality. Marketers can generate ad copies, articles, and social media content more efficiently, allowing them to focus on strategy and creativity.

Furthermore, the tech and developer communities greatly benefit from ChatGPT's ability to understand and produce code. This capability can accelerate the development process, debugging, and even serve as an educational tool for learning new programming languages or frameworks.

Education also stands to gain immensely, as ChatGPT can tailor learning materials to individual needs, answer student inquiries, and provide explanations for complex concepts, essentially offering a personalized tutoring experience.

Financial services are harnessing ChatGPT to interpret market data, write reports, and manage customer inquiries, thereby improving the speed and quality of service.

However, while the impact of ChatGPT is profound, it's essential to discuss how we address potential challenges such as job displacement and maintaining data privacy. Let's delve into the conversation about different sectors, their transformation with ChatGPT, and potential approaches to integrating this technology ethically and effectively. What are your thoughts or experiences with ChatGPT in your industry? How do you see it shaping the future of work and productivity?",active,1,positive,0

I'm a professional translator. The performance of ChatGPT o-1 impressed me on every fronts but transaltion and creative writing. And I discovered the similar sentiment from other professionals. This is my understanding of the reason behind it:

The nature of the task is different.

Reasoning and STEM Problems has clear right or wrong (objective) answers, making it easier to define rewards and penalties in RL. It can benefit from the feedback loop. Also RL can simulate practice by repeatedly exposing the model to varied problems and allowing it to adjust based on outcomes, mimicking how students learn STEM subjects.

While translation and creative writing tasks are much more subjective. Different readers might prefer different styles. Creative writing and translation not only require grammatical correctness but also the conveyance of style, tone, and cultural nuances. And these tasks can have multiple equally valid outputs for the same input, that’s why supervised learning still predominant training(for specifically solving this kind of tasks). It usually relies on large datasets of human-generated content, where models learn to predict the most likely continuation of text based on the examples given, rather than through interactive feedback.

I know some students have IEPs that say they should always be given class notes, and class notes are generally just a nice thing to have, so I thought I'd share this workflow I came up with!

If you have Microsoft OneNote (through an Office subscription), if you click on the Home bar on the top menu bar, then the three dots on the right to see extra hidden options, all the way at the bottom is a Transcribe feature. And it works really well! Not perfectly, but surprisingly well, and best of all, as far as I can see, you can automatically speech-to-text an unlimited amount of audio per month? All you need to do is remember to hit Transcribe to start at the beginning and end (to stop) of each class period.

  
You can then click ""Add to Page - Text with Speakers"" to copy/paste the full transcription into a OneNote page. (I generally just make a new page for each class labeled like P1 09.23.2024, P2 09.23.2024, etc.)

  
FINALLY, copy and paste all of that into ChatGPT with the following instructions at the front! Just copy/paste this, then copy/paste the transcript text:

""The input you receive will be the outputs of a relatively, but not perfectly, accurate speech to text transcription software from a classroom environment with a teacher or teachers, and multiple student speakers.



You will do your best to account in the text you receive for the types of grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, dropped punctuation marks and quotation marks, and skipped words common in speech to text transcription outputs.  



Having done this, based on the class transcript you are provided, you will please:

1. Provide a brief summary of the main points (2-3 sentences)

2. Break down the content into 3-5 main topics

3. List 5-10 key terms or concepts

4. Generate 3 review questions



Transcript:

Format the output as follows:

Summary:

\[Your summary here\]



Main Topics:

1. \[Topic 1\]

2. \[Topic 2\]

...



Key Terms and Concepts:

- \[Term 1\]

- \[Term 2\]

...



Review Questions:

1. \[Question 1\]

2. \[Question 2\]

3. \[Question 3\]

""""""""

OR, if you want (and especially if you have ChatGPT pro, as the length of a full transcript of a 45 minute class generally seems to be too much for a free chatgpt account), you can try using this link I made up:

[https://chatgpt.com/g/g-YdG002zeX-transcript-summarizer-and-instant-class-notes-gpt](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-YdG002zeX-transcript-summarizer-and-instant-class-notes-gpt)

If that link or your free ChatGPT account both don't work because the transcript is too long, if you sign up for [Claude.ai](http://Claude.ai), and use the exact same prompt + copy/paste of the transcript, that SHOULD work, even with a free version!!!

1fnqm2s,1,2024-09-23,AI Tool Combinations Training,u/Difficult-Hand-4654,Business_Ideas,https://www.reddit.com/r/Business_Ideas/comments/1fnqm2s/ai_tool_combinations_training/,"I provide specialized education on AI tools tailored to professions. As I have been following almost all the latest tools for two years, I am familiar with AI tool combinations for various industries. I believe that AI doesn't need to take away anyone's job. I argue that those who can use AI tools aligned with their profession or in an alternative field can increase their performance and/or income. For example, I find the complaint of a graphic designer saying 'AI is doing what I do, so I am no longer needed or won’t be needed' to be illogical. I try to show that this graphic designer friend can multiply their salary by using these tools. 

To give some examples: 

For architects: I take your simple, 2D floor plan and use an AI tool to turn it into a 3D model. Then, I take that output and use another AI tool to work on textures or the exterior. Alternatively, I generate an output from an AI tool that can do isometric drawings, pass it through the stages I just mentioned, and deliver the design. I am not an architect; my university education is in Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation.

 For YouTubers: I generate a script via ChatGPT, source visuals from other AI tools in line with the script, and if needed, I add simple animations using another tool. I convert the script into a voice-over using yet another AI tool. I then combine the visuals, animations, and voice-over in Premiere Pro. I can deliver either short videos or longer ones like documentaries. 

For painters: I teach you how to get the best reference images from which tool. I ensure you master the correct prompt-writing techniques for color harmony, character positioning, and drawing techniques.

 For B2B companies: I use a different AI tool to scrape data from Google Maps, allowing you to reach potential customers and B2B contacts. I provide you with updated email addresses, phone numbers, contact names, and LinkedIn profiles in Excel format. 

For Etsy stores: I start by generating the first design via AI tools. For example, you might be a seller of wooden clocks. I create new wooden clock designs through AI. I then vectorize these designs in a way that you can produce them, making them suitable for laser cutting or printing. I prepare mockups using other AI tools. Or you may only sell t-shirts. The most common use of AI is for creating designs on t-shirts and sweatshirts. I get a new design from an AI tool, vectorize it, and deliver it. I can also prepare emoji sets, illustrate children’s books, or ensure character continuity. What I personally enjoy doing the most is illustrating children’s books and working on projects with character continuity.

 If you want to improve yourself or customize AI tools for your job in any area, I can conduct a quick research to find suitable AI tools and teach you how to use them. Whether you're thinking about if AI could be adapted to your sector or facing challenges in your industry, I can teach you how to combine multiple tools to create a final product or directly deliver the final product if you prefer. 

Currently, I offer face-to-face training in the city where I live. Last year, I gave a conference to an Artificial Intelligence Engineering club at a university, themed 'Earning Money with AI Tools.' Next month, I’ll return to that university to conduct a workshop on creating digital products. 

Since I use a different method for each student and/or sector in my trainings, I prepare a new curriculum each time. I’m not entirely sure if the right term is 'curriculum,' maybe 'lesson plan' could also work. After we get in touch, I prepare the appropriate combination of tools and provide detailed training on how to use each tool in that combination. 

Question one: Should I evolve this into a training center or a website selling training packages? Or should I open an Instagram account and provide trainings there, such as through Zoom meetings? Should I turn it into a start-up and seek crowdfunding to transform this into a training app? I want to make this a full-time job, but I’m unsure how to start and proceed. 

Question two: Do you have any suggestions for a profession where I could adapt AI tool combinations? I am open to any ideas and feedback.

1fo366c,1,2024-09-23,Can Paraphrasing Tools Generate Undetectable AI Content?,u/gptgabe,stealthgpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stealthgpt/comments/1fo366c/can_paraphrasing_tools_generate_undetectable_ai/,"read on the site: [https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/can-paraphrasing-tools-generate-undetectable-ai-content](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/can-paraphrasing-tools-generate-undetectable-ai-content)

Paraphrasing is a smart writing technique employed by students, writers, and content creators for different purposes. Whether it is maintaining uniqueness, readability, or clarity, rephrasing helps to improve content quality in many ways.

However, manual rephrasing is not everyone’s cup of tea. It requires the ability to present the same thing differently without sacrificing the original meaning. For those who lack the art of paraphrasing, advanced paraphrasers have been developed.

These tools utilize the power of sophisticated AI algorithms to rephrase sentences of existing content. However, since these tools are backed by artificial intelligence, it raises the question in many people’s minds whether the content they rephrase contains AI traces or not.

Since both academic institutions and search engines highly prohibit machine-generated content, writers and learners remain worried about whether their paraphrased content will pass & avoid AI content detection. If you are also confused about this matter, there is nothing to worry about.

In this article, we will thoroughly explain how AI is ai detected in writing & whether paraphrasing tools are capable of creating undetectable AI content. So, without further ado, let’s get started.



# How Paraphrasing Tools Generate Human-Like Content?

Paraphrasers can contribute in different ways to generate content that depicts human writing. Here are some of their most prominent contributions.



# Performing Significant Word Replacements

One of the main techniques paraphrasing tools use to create content that closely resembles human writing is improving word choice. Sometimes, existing text may have some words or phrases that might indicate the involvement of AI. For example, words such as elevate, leverage, delve, and seamless may be flagged as AI-written as they are mostly used by AI writing tools.

Paraphrasers offer the most relevant alternatives to such words commonly used by human writers. By introducing natural vocabulary in the text, a proficient rephrasing tool makes the content more natural and easily readable for everyone. It helps you enrich your text with simple language that reflects the essence of human writing.



# Restructuring Sentences

An advanced paraphraser doesn’t rely on just word replacements to generate human-like content. Rather, it performs significant sentence enhancements to make the text appear written by a professional writer. For this purpose, it first analyzes the context of each sentence and then finds areas for improvement.

While performing sentence changes, it mainly focuses on simplifying the complex parts to make the information easily accessible. It varies the sentence length and incorporates simple structures just as human writers do. By breaking complicated sentences, it presents the same information in two or three easily understandable lines. It may merge short sentences to convey the idea effectively where needed.



# Eliminating Redundancy

Sometimes, you inadvertently write the same words or ideas many times in the content. This creates redundancy in the text, which is mostly seen in AI content. In cases of excessive repetition, your content may be classified as machine-generated in AI detection in your content. However, if you rephrase sentences using an efficient paraphraser, this risk can be mitigated easily.

A paraphrasing tool offers a variety of options for redundant words and ideas. It can provide you with the most relevant phrases that you can use instead of repeating a word. Similarly, it can help you present the same idea uniquely in different sections of content by making notable enhancements in sentence structures.



# Adjusting Tone



Another way paraphrasers contribute to generating human-like content is by helping with the adjuting tone. It allows you to set the writing style in such a way that it aligns with the intended readers. Using it, you can make the tone of the entire content more conversational, which AI content often lacks.

Before eliminating tone inaccuracies, a diverse paraphraser performs an in-depth contextual analysis of content. After that, it aligns the words and sentence style in such a way that fits the required tone. The best thing about paraphrsers is that they don’t deviate from a particular writing style throughout the content.

# Best Paraphrasers To Create Undetectable AI Content

The question remains the same here how to avoid ai detection. Remember, not all paraphrasing tools are created equally. They have significant differences in their capabilities. Here are some of the most powerful paraphrasers that can help you create undetectable AI content.



# [**Paraphraser.io**](http://Paraphraser.io)

When it comes to creating content that sounds human-written, [Paraphraser.io](http://Paraphraser.io) could prove incredibly helpful to pass ai detection. This AI-driven paraphraser goes beyond generic enhancements. It performs a deep examination of the text and reformulates sentences in such a way that every line possesses the essence of human writing. Use this [paraphrase online](https://www.paraphraser.io/) to make significant alterations in word choice, sentence structure, and tone and make the content appear to be crafted by a seasoned writer.



# QuillBot

QuillBot is another advanced paraphrasing tool that can be your companion in content that can pass & avoid AI content detection. It exploits the potential of smart algorithms to scan the input text efficiently. Then, by using a diverse vocabulary and restructuring the sentences wisely, it makes the text appear human-like. As a result, your content doesn’t get flagged as machine-generated by any AI content detector or search engine.



# [**Rephrase.Info**](http://Rephrase.Info)

[Rephrase.Info](http://Rephrase.Info) is also a gem on the internet that lets you reshape existing content in a natural way. It could be best for content creators who need human-written content to upload on their websites so that they can avoid search engine penalties. However, it is not limited to rephrasing just web content. From academic assignments to proposals and emails, you can paraphrase any type of content using this tool.

# To Sum Up

To put it concisely, the content rephrased through a cutting-edge paraphrasing tool is undetectable by chatgpt detector & other AI content detectors. This is because these tools prioritize making the text human-friendly. Above, we have thoroughly explained the role of paraphrasers in generating content that resembles human writing. After going through this article, we hope that now it is clear to you that the content generated through these tools cannot be flagged as AI content.",active,3,neutral,0
1fo4fo6,2,2024-09-24,AI EdTech based on communication,u/TheEntrep,Business_Ideas,https://www.reddit.com/r/Business_Ideas/comments/1fo4fo6/ai_edtech_based_on_communication/,"Need help finding gaps in this idea.

**TL;DR** After using ChatGPT as a conversational learning companion, I've improved my understanding and raised my GPA from 3.5 to 3.87, recognizing the value of AI in supporting personalized learning strategies. Observing that most educational AI platforms focus on automating teaching tasks rather than understanding students individually, I've identified a significant gap in the market. To address this, I'm proposing an AI platform that enhances teacher-student relationships by offering personalized insights into each student's thinking, behavior, and learning preferences—integrating seamlessly with teachers' lesson plans and facilitating continuous two-way communication. This solution not only promotes authentic learning and reduces cheating but also empowers teachers to tailor their approach, enriching the overall educational experience.

* **Holistic Understanding of Students**
* **Teacher Empowerment**
* **Real-Time Adaptability**
* **Ethical Learning Environment**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Background**

Ever since ChatGPT came into existence, I've used it constantly for my college classes. I view AI as a supplement rather than just an answer generator, using it to help explain complex topics and address my behavioral needs of my learning strategies. Interestingly, I treat it a bit like a human and enjoy conversing with it about school subjects. This conversation has helped me to understand how I think about learning a subject then cultivating GPT to teach me in that manner. With this role change I have seen my grades go from a cumulative 3.5 to a 3.87.

Given the current landscape of the educational AI market, I've examined several key factors across existing platforms: key features, sub-features, target markets, the teacher's role (whether supplemental or as a replacement), communication channels between teachers and students, dashboard functionalities, and the level of teacher involvement. What I've noticed is that most AI platforms tend to focus on automating teaching functions—like generating lesson plans, guiding students through logical thought processes, and being heavily subject-oriented—rather than serving as tools to deeply understand the student as an individual and how the unique teacher fits into the student's life.

For example, platforms like **Carnegie Learning's AI solutions**, such as MATHia®, offer adaptive learning experiences and provide teachers with data on student performance. These tools are excellent at delivering personalized content and helping students master subject matter. However, they often focus on academic metrics and may not fully address the need for capturing a student's unique thought processes, behavioral patterns, or how they interact with their teachers on a personal level.

This suggests that while current AI platforms are valuable for enhancing educational outcomes, there is a significant opportunity for tools that prioritize understanding the student holistically. There's a pressing need for AI platforms that not only assist with educational content but also enhance the teacher's ability to understand and connect with each student individually, supporting the teacher's role in guiding the student's educational journey.

**Solution**

**Introducing an AI Platform That Enhances Teacher-Student Relationships**

In the evolving landscape of education technology, many AI platforms focus on automating tasks like generating lesson plans or providing direct answers to students. While these tools have their merits, they often overlook the importance of understanding each student's unique thought processes and how teachers can best support them. Recognizing this gap, I am proposing an AI platform that teams up with teachers to offer personalized insights into each student's thinking, behavior, and learning preferences—without replacing traditional classroom methods.

**Engaging Students Through Behavioral Communication**

This platform engages students through behavioral communication, helping them process their thoughts rather than just providing solutions or formatting lesson plans. By interacting with the AI in a conversational manner, students are encouraged to articulate their understanding and work through challenges, fostering critical thinking and self-reflection. This approach positions the AI as a supportive companion in their learning journey, not just a tool for answers.

**Seamless Integration with Teacher's Own Lesson Plans**

Teachers can seamlessly integrate their own lesson plans into the platform. The AI analyzes these plans alongside individual student profiles, offering advice on where each student might struggle and suggesting personalized strategies to help them using the current lesson material. This ensures that instruction is tailored to meet each student's needs while still aligning with the teacher's curriculum and teaching style.

**Facilitating Continuous Two-Way Communication**

By keeping the conversation flowing between students and teachers, the platform helps educators tweak lesson plans based on real-time feedback while still meeting state learning requirements. Teachers receive immediate insights into how students are interacting with the material, allowing for timely interventions and adjustments. This dynamic exchange enhances the learning experience and promotes a more responsive educational environment.

**Dynamic Insights Through an Intuitive Dashboard**

With an easy-to-use dashboard, teachers gain access to dynamic insights and behavior assessments that go beyond traditional performance metrics. The platform provides a holistic view of each student's progress, engagement levels, and areas where they may need additional support. This empowers teachers to make informed decisions and tailor their approach to better support each student's learning journey.

**Reducing Cheating by Promoting Authentic Learning**

The platform cuts down on cheating by reinforcing that the AI is a tool meant for communication and thought processing rather than searching for answers. By positioning the AI as a learning companion, students are less inclined to misuse it for shortcuts and more likely to engage authentically with the material. This cultivates an environment of trust and integrity in the learning process. Let's face it students are going to use AI now.

**Addressing a Critical Gap in Educational AI**

Unlike many existing AI platforms that act as replacements for certain teaching functions, this solution is designed to enhance and support the teacher's role in the student's life. It focuses on understanding the student as an individual and strengthening the unique relationship between teacher and student. This approach fills a significant gap in the current market, where personalization often centers on content delivery rather than fostering meaningful connections.

**Why This Solution Matters**

By addressing the limitations of current AI educational tools, this platform offers a transformative approach that benefits both teachers and students. It empowers educators with deeper insights, supports students in processing their thoughts, and maintains the integrity of traditional teaching methods. This not only improves educational outcomes but also enriches the overall learning experience.",User_deleted,2,neutral,0

StealthGPT knows essays. We know what academics love to read. If you want to write powerful, persuasive, academic essays then this guide will give you the 7 keys to unlocking your best writing.

So, what are the qualities that make a good essay? It’s not a collection of qualities ranging from the basics, like syntax, diction, grammar, style, and formatting to deeper considerations like persuasiveness, the hook, argument building, and more.

Throughout this guide, I’ll show you what StealthGPT generated using its Stealth Writer tool as a sample.

# Key 1: Five Basic Concepts

I know it’s a little misleading, telling you one tip is understanding five concepts, but I’m going to make this quick. There are five basics you need to take into account when starting your essay and I don’t need to write a whole essay to explain each of these. They are:

* **Form**: The logical order of your essay. Make sure your essay flows from introduction to body paragraphs to conclusion which tightly wraps up your essay with a bow.
* **Writing Style**: Don’t be boring. Good writing expresses a persona that highlights writing skulls including vocabulary, rhythm, artfulness and fluency of English.
* **Conventions**: Punctuation, sentence structure, and grammar. If your essay is lacking in these basic conventions, it doesn’t matter how much style and credibility you’ve injected into your essay, readers won’t take it seriously. Ensuring you stick to conventions is as simple as proofreading.
* **Supporting Documents and References**: Academic writing always considers your resources and citations. You want to demonstrate proof of intensive research with references and quotations with proper citation to whatever format you’re using be it MLA, APA, or Chicago.
* **Topic**: Know your topic or essay question. Know the argument you’re making on behalf of that topic. Know the resources that will help you build that argument. Don’t come into an essay unprepared. All these things need to be known to you well before you start. Brainstorming is a serious step in the essay writing process that you will need to do before diving into your first draft if you want to write an effective essay.

You will find all these conventions present in Stealth Writer’s essay:

Perfect punctuation and grammar. No spelling mistakes and even a personalized writing style and word count requirement if you ask nicely.

# Key 2: A Strong Thesis

The thesis statement is the most important element of any essay. It is the main point or claim of your essay. Usually, a thesis appears at the end of the essay’s introductory paragraph with each body paragraph logically building upon your argument to support that thesis afterward.

A good thesis is arguable, not description of a subjective reality. The point of your thesis and essay at large should be that the read may be able to argue with the point of your thesis until you persuade them with the argument you present and support in each following paragraph.

Before choosing a thesis, you should consider if it’s so obvious that people wouldn’t argue against it or if it’s so simple it wouldn’t require an entire essay to argue.

Unlike each of those previous five conventions, I could write an entire essay about what makes a good thesis. Here's a [Harvard article about writing a thesis](https://writingcenter.fas.harvard.edu/thesis) that I found helpful.

# Key 3: The Hook

An essay’s introduction is more than just the piece of writing where you place your thesis, it’s the essential lure you’re gonna use to seduce readers to start and finish your essay. You need to learn how to hook your readers by baiting them into reader further. This includes not revealing everything right away, build upon a mystery by choosing language that leads the reader one breadcrumb at a time.

Your introduction shouldn’t just include a thesis but sentences that hook your readers by giving them unexplored lines of inquiry toward your thesis that absorb them into your writing.

[Writing a hook](https://www.collegeessayguy.com/blog/write-good-hook-for-essay) can be difficult but thankfully, the College Essay Guy has you covered too.

# Key 4: Building an Argument

Separate your argument into points. Any element of your argument a reader may dispute should be a separate body paragraph for you to persuade them.

Each point of your argument will require a body paragraph following your thesis. Each body paragraph will require a topic sentence. Topic sentences need to present an argument linked to the central idea in our thesis that you build upon in the rest of the paragraph.

Now once you’ve made your argument, you need to provide relevant evidence. This is where you use proper citations without plagiarism to convince your reader. Evidence isn’t all you’ll need though, once presenting them with citations, you will need to analyze what you’ve cited to appeal to your point. In other words, tell us how the evidence supports the topic sentence of your paragraph.

Using Stealth Writer’s new In-text citations feature, you can input as many quotes as you need and it will automatically write them out in whatever format you require. Here’s how we put it to use in our essay:

As you can see, any quote can be linked back to its citation which you can either input manually or automatically using this feature.

# Key 5: Transitions

You essay writing skills alone aren’t enough to lead your reader through an essay. Great essays need to leverage content and information to transition from one paragraph to the next or one sentence to the next.

An important method to utilize when transitioning to a new idea is to jump off introducing that new idea by relating it to an old idea you’ve already mentioned previously. You can compare or contrast the new idea to the previously mentioned one. You can agree or disagree with the old idea using the new idea. You can show cause and effect relating the old to the new idea, or you can explain the old idea using the new idea.

Simply presenting new information to the reader without giving them a base of familiarity is off putting and often too complicated to follow for readers.

# Key 6: Counter Arguments

Because you’ve chosen a thesis that is arguable and you’re trying to persuade readers to your position, there is no better method of getting them onboard with you than first acknowledging then debunking and dismantling the counter arguments to your point.

Always be considering counterarguments to conclusions you’ve drawn from evidence, assumptions you’ve made, evidence you haven’t presented, and an alternative interpretation of your evidence. Because readers will always be thinking of different counterarguments to your points as they read, you shouldn’t just be adding them into your work once you’ve completed writing your essay and building your argument.

Writing a counterargument needs to dispel any standing it has in your readers mind. First, you have to present the counter argument. Then you have to counter that argument and explain why either the counterargument is flawed or too weak to undermine your argument. Be mindful of how you present a counter argument, saying things like “nevertheless my argument still stands” diminishes the credibility of your counter.

# Key 7: Conclusion

Each discipline has different standards for what makes a good conclusion but in any case, what makes a bad conclusion is just a simple summary of what you’ve already stated throughout the essay. What you want to do in a conclusion is address two aspects to an argument the “so what” and the “now what”.

Address the “so what” by setting the stakes that depend on your arguments persuasiveness. Then leaver your readers with the “now what” by addressing how they can now see the issue in a new light after your argument, what questions can be raised following the research and argument constructed that couldn’t have been made at the beginning of the essay, what larger context is your argument a part of, or what actions can be taken in light of your argument.

That’s how you tie your essay up into a perfect bow, instead of just summarizing the previous sections.

# Conclusion (of this guide, not your essay)

Implementing these tips into your next high school or college essay will have your professor thinking you’re a better writer. Whether you use an AI writing tool or just good old fashioned research and writing to make that essay, these seven keys will improve your output.

# FAQ

# Is Using Generative AI Plagiarism?

Traditional plagiarism is stealing someone else’s words or ideas then not providing proper credit or crediting yourself. Because generative AI generates original content, you are not stealing anyone’s words or ideas when using it. However, academic institutions still consider the use of AI as a ghost writer for academic writing as academic misconduct under the pretense of “AI plagiarism”. You can learn more about the [ethics of AI in academia](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/is-using-chatgpt-plagiarism-academic-dishonesty-in-dishonest-academia) from our blog post.

# Who Uses Generative AI?

A report suggests that half of students are using generative AI for school work now but the software isn’t limited to academia. Professionals use AI writing tools for SEO, blogging, and social media just like students use it for essays and assignments. Funnily enough, faculty use it as well for a variety of tasks from creating curricula to syllabi.

# What Is Undetectable AI?

Because AI detectors have been implemented by most universities, undetectable AI software like StealthGPT was created so you can generate human-like writing using AI. Previous to this, Chatbots generated text that was a dead giveaway as far as its authorship went, now by duplicating the trends of human writing like the complexity and randomness of word choice, sentence structure, and sentence length, undetectable AI tools can generate text that is indecipherable from human text to both AI detectors and professors alike.

1foxlta,49,2024-09-25,Long Time Lurker - All the 'Chance Me/Pick Me Uni/Which Uni is better' is often pointless,u/LonelyMC,Indians_StudyAbroad,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indians_StudyAbroad/comments/1foxlta/long_time_lurker_all_the_chance_mepick_me/,"*A bit of a long post, I apologize for that*  
  
Hello everyone, I am also from India, applying for Fall 2025 intake. I have been a long time lurker in this subreddit since summer 2025 as I wanted to know what others would be applying to. Not to demotivate/degrade anyone, but most of the posts here are basically:  
1. Here is my profile, please chance my acceptance rates.  
2. I want to study X, please give me a list of universities to apply.  
3. I am applying to A,B,C,D universities, which one is better?

I would just like to point out why these questions often amount to nothing:  
  
1 -> Acceptance rates are often dependent upon multitude of factors, not just your profile, which entirely depends on the graduate admissions committee of the particular year of the particular department (how many students they can support). In 2024 they might have taken in a cohort of 25 students, but maybe if 2-3 professors went on sabbatical, they might be willing to only take in a cohort of 20 students. Another important factor is the students you are competing with. Maybe your profile would have got you in easily in the 2024 cycle, but if suddenly 10 Edward Wittens and  5 Claude Shannons are applying for the 2025 cycle, then you are out of luck.

2 -> No, you must do this yourself. This question is the most irritable out of the 3 I have listed. Please, do your own research. It takes time. I have been making university lists since June this year, reading in-depth about every program on the program page, list of professors, courses offered, research done in that department, places where students go after the end of their degree. You need to be **independent.** 

3 -> Many factors play into this, its often super hard to judge. Rankings are often all over the place. QS ranks MIT 1st, THE ranks MIT 3rd, while US rankings put MIT at 2nd. The ranking gets messier for lesser know unis. Ideally, just apply broadly, then leave the choice to the future you when you have multiple acceptances.

  
What you should ideally do:

1. Do individual research on programs. Start by deeply introspecting yourself on why do you want to study further? What do you want to study further? Your short term and long term expectations. Why this specific X and Y university. What do they offer that others dont?
2. People applying to MS programs must understand that they will have a research component. Research fit is really necessary. What is research fit? How well is the match between area you want to study and work and what the department provides. The fit goes both ways. Say you wish to work in deep reinforcement learning, but the department works on computer arch and optimization theory, then there is no fit. They will reject you even if you had a stellar profile.
3. Do NOT depend on ANY consultancy. Probably going to re-iterate and repeat some of my points I have said above, but do not go to any consultancy. Do your own research, apply yourself. Independence is a trait needed to survive, you must know how to collect information. You are your individual self, show it through the apps, in SOP.
4. Understanding different countries have different requirements. US is quite different from Europe. Why select US over Germany? Or vice-versa? Do you have the answer for this question? What will you do after the degree?
5. Individually tailor SOP. Please don't copy paste a template with your name changed. Please don't be generic. It should be good enough that they should be fighting with other universities to take you in. 
6. Be streamlined through the whole process. Don't rush things.
7. A word of warning. Look out for universities which are degree mills. I won't drop any names, but their degrees might not be worth all the effort, money you put in. These are easy to get into, but beware.

I know I this is very long, but thank you if you got till here. These are my individual observations I have made over months of research. If you have any questions, I will be happy to answer. Hope this post helps!

It might be hard to keep timelines, but I think there are interesting dates to keep in mind.

Initial release of chatGPT was in November 2022. It was at around elementary or middle school level.

Release of gpt-4 was in march 2023. It was at level of freshmen high school.

Release of o1 was in September 2024. It is at a level of college grad or college junior. 

Now, if you were a junior highschool in 2023, now as a sophomore you have access to college level intelligence. If you were a college junior, when gpt-4 released, now you have access to one or two grades above you. 

If you were in elementary school, by the time you will take exams to highschool, there is likely going to be PHD level intelligence access in your phone.

If you just entered college, it will take you 6 or 9 years to get your education, and it makes me think how much intelligence we will have in our phones by then.

Can people genuinely tell me what exactly kids are supposed to learn? Why is using chatGPT to solve your homework wrong?

ChatGPT's incorporation into educational platforms offers unique benefits, such as providing instant feedback, personalized learning experiences, and a vast repository of knowledge accessible through a conversational interface. For corporate training, this means employees can engage with the material at their own pace, solidifying knowledge retention and improving the overall effectiveness of training modules. It also promises to streamline complex training processes by breaking down intricate subjects into digestible conversations.

In academic settings, ChatGPT can serve as a virtual tutor, assisting students with homework, helping with research, and even practicing language learning. It has the potential to democratize education, offering support to students who may not have easy access to human tutors or additional resources. Moreover, ChatGPT can help educators create a more interactive curriculum by integrating AI into lesson plans and discussions.

However, while the promise of ChatGPT is great, there are considerations to be made regarding its efficacy. It's important to weigh the AI's current capabilities with the complexities of educational needs, and ensure that it aligns with learning objectives. Can it cater to different learning styles? How does it interact with subject matters that require nuanced understanding and critical thinking?

I'm curious to hear the community's thoughts on this. Have you had any direct experience with ChatGPT or similar AI technologies in a learning environment? What do you consider its strengths and limitations? Let's delve into the subject of ChatGPT's role in virtual education and its impacts on how we learn and teach in our fast-evolving world.",active,1,positive,0

1fpbtho,1,2024-09-25,Breaking Bad: The Sitcom,u/seantenk,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1fpbtho/breaking_bad_the_sitcom/,"So, I asked ChatGPT to generate “a sitcom about Breaking Bad in an alternative universe where Walter White never have cancer, and so he never becomes a drug lord.”

This is the outcome, and it just killed me: 

**Breaking Bad: The Sitcom**  
**Title**: *Breaking Good*  
**Genre**: Sitcom  
**Premise**: In this alternate universe, Walter White never gets cancer. Instead of turning to a life of crime, he focuses on his regular life as a high school chemistry teacher, trying to balance the everyday chaos of family life, a quirky school staff, and hilarious misunderstandings. Jesse Pinkman is still a former student who can’t quite figure out his own path, but rather than cooking meth, he's more interested in starting his own weird businesses. Hank Schrader is the loud but lovable brother-in-law who’s more of a nosy neighbor than a DEA agent with serious pursuits.

---

### **Main Cast**

- **Walter White**: A well-meaning, nerdy high school chemistry teacher with a knack for solving problems in over-the-top ways.
- **Skyler White**: A sharp-witted wife trying to manage the family finances and stay sane while dealing with Walter’s schemes and their son’s teen years.
- **Jesse Pinkman**: Walter's goofy, former student and neighbor, always full of terrible ideas for get-rich-quick schemes that never work.
- **Hank Schrader**: The boisterous, nosy brother-in-law who lives next door. Hank is constantly barging in, offering terrible advice, and generally making a mess of things.
- **Marie Schrader**: Skyler's sister, a well-meaning kleptomaniac who's always involved in everyone's business.
- **Saul Goodman**: A local attorney who has somehow become Walter's best friend. He's always coming up with ridiculous legal loopholes for even the most mundane issues.
- **Gus Fring**: Owner of the neighborhood Los Pollos Hermanos franchise, a respected businessman who’s a little too perfect. Walter can't help but suspect there's something ""off"" about him, though it’s just his extreme neatness.

---

### **Episode 1: ""Science Fair Fiasco""**

**Plot**:  
Walter is tasked with helping organize the high school science fair, and he's determined to make it the best in the state. He ropes Jesse into helping, convincing him to set up a harmless, over-the-top chemistry demonstration that *totally* won't explode. Meanwhile, Hank is determined to be the judge of the fair and uses his ""detective skills"" to figure out which kid might be ""cheating.""

**A Plot**:  
Walter and Jesse create a simple baking soda volcano, but Jesse, ever eager to impress, decides to add “a little something extra.” Hilarity ensues when the volcano erupts all over the gymnasium, causing the fire alarm to go off. The school's principal, Carmen Molina, is not amused and demands that Walter ""stop bringing his weird inventions"" to school events.

**B Plot**:  
Skyler is trying to plan a family vacation, but Marie keeps hijacking the plans with suggestions for destinations that are either way out of budget or entirely inappropriate (like a luxury cruise to Alaska). Hank, meanwhile, is sure that one of the kids at the science fair is running ""some kind of scam"" because their project is just too advanced for a high schooler. His “investigation” involves knocking over multiple projects and getting into a debate with a 14-year-old about magnets.

**Key Moments**:  
- Walter’s frustration builds as Jesse continually adds unnecessary elements to the project, including food coloring, Mentos, and even Pop Rocks.
- Hank dramatically sneaking around the science fair with a fake mustache, pretending to be undercover.
- The fire alarm scene, where Walter and Jesse frantically try to stop the ever-growing foam volcano, while Hank accidentally sets off another project—a homemade rocket that flies straight into Principal Molina’s office.
- Skyler finally snapping and announcing that the family vacation will be a camping trip, much to everyone’s horror.

**End Scene**:  
After the chaos dies down, Walter is banned from organizing future science fairs, but Jesse, ever the optimist, tells him, ""Yo, Mr. White, next year, I’ve got this idea for a *laser show*."" Walter just sighs and says, ""Let’s never do this again."" Hank, standing by with his clipboard, proudly declares that he’s figured out which kid was cheating, but it turns out he’s been ""investigating"" a teacher’s demonstration the entire time.

---

### **Episode 2: ""Neighbor Wars""**

**Plot**:  
Walter and Hank get into a neighborly feud when Hank builds a giant BBQ smoker in his backyard, which blows smoke into Walter’s house. Meanwhile, Jesse tries to start a dog-walking business, but his lack of basic canine skills creates chaos in the neighborhood.

**A Plot**:  
Hank's new BBQ obsession leads to all-day smoking sessions in his backyard. Walter, tired of his house smelling like brisket, tries to politely ask Hank to move the smoker, but Hank refuses. What starts as a simple disagreement escalates into an all-out prank war, with Walter using chemistry to get back at Hank. Walter fills Hank’s smoker with a harmless but highly pungent sulfur compound, causing Hank to believe he's ruined the entire BBQ.

**B Plot**:  
Jesse, trying to make quick cash, starts a dog-walking service but underestimates how hard it is to control a pack of dogs. At one point, he loses control of seven dogs, and they run rampant through the neighborhood, eventually ending up in Walter’s yard, trampling Skyler’s flower beds.

**Key Moments**:  
- Walter secretly tweaking Hank’s BBQ recipes, resulting in a chili that’s so spicy it sends Hank and his buddies running for the hose.
- Jesse walking the dogs and being dragged down the street like a cartoon character, yelling, ""Yo! Slow down!""
- Skyler, fed up with the petty feud, ends up taking the dogs away from Jesse, who sighs in relief and says, ""Thanks, Mrs. White, they were way more savage than I thought.""
- The BBQ climax where Hank and Walter attempt to one-up each other in a “BBQ-off,” but both are distracted by Jesse’s runaway dogs, who devour all the food.

**End Scene**:  
The episode ends with the Whites and the Schraders sitting together in the backyard, eating takeout from Los Pollos Hermanos while the dogs sit calmly nearby. Walter sighs and admits, ""Maybe we should leave the BBQing to professionals."" Hank, wiping sweat from his forehead, agrees, “But I still say my ribs would've won.""

---

### **Recurring Themes and Gags**  
- **Walter’s Over-the-Top Solutions**: Every time Walter tries to solve a minor problem (like unclogging a drain or organizing a school event), he overdoes it with some complex chemistry that ends up backfiring hilariously.
- **Jesse’s Failed Side Hustles**: Jesse is always coming up with new, terrible ideas for businesses, from dog-walking to organic smoothies to selling t-shirts with slogans like “Yeah, Science!” which no one ever buys.
- **Hank’s Over-the-Top Investigations**: Hank is always convinced there’s a criminal conspiracy afoot, even when the situation is completely mundane.
- **Marie’s Kleptomania**: Marie’s habit of stealing random, useless items leads to awkward but funny situations, like accidentally taking the neighbor’s garden gnome or sneaking silverware into her purse at family dinners.
- **Saul’s Wild Legal Advice**: Saul is always ready with some ridiculous legal loophole that’s both completely unnecessary and totally convoluted.

In *Breaking Good*, the stakes are low, the laughs are high, and no one’s life is ever in danger—except when Jesse gets involved with his next ridiculous idea.",User_deleted,0,neutral,0

1fq39ds,1,2024-09-26,Professor Catches Students Plagiarizing With AI,u/gptgabe,stealthgpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stealthgpt/comments/1fq39ds/professor_catches_students_plagiarizing_with_ai/,"Read: [https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/professor-catches-students-plagiarizing-with-ai](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/professor-catches-students-plagiarizing-with-ai)

In a situation so ironic and meta, it’s almost hard to believe, Megan Fritts, an assistant philosophy professor at the University of Arkansas, Little Rock, caught numerous students plagiarizing with AI on their first assignment for her Ethics and Technology class.

# AI Plagiarism in an Ethics and Technology Class

The assignment was simple: “Briefly introduce yourself and say what you're hoping to get out of this class”. The purpose of the assignment was two-fold: to learn about her students and to get them acquainted with Blackboard’s discussion board feature.

Having used ChatGPT to generate their essays, many of the students submitted similar outputs that instead of stating their desired expectations of the class, regurgitated descriptions of what an ethics and technology class is. Such personalized requests are often too complex for ChatGPT’s algorithm, so it comes as no surprise that Fritts was able to spot the watermarks of AI writing right away.

""When you're a professor, and you've read dozens and dozens of AI essays, you can just tell,"" Fritts responded when asked how she was able to detect the presence of AI.

The students, perpetuating their interest in understanding ethics and technology, did the right thing and immediately confessed to using AI to write their introductory essays.

""They all owned up to it, to their credit, but it was just really surprising to me that — what was supposed to be a kind of freebie in terms of assignments — even that they felt compelled to generate with an large language model.""

The casualness of students using AI to write an introductory essay speaks to two phenomenons: First, that students are using AI writing tools for school work at astounding rates.

Where it was reported that 86% of college students are using AI in their studies.

Second, that students don’t see the need to put effort into meaningless work. In the replies to Fritt’s now viral X post detailing her story, many of the replies argued that of course students would be using AI for assignments they deemed “busywork”, comparing the use of AI to write essays to using a calculator to solve math equations.

Fritts disputes this comparison, especially in the case of humanities assignments, which she feels are meant to shape people not dispense content.

""The goal is to create liberated minds — liberated people — and offloading the thinking onto a machine, by definition, doesn't achieve that,"" she said.

Although using the word “liberated” implies a political context or perhaps agenda, Fritts does touch upon the academic consensus that doing school work is essential to developing thinking ability. Whether by using generative AI or simply by harboring a technology addiction, our thinking ability from our decision making, critical thinking faculties, or even our attention spans, are compromised.

# Tech Solutions for Tech Problems

There are numerous instances of students facing severe consequences for using AI, but it's teachers who are suffering with the burden of finding new ways to make meaningful learning experiences that counteract AI usage.

Many are feeling helpless, with so many students using AI writing tools, whether undetectable or not, and with the outright [failure of AI detection tools](https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/teach/ai-detectors-dont-work/) to properly do their jobs, the future of academia seems dim to some.

Even Fritts herself acknowledges that the burden of curbing the AI plagiarism problem can’t be on the students. Instead, institutions are realizing there is no way out other than embracing AI in academia.

Higher Education institutions have been utilizing AI for a variety of tasks from AI detection software, to generative AI for curricula, syllabi, and homework.

Whatever faculties students don’t develop from doing old-fashioned school work, might be developed from learning AI literacy and applying the technology to complicated problems.

# The Future of AI in Academia

As detailed in this Forbes article [predicting AI trends in academia](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/08/29/three-predictions-for-how-ai-will-reshape-academia/), one should expect the institution to buckle against technological change by restructuring the way students take on their writing assignments. Many of these assignments will be done in class to curb AI cheating, from brainstorming to submission, students will write their essays in class.

Once the systems start implementing more customization and personalization, they will be able to shape learning experiences to each individual student in a classroom, so no student gets left behind.

# Should The Use of AI Tools be Considered Plagiarism?

Using AI-generated content isn’t traditional plagiarism. Plagiarism is the theft of someone else’s words or ideas without proper credit. Meanwhile, AI-generated text is always original. Catch students using artificial intelligence, they will be accused of academic dishonesty under the category of “AI plagiarism”.

So no, [using AI writing is not plagiarism](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/is-using-chatgpt-plagiarism-academic-dishonesty-in-dishonest-academia). You can go as far as calling these students cheaters, but that might not age well with the way things are going.

# AI Tools for Submission and Detection

Had Fritts’ students used undetectable AI writing tools, perhaps this story wouldn’t have ever been written. Unlike OpenAI’s ChatGPT or other AI chatbots, undetectable AI writing tools like StealthGPT don’t feature the watermarks of AI-generated text and instead replace them with a human writing style.

For instance, [StealthGPT bypasses AI detectors](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/bypassing-ai-detectors-stealthgpt) like Turnitin, GPTZero, [Originality.ai](http://Originality.ai), and more. These AI checkers usually have high false positive rates, like Turnitin which acknowledge a 4% false positive rate at the sentence level.

To understand why this happens so often, you need to understand what is an AI detector. An AI detector analyzes text for AI writing and that just means it tries to find word choice, sentence structure, and sentence length that are so simple and precise, they were probably written by an algorithm that optimizes for utility. It’s rather easy to find student writing that uses simple and precise language, which was the case when Stanford discovered [bias in AI detectors](https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/stanford-study-finds-ai-detection-tools-to-be-biased-against-international-students/#:~:text=Turnitin's%20tool%20was%20much%20more,by%20non%2Dnative%20English%20speakers.) against students that didn’t speak English as their first language.",active,1,neutral,0

From expanding introductory chapters in Hindi to developing questionnaires for research objectives—ChatGPT has saved me so much time and mental bandwidth.

One example: I was working on a proposal titled ‘Language Across the Curriculum’ and needed tools that could differentiate between language and non-language subject teachers. I simply outlined the objectives to ChatGPT, and it gave me creative, well-thought-out suggestions for developing the right tools.

The following is a summary of my experience and some tips I wish I had when I started! 

  
(sorry in advanced for all the typos and grammatical errors, this is meant to be informal, had enough formal writing with this degree lol)

https://preview.redd.it/x47cnfqkh8rd1.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&s=58713b67175068176d32bfde46fc646f732a7471

I started on April 1st 2024 and finished on September 26th (tomorrow is my birthday! perfect timing)

I am 19 (about to be 20 tomorrow) and I took a gap year from high school to figure out what I wanted to do. I felt kind of behind so I knew if I was going to get a degree I wanted to get it as fast as possible. I do not work full time, I had a food service job where I worked weekends totaling 16 hours a week. I put in on average 40 hours or more per week. I definitely procrastinated a LOT. The first month I only got 4 classes done, I didn't think 6 months was a realistic goal because I always read about people doing it in 6 months with transfer credits or with work experience. But after that first month something clicked in me and I became dedicated to finishing in 6 months. 

I was somewhat good at school, I graduated #8 in my class, I didn't do the college courses and honor classes towards the end of the school year because I thought college was a scam (only a scam if they take all your money and it takes 4 years or more lol). I just say this because I feel like some of the things I learned in school helped me get through most of the general education classes really quick, especially the science class we had in this course. 

The mindset I had while I did these courses was that the general education isn't really that important. I would try to get those done as fast as possible. I wouldn't even read the material if possible. But on the actual accounting classes like Intermediate Accounting 1, 2, and 3 I actually read the through the whole book and watched all the videos. The only classes where I didn't read the material was Auditing D215 and Accounting Information Systems D217. I used the notes that were available in the resources and also watched the Edpsira videos for those. Those two classes were finished in 1 day. I remember auditing took me exactly 10 hours to complete. I am just saying this because there is a HUGE amount of people saying these courses are extremely difficult and I think its a bit over exaggerated. I wouldn't say they were easy but definitely not extremely hard. Just wanted to say this, because I was really unmotivated to get through them after reading everyone's experience. 

Also read about some people saying the Business Law class (D216) was hard, but for that one you just have to watch the cohorts and thats it. The lady explains everything so well. 

OOOOOOOOO another life hack. ChatGPT. No this is not cheating, only dumb people use ChatGPT to cheat. This was the thing that helped me SOOOOOOOO MUCH. Basically if I didn't get a question right on the unit tests or PA I would screenshot it and ask ChatGPT why I got it wrong. If I still didn't understand I would keep going back and forth with it until I comprehended the topic. Its like talking to a professional that knows everything, beware though... sometimes it did not give me the right information. I'd say around 90% of the time the information it told me was correct. It helps to somewhat know what your are learning and being able to reference it from the text book to catch on to these mistakes. But the errors weren't major. I would just tell it that the test said the correct answer was this other answer choice and then it would correct itself. 

Um also I've seen people posting about perplexity being better than ChatGPT and I'm not sure about that. But I think the issue is I don't know how to use it. I pay for ChatGPT ($20 a month) so thats what I used. But today ChatGPT was down and I needed to study for my final OA D105 so I decided to give it a try since all WGU students get one year of the pro version of perplexity for free. I did not like it at all, but like I said i probably do not know how to use it. I couldn't find where I could have a conversation with the AI, it kept on referencing the first thing I brought up all the time idk. But if it works for you, use it!

The Performance Assessments were VERY EASY all the time! Its not that deep honestly, I was always so confused when mine got evaluated and I passed. Sometimes I felt like I didn't do to good of a job and it was going to be returned back to me but I always passed somehow. I think that they literally only care about the things listed on the rubric, which duh very obvious but idk. Just know its not that hard dont stress out. Do everything on the Rubric and you'll be fine. This is how I used chatGPT, I could copy and paste my essay and rubric and tell it to evaluate my essay based on the rubric provided. So yeah another little life hack for y'all. Oh and I HATE Grammarly idk why I just have a beef with them. I use QuillBot Grammar check, way better in my opinion. They catch more things than Grammarly. 

I energy drinks and coffee were definitely my friends these last 6 months. I drank Celsius energy drinks, the little packets you can mix with water. Very low calories so thats good. It's cause sometimes I would feel like I was reading but it wasn't going in my brain for some reason, so I would just drink one of those and It helped. Also towards the last 2 months I bought this gum called Neuro Gum, claims to give you energy and it has L-Theanine which helps you focus if you mix it with caffeine? I dont know, sounds silly but even if it was just a placebo effect they definitely helped. I pretended to use them like a ""magic pill"" that would make me smart. 

But yeah thats all I could think about, just wanted to give some people advice I wish I would of had when I was first starting. I am not trying to brag, trust me.... I already did by posting about this on my Instagram story that 13 people saw so yeah lol. I'll try to answer a few questions if y'all have any. I plan on getting a job next month, already looking at a few things. Also starting my Masters Degree with WGU in November so yeah gonna be so much fun! Can't wait for the end of year pizza parties yum.

If this is an obvious(ly dumb) question, I apologize, I was a lawyer before I became a teacher and I didn't go the traditional route.

I teach 8th grade history, and we're wrapping up our unit on pre-Revolutionary War America, specifically the tensions that rose between the colonists and the British over the various social, political and economic issues. A quick aside, I also call this unit ""Llama Llama Colonial Drama."" Anyway, their assessment will be a persuasive work where they have to convince the audience/reader to either join the Patriot or Loyalist cause. 

Here's my issue: I want to give the students options as to how to present this persuasive message. I want to do an essay option, a poster board/Google Slide option, and a videotaped option, but I want them to work hard on any option and not think they can be lazy if they're not writing an essay. Should I create multiple, rigorous rubrics for these options, which might clutter things up, or is there a magical, ""one-size-fits-all-media"" option out there I can use?

1fqrvvp,46,2024-09-27,Professor here. Need front-end UI advice/recommendations when running a local model (in production) for use in the classroom. More on the use case inside.,u/gigDriversResearch,LocalLLaMA,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1fqrvvp/professor_here_need_frontend_ui/,"I teach analytics in a b-school. I have a LLM with RAG access to a textbook I've written for my course. I use the LLM as a virtual tutor so it can help answer questions at 2am when students are doing assignments that are due the next morning :). I also give assignments requiring them to leverage the LLM for data viz in R and Python. LLMs have enabled so much more in my classroom - as business students, they don't get programming training but this gives them an appreciation for what data science entails and prepares them to work with data scientists.

I've never required students to purchase a textbook (which is why I wrote my own) or any other course materials because it's rarely necessary. But for the first time, I went against that and made a genAI pro subscription part of the required course materials. The goal was to let students experience a frontier LLM and help them learn to think about how to leverage gen AI in their workflow.

Now, requiring extra purchases made me feel dirty, even though I felt it was justified. So, I'm going back to not requiring purchases which means I need to create my own front-end for students to access. Ideally it will have a similar UI as chatgpt or artifacts. The plan is to set up a domain and website so I can use it internally through university log-in info. I already have options for the back-end (e.g., HF inference endpoints or bedrock through my university's AWS relationship, but RAG is kinda pricey for me on AWS; a fine-tune is the next step and I have student assistants helping me generate a large dataset from my textbook to that end). I give assignments where they generate code so the solution needs to produce code in markdown. The other issue is it will need to go through my university's accessibility review for compliance.

What are the options for hosting a front-end with this? I prefer to adapt something rather than create it from scratch (although I'm not opposed to this). E.g., on my personal machine, I use [chatbot-ui](https://github.com/mckaywrigley/chatbot-ui) with ollama and API calls when I need a frontier model. I've considered adapting this since its open-source. Any other suggestions?

The world of undetectable AI is treacherous, with few software able to cut it against AI detection software that is always subject to updates and implemented by every relevant institution. You already know StealthGPT’s AI-generated content can beat these detectors, but once in a while, a new AI opponent enters the arena to see if they can take the throne.

Caktus AI offers an AI humanizer and AI writing tool it claims can bypass AI detectors. We’re going to be the enemy’s using AI detectors to see if Caktus’ AI tools really have the functionality they claim to have. Is Caktus AI the best AI? Does it generate AI text that can bypass AI content detectors and plagiarism checkers? All will be answered in this undetectable AI review.

# My Grading System

Both students and amateur food critics on Yelp will recognize my system. I offer a letter grade and star rating out of 4 stars which is the culmination of four categories which are writing ability, functionality, user-experience, and pricing.

# What is Caktus AI?

As a citizen of the American Southwest, I’m partial to cacti. So, if an artificial intelligence company is going to have one as its mascot, I’m gonna take their service for a spin. At first glance, Caktus is a tool to help you with school work. Whether it’s academic writing, math, or chemistry, Caktus AI has generative AI tools to help a student. Their AI essay writer, which they claim is the best in the world, is the tool in question today though.

They also have a bypass AI tool that only comes with a paid subscription, so I’m gonna bypass using it. If generated text with their basic tool doesn’t feel like high-quality human writing and can’t beat AI detection, it’s not worth diddly squat. An essay writing tool with the same AI watermarks as ChatGPT is useless if you can’t submit your essay.

# Comparing the Results of Our Essay Writers

Before we see if Caktus AI is functional enough to bypass AI detection, we need to inspect the actual writing it generates to see if it has any kind of readability or style. Here is the result of Caktus AI getting a prompt from me:

I waited and waited. Caktus took forever to analyze my prompt and generate an essay. So long I thought the software was bugged. So long that I had to restart it twice. So long that it was clear that they did not want me to use their free service at all.

They were gonna do everything in their power for me to buy a subscription to their software. I decided to let my computer sit, hoping if I came back much later, I’d have an essay. Make a note of the time:

I gave Caktus a prompt at 11:45 and by 12:19 Caktus AI was still ""analyzing"", giving me no option but to give Caktus a 0.

# The Final Grade: F, 0/4 stars

For the first time, one of the AI tools we tested simply didn’t work at all to generate text. Thus, Caktus gets an F in every category. I’m sure the poor functionality of their free-version exists simply to compel people to subscribe to their pro version, but if anything should discourage you from doing that, then a non-functioning tool should be it.

We couldn’t test Caktus’ essay against Turnitin, [Originality.ai](http://Originality.ai), GPTZero or any AI Detector. There was no research paper or citations to review, nothing. Caktus isn’t so much AI technology as it is a total croc.

If you want an AI algorithm you can trust, visit StealthGPT’s [pricing](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/pricing) page where you can subscribe for less, only $0.99 for the first month with a student email, or you can use our free version which will generate your essay in seconds, unlike Caktus AI.

# FAQ

# How to Bypass TurnitinAI Detection?

You will need undetectable AI to bypass TurnitinAI Detection. Turintin is currently integrated into most student submission portals like Canvas and Blackboard. However, StealthGPT has always been able to fly under Turnitin’s radar no matter how many times Turnitin updates.

We have numerous articles showing exactly [how to make your text undetectable](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/make-chatgpt-undetectable) enough to bypass Turnitin, give them a read then give StealthGPT a try yourself.

# Are AI Detectors 100% Accurate?

No detector is 100% accurate. In fact, Turnitin acknowledges that their software has a 4% false positive rate at the sentence level. With 86% of students having used AI, that amounts to a massive amount of false positives that make the prospect of using AI ineffective. That’s why MIT simply proclaimed that [AI detectors don’t work](https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/teach/ai-detectors-dont-work/).

# Why Do Teachers Trust AI Detectors?

Some do, most don’t. Trust isn’t exactly the word I would use in this context. Teachers don’t have any better tools to detect the presence of AI-generated content. They’re aware of the high rate of false positives and the nightmare that comes with a student fighting an accusation.

Still, academic institutions have no other way to ensure academic integrity stays intact. So, they use AI detection tools in spite of their problematic nature and even their [bias against international students](https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/stanford-study-finds-ai-detection-tools-to-be-biased-against-international-students/#:~:text=Turnitin's%20tool%20was%20much%20more,by%20non%2Dnative%20English%20speakers.).",active,3,neutral,0

Here's why:


As was posted recently, aA has had yet another round of layoffs, completely decimating the career placement team. This is the beginning of their replacing their staff with AI.


Now on paper an AI instructed bootcamp model could theoretically work to fulfill it's purpose of teaching you to code. However, what reason are you even going to a bootcamp then? They'll be cutting down on instructors next and they already have the TA's spread too thin to where they're operating via tickets and messages now so you're getting minimal (if any) direct attention or assistance.


Next, there's the fact that if you're operating on an AI bootcamp model, do you really think you're going to outperform Claude or GPT when you can't possibly have a similar amount of GPUs or training data? Their new CEO had founded an AI tutoring company prior to starting at App Academy, but even if she's bringing proprietary technology from there, it won't be able operate to the degree of the free technology that's currently in rotation. (Excluding a lack of rate limits)


Finally, will students who are new to learning to code be able to use AI resources responsibly in order to chase comprehension rather than memorization? There's a completely real chance that they're just weakening their graduate pool in an already highly competitive market.

I figure it’s worth thinking about and being more informed when I talk to my senior colleagues. 

I’m strongly against GenAI for writing assignments as a plagiarism and mediocrity machine, but see fewer problems in code where one doesn’t need to cite in the same way. In practice, a number of my PhD colleagues used ChatGPT for one-off Python and bash coding jobs and it seems reasonable - that’s its real language after all.

There are many things on my mind. Where should I go in terms of my career? Should I consider a double major? Should I focus on jobs or prepare for higher studies? Should I continue with LeetCode or concentrate on hands-on projects? Should I participate in hackathons or dedicate my time to mastering data structures and algorithms? Should I prioritize my grades or actively seek internships? Should I engage deeply with everything taught in our undergraduate program, like microcontrollers, or just study for exams?

I’ve always wanted to present my ideas in writing. Should I start a blog, given that I’m good at it, even though it consumes a lot of time? Over the past week, I’ve been studying diligently, but I feel a disconnect—what is my purpose in all this, and where should I focus? I’ve downloaded a psychological course from UCL and took a practice test for the psych GRE (available online for free) to pinpoint my weaknesses. I’m genuinely interested in both psychology and economics.

I’ve heard various accounts about the challenges of securing a job in the tech market right now. Everyone keeps saying the SWE job market will recover by the time I graduate, but what if the pre-COVID era was an actual bubble, and we’re now entering a period of austerity? I’m working on LeetCode, building projects in web development, and have experimented with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for language models, particularly LLAMA-2, to assist with legal drafting. SFT is straightforward, cost-effective, and a valuable tool for aligning language models, which makes me believe that anyone with a couple of hours can engage with it. Am I truly cut out for this field?

As a second-year student, I feel stagnated—like I’m not learning anything new, and I’m not networking or meeting interesting people. On average, I study 5-6 hours a day, trying to increase that, but it seems like my study approach yields diminishing returns after the first two hours.

The people I aspire to work with are significantly ahead of me, and I feel there’s little chance I can catch up. They’ve had a real head start, having worked hard for a long time with guidance, while I’m only just beginning my journey.

“Since then, the potential of generative AI has felt clear, although its practical applications in everyday life have remained somewhat nebulous. Academia remains at the forefront of this question: Everybody knows students are using AI. But how? Why? And to what effect? 

“… This past June, a group of Bangladeshi researchers published a paper exploring why students use ChatGPT, and …of the many factors that the paper says drive students to use ChatGPT, three are especially compelling to me. Students use AI because it saves time; because ChatGPT produces content that is, for all intents and purposes, indistinguishable from the content they might produce themselves; and because of what the researchers call the ‘Cognitive Miserliness of the User.’ (This is my new favorite phrase: It refers to people who just don’t want to take the time to think. I know many.)

“…The future, for professors, is starting to clarify: Do not give your students assignments that can be duplicated by AI. They will use a machine to perform the tasks that machines can perform. Why wouldn’t they? And it will be incredibly difficult, if not outright impossible, to determine whether the resulting work has been done by ChatGPT, certainly to the standard of a disciplinary committee. There is no reliable technology for establishing definitively whether a text is AI-generated.

“But I don’t think that new reality means, at all, that the tasks of writing and teaching people how to write have come to an end. To explain my hope, which is less a hope for writing than an emerging sense of the limits of artificial intelligence, I’d like to borrow an analogy that the Canadian poet Jason Guriel recently shared with me over whiskey: AI is the microwave of language.”

I'm a second year Masters student in AI looking to gain more industry-relevant experience in the field of LLMs. I am a researcher as well with some publications in Swarm Intelligence and Multi-Agent Systems, thus I'm interested in learning how to deploy and manage a system of multiple LLMs collaborating to achieve a goal.

Inspired by my hatred of the boring university homework that does not provide any value, I've designed a system that in theory should allow me (even tho I won't actually use it for it for obvious reasons) to feed a PDF with the task instructions and get anything specified as deliverables in the document as output. My core goal is to gain industry-relevant experience, therefore I'm posting my general design to get feedback, criticism, ideas, and points of start. 

My current experience with LLMs is mostly playing around with the ChatGPT API and some finetuning for control of agents in MAS simulations, so I'm new to anything that includes the cloud, Agentic LLMs and things like RAG. Therefore, I would also heavily appreciate pointers on good resources to get started learning about those! 

Also, feel more than welcome to advise me on skills to add to the list that are good for the industry, I'm mostly focused on landing a good job after I graduate because I need to help my family with some big unexpected expenses. Thanks a lot in advance!

  
Here is the general design:

# Core Idea

The idea is to design and implement an agentic LLM-based system to solve a coding task or homework (including a report) given a PDF containing the task description by utilizing several agents that each have a role. The system should be hosted in the cloud and have a web interface to interact with, to learn industry-sought skills such as cloud engineering and management of LLMs in deployment.

# Skills List

Some of the skills I wish to learn

1. Agentic LLMs
2. Multi-agent systems of agentic LLMs
3. Cloud Deployment of LLMs
4. Quality Assessment of Deployed LLMs
5. Finetuning LLMs for given roles
6. Dockerization and Kubernetes (If needed)
7. Web Interfacing
8. Data pipeline management for such a system
9. RAG for the writer/researcher agent (needs context to write better report sections?)

# Agent List

* Coder
   * Tasked with the actual implementation of any requirements and returning the relevant output
* Researcher
   * Retrieves the needed context and information required for the report
* Writer
   * Tasked with putting together any the researcher's information and the coder's output and write the report itself
* Manager

1fszvkf,1,2024-09-30,ChatGPT's Impact on Business Productivity: Top Transforming Sectors,u/cporter202,ChatGPTautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTautomation/comments/1fszvkf/chatgpts_impact_on_business_productivity_top/,"The advent of artificial intelligence has paved the way for innovative technologies to disrupt the traditional business landscape. Among these, OpenAI's language model, ChatGPT, has stood out, significantly impacting business productivity across various sectors. I would like to delve into how this powerful tool is transforming industries and revolutionizing the way we work.

In the realm of customer service, ChatGPT is being harnessed to provide immediate, around-the-clock support. By leveraging its natural language processing capabilities, companies can deliver faster responses and minimize wait times. This not only enhances customer experience but also allows human agents to focus on more complex queries, thereby increasing efficiency.

The legal sector is another domain witnessing ChatGPT's influence. Law firms are employing the AI to draft and review documents, a task that conventionally consumes copious amounts of time. This automation accelerates the preparation process while reducing the margin for error. As such, lawyers can devote more attention to case strategy and client consultancy, thereby adding value to their services.

Education also benefits from ChatGPT's proficiency. Teachers and educational institutions are utilizing this technology to create personalized learning experiences. Chatbots can tutor students, adapt to their learning paces, and provide immediate feedback, making education more accessible and inclusive.

In marketing, ChatGPT has become an asset for content creation and consumer insight analysis. Marketers can swiftly generate promotional material and analyze customer feedback with nuanced sentiment analysis to shape more effective marketing strategies.

Further, the healthcare industry is integrating ChatGPT for patient interactions and administrative tasks. This AI's capabilities in understanding and processing medical terminology mean it can efficiently manage appointments, reminders, and preliminary patient inquiries, leaving healthcare professionals with more time for patient care.

It's imperative to consider that while ChatGPT and similar AI tools greatly contribute to productivity, they also come with challenges — particularly in terms of job displacement and the need for new skill sets amongst the workforce. As with any technological shift, it is essential to find a balance, ensuring that these tools are leveraged to complement human capabilities rather than replace them.

1ft7z9z,266,2024-09-30,Y'all (freshers) need to chill. Here's how.,u/unsuspiciousprofile,UniUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/1ft7z9z/yall_freshers_need_to_chill_heres_how/,"I am in my 3rd year and see daily posts here of people stressing over some minute details that will have zero impact on your life ever.

Someone missed a class, someone esle slept with a flatmate, some other person hates their course after 5 classes, bunch of people homesick.

Here's my take on all of this:

I understand, we literally all went through this. Now yes some are having a blast at uni, but if that is not you, it doesn't mean it is gonna be like this forever.

When I was in my 1st year, I did stupid shit that led me to getting severely depressed in the middle of UK's gloomy winter. Somehow, I decided to stay on my course and guess what? Can't be happier now. 

There is so many things that might go wrong it's impossible to address them all, but unanymously working on yourself is what it comes to it. If you are struggling with budgeting, this is what you need to learn. If you are struggling with socialising, this is also what you need to learn. Or maybe you are a massive procrastinator and leave everything till last minute? Well, you have a whole 1st year to figure out how to overcome it, and even if you fail it's only like 10% of your final grade. Many many problems of students at uni are really just problems of being in a situation where your self -regulation is still high school level, but your freedom is much more like that of an adult. So you need to grow this ability. In fact, you could argue that all that undergrad really is for is showing your future employer that you are somewhat able to keep a regular schedule and hand in things in due time. The skills you develop only really become meaningful after master's, unless in your profession you can work right after bachelor. And this sounds incredibly anticlimatic but it's not bad news at all, you will learn plenty of very useful skills, academic and non-academic. But just know that things take time, and sometimes they make get very bad before becoming great. 

It's corny but as humans we struggle with managing our freedom, and when granted some more we don't quite know how to navigate it. However, mistake after mistake and hurdle after hurdle you become more and more convinced that certain ways to do things work better for you than others. It's just very important to stay strong and not let it all break you, so find yourself the support you need, be it your parents, friends, colleagues or whoever you can think of who's ever been supportive. If there's nobody like that, use reddit and ChatGPT. Good luck!",active,287,negative,0
1ft8g06,23,2024-09-30,Adjuncting at four very different schools,u/Excellent_Carob173,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1ft8g06/adjuncting_at_four_very_different_schools/,"I'm adjuncting at four very different schools:  (1) a very selective private university, (2) a private regional college, (3) a private minority-serving college, and (4) a public community college.  I teach/have taught lit and comp at all of these schools.  

Here's what I'm dealing with this semester:

***Reading (and Participation)***  
At all four schools, reading comprehension is a major problem.  

At 1 and 2, I have students - domestic, English-as-a-first-language students - who lack elementary reading skills.  At 2 and 3, I cannot expect that any of my students will do any reading whatsoever before class.  I can even provide the audiobook, and they won't listen.  At 1 and 4, I can tell that 25-50% of the class will at least glance at the reading beforehand.  

But, again, the real issue is that even when we read out loud in class, it's clear that the majority of students struggle with literary texts written at a 7th grade reading level in lit classes, and they struggle with news stories and op-eds written at any level from middle to high school.  

It's not hopeless, though.  Many catch on.  However, many just...don't; they have already thrown in the towel.  

At 1, I see the greatest divide.  My class there always immediately splits between students who will ""get it"" and insist on excelling, and then those who just don't.  That divide is growing, though.  There are clearly students who have recovered from Covid and then those who fell through the cracks.  There are students with a lot of civic knowledge and students with hardly any. They hesitate to speak up because they're scared they might be ""wrong"" - until a handful of them are comfortable. They are my most anxious students overall. 

At 2, they are mostly annoyed that they are being expected to read anything.  Asking students to (volunteer to) read out loud at this institution has been eye-opening and shocking, though.  Many struggle with 'basic' vocabulary words that I learned in my low-ranked public middle school preparing for the PSAT. I can read things out loud to them carefully, stressing the important words and phrases, and the content still won't ""click.""  These students have the least amount of civic knowledge.  They don't want to speak up, and they are not bothered by uncomfortably long silent pauses.  They'll wait it out with me.  These are my most self-conscious, too-cool-for-school students.

At 3, they participate without abandon, and they're not afraid to be wrong.  (These were mostly below-average high school students.) They struggle to read on their own just as much as 2, but when I read with them out loud, they grasp the concepts.  What they lack in reading and writing preparedness, they make up for in conversation.  These classes have the most students with any civic knowledge, even if there are fewer with as much civic knowledge as 1.  These are my most reliable students.

At 4, my students are a mix of my best from 1 and my average from 3.  Half my students are really hopeful and want to transfer to a four-year school; the other half just want to get through as efficiently as possible.  This class has the most students who can comprehend texts on their own. They participate.   These are my most mature students (though not, on the whole, older.)

***Writing (and Assignment Submission)***  
All struggle to write; all struggle to use any word processor.  

At 1, many want to rely on ChatGPT, but they are learning to ""try"" to disguise their usage.  All of them have a superficial sense of what an essay ""should"" look like.  They have the least faith in their own ideas.  The vast majority still fail to follow submission guidelines, even when you demonstrate.  They are the most likely to get upset for having points deducted for not following submission guidelines.  They genuinely think ""I didn't know"" should be a get-out-of-jail-free card for anything and everything.  They are the most likely to grade grub.  But, then, when I've taught upper level courses here, I've been blown away by some of them.

At 2, many want to rely on ChatGPT, but they don't know how to use it.  These students also have a (very) superficial sense of what an essay ""should"" look like, but they don't have a grasp of the mechanics of writing, so except for when/where they paste from ChatGPT, their essays often don't actually say...well...anything.  They don't care about submission guidelines or deadlines, regardless of demonstrations and reminders.  They'll take the point deductions.  They just want the class to be over.  

At 3, most are weary of ChatGPT because they ""know they'll get caught,"" they say.  Many of these students have no real sense of what an essay ""should"" look like, but they, on the whole, make more substantive contributions.  They will try to follow submission guidelines if you demonstrate. These students are the most likely to hand in assignments on time.

At 4, ChatGPT usage varies widely.  Some use it fairly well.  Some use it not-so-well.  Some are scared of it.  They all have a sense of what an essay should look like, and they are, by far, the most likely to follow submission guidelines.  The fail to meet deadlines just as much as 1 and 2, but they'll take the point deductions.  

***Conclusion***  
This is a wild ride... I'm still learning... ",User_deleted,22,neutral,0
