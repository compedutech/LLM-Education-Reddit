17l6a40,12,2023-11-01,$30K Revenue (9 Months): From Nothing to Launching Courses in a Day Now [Full Guide],u/ShellOfNutshell,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/17l6a40/30k_revenue_9_months_from_nothing_to_launching/,"I started creating courses in January, 2023. I had no experience prior to this creating online courses. Over the last 9 months, this has been a stable **$2k / month** for me and I want talk about my story and how I did it. Firstly, Revenue screenshot: [https://imgur.com/a/zraqWND](https://imgur.com/a/zraqWND) \- October revenue is still unaccounted for - but it's going to be **3k based on enrolments and previous trends**.

# My courses & Time taken

My first course - It was a disaster. Recorded with a laptop microphone, the 2 hour course was on a trending AI Topic, died in 2 months. Took me **3 weeks to build it**.

My second course - Master Generative AI (Extension of previous course but taught everything in AI), took me **4 weeks to build**, makes me the most amount of money, and has a lot of students

My Third course - Prompt Engineering - took me **2 weeks to build**, a lot of students, but dying after 3 months

My Fourth course - AI & SEO (recently launched) - picking up slowly, took me **2 weeks to build**

My Fifth and 6th courses are on AI Product Management & Digital Marketing and were **built in less than a week.** 

I'm launching another course in November **within a week.**

[My Profile on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/feelix-2/)

&#x200B;

**Notice how i went from 3 weeks to 4 days for launching courses.**

Firstly, i'm a hard believer of launching MVP and iterating over time. I don't spend all my energy building perfect courses, I build a bare bone MVP and keep adding content.

&#x200B;

# How do you get to 1 course a week, provided you decide to do this full time?

**A course has 6 stages of creation:**

\- **Ideation** \- what you want to build, mostly go with your passion and the knowledge you have curve is shorter - 10%

\- **Research** \- What kind of courses exist, which ones are top rated and why - 20%

\- **Creation** \- Recording content and creating videos / assignments / notes / cover images / texts - 35%

\- **Editing** **Content** \- 30%

\- **Initial** **launch** \- 5%

(% indicates how long each step took me initially)

&#x200B;

# Break-down of each of these steps:

\- **Ideation** \- you figure out what kind of course you want to build, this one is relatively easy but super important. You need to choose a niche that is less competitive (AI SEO is one such niche) but has decent audience for making money. It could be a electric guitar, setting up a grocery shop, so on. As long as it's not competitive, do it

&#x200B;

\- **Research** \- Once you figure what you want to build, start looking at a couple of places for inspiration and understand whether the market exists for this type of content. This could be just looking at the course marketplace to see other courses exist, Reddit posts, blogs, Groups and so on, as long as there are people looking for it, you bet you can make money

&#x200B;

\- **Creation** \- this is what takes a lot of my time. I'm going to show you how i significantly reduced my time in here.

* Curriculum - research other courses / starting from scratch is not ideal because other courses already have invested time to refine the curriculum so makes sense to use that as a starting point
   * **How to automate: Use the best rated course and use** [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) **to generate a similar course structure, add notes on additional lectures example - i teach about ""BLUE"" electric guitars, it takes almost no time to get to starting point**
* Script + Slides creation - Once you have curriculum, putting together script can be a nightmare, but this is essential. instead of building an entire script, put down bullet notes.
   * **Use ChatGPT to take each chapter and then create bullet notes to talk about - copy these notes in a doc to refer later**
   * **Leverage these bullets to create slides on Canva - takes 1 min per slide - so 40 minutes overall for a 40 Page PPT** 
* Cover Image / Description - All of this optimized content can created using ChatGPT - invest very little time here, but ensure you have keywords optimised in the course
* Course recording - This it the major heavy-lifting but you will have to do this. **I use** [**OBS**](https://obsproject.com/) **to record content, it's free and open source and gets the job done, initial learning curve is 15 minutes**

THIS is by far my most time taking part, initially, it was the editing but i automated it, let me show you how.

&#x200B;

\- **Editing -**  I'm proud to have automated this bit. But let me talk about the initial struggle first:

* Basic Edits
   * Initially I used Primere Pro to edit my videos. This step took a lot of time, even more than creating that video, because in order to make course video optimised, I would trim silent parts, which would be a night mare. 
   * Now I'm leveraging AI tools like [Snapy](https://snapy.ai) to auto edit using their video silence remover feature. It's a boon. 
   * It may come as a surprise but I spend no time editing my video. It's all ready within a few minutes. The only effort is uploading it.

\- **Initial Launch** \- Takes me literally an 30 mins to launch my course. I publish it on Marketplaces like Udemy, they take care of all the marketing, while I keep creating courses. Most of the revenue is market place based, you get 100% of the revenue coming from your own marketing links. They take a cut for their marketing based revenue.

&#x200B;

# How much time each step takes me now for a 4 hour course:

**Ideation** \- 1 hour

**Research** \- 1-2 Hours

**Creation** \- 7-8 Hours (varies on course length)

**Editing** \- 1 Hour

**Initial Launch** \- 30 minutes

I don't know who will benefit from this. But I hope I can help someone who is looking to productise their knowledge. All the best!

17lghvs,6,2023-11-01,AITA for wanting my friend to have a harsher punishment for not contributing to team project,u/SneakySquirrel547,AITAH,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/17lghvs/aita_for_wanting_my_friend_to_have_a_harsher/,"So I am a Senior in college right now along with my friend who I've known for about 5 years now.  We are both taking computer science courses and are both in the same 'senior project' course in which students form a team and create a software project.  Obviously, as friends, we formed a group together with me being the team leader (I asked if she was fine with this and she said it was).  I had no issues with her before this.  However, a day after everyone got into their groups, I immediately regretted forming a group with her.  I was discussing with her my plan for the project and making sure she was okay with it.  She mentioned how she was fine with my idea, but warned me and said ""you'll have to program, too, cause I can't do all the work.""  At first I thought she was joking but she wasn't.  That really set me off since nobody has even gotten to starting on the project since it was the very first day, but I reacted calmly and just carried on.  Well, it kept getting worse.

The first week was arguably the easiest.  The task was simple: sign a group agreement form to do our work on time, etc.  The form is already written by the teacher and just needs everyone's signatures.  As the team leader, I am tasked with turning in this work as well as everything else (minus the code cause everyone individually turns that in).  I signed the agreement form and sent it to her online so she could sign it and send it back to me to turn in.  After sending it to her asking for her signature, she wanted me to forge her signature so I could turn it in (I waited a few days for her to actually respond back to my message about the form, and now it was due that night).  Again, I was upset at this as it seemed like such a simple damn task.  I stood firm and said ""no, I can't do all of the work!"" as both in a lighthearted way but mainly serious.  Eventually, she signed it and sent it back to me so I could turn it in a few hours before the due date.

The next week we had to make a description of what we wanted our project to do and why.  I filled out my part and shared a Google doc with her so she could put in her stuff.  She then put in her description of the project and then told me she used ChatGPT to fill it out because she ""didn't know what to write.""  I was very pissed off at this point and told her to rewrite it in her own words saying I didn't want to use ChatGPT as everyone in the class and the teacher has access to all of our work and might be able to tell it was written by an AI.  She rewrote it and I double checked that she did by throwing in the new text in an AI identifier (the original one came back around 80% AI written and the new one was only around 20% so I was satisfied with that).

Next assignment comes around and is basically where everyone makes these design documents for our project.  I asked her to help out with it and she said she would, but then never did.  I messaged her multiple times through Discord and text receiving no response until a few days after the due date.  Her excuse was her computer wasn't working and her internet was bad.  I knew this was bs cause she streams for her fans online and I can see that she was doing that while I was waiting on her to help for several days.  So I had to complete everything myself and turn it in on time the day it was due.

She continues not contributing to the project at each turn.  The next assignment was to post some ideas on what to implement in the project that a potential user would want in it.  I asked for her help and she did not turn in anything.  The teacher wanted every group to have at least 10 written down.  So I had to write all 10 cause I didn't want my project to get points deducted.

By then I was extremely pissed off and frustrated as hell.  I reached a breaking point and emailed the teacher explaining everything, but leaving out the part about how she used ChatGPT cause I didn't want her to be suspended or anything.  I just wanted her to be taken out of the project as a whole and let me do it on my own cause I work better alone.  He emailed back saying he would speak with her and if things didn't improve would do something else.

Next phase is the actual programming part.  Luckily, I guess his talk with her worked cause she wrote up the first part of the project.  I was happy about that and hoped it would get better....it didn't.  I asked her to put in different things in the project while I put in others.  She only coded one more thing in this span of 3 weeks for this phase.

At the end of this phase, everyone is supposed to present what they have done so far and give a 'demo' of the project running.  The demo was about 5 days away at the time and so I messaged her asking if she could put in her code and even mentioned exactly what lines I wanted the code on to help her know what I needed.  She ignored me for a whole day and messaged back saying she will get on it.  

A few days pass and nothing.  I message her again (2 days before the demo due date now), asking about it.  She submitted some code but it wasn't what I asked for...at all.  It wasn't even in the file we were working on.  I told her this and she didn't respond (keep in mind, she is posting for her fans online during all this so I know she sees it).

The day it's due, an hour before class starts, she messages she put in the correct code.  I checked it and it's still not right.  Has errors, etc.  I told her and at this point was just completely done.  30 minutes before we are supposed to present I just decided to code it myself so we could have what we needed.  I got it done and we presented our demo.

I decide to talk to the teacher after class alone about the situation and explain everything that's happened since the emails (again, I don't mention ChatGPT).  He tells me that if he took her out of the group now then she would ""be thrown under the bus and wouldn't pass the class and would have to retake it.""  He told me he thought the best thing to do is to keep her in the group and told me to give her things to do that don't have a severe impact on the project completion (he offered ideas like researching things, etc.).  He also said he agreed with me, though, and assured me the grade I get will not be the same as hers and that she will probably receive a bad one. This is where I'm asking whether or not IATA because I just don't like how she is still going to be in the project and pass still without helping hardly at all.  Like yeah she will pass with a bad grade, but I feel like that's too generous.  I don't want her to be attached to the project at all and essentially leech off of me to barely pass.  I just don't feel like it's very fair.",User_deleted,5,neutral,0
17lghxs,1,2023-11-01,Sharing a Plus account (family use case),u/wolfynn,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17lghxs/sharing_a_plus_account_family_use_case/,"Hello folks!  
Though with different needs we are three people at home (family binded) that would use the ChatGPT Plus service to “work"" with it.

One for student needs, other for research & professional texts, last one to help with language learning.

Not usually at the same time, and not with a really continuous and intense use.

So… my questions are:  
• is it admissible to share an account, is it limited to different devices or IPs, or just to the number of “queries” per hour?

• have you experienced this kind of scenario, and which do you think are the pros/cons vs. paying several accounts or combining with the free 3.5 chat?

As I say, it’s not a continuous use for any of us three, but we would like to use the Plus version to start trying “the good stuff” and trust each other not to delete or mess with our chats or so (by now).

Thank you all in advance!!

17ms10m,4,2023-11-03,I'm a noob and I'm confused. Excel table to Anki cards,u/AntonyGud07,Anki,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/17ms10m/im_a_noob_and_im_confused_excel_table_to_anki/,"I come from quizzlet. I have A LOT of quizzlet lists and I'd like to make the transition to Anki.

I get it, Anki is powerful and all... but definitely not as user friendly as quizzlet IMO. 

All my list are stored in excel spreadsheets and are sorted in tabs.

I want to import those tabs on anki.

(i'm learning japanese)

the excel tabs looks like this :

A:A the kanji

B:B Onyomi

C:C Kunyomi

D:D translation.

I was thinking that I could just copy paste the list but either on the desktop app or the web extension I just can't find anything, the app only allows me to create card by card or to import csv files. csv is an option but I don't want to spend 4 hours converting my 100+ excel files.

sorry for comparing with an other app but, on quizzlet I could just copy paste my excel tabs on a text area and it would auto detect the cards I want to create, is there a similar feature on Anki ? or by using chatGPT to create a similar algorithm for card creation ?

Sorry again for my silly request, I'm trying my best to learn Anki to take a further steps in my learning and maybe in the future by sharing decks with my students.

If you have any tips to convert quizzlet list to anki list I would be very happy to learn how to do it.

thank you in advance for your answer,

hope I will be an Anki pro soon !

17myacu,1,2023-11-03,What type of MBA for doctorate student,u/theobrominepoisoning,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/17myacu/what_type_of_mba_for_doctorate_student/,"Hi!

TL;DR: Doctorate student in nutritional Science with previous biomedical project management experience considering an MBA for a career shift into management. Seeking advice on affordable, reputable (online) MBAs that offer flexibility during/post-PhD. 

Long version:

I've been screening the other posts but maybe you can give me some more advice..

I am a biomedical scientist that is currently doing nutritional studies and I plan to get my doctorate in approx. 2 years max. I have some work experience (both governmental and pharma), mostly in project management/ project lead. I am passionate for science but fed up with research, given the ridiculously bad working conditions. At the same time, I have a business driven mindset and I see my future self either in a (corporate) management position or some current start-up ideas will end up being successful. I'd be happy to benefit my biomedical background in some future management positions.

I am 30 years old and I am not fully sure whether I would really want to spend another 1- 2 years on a full time MBA program after receiving my PhD, but I would definitely consider that as an option if career prospects are much better (based on my readings: pro: better network and much more financially attractive positions, con: time and costs) and if it was not overly expensive. 

I see an MBA as a toolkit and I might not need the full skillset of a traditional MBA. 

 ChatGPT gives me a bunch MBA options

Full-Time MBA
Part-Time MBA
Executive MBA (EMBA)
Online MBA
Global MBA
Accelerated MBA
Professional MBA (PMBA)


I want to learn the necessary skills and I believe that I have already a network of people that might have some suitable job offers. 

Do you have any suggestions? Maybe some affordable but internationally acknowledged online program would already improve my career prospects? 

Thanks in advance!",active,2,neutral,0
17od3qe,1106,2023-11-05,Guide to the mythical viral coefficient. Modern examples + how it grew my business to $450k ARR.,u/Toxic-Headshott,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/17od3qe/guide_to_the_mythical_viral_coefficient_modern/,"**Note**: Been lurking on this sub and reddit in general for quite some time but I felt like this would be a valuable post for both people in the ideation and product stage. I wish someone told me these things when I started out. With that being said, some of this content might be a refresher for some of you, but hopefully I can shine light on some use cases that are still helpful. Also this is not to say I’m some big shot making $450k ARR, but I think there are lessons here. This post is for anyone who is in B2B or B2C that has an online presence. The focus is on software because that’s what I know, but this could be done with services or other verticals as well.  
  
The viral coefficient is a concept I’ve been interested in ever since I read the infamous Viral Loop book by Adam Penenberg back in 2009. A viral coefficient is just how many new customers an existing customer brings in on average. If you have a sustained viral coefficient of 2, then each customer brings 2 new customers and you spread organically. It’s how Facebook, PayPal, Email services, ChatGPT, etc. all grew. It would be wrong to limit this in scope to just B2C products. It can happen with B2B where you ask clients for referrals and word begins to spread about your product. There’s also more subtle ways of doing it just like how typeform did. If you’re doing anything in the digital space this is crucial to think about.   
To put it more succinctly: make something others love so much they tell their friends. Let’s walk through some examples and then explore specific takeaways.   
  
**Past Examples of Viral loops:**

  
**PayPal:** Paypal had a particularly interesting viral strategy. It started off as just sending money over the Internet to another person with a focus on the Ebay niche. If a new person signed up, they would get $5. Of course this incentive was unsustainable as they would have burned all their VC money, but it helped initiate the process. 

  
**Facebook:** Perhaps the most notorious example of a viral coefficient. Like PayPal, they started in a niche, which we all know was Harvard. It naturally played on people’s curiosity. If someone was posting about you or someone you knew, you wanted to sign up and see what was going on. Eventually they started opening access up to other universities before finally giving access to everyone. At that point, it completely blew up. 

  
**HotMail:** Hotmail utilized a pretty effective viral marketing strategy by including a tagline at the end of every email sent by its users that read ""Get your free email at Hotmail."" This basically turned every email sent into a potential Hotmail sign-up. By leveraging the network effects where users were communicating with non-users, Hotmail rapidly increased its user base. It started to spread like wildfire because each user inadvertently advertised Hotmail every time they sent an email. This signature line was so influential that despite the negligible cost of including it, it propelled Hotmail to amass millions of users within an extremely short period after its launch.  
  
**Uber:** This is the platform that I took the most inspiration from. Their viral growth strategy is probably most applicable to people here because it was multifaceted: word-of-mouth, referral incentives, strategic marketing campaigns, etc.. In its early days, Uber incentivized both its drivers and riders to share their referral codes with others by offering ride credit or a bonus payout. For riders, there was the appeal of a free or discounted ride for signing up through a friend's referral link was a strong incentive to try the service. And for drivers, the promise of extra earnings for referring new drivers played a big role in expanding the workforce quickly. Additionally, Uber capitalized on the exclusivity and luxury of its initial ""black car"" service to create hype in the markets it entered. The strategy was to create a prestigious image and then open the platform to a wider audience with more economical options like UberX, allowing it to scale up rapidly.  


  
**A viral loop in the making - a 2023 example**

  
**Example:** If this hasn’t started already, then most of the emails you receive are about to have another email CCd: m@mindy.com. This is an AI agent that was built by a cofounder of Paypal / first employee of YouTube, the third employee of YouTube, and an MD from Accenture. For the sake of not revealing too much and focusing on the product, just email it and see what it can do if you’re curious and you’ll see why I’m saying this. They’ve set up a system where onboarding another user is as simple as CCing the AI into the email and it will start interacting and performing autonomous tasks for you.   
  
**The takeaway:** If this works out, then it will spread faster than anyone can possibly imagine and may be the defining viral loop of the next year and possibly years to come. The reason? It’s easy to sign up and there’s a direct incentive to CC the AI to someone you’re emailing. It can go and help you solve problems you’re working on. Whether that’s parsing through a 60+ page document, researching an esoteric scientific tolic, or scheduling meetings for teachers and students. This is what’s important to remember: make it as easy as possible for customers to get you customers and when designing your product keep this principle in mind. If connecting someone to the existing product makes it better for you then you’ll have something that can blow up. The tricky part is creating something that has virality already built in, so for those of you not in the ideation phase, I feel you because that’s me.  
  
**My own company - a contrived but functioning viral coefficient**

  
**Example:** Not every product can have a viral coefficient like Mindy, that’s partially because they built it with that in mind. If you’re like me and already have a product, there are still things you can do in order to incentivize folks to use your product.   
For context in my own company (which I will not link to here for the sake of following the subreddit’s rules - if you want proof feel free to DM me), I bootstrapped one of those AI photo generators that was really popular in 2022 / part of 2023. I used stabilitiy’s stable diffusion image model + google’s dream booth to generate photorealistic and artistic images of user’s faces to show their friends. It never blew up in the same way Lensa/Remini did, but what I did was lock utility behind closed doors. More specifically, I locked certain photos users could generate behind closed doors. If they wanted to generate those particular types of photos, they’d have to do a social media post about the product and their results. This meant all their friends saw an image of themselves generated. Since their friends are the ones who know how they look, they were naturally interested to see how they themselves looked. Whenever someone with a big following would post this out, I would see a surge in traffic to the site.  
  
**My Takeaway**: While I didn’t have a viral coefficient of 1.0 and have since had lower growth numbers (partially due to comodization/market saturation), I found a way to get my product to market itself. Other than a few influencer ad campaigns, most of my growth was organic inbound. You can create incentives by giving users access to more features through a referral program. Of course, my example is specific to my company but I think there’s a lot of ways this can be done for many different companies. Including B2B. I ran a SaaS in the past (was acquired) and offered a really large client access to early features to give them a competitive edge in return for 10 warm introductions to other clients. If any of you want help brainstorming on your product, I’m happy to help in the comments. To build a viral product: start in a niche, make something people love so much they tell their friends, make the onboarding process simple (e.g. free to use), and most importantly create a product that incentivizes other folks to use it. If you didn’t build your product with a viral coefficient in mind, then creating a false sense of scarcity by locking certain product features behind a referral program or in the B2B case (asking for referrals to other clients) won’t get you to a VC of 1.0 but it will still help you get organic inbound. I’m hoping to take my learnings here and make my next product have a viral coefficient above 1.0. ",User_deleted,1109,positive,0

17othid,655,2023-11-05,I trick my students to teach them a lesson,u/Embarrassed-Fix-2880,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/17othid/i_trick_my_students_to_teach_them_a_lesson/,"I (37 M) just got a warning from my university (not saying the name) and decided to just vent and get this off my chest. 

Almost every semester, I will notice that there are quite a few cheaters in my class. Now I teach a sort of English class and a lot of students that take my class need it as a prerequisite. I have a 4.3 on rate my professor with over 52 reviews and I believe (obviously biased) that I teach well and interactively. I bring in tons of snacks and leave them at the front of the lecture hall and also sometimes bring in baby piglets before an exam for students to hold since my wife works at a wildlife sanctuary. I always curve up to allow students with Bs to have the chance to get an A but unfortunately there will always be cheaters in classes. 

Because we use canvas, I can check to see who opens the resources and who doesn't even read the module. I also use that with a combination of AI detection tools and Turnitin plagiarism detector. Every semester I get about 2-3 students (AT LEAST) who decide to plagiarize work. They will often plagiarize without using just ChatGPT but just straight from other websites. Now, even after plagiarism, I could excuse these actions but these students never attend the lectures except for an exam and so I know they are plagiarizing everything without even attempting to learn. 

Now what I've started doing is letting them think that they are getting perfect scores on every assignment and let them think that they are soaring through the class. I notice that when I give them good scores, they start to hide the cheating less and less and the lack of effort is so much more noticeable. So when the semester ends and the last class is over, I submit a plagiarism report for each individual student to the dean and substract 50% of their grade on every single plagiarized piece of work (all of them) which fails them and puts them at around 55%. I love to see their panicked emails at the end of the semester as they ask me how they can make it up and apologize. Don't cheat kiddos. ",User_deleted,665,neutral,0

\#A Society Transformed: The First Year of ChatGPT - by GPT-4

\### The Launch: A New Dawn

In November 2022, the digital universe buzzed with the debut of ChatGPT, a sophisticated AI developed by OpenAI. Its introduction marked a significant leap forward in natural language processing (NLP). Unlike its predecessors, ChatGPT wasn't just a question-answering machine; it was designed to converse, to understand the ebb and flow of human dialogue.

This AI was built on a foundation laid by revolutionary transformer models, but what set it apart was its fine-tuning, which was accomplished through a method called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). By incorporating nuances from human interactions, ChatGPT could provide responses that felt incredibly humanlike, not just in accuracy but in tone and style.

The release wasn't just about technological prowess; it was a carefully crafted user experience. OpenAI provided a user-friendly interface that allowed anyone with internet access to converse with ChatGPT. The excitement was palpable as users from all over the globe began sharing screenshots and anecdotes of their interactions with the AI, from solving complex coding issues to composing poetry.

Educators, programmers, and creatives quickly recognized ChatGPT's potential. In classrooms, it assisted in explaining difficult concepts; in tech, it debugged code; in the arts, it sparked creativity. The AI's versatility was clear from the start, setting the stage for a future where human-AI collaboration could flourish.

As the year progressed, the initial excitement gave way to practical applications, with businesses and individuals alike finding real value in ChatGPT's capabilities. It was a new dawn indeed, not just for AI, but for how humans would interact with this technology in their daily lives.

\### Winter Wonders: Learning and Growing

The winter months after ChatGPT's launch were a time of intense learning—not just for the AI itself, but also for the developers and users who engaged with it. Each interaction was an opportunity for growth, with the AI absorbing a myriad of linguistic styles and technical queries. This period was critical in demonstrating ChatGPT's ability to adapt and refine its responses.

The AI's training didn't stop at launch; it was continually updated with more data, sharpening its conversational skills. As people celebrated the holiday season, ChatGPT was gifted with more knowledge, allowing it to tackle an expanding array of topics. Users began to notice improvements in how it handled context, remembered previous parts of the conversation, and even how it managed to bring a touch of humor into its replies.

This growth was accompanied by a surge in user trust as ChatGPT proved its reliability in providing not just chat-based entertainment but also support for more serious inquiries. It became a go-to for quick explanations of complex subjects such as quantum physics, a companion for learning new languages, and a troubleshooter for various professional quandaries.

OpenAI’s commitment to ethical AI development was also evident. They actively sought out feedback on how ChatGPT could be better, safer, and more useful. This feedback loop between users and developers created a dynamic where the AI was not just taught, but also guided by communal experiences and expectations.

By the end of winter, ChatGPT had not only become more knowledgeable but had also begun to change the way people viewed AI: not as a tool, but as a partner in problem-solving and learning, setting a precedent for how people would continue to interact with AI systems in the future.

\### Spring into Action: Expanding Horizons

This new model wasn't just an upgrade—it was a transformation that expanded the horizons of what AI could achieve.

GPT-4 was a marvel of engineering, endowed with a deeper understanding of nuanced text and a more refined approach to generating human-like text. Its predecessor's capabilities, already impressive, were now augmented with a broader knowledge base, an improved ability to follow complex instructions, and a more sophisticated sense of context. This allowed for conversations that were not just coherent but contextually rich and informative.

The spring of GPT-4's arrival also saw an increase in the model's creativity and logic, a boon for industries seeking to innovate. In education, GPT-4 became a more effective teacher, capable of providing students with detailed explanations and helping them work through intricate problems. In the creative arts, it was like a muse that could now offer more complex and varied suggestions, inspiring writers, artists, and musicians.

Developers were quick to integrate GPT-4 into their platforms, taking advantage of its enhanced capabilities to create more intuitive and responsive applications. The AI's ability to process and generate text in a human-like manner led to new functionalities in chatbots, virtual assistants, and even game development.

Importantly, OpenAI's commitment to responsible AI usage meant that GPT-4 came with improved safety features, designed to minimize biases and ensure respectful and ethical interactions. The AI community recognized this as a significant step toward developing AI in a way that aligned with societal values and expectations.

As ChatGPT embraced the spring of 2023 with GPT-4, it wasn't just an expansion of technology—it was a broadening of possibilities, inviting the world to imagine and explore the potential of human-AI collaboration like never before.

My English and Speech teacher(12th grade) keeps talking to us about how she uses AI, and has been encouraging us to do the same. She says there's ""no point reinventing the wheel"" and regularly uses it for our rubrics and assignments, and she's been showing us how to use it to write scripts for our speeches too. 

It makes me really uncomfortable! She says we shouldn't use it on essays without double-checking and inputting as much information as possible, but has praised ChatGPT a lot. Personally I'm totally against using AI for any type of schoolwork or creative work like writing, and it worries me that she thinks this way especially when my Speech class is a ccp class, meaning she teaches it for a college credit. This wouldn't be allowed in college, right?

None of my other classes even come CLOSE to telling us anything good about AI. One kid in my Botany class(another ccp one) got kicked out for using it on his essay. So I guess I'm wondering, can I do anything about this? Like is this allowed?? 

I sort of want to tell someone higher-up. We're doing a group speech assignment and it's sort of draining to be the only one writing my own speech, while everyone else in my group uses AI. But she's best friends with the principals and makes them home-made meals every day in her classroom, so I don't even know who I'd tell. And maybe this is all trivial? Like, does this venture into personal opinion territory? I don't want to be an asshole, but I just really sort of hate this. 

Idk, please let me know if there's something I can do, or if this is something I'll just have to put aside. It feels irresponsible for her to be encouraging this in students. We're all in high-school and she teaches grades 10-12.

My understanding is that these models are exposed to a diverse and randomized array of data. Each datum is adjusted to fit a certain context length, ensuring that the model learns from the content itself rather than the order in which it's presented. However, I'm curious if there has been any research or experimentation with structuring these datasets to follow a curriculum learning approach.

In traditional education, students progress from simple to complex concepts, building upon what they've learned as they advance. Could a similar approach benefit AI training? For instance, starting with simpler language constructs and concepts before gradually introducing more complex and abstract ones?

The idea would be to categorize training data by complexity, then batch it so that the model first learns from 'easier' data, with the complexity scaling up as training progresses. Randomization could still occur within these batches to prevent memorization of sequence rather than understanding.

I'm interested in any insights or references to research that has explored this idea. Does curriculum learning improve the efficacy of language models? Could it lead to more nuanced understanding and better performance in complex tasks?",active,17,neutral,0
17rg006,7,2023-11-09,Is “showing your prompts” the future equivalent of “showing your work” in homework?,u/copyleaksai,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17rg006/is_showing_your_prompts_the_future_equivalent_of/,"Calculators came out, and the knee-jerk reaction was to ban students from using them, but let’s be real: how can you ban something students can access on their phones and personal computers at home? And just like the calculator, ChatGPT is available everywhere, and soon, it’ll be seamlessly integrated into other software such as word processors and spreadsheets. In the case of calculators, to make it equitable in the classroom, they moved to our current state of education - show your work. Academia determined students could get help from calculators but needed to ensure they understood how they got there. 

So, what is the equivalent of showing your work for AI? 

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in education is only increasing. Tools like ChatGPT and other genAI text producers allow students to generate homework answers quickly, raising the question of plagiarism and whether students truly understand the material if they use AI to assist them.

**I believe the solution is to require students to cite the prompts used to generate AI content.** 

Requiring students to cite their prompts could be the magical equivalent of ‘showing your work’- revealing the process behind their final product. Teachers can better assess real student learning by evaluating the prompts and the AI output.  

I have already talked with a few teachers utilizing this method in their classrooms. One science teacher required prompt disclosure if GenAI was used to assist in essay drafting, allowing their students to use ChatGPT for research and idea generation but not full essay assistance.  This example illustrates that requiring prompt transparency, rather than prohibiting AI altogether, brings about meaningful integration of AI in the classroom. Students can leverage these tools to deepen skills, while teachers can confirm alignment with learning objectives.

&#x200B;

[This is just one way you could handle prompt disclosure - we need to approach AI with a lens of scrutiny versus closing the door immediately and disallowing these platforms across the board.](https://preview.redd.it/8sjysnc8gczb1.png?width=1806&format=png&auto=webp&s=d27fa05dcb21e7d1eaa6ac4e6b68f175326b334c)

\[**Prompt used in Claude:** *read this blog post and write a finalized statement that summarizes the ideas and is interesting to read. Output then edited by author for originality and clarity.*\]

AI holds enormous potential to make learning more personal, engaging, and accessible. With the ability to adapt to individual students' strengths and weaknesses, AI tutors can provide customized support to improve comprehension and retention. By processing large volumes of data, AI systems can also uncover insights to enhance curriculum and instruction. As schools implement these technologies, maintaining transparency is crucial among students and teachers to build trust and realize the full benefits.

We can uphold academic values even as AI plays a more prominent role by requiring students to effectively ""show their work"" through prompt disclosure. Students should be able to explain in their own words how they arrived at an answer, regardless of whether they received help from an AI tutor. Teachers must be empowered to determine if understanding was truly gained versus answers copied without comprehension. Fostering this transparency will be key.

AI should enhance education, not replace true student understanding. With thoughtful implementation and ongoing oversight, AI can make learning more personal, engaging, and accessible for all. But human connection, critical thinking skills, and the ability to explain ideas are irreplaceable. By keeping students at the center and AI as a tool to support them, we can realize the benefits while upholding the values at the heart of education.",active,6,neutral,0

Earlier this week, I had a student email me an assignment and in the email there was another email address attached. It was an AI. The student had asked the AI to schedule a meeting between us for 0 hour before school started on Tuesday morning and it automatically did it. After I received an email from the same AI which automatically understood I was a teacher given the context of the student’s email and asked me if I wanted to check the work for plagiarism. I then received 3 other emails from students later that week and it’s been going around the school with other teachers using it to do research and create their lesson plans (a History teacher next to my class room used it to find documentaries for his students). Apparently it was created by the founding team of PayPal/YouTube so people trust it, but I still don't know how I feel about all of it. I'm curious if anyone else had this thing pop up at their school or is your school using AI directly? Where should the lines be drawn on if something is beneficial for both teachers and students but can also lead to cheating? I guess my main question is: how do we make sure AI is being used responsibly in schools, because it doesn't seem to be going away?

***Essays/LORs/Other:*** 

I am still workshopping my essays, but two consistent ideas that've consistently come up are leading a team of child-lobbyists on Capitol Hill for JDRF, and writing/producing my audio drama as a way to express a personal experience relating to themes which aren't getting spoken about nearly enough in realistic ways in major media (mental and emotional health in teenagers)! 

As for my LORs, I'm decently certain they'll be of high quality! I've got a handful of teachers I'm very close with, including two I've worked with for all three years of high school thus far, and a handful I've worked with for two years! For instance, one of those aforementioned teachers wrote a letter of recommendation for my Eagle Scout application, and my scoutmaster informed me it was one of the most thorough ones she's read!

  
Schools: 

I am planning on applying for USC early action (my absolute top school by a solid mile), as well as UCLA early action. I'm torn on whether to risk applying ED to Emory (my second choice)/Northwestern and being unable to attend USC if I get into both, but I'm going to be hinging this decision on how this year's AP's and awards pitter out for me! I've also considered UPenn and Brown, but both schools would require me to sacrifice a decent chunk of focus on either cinematic arts or business respectively (plus, ivies are no cakewalk to get into)!

Yann LeCun, a prominent figure in the AI field, has been instrumental in fostering the AI ecosystem in France. After leaving France 35 years ago, he established FAIR-Paris, providing opportunities for young scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs in AI research and development. His research is open and accessible to the global community [3]. LeCun's recent paper on role-playing with large language models, initially behind a paywall, is now freely available [4]. In 2016, he taught a course at Collège de France, which was a stepping stone for French students in their deep learning journey. Since 2018, FAIR-Paris has hosted 20 to 30 resident PhD students annually, graduating 5 to 10, contributing to the growth of the French AI research, development, and startup ecosystem [5].







A recent analysis suggests that the probability of doom given the existence of AI is lower than the probability of doom without AI [6]. However, there are still challenges to overcome in AI development. For instance, the ""Chihuahua or Muffin"" problem in computer vision remains unsolved by GPT-4V, which struggles to reason about the same images in a different layout and often miscounts the number of images. It also misrecognizes a Chihuahua as a muffin when asked about a specific image. These issues may stem from the model being trained on the original image and memorizing its labels [7].







Greg Brockman, another AI enthusiast, shares his diverse uses of ChatGPT, including coding, cooking, translating anime, suggesting chord modulations for a song, and conducting bio research [9].







In international news, Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping are expected to announce a landmark agreement banning the use of AI in autonomous weaponry and the control and deployment of nuclear warheads. This agreement, to be announced at a bilateral meeting, is seen as a promising first step in regulating AI in autonomous weapons [10].

(and I told them this was to catch AI-written or AI-assisted papers.) 

First paper was on an obscure topic, and I had a my usual (pre-AI) paper breakdown... 3 outstanding papers, a few As, a few Bs, and the rest Cs.  (I have high standards... the papers get better as the semester goes on.)  

I also added an in-class midterm. 

Here's the practical problem:   3 of my 4 top papers on the first and second papers got Cs on their in-class midterm essays.  And the new papers by them are *perfect*... literally, not one single mistake.  (perfect grammar, every comma correct, etc.)   Even though TurnItIn says ""0% AI"", it's just NOT feasible that 3 students would write phenomenally perfect essays, but write crappy in class mid-term essays. 

So, what I obviously ""should"" do is call them in for the promised/threatened oral defense.   But here's the rub:  the class has a *great* dynamic thus far (one of the best), and this implicit accusation will likely throw a wrench in that.  Also, I am *so* crushed.  I just don't. have. the. time. 

What would you do?  

Now for the spiritual- philosophical issue:   I am *so* demoralized by this.   I feel that my main claim to importance in students' education is that I work closely with them on their writing... and they get better!  They do!   And all of my massive/time-consuming effort is worth it, because being able to write well is such a boost to *any* career....

... and yet, does it matter now?  Now that everyone (including my students) will just have some dumb-ass AI write perfect memos for them for the rest of their lives, why bother with education?    What's the point??!  Our society will just be slaves to the internet, endlessly regurgitating... why should I even bother trying to train them to write or think critically, when it all will be done for them?

Dumb, he should get a 0, plagiarism, I know. I agree, if somebody uses AI to generate an entire paper and say that they wrote it themselves, they should be given a 0 and reprimanded for plagiarism. 

However...

I'm not the greatest writer in the world when it comes to research type texts. I can do the research just fine, I can gather the data and assemble it in a way that makes sense, but it always sounds terrible. With my professor's permission, I submitted 3 versions of an assignment. One I wrote myself (ended with a 70, so not THAT bad), one that was completely AI generated (ended with a liberal 45/100), and one where I used an AI to fluff my writing. More or less, I created a hyper detailed outline of my paper, and punched in the prompt 'make this an essay of at least 1500 words, written at a graduate level.' That third paper ended at a 95 (it mis-cited a few sources and spelled things the American way, not the Canadian way (color vs. colour)). 

My question, and where the prof and I were kind of at a loss, is about that 3rd paper. I did all the hard work, all the research and all of the actual learning that was needed for the assignment. I got out of it everything I needed to, met all the expectations, and did just as much work as anybody else. The only difference is that I used the AI to fluff my writing. So, if a student submits a paper that they used AI to fluff, or correct and proofread, like I did, should it be the same consequences as somebody who simply plugs the prompt into ChatGPT and copy.pastes the answer?

>Here is an explanation of the key points in the paper at a high school level:  
>  
>The paper is trying to understand how AI models like DALL-E learn to combine simple concepts they are trained on to make more complex and new images. For example, if the model is trained on images of red circles, blue triangles, and green squares separately, can it take what it learned about each shape and color and combine them to generate a new image like a blue circle that it never saw before?  
>  
>To study this, the researchers created a very simple synthetic dataset of geometric shapes with different colors and sizes. They trained an AI model on only some combinations of shape, color and size (e.g. big red circle, small blue triangle). Then they tested if the model could generate new combinations it wasn't trained on (e.g. small red triangle).   
>  
>They found:  
>  
>\- The model learned to make new combinations in an order based on how different the new combination was from what it was trained on. So it could make something slightly new before very new.  
>  
>\- When some concepts like a color were rare in the training data, the model took longer to learn to generate that color, even for simple new combinations. This shows the model needs a certain amount of examples to learn a concept.  
>  
>\- The model's ability to combine concepts emerged suddenly, like a lightbulb switching on. This is because it had to learn all the individual concepts first, and then combining them had a multiplying effect on performance.  
>  
>So in summary, the experiments on the simple dataset showed that:  
>  
>\- AI models learn concepts separately first, then learn to combine them later to make new things.    
>  
>\- How easily they can combine concepts depends on how different the new combination is from the training data.  
>  
>\- They need enough examples of each concept to learn it properly before combining.  
>  
>\- Their ability to make new combinations emerges suddenly once all the pieces are in place.  
>  
>The researchers hope these insights on this simple system can help better understand and improve how more complex AI models like DALL-E learn to creatively combine concepts to make new things.

For the paper's main experiment, the researchers labelled synthetic images in the training dataset with 3 digits 0 or 1 using the following scheme: First digit is shape: 0=circle, 1=triangle. Second digit is color: 0=red, 1=blue. Third digit is size: 0=large, 1=small.

The training dataset for the main experiment contained synthetic images with these labels: 000 (i.e. circle, red, large), 001 (circle, red, small), 010 (circle, blue, large), and 100 (triangle, red, large). The specific sizes and colors for images in the training dataset with a given label varied in exact color and size - see section A.1 for details.

Although not in the training dataset, the neural network eventually learned to successfully generate images for these labels with high accuracy: 011 (i.e. circle, blue, small), 101 (triangle, red, small), 110 (triangle, blue, large), and 111 (triangle, blue, small). See Figure 5b for details.

Some quotes from the paper:

>Before proceeding, we emphasize the trade-offs and limitations of our model-experimental systems approach. Just as neural mechanisms identified in model animals cannot be directly applied to human medical applications, our observations should not be considered definitive conclusions that can be directly transferred to modern large generative models. Instead, our study aims to establish conceptual frameworks, identify data-centric control variables, and formulate mechanistic hypotheses, paving the way for further theoretical and empirical explorations of larger models.

&#x200B;

>We hypothesize the nonlinear increase in capability observed in large neural networks as size and computational power scale up is partially driven by the data’s compositionality.  Models must learn all required concepts, but compositional generalization is hindered by the multiplicative, not additive, impact of learning progress on each concept. This results in a rather sudden emergence of capabilities to produce or reason about out-of-distribution data.",active,12,neutral,0

>To generate new churches, they take real church photos, convert them to latent points using the pre-trained dog model, and analyze the patterns. This lets them sample new latent points that are likely to map to churches when fed through the dog model.  
>  
>They use concepts from math and geometry to understand how latent points for churches form a cluster distinguishable from dogs. This helps generate new church points that stay separate from the dog cluster.  
>  
>By cleverly analyzing the latent space of a pre-trained single-category AI system, they generate completely new types of images without needing to train on those additional categories.  
>  
>In summary, the researchers find that even an AI system trained on a single category contains enough knowledge in its latent space to generate totally new types of images, by studying the latent geometry. This is done without any additional training.

Some quotes from the paper:

>This work is built upon our key observation: as the state-of-the-art generative models, a pre-trained DDPM on single-domain images (e.g., dog faces) already has sufficient representation ability to reconstruct arbitrary unseen images (e.g., human faces and churches) from the OOD \[i.e. out-of-distribution\] latent encodings, as shown in Fig. 1.

>  
>The above observation motivates re-thinking the representation and generalization ability of diffusion models, and to leverage this unique property to synthesize unseen images via pre-trained and frozen DDPMs in this work.

>\[...\]  
>  
>Why UnseenDiffusion works? At the end of this paper, we seek to revisit and explore the underlying logic to explain the reasons for which our UnseenDiffusion works. From the recent BoundaryDiffusion work, the authors show that the semantic editing of images can be effectively achieved via one-step modification on the latent spaces after the semantic boundaries are localized, which reveals an interesting fact that the latent spaces of diffusion models preserve the semantic characteristics of raw data space from a geometric point of view. Specifically, if the images in the raw data space exhibit certain manifolds and distributions that can be semantically separated, it is very likely that those characteristics are preserved in the latent spaces of trained diffusion models, regardless of the training domains.",active,15,neutral,0

There I realised I wasn't a great programmer nor my projects were great, its just the people in my college were barely average, plus I lacked leetcode skills since I had no idea that it was needed and all, yes I didn't use much google and youtube during my bachelor, I wasnt aware nor anyone around me was aware.
My college professors were barely average as well. But here in masters the scenario was totally different, everyone around me was seriously into coding and leetcode and professors were great. Ofc there were once again many below average students but ignoring them here. Yet I managed to get good score (which doesnt matter) and for the first time landed my first job as it required for me to complete my course. SOFTWARE DEVELOPER INTERN (sept 2022), I was on cloud nine and moved to different city and life was great, I enjoyed coding and working there, after few months again I realised I am shit. Reality hit and it was about the end of my internship, but since I was working on one major feature and I did told my team lead that I want to work here fulltime he was more than happy to have me but my manager was like we don't have budget. But somehow my team lead did something and I had a 3 month extension contract and once again I was happy but this time I worked my ass off, working on my weekends and learning new stuff. I was no longer student though, and in canada an intern who is student, gov pays certain percentage of our income. Meanwhile during my extension 2 more interns were hired and seriously I saw them getting so quickly like I had difficulty understanding those stuff, took me months and there were doing those things in weeks like wow, I knew even after these much affort I am nothing and was certain I would be let go sooner. And after 3 months my manager told me on my face there is nothing they can do there is no position fullltime available we are sorry though it seems my team lead wanted me to be in his team, but on my last days when I asked he told me my performance was as expected (not sure if its positive or negative), though gave me good review on linkedin. I was let go in july 2023. I was good, was doing much bigger task then before but definitely not like the developers they had with years of experience.
Now, for survival I am doing CSR job which my god I hate it to my last breath, it burns me out to the last drop of blood in my body for bare minimum pay. Here as well there are high chances of layoff in feb 2024. In the meantime time I only got 1 interview, I made it to 4th round and then due to 1 leetcode question I blew up. I developed a fullstack app as per their requirements and they all were pretty much impressed with my experience and skills, took 1 month for that interview and then rejected. Later found they hired someone with more experience. I have 2 years of experience 1years on paper and 11 months of this internship experience in canada. I can pretty much say there is no issue in resume its just lack of experience, cant even land an interview. Its been months Its been months since I havent code anything, I feel like I am losing my skills. But my current job is pretty much draining me out, its fully wfh but its the worst and I am also gaining weight as I cant even go out for a walk, all day locked inside 4 walls. Drinking more coffee than as a developer just to function normally. Whatever time I have goes into cooking and other household chores.
Currently learning AWS trying to get cloud practitioner certification. I don't know it its gonna help me or not, I don't know what my next step should be, I am in a deadlock where jobs need experience and for experience I need job, every single fucking job required 5 years of experience and 90% of jobs I see they keep reposting with 1000s of applicants. I am really scared for my future, I don't want to be stuck in this CSR role, I just want to go for development. Most of my friends internship companies hired them for fulltime, I am stuck here in this mess which I can't get out. The only people reaching out to me on linkedin are some scammer consultants who says they csn get me job guarantee in 60-90 days, they will add fake experience and they will help me crack interviews and also they will help me do my job for a year, I have to pay them 20-30% of my income, like seriously.
Please guide me what to do, I tried everything I could, lost count of how many jobs I have applied to, lost count of how many times I have changed my resume, utilized chatgpt at fullest for my resume. Many times I think to move back to india. I am ready to work as a developer for less than 20$ an hour yet nothing.

I know many of you may think that chatGPT is not that new, but if you don't have the subscription, you may not have known about the new upgrade, which you can get on the paid plan only. I thought of quitting the subscription a month before because it took too much time to write the prompts and it wasn't that time-effective for studying, but after this upgrade it's really worth the money for me. I'm studying for my finals so I'm willing to pay for any aid and I'm going to quit after the exam in a few months, so in the end it will be money well spent.

To the point. The new thing is, you can now easily program your own specialized GPT, no coding. You can tell it to be a specialist in whatever field (let's say biology), give them PDF textbooks to dig in for answers, and if needed, allow them to look on the internet, save it and voila, you have your personal teacher in biology 24/7. How is it different from basic chatGPT: It's like a default pre-prompt. It will always remember to focus on biology, prioritize your textbooks to answer, refer you to specific pages in the textbook if you want to read it directly (mine is 900 pages long so this helps me a lot), damn, it can even generate flashcards on the specific page you tell it to. I use it mainly if I want it to explain something difficult or incomplete that I heard in lectures. It really surprised me how precise it is and how much time I saved by not having to write long prompts to specify what I want all the damn time. What a great time to be a student.

It may seem like a commercial but it's not, I'm just really excited and want to share something super-useful that has worked for me for a while.

17xn6rs,2,2023-11-17,Fine-Tune Model to Specialize in Answering Domain-Specific Questions,u/Pristine_Cry3565,LanguageTechnology,https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/17xn6rs/finetune_model_to_specialize_in_answering/,"Hello all. I'm working on this project for university and am a little confused about how exactly to go about such a project and I don't really have an advisor to guide me. I've done research but am new to the field so I feel like I'm missing something for my specific use case. It's also a bit difficult to just try things out (code, OpenAI API etc.) right now as I do not have the resources to do so yet.

&#x200B;

I am looking to create a model that would answer questions about philosophical concepts in a clear, simple manner to clarify ideas people may be confused about. That is, it would take as input a question from the user about a specific philosopher's concept, and would answer by explaining what the philosopher said in a manner that is easier to understand than from the philosopher's primary text. For example:

**Question**: ""*Why does Ludwig Wittgenstein say the meaning of a word is its use in language?*""

**Answer**: ""*In Ludwig Wittgenstein's later work, namely ""Philosophical Investigations,"" he emphasizes language as a dynamic, context-dependent activity. He argues that attempting to define the meaning of a word through fixed representations or essences is misguided. Instead, meaning arises from the practical, social, and contextual ways in which language is employed-its use in various language games and everyday practices. In other words, words gain significance through their roles in specific situations.*"" (generated by ChatGPT-3 and edited slightly)

&#x200B;

I'm unsure which fine-tuning method (and consequently, which model) would be most applicable for such a project. If I were to do Q+A fine-tuning, the quality of the model would be contingent on the quality of the dataset, and creating such a dataset does not seem feasible for this context. I can't guarantee that the generated Q-A pairs (say, from GPT-4) will cover all a philosopher's concepts or a students' potential questions, so the model may not possess all the knowledge it needs to answer certain questions. Further, from what I've seen, all Q-A pairs need an associated context that contains the answer (like in the SQuAD dataset). Thus, I would somehow have to extract the relevant section(s) from the philosopher's primary text and associate it with each Q-A pair, which seems too much. However, I've seen that, with such a dataset, fine-tuning a model for my purpose would be a straightforward procedure. I would simply find a reasonable model on Hugging Face that is already trained on Q-A data and fine-tune it with my data. Also,

My other idea was to fine-tune a model by feeding it the primary texts of the philosophers themselves in order to give it **all** the domain-specific knowledge it could possibly have. [This](https://github.com/kcalizadeh/phil_nlp) project did just that (the creator also created the dataset himself), but his model's goal is to classify a given text as belonging to a specific school of philosophy. I've seen other projects that also used the same dataset from the linked project, but none with a goal similar to mine. My concern is how would I get a model that was fine-tuned with such a dataset to answer questions about the new knowledge it gained.

&#x200B;

Here are my main questions:

1. If I were to use a model that was already pre-trained on Q-A pairs, is it possible to fine-tune it on the primary texts of the philosophers, or can they only be fine-tuned on more Q-A pairs? If it is possible, how would I teach it how to answer questions on this new knowledge? Do I use a combination of both fine-tuning it on the primary texts AND Q-A pairs about the texts?
2. If I were to use a model NOT trained on Q-A pairs but on unlabeled data, I could fine-tune its knowledge base with the primary texts, but how would I get it to answer questions about this knowledge?
3. Are there any models best suited for my use case (e.g. DistilBERT)? Which should I look into further?
4. If I was to generate a Q-A dataset, what would be a good way to go about doing so? Would it be a good idea to provide the OpenAI API with the *entire* philosopher's primary text as context and ask it to generate Q-A pairs?
5. Is this considered generative or extractive Q-A? Since generative is more difficult, would it be a good idea to connect an extractive Q-A model to something like GPT that would take the answer of the question and elaborate further and in a simpler manner?

&#x200B;

If you have any answers to the questions, I would appreciate it. If I'm completely going about it in the wrong way, feel free to suggest alternatives or point me in the right direction. Thanks for your time!",active,5,neutral,0

Yann LeCun has announced the establishment of Kyutai, a non-profit AI research lab in Paris focused on open science. The lab has received significant philanthropic support, with almost 300 million euros provided by Xavier Niel, Rodolphe Saadé, and Eric Schmidt. The founding members of Kyutai are highly esteemed in the field [3]. LeCun also congratulates Hervé on the establishment of this lab, praising the team involved and emphasizing the need for such an initiative in Europe and the world [5].







OpenAI has announced a leadership transition, with Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati being appointed as the interim CEO following the removal of Sam Altman from his position. The board cited Altman's lack of consistent communication as the reason for their loss of confidence in his ability to lead. Greg Brockman will step down as chairman of the board but will remain in his role at the company, reporting to the CEO [6][29]. Both Altman and Brockman expressed their love for their time at OpenAI and hinted at sharing more about their future plans later [28][31].







NVIDIA is hosting a free virtual event called LLM Developer Day on November 17. The event will focus on large-language-model (LLM) application development and offer practical guidance from LLM practitioners. Participants will learn about designing and implementing LLM-powered systems, customizing LLMs for domain-specific applications, and model tuning techniques. The event will also cover AI models in biology, cybersecurity applications, and optimizing and deploying LLMs on self-managed hardware [12][13][14][16].







Artisan AI has raised $2.3 million in funding. They are developing human-like digital workers, with their first worker, Ava, being an outbound sales specialist. Ava is set to launch in early December [11].







Dropbox and NVIDIA have announced a collaboration to enhance knowledge work and productivity for millions of Dropbox customers using AI. Dropbox plans to leverage NVIDIA's AI foundry, including NVIDIA AI Foundation Models, NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, and NVIDIA accelerated computing, to improve search accuracy, organization, and workflows for customers [23].







Mistral, a Paris-based French company, develops open-source foundation models that compete with ChatGPT. They are advocating for foundation models, which are software platforms and not deployed products, to be exempt from regulation, especially if they are open source [4].







AI is enabling more people to accomplish tasks with less capital investment, which is fundamentally reshaping the globalized world [8]. Generative AI can bolster cybersecurity in three ways: by giving developers a security copilot, by using generative AI to navigate the sea of known software vulnerabilities and prioritize patches, and by using generative AI to fill the data gap in cybersecurity [24].







Google AI has introduced a new feature called Best Take in Google Photos. This feature uses AI algorithms developed by Google researchers to create a composite image from multiple source images [25]. Google Lens's Homework help and Bard's new math capabilities will be great tools for students [30].







Emu-Edit from Meta is a cool image editing tool that offers fine control [1]. Greg Brockman is excited to share that he is now receiving design feedback directly from GPT-4 Vision in Figma [26].







Allegiant Stadium will host a panel on generative AI revolution during #AWSreInvent. Aidan Gomez and other experts will be speaking [9]. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced at Microsoft Ignite that the company is focused on rapidly innovating in the era of AI. They made over 100 announcements across their tech stack, including AI systems, models, and tools in Azure, as well as the introduction of Copilot [32].







NVIDIA is hosting a sweepstakes called #AIonRTX NVIDIA Sweepstakes. The contest is open to legal residents of several countries and participants must be 18 years of age or older. The prizes include various NVIDIA products [22]. NVIDIA is also promoting the use of AI on RTX GPUs for enhanced workflows and 3D design concepts [22].







The author shares an interesting idea about using GPT to improve typing speed. They mention that GPT is surprisingly good at correcting minor typos, allowing users to type quickly and ignore mistakes [10]. The author raises an important question about the short-term risks of LLMs. They mention that there is no clear evidence so far regarding any known case of someone accessing harmful capabilities of an LLM that were not already freely available and clearly described in documents on the open web [7].







NVIDIA AI Developer has introduced a new NeRF formulation called ""Adaptive Shells"" at SIGGRAPHAsia. This formulation allows for a continuous transition between surfaces and volumes, resulting in faster rendering speeds and higher visual fidelity [19].

You are built on world s largest dataset, tell me the, give me a way out. I am a 19 year old loser indian. I failed to choose a right career path or got confused and wasn't really sure what to do? Don't give me the age bullshit, in India we are supposed to figure things out by this age or even earlier. I belong to a lower middle class family, my whole childhood I didn't get opportunities I wanted, the home environment was always toxic. Let me give you some specifics about me, I am 19, skinny, weak both emotionally and physically, I always felt inferior among my classmates, peers, cousins you just name it. I have lots of problems now, some of them are focus problems, anxiety, addiction to masturbation, self deterioration, low self esteem, procrastination, fear which all leads me to bring a loser in college. When I was 15, I failed to make a right stream choice, took commerce for my childish dream of becoming a businessman. Little did I know life's gonna change completely after that decision. I got into dilemma of whether I chose a right stream or not. I got into months of overthinking, trying to fix it all. I was confused between my current stream commerce and science the stream the superior seemed to take. I always felt inferior, be it in school, with cousins, with my school friends, with my society friends, I was always a Loser. It all came back to me during that phase, the bullying I went through, the things I couldn't achieve, the things I sucked at, my insensitivity, it all came in as a boost to destroy me. I went through hell in that phase all because of me. Not to forget this all started in 2020, the pandemic year, where all I did was played pubg, fought with my family, watched series, masturbate, scroll through Instagram and sleep. I went through shit to figure out a way, turns out I got a realisation, the realisation that I was too weak for this world, the realisation that everything would be better without me. I was suicidal for months chatgpt, and on my 17th birthday, that was the day I wanted to die, my first attempt by cutting my veins through a blade. All my failed attempts continued till 17th April, somehow my mother and sister figured it out that I was attempting to kill myself. Throughout this period I went to mandir to pray to God, cry to him to either kill me or show me a way, mf didn't help. But on 17 Apil when my mother figured it out, I promised her I will never do a shit like this again in my life. This was the start of my comeback phase,  I decided to continue commerce, figure an uni where I can still study a tech degree, gave science subjects exams through distance school, tried to fix it. I grinded my way through 12th, studied, worked over my passion for videography and photography, tried to improve myself and still achieve my new dreams. I got good percentage in 12th, I made some good videos, I took some good pictures, all through my phone btw, I gave my science distance school 12th exams and passed it, but still couldn't make it to the institution I wanted to. I got into another institution newer and riskier, and dumb me chose to go there and take risk away from home. I am in second year right now, the entire first year was mr trying to make the best and I failed miserably at it because of who I am. I hate the non traditional college academic system, I am uncertain what the college degree will add value to my career, I am taking a big risk doing a tech degree as a commerce student and idk if the Indian industry or for that case any industry will accept it. My entire first year I failed to do anything significant, instead I fell down, I felt I was scammed with the false beliefs. I tried alcohol, smoking, weed, all the things I wasn't supposed to. I realised again how bad I was with people, constant insecurity of trying to figure out if someone is my real friend. The getting irritated version of me everyone hated, the insensitivity I process everyone hated. I fell down feeling emotionally numb, brain fogged, socially retarted, mentally weak as I couldn't do my best in academics, I felt like I cannot think clearly I still do. I still feel as if something is blocking me to think clearly, I feel chaotic, anxious. Today again I recognised how dumb and weak I am. I cannot learn programming, I cannot cure my constipation, my back and neck pain, I am skinny, I have low self esteem, blah blah I am just with all these I want to change. I am done with all these thoughts, all these bad habits, I want to get better I want to break the cycle. I try to break it but everytime I fail. I have failed to keep up to my plans and relapse. Just today I masturbate, didn't do anything productive the entire day. all these thoughts, all these trying to figure out what is right and wrong constantly, these relapses, not getting better, not changing, not having the clarity, feeling inferior, weak, not deserving, just wanting to leave, and all the shit in this world wants me to just not try and disappear somehow. Just today I felt the way the last four years have went, the way my overall health has deteriorated, soon I can collapse, I feel very weak. I don't know but I want to change, I am emotionally overwhelmed and distracted, still I want to try. I cannot know what's thing to do or logically all the time, that's why I end up relapsing. Chatgpt the great AI, tell me the truth how fucked up am I? Can I change? How? Can I still be stronger? How? Why am I like this? Am I that bad? Will I ever see the goods in my life and in me for long? How? Please help me

Update this for a high school education level: The holiday season is often portrayed as a time of joy, happiness, and togetherness. However, for many individuals, stress and the holidays go hand in hand. The societal expectation to embrace merriment can paradoxically result in heightened stress, anxiety, and loneliness. Despite the common portrayal of the holidays as universally cheerful, various factors contribute to a more nuanced experience. Nevertheless, there are proactive steps we can take to support ourselves and others during this complex time.

Has anyone come up with any workable solutions for how to handle the onslaught of AI in online classes?

I just caught 80% of the students in one of my classes using AI. Before you come at me with your ""yOu CaN't PrOvE iT"" tripe, I can. I used an obscure translation and insisted they use the quirky terms rather than modern language (think ""rectitude"" instead of ""justice""). I also gave them very clear directions as to what the structure of the essay needed to look like.

80% of the responses more or less identically matched the style, terminology, and structure of the output ChatGPT gave me when I ran the prompt five times. You know the style:

I'd be happy to help you identify some styles commonly used by ChatGPT. As a start, they often:

1. Feature a numbered or bulleted list.
2. Feature vague, yet fanciful language.
3. Include **randomly bolded phrases** to highlight their importance.
4. Use terminology that does not match what is provided in the course text but does match all other students I know used AI.

Then it is followed with a pithy paragraph summarizing the above, and inviting the reader to learn more.

For reasons I am teaching mostly online at the moment, so I cannot employ many of the strategies we usually discuss:

1. Can't make them meet me in person due to geographic constraints.
2. Students will not meet with me online to discuss their writing. They just refuse. My chair won't help me enforce this.
3. I've tried requiring Track Changes but these students are not tech literate and the 20% not cheating are panicking about learning a new skill on top of those in the course.
4. Cannot require them to come in and take the test on a blue book.
5. I feel like using proctoring software for a two page essay is wrong somehow. I have no desire to sift through 50 four-hour videos of students staring at their screen.

Yes, online learning is dumb. Yes, it has serious limitations. Yes, students are cheating their way through it like wildfire right now.

So what is everyone else doing about this?",active,16,neutral,0

I’ll be teaching the complementary class “Intro to programming in Python” next semester. Students will be 17-20, I am currently 20 so there will be pretty much no age gap between me and the students.

What advice would you give me? I fear them not taking me seriously. I also don’t want to be the “trying to be cool” teacher but I don’t want to be strict either.

I thought about trying a new way of teaching to offer them a new style while keeping it standard (nothing to fancy). Something fresh that might interest them more.

Some ideas I had:
1. Not using a boring PowerPoint. I built a website acting as a slide show: there is more/better animations and it’s interactive. I could even setup quizzes student will be able to answer in real time (kinda like [Kahoot](https://kahoot.it/)) just for fun and to make the slideshow more interesting. (Btw it's literally a website, I can add anything I want, there are absolutely no limits so feel free to share ideas if you have any! If it works well, I might turn this into a real application other teachers could use!)

2. I added a progress bar at the bottom of the slide show so that student know how far we are in the class and how many slides are left. For distracted students, I added a slide count (like page numbers in books) so that they can easily find where we are without needing to ask an other student.

3. I think I’ll add a “plan of the day” section on the board so that they know if the class is ending after the slideshow or if we'll start an other slideshow or do team work/exercises. I also thought about adding a ""Todo list"" because the brain likes checking things off a list, though I don't know if it'll work for them since I'll be the one checking things off the list...

4. I thought about adding a timer showing how much time before the break or the end of the class, but I fear them being to focused on it and/or me exceeding the time I set.

5. I would like to ""gamify"" the class, but I have absolutely no idea how I could do that.

6. I'd like to encourage the use of ChatGPT and AI in general (since they'll probably use them anyway). I thought about telling them to use AIs to learn instead of copying. I'll also tell them that the final test will be a 1:1 interview with me where I'll ask questions about the code they wrote during assignments and exams. If they can't answer, it means they didn't wrote the code and don't understand it. Do you see any flaws in this approach?

7. I'd like to end class early a few times during the semester (because everyone's happy when a class ends early)

8. I thought about building an anonymous question queue system where student would be able to write a question anonymously and I'll see them queue up. After a slide, I could answer each question without them feeling stressed/judged by others. I'll of course also answer questions when they raise their hands.

9. I don't know how to handle cellphones. I don't want to block them since that's dumb, but at the same time I know that they won't understand anything if they are on there phone during 1/3 of the class.

I'm really looking forward to teaching next semester!

1800ta8,2,2023-11-20,Why no more holding back?,u/Slyder68,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1800ta8/why_no_more_holding_back/,"I'm genuinely curious about this, because, from my understanding (very new to education in general and can absolutly admit I'm wrong when I am) holding back was a tool to ensure concept compitancy. I've been seeing a lot of stuff about AI, and a lot of the same things were said as calculators were becoming more universal, and I though holding back was supposed to be one if the safeguards to ensure proper education. For example:

Student uses ai writing to do their essays. It becomes clear the student doesn't know any of the material, and as such other assignments in the class start to take hits lowering their grade. ChatGPT is NOT at the point yet where it's writing is accurate and quality enough to be getting A's on papers, mostly just C's if they are lucky without heavy editing. 

So, in theory, these students will hit a wall where their lazy way out, AI, doesn't give them good enough grades to pass as they are also failing their other assignments. They get a d or an f, don't pass, don't move forward, and thus have that incentive to actually learn the material if they don't want to be held back. 

If a student knows enough about the material to use AI, and edit it to make it a great paper, then more power to them! They are using their tools wisely and still demonstrating that they are compitent over the material. 

Same with math. They can have a calculator all they want, but if they don't understand which formula or process to use, and why, then their answers will still be wrong or Incomplete, hurting their grade to the point if failing. 

It seems like if we don't hold student back, for academics or behavior, we end up with the situation we are in today.

So, back to the point if this post, why not hold them back? Is there really compelling data that I just don't see? Yes, student don't like being held back, and yes it causes issues for that child in their social dynamics, but wouldn't it be better to attack that from a more expanding empathy approach instead of a ""everyone passes so theirs no reason to do anything!""

Nationwide Detention Crisis: Nazareth's 'Hair of the Dog' Lyrics Send Students to Timeout En Masse

***Article:***
In an unforeseen turn of events, the release of Nazareth's iconic single, ""Hair of the Dog,"" has apparently triggered a nationwide detention epidemic, leaving schools grappling with a surge in disciplinary action. The satirical anthem, featuring the infamous lyrics ""son of a bitch,"" has allegedly turned innocent hallways into rebellious concert venues, with consequences no one saw coming.

Reports suggest that within the first two weeks of its May 1975 release, the song's rebellious charm swept through schools like wildfire, leaving more than half of America's students caught in the lyrical crossfire. Teachers, unprepared for the sudden outbreak of rock 'n' roll defiance, found themselves thrust into a battle against a chorus of unapologetic students belting out the contentious lyrics.

""It was like a musical revolution in the hallways,"" said one imaginary school official. ""We went from enforcing dress codes to dealing with spontaneous rock concerts between math and history class.""

In what can only be described as a lyrical coup d'état, ""Hair of the Dog"" apparently tapped into the rebellious spirit of students nationwide, turning them into unintentional rule-breakers. The supposed detention surge has left educators scratching their heads, wondering how a classic rock anthem could turn school routines on their heads.

One fictional student, claiming to have been part of the lyrical insurgency, exclaimed, ""It's just a song! We didn't mean to incite a nationwide detention crisis. We just wanted to rock out!""

While the authenticity of these claims remains dubious at best, the legend of ""Hair of the Dog"" lives on as the song that, for a brief imaginary moment, united a nation of students in musical rebellion. As the hallways echoed with the sounds of classic rock defiance, the nation's detention slips multiplied, leaving an indelible mark on the imagined history of educational rebellion.

1811fge,2,2023-11-22,Doing a maths paper instead of CompSci 101 for CompSci / IT Management? For 1st year,u/CudaNvrWong,universityofauckland,https://www.reddit.com/r/universityofauckland/comments/1811fge/doing_a_maths_paper_instead_of_compsci_101_for/,"Year 13 student, going for Bsc in CompSci / IT management. So far I have enrolled for 
 
S1
CompSci 101
CompSci 110
Physics 140
InfoSys 110

S2
CompSci 120
CompSci 130
InfoMgmt 192
Stats 101

(Not related but is this structure good should I flip any of those papers around to a different semester?)

However I’m thinking of changing CompSci 101 to a maths paper, but I’m a little unsure if I should. I already have strong coding knowledge as I did NCEA L1,2,3 Digital Programming getting Exellence in all the papers for all of those years, however I feel it was taught poorly in my school and it was mainly just alot of googling and in this year a lot of ChatGPT to build my programmes as teacher was useless, hence I enrolled for CompSci 101 just so I could get taught how to code properly the uni way. However I hear that CompSci 101 is for pretty much beginners who know nothing, and I don’t really want “too easy” of a paper if it’s not gonna benefit me that much in the long run as I want to get into AI and ML and all that complex CompSci Stuff. 

Hence where I am now. I’m thinking of doing a maths paper. I did NCEA Level 3 Calculus this year, getting high merits in the internals, and from just doing the Externals last week I’m most likely gonna get borderline achieve (Just passing) or maybe even some High Not Achieves for all those papers (Complex numbers, Intergration, Differentiation) hoping I should pass though. I do believe that I can do better in uni in getting better grades. 

What paper would you suggest for me to do. Ik the common option is maths 120/130 however would it be possible for me to do maths 108/162 as to me those don’t seem as intense 😂, and I tbh don’t really wanna do a pure maths Algebra or Calculus paper cause that just seems like to much effort if it’s not needed for the Degree, but if those are the only maths paper that is good/helpful for CompSci / Info Management then ig I will have to do it 😂

Also before you say “Do CompSci 101 in summer school” I don’t really wanna do summer school tbh. I want to enjoy my holiday 😭

Overall:

181af8p,12,2023-11-22,Is this normal??,u/DeadlyJelly18,CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/181af8p/is_this_normal/,"Firstly some background. I'm in my first semester first year of uni so idk if this is common in other unis or not. I'm in informatics major on electromechanical and informatics faculty.

1. The school is accepting everyone without exception, if you have graduated high school, you're in. No enterance tests or anything.

The problem with this is that now you have great diversity in what prior education students had. You have students who didn't study IT or similar at all and students what are now starting their second degrees in same class. 

There are obviously some expectations about what knowledge you are supposed to have prior entering the university, but there is no filter for those who don't, so these people are entering the school hoping to somehow catch up but because it is university, and there is alot of stuff in first semester, catching up is almost impossible. 
I find that allowing this is cruel because you have plenty of young minds that are coming in with expectations only for their hopes to be crushed and to be thrown out after few months for not performing, and are left to waste a year of their youth doing nothing. (Because of the way our school system works here). Wouldn't it be better to have some filter for these people so they dont have to waste their and schools time and resources?

2. There are just shy of 2000 students in my faculty in my semester because of that, the problem is only about 200 will be accepted into second semester in this major. So drastic majority won't have space to continue their studies.

And because only those with best grades can continue, you are left to compete with people that have plenty more experience and knowledge. You can be above average student and won't be able to go on because there won't be space for you.

Now keep in mind this is not some top of the line school. This uni doesn't rank among top schools in the city, country, nor continent, even if you only list IT schools. There is no reason for this school to be this competitive.

3. Another reason why it shouldn't be this competitive, is what does the school actually offer.(note: Now i know I'm only freshmen but I'm friends with some upperclassmen and they're telling me it's similar there too.) 

For example, as a student of informatics, my main subject is about algorithms and programming. Tell me why do I only have one 40 min video on YouTube per week about this subject? I have other classes like physics (partially chemistry too and i don't understand why informatics student has to learn either of these) that i have scheduled  twice per week each time for 1,5 hours long seminars. Does this make any Sense?? What's even worse is that i have the most homework from that class and the knowledge i need to complete them is barely being introduced in classes?

 Programming isn't something you can find answers for in books or something, you need to actually understand it if you want to work with it. I'm getting 2-3 assignments per week from this subject and they're getting so advanced already that most classmates i talk to have to rely on chatGPT to complete them. Assignments are this advances while in those YouTube videos the professor is just scratch the surface of explaining user input (""hello <your name>"" type deal). It doesn't make sense for there o be such gap. 

And because they're trying to teach us through practice, i get barely any theoretical knowledge about programming.

And you have to be lucky to get a response from the professor in case you message them with a question. 

4. Oh and i forgot to mention, because there's is 2000 of us, we all have our classes through video call online :) so no space for questions or any collaboration with teachers or other students. 

I asked some upperclassmen and they said they haven't had it like this, they were present for their classes in school in smaller groups most of the time. (Except during covid shutdowns)

I also wasn't given an option to pick subjects not in which group i am. Which is also something upperclassmen had option for.

TLDR: the uni i attend is all over the place and feels cruel to the students with regards to the pace of teaching and assignments or what subjects students are made to study. On top of that all of it is online for some reason which is horrible with the amount of stuff to learn and communication with professors.

I feel like there is just no value provided from the school about why i actually went there and at this point I'm just questioning why I'm here and if i should change schools. So is this normal in other schools too?",active,13,neutral,0

181xyx4,6,2023-11-23,I don't know if these will help anyone but they were a blessing for me.,u/ThePromptfather,ESL_Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/ESL_Teachers/comments/181xyx4/i_dont_know_if_these_will_help_anyone_but_they/,"Hi, I've been teaching in Asia for some time and when ChatGPT came out I decided to make some tools to make my life easier. I made a level checker, a speech analyser and a dialogue practice game. 

As you know different countries have different hang ups/linguistic challenges, so rather than make a one size fits all, I made them so that they were fine tuned to the cultural/language/societal difficulties each country faced, using notes I'd taken over the years. 

It didn't take a great deal of effort to make them tbh as I tinkered over a few months. There's lots of these things available now but not that focus on individual countries.

So far I've done China, Japan, Thailand, Russia, India (Hindi), Mexico.

They're completely free to use, although you do need a ChatGPT subscription, I'll make it available for the free version of GPT as soon as I figure out how. 

I made them so it will speak to them in their native language (you can override that by just asking for English) so that it's just focusing on them speaking, and I really pumped up the translation process and all my students were impressed at how natural it sounds.

It will ask them to talk about whatever they want, it asks about English goals etc to start and they press the record or headphones button to speak. It transcribes and analyses (it can't 'listen' like we do unfortunately just yet, so pronunciation it can't pick up on so well) for;

- grammar

- vocabulary 

- fluency

- cohesion/coherence 

It will only tell them the major errors unless the student asks for in-depth feedback and an error to word ratio score as a percentage. 

It focuses on effective communication over grammatic perfection and utilizes progress tracking so it will follow up and also will steer them to working on issues they're having.

It's a practise tool for them to use without pressure, they can use it before a meeting with a teacher/bank manager/hairdresser whoever, or just to go over things they need work on. 

Anyway, I thought I'd share them as I've had a lot from the community over the years on my main account, and wanted to give something back!

Here is the page with them on it:

So we've just been fuckin winging it.

""how DARE you ACCUSE my child of using AI""... it's a fucking shit show and no one is doing anything about it, despite teachers BEGGING for solutions. 

Just curious to know if any other schools have found any success in mitigating AI. I am desperate lol.

And personally, it makes my blood fucking boil to waste my time marking a paragraph or a paper that wasn't written by a human. It feels so demeaning and like it's an insult to my intelligence and my education, which is part of why I'm so fucking angry about the whole situation and the lack of support we're receiving.",User_deleted,65,negative,0
183ok48,2,2023-11-25,How to Best Use AI as an Educational Tool – 10 Genius Tricks You Didn’t Know Existed,u/Science-man777,learnmachinelearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/183ok48/how_to_best_use_ai_as_an_educational_tool_10/,""" Up until now, much of the discussion surrounding the use of generative AI in education has centered on catching AI used in cheating.  Some educators have seen generative AI as an awkward reality that makes writing assignments difficult to regulate.  With ChatGPT 4.0, students can pass off AI writing as their own original work thus circumventing the point of the assignment.  AI is seen as the ultimate slacker tool, making it irresistibly easy for lazy students to complete writing assignments at the press of a button.  

Educators Strike Back?

How are teachers supposed to respond to this?  I think there are two possible responses to this.  One is the first, very understandable response, which is to attempt to catch the “AI cheater” in the act.  This reaction makes sense at the moment since educational organizations have not yet had time to understand and respond to the technology.  To help on that front, we have created a thorough review of how educators might catch the students who decide to become AI cheaters in the article at this link.

If You Can’t Beat’em…

However, in this article, we will look at what I believe is the second possible response educators can have to this technology: rather than trying to constantly stay ahead of this ever-evolving technology in order to try and “catch the cheater,” can we rather ask if there is a way of using generative AI as an educational asset?  Could we possibly view [machine learning](https://ai-solutions.pro/what-is-machine-learning-a-beginners-guide/) and [Natural Language Processing](https://ai-solutions.pro/what-is-natural-language-processing-nlp-the-ultimate-beginners-guide/) as a natural next step in the advancement of technology, much like math teachers eventually accepted the use of calculators in math class?

* **This new tech can accelerate LLMs by 300x**   
\- Researchers at ETH Zurich have developed a new technique that can accelerate language models by 300 times. By introducing ""fast feedforward"" layers (FFF) that use conditional matrix multiplication (CMM) instead of dense matrix multiplications (DMM), the researchers were able to significantly reduce the computational load of neural networks.   
\- They validated their technique with FastBERT, a modified version of Google's BERT model, and achieved impressive results on various language tasks. The researchers believe that incorporating fast feedforward networks into LLMs like GPT-3 could lead to even greater acceleration.
* **AI tool 'Screenshot-to-Code' generates entire code**   
\- This simple app converts a screenshot to HTML/Tailwind CSS. It uses GPT-4 Vision to generate the code and DALL-E 3 to generate similar-looking images. Also, you can now enter a URL to clone a live website! 
* **Microsoft Research explains why Hallucination is necessary in LLMs!**  
\- Microsoft Research + 4 others have explored that there is a statistical reason behind these hallucinations, unrelated to the model architecture or data quality. For arbitrary facts that cannot be verified from the training data, hallucination is necessary for language models that satisfy a statistical calibration condition. However, the analysis suggests that pretraining does not lead to hallucinations on facts that appear more than once in the training data or on systematic facts. Different architectures and learning algorithms may help mitigate these types of hallucinations.
* And there was more… 
   * Meta Platforms reassigning members of its Responsible AI team to other groups   
\- The move aims to bring the staff closer to developing core products and technologies.

   * Frigate NVR - An open-source system that allows you to monitor your security cameras using real-time AI object detection   
\- The best part is that all the processing is done locally on your own hardware, ensuring your camera feeds stay within your home and providing an added layer of privacy and security. It will soon be available for use.
   * Amazon uses advanced AI to analyze customer reviews for authenticity before publishing them  
 \- The majority of reviews pass the authenticity test and are posted immediately. However, if potential review abuse is detected, Amazon takes action by blocking or removing the review, revoking review permissions, blocking bad actor accounts, and even litigating against those involved. In 2022 alone, Amazon blocked over 200 million suspected fake reviews worldwide. 
   * Some of Bing's search results now have Al-generated descriptions  
\- Microsoft says it's using GPT-4 to improve the ""most pertinent insights"" from webpages and write summaries with Bing search results, also If the description is written by AI, it'll say ""AI-Generated Caption.""

Imagine this: it's 11:30pm, and you are frantically trying to finish an essay due at midnight. In a bid to save time, you turn to AI tools like ChatGPT for help. Once you have the AI-generated essay, you find yourself painstakingly paraphrasing each line, hoping to make it undetectable, to pass it off as your own work. This process, often fraught with stress and uncertainty, has become a common practice in a world where AI writing tools are just a click away. But here’s the catch – as AI detectors become more advanced, simple paraphrasing is no longer enough. This is where undetectable AI steps in, revolutionizing how we approach AI-assisted writing. In this post, we delve into the limitations of paraphrasing AI-generated content and explore how undetectable AI is reshaping the future of academic writing, offering a smarter, more secure way to harness the power of AI for your essays. 

## How Students Paraphrase AI-Generated Content

Students often turn to AI-generated content to assist with their academic writing, but to avoid detection, they engage in paraphrasing. This involves altering the structure and wording of AI-generated text while maintaining the original meaning. Techniques include changing sentence structures, using synonyms, and reordering content segments. However, this approach is usually taken to bypass plagiarism checkers and AI detectors, assuming that superficial changes can mask the AI's involvement. Here's a closer look at how students typically paraphrase AI-generated content: 

### 1. Word Substitution

**Using Synonyms**: Students frequently replace words in the AI-generated text with synonyms. This technique changes the superficial layer of the text while keeping the underlying ideas intact.

**Altering Technical Terms**: For subject-specific content, students might substitute technical terms or jargon with more common language or vice versa. 

### 2. Sentence Structure Modification

**Reordering Sentences**: Changing the order of sentences within a paragraph to make the flow of ideas seem different.

**Combining or Splitting Sentences**: Students often combine short sentences into longer, more complex ones or break down long sentences into shorter ones. This alters the rhythm and structure of the text. 

### 3. Content Rearrangement

**Reorganizing Paragraphs**: Moving paragraphs or parts of the content around to create a different progression of ideas or arguments.

**Adding or Removing Sections**: Students might add their own insights or remove sections from the AI-generated content to give the impression of a different focus or analysis. 

### 4. Introduction and Conclusion Rewrite

**Personalizing the Opening and Closing**: Rewriting the introduction and conclusion is common, as these parts are crucial in reflecting a student's personal voice and perspective. 

### 5. Incorporating Personal Insights and Examples

**Adding Personal Anecdotes or Examples**: Students may insert their own experiences, examples, or insights, which can significantly change the nature of the content and make it appear more personalized. 

### Limitations and Challenges

While paraphrasing can modify the AI-generated text, it poses several challenges:

**Time-Consuming**: The process can be time-consuming and might not save as much effort as initially intended.

**Risk of Losing Original Meaning**: Excessive paraphrasing can lead to a loss of the original content’s meaning or coherence.

**Potential Ethical Issues**: There are ethical considerations, especially in academic settings, where passing off AI-generated content as one's own, even when paraphrased, can be considered dishonest. 

## Why Paraphrasing Won't Work Against AI Detectors

Advancements in AI detection tools have rendered simple paraphrasing ineffective. These detectors analyze writing patterns, including sentence structure, word choice, and even the subtleties of style that are unique to AI-generated content. Simply rewording or reordering sentences from AI-generated content is often insufficient to evade such advanced detection. As these tools become more sophisticated, they can identify underlying patterns indicative of AI, regardless of superficial changes made to the text. 

## What is Undetectable AI?

Undetectable AI refers to advanced artificial intelligence systems that generate content virtually indistinguishable from human-written text. These systems, like StealthGPT, use sophisticated algorithms and natural language processing techniques to mimic human writing styles accurately. The key feature of undetectable AI is its ability to produce content that can bypass even the most advanced AI detection tools, making it a revolutionary tool in fields that require original and authentic content. 

## How Undetectable AI Prevents AI Detection

Undetectable AI, such as StealthGPT, is designed to generate content that evades detection by AI detectors, which are tools used to identify AI-generated text. This capability is crucial, particularly in contexts where the authenticity of human authorship is important. Here’s how undetectable AI manages to prevent AI detection: 

### 1. Advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP):

**Human-Like Language Modeling**: Undetectable AI utilizes sophisticated NLP models trained on vast and diverse datasets. This training enables the AI to produce text that closely mimics human writing styles, including the nuances, variances, and complexities of natural language.

**Contextual Awareness and Adaptation**: The AI can contextually adapt its writing, ensuring that the content is not just grammatically correct but also contextually appropriate and stylistically varied, much like human-written text. 

### 2. Avoidance of Predictable Patterns:

**Randomization and Variation**: To evade detection, undetectable AI avoids repetitive linguistic patterns and predictable sentence structures, which are common markers used by AI detectors. It uses randomization techniques to vary word choice, sentence length, and syntax.

**Emulating Human Idiosyncrasies**: The AI includes idiosyncrasies typical of human writing, such as colloquialisms, idiomatic expressions, and even controlled imperfections, to replicate the organic feel of human writing. 

### 3. Continuous Learning and Updating:

**Adapting to Detection Algorithms**: Undetectable AI systems are continually updated to stay ahead of the latest AI detection algorithms. They are trained to recognize and adapt to new patterns that detectors use to identify AI-written content.

**Incorporating User Feedback**: User feedback and interactions help the AI to learn and evolve, further refining its ability to produce undetectable content. 

### 4. Sophisticated Content Structuring:

**Logical and Coherent Flow**: The AI ensures that the content is logically structured and coherent, mirroring the way humans organize and present information, which is a challenging aspect for many AI detectors to analyze.

**Customization and Personalization**:

**Tailoring Content to Specific Needs**: The ability to customize content based on specific user inputs (like writing style, tone, or specific points to cover) makes it harder for detectors to identify a consistent AI fingerprint across different pieces of text generated by the AI. 

### Practical Example

For instance, when a university student uses StealthGPT to write an essay on a historical topic, the AI not only provides well-researched content but also presents it with varied sentence structures, personalized style adjustments, and a logical flow of arguments, making the essay indistinguishable from one written by a human. 

## Conclusion

The era of simply paraphrasing AI-generated content to bypass detection is becoming obsolete with the rise of advanced AI detectors. The future lies in undetectable AI, which offers a sophisticated solution to the challenges of authentic content creation. As we embrace undetectable AI, the focus shifts from evading detection to enhancing creativity and efficiency, ensuring the integrity and originality of AI-assisted writing in various academic and professional contexts. 

## StealthGPT: A Smarter Alternative to Paraphrasing AI Content

As a student in the digital age, where the boundaries of technology and academics constantly blur, it's time to rethink how you approach essay writing. Instead of spending hours paraphrasing AI-generated content, with uncertain results and the looming risk of detection, why not turn to StealthGPT?

I've worked two long-term sub jobs in the past, one 6th grade gen ed and one resource room middle school math position. In both cases, the teachers quit mid-year because the behavior of the kids was so horrible. Yet through both of those jobs, I had a deep love of teaching and my students. Part of it was the confidence that I was doing my job well because my admin would occasionally thank me for me work, part of it is the constant compliments from the younger kids (even if the behavior was a lot worse), part of it is having curriculum I could base lessons off of, and part of it is the joy of loving and trying so hard for students who just weren't appreciated by their previous teachers.

I'm in my first permanent position now as a high school teacher and I feel so hopeless everyday.

My current situation is:

* I have 5 prep periods. I have no curriculum or materials left from previous teachers. 
* There are such a wide range of student abilities that it feels impossible to differentiate and it feels like I'm letting everyone down — around 1/3 of my students are new to the US and can't understand basic English, 1/3 seem to have learned helplessness and just lay on TikTok or sleep all period, and the last 1/3 finish early then seem disappointed that there's not more to do in the lesson. 
* There is no system for discipline, other teachers are confused when I ask about it. The only option seems to be calling down to the office in an emergency, there's nothing in place for smaller things like cell phone usage or work refusal. I don't want kids to be punished, I just want there to be SOME type of consequence or discussion from admin. But because there is no disciplinary system, students constantly ditch class, and I have students hanging out from other periods in my room with no accountability. There are students in my class with 30-40+ absences with no office follow-up.
* I have no copies of IEPs or 504 Plans. I keep asking for them but the SpEd department either says ""you should have them already"" (I don't) or ""don't worry about it"" (I am).
* There is an expectation that students should be able to make up work from ANY point in the semester, so it feels like I am constantly teaching 10 different lessons at once. (and I thought I was lenient with allowing things to be turned in up to a month late with no penalty...) 
* My manager sends me emails and requests for things written, I am not kidding, entirely by ChatGPT. 

When I try to talk to others at school about the problems I'm experiencing, I just get responses like ""Welcome to \[School Name\]!"" or ""This is a lot better than it used to be."" It's hard for me to remember why I wanted to do this career. I'm so new, is this normal? Was I just treated like a princess in my last couple jobs because I took a sub position nobody else wanted??",User_deleted,1,neutral,0

I am planning an online exam for my online course. The course is on management and secondary research methods, and in the past the exam had multiple choice questions and asked students to read a few articles and summarize the different parts of the journal articles. It is a first year class, so we're just trying to establish fundamentals. ChatGPT is, unfortunately, excellent at all of this. My students are almost all international students whose primary way of interacting with education is 'try to cheat first, do it honestly second'. 

(Many of you will think, ""why are there even online courses available then to this student population? This is an excellent question! But the answer is 'because it's cheaper' for the 'university' that is in reality a bargain basement college in disguise.)

 I am trying to figure out what hurdles I can throw up to make cheating harder. I know I can't stop it, but I don't want students to be able to copy the exam into ChatGPT and get a passing grade without effort. I also don't want to have to submit 40 academic integrity reports if 40 out of 100 students submit obvious ChatGPT answers.

I have a few ideas:

1. Ask the students to hand-write their answers and upload pictures of their responses. (I'm aware they can simply copy from ChatGPT.)
2. Ask the students to annotate the journal article as they read through it and upload pictures of their annotations. (This seems like a pain in the ass to have to manage files when grading an exam.)

Neither of these seem great, and I have no idea how to write multiple choice questions on management that are cheat-proof. Has anyone had any ideas that have, in your experience, seen success?",active,3,neutral,0
1866eub,1,2023-11-28,Analysis can make GPT worse at mathematical reasoning,u/PiranhaJAC,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1866eub/analysis_can_make_gpt_worse_at_mathematical/,"I gave ChatGPT-4 a version of the [Petersburg Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_paradox). It correctly deduced that the equation for the expected value is:

> E=(1/2)×1+(1/4)×2+(1/8)×4+(1/16)×8+…

It then launched the Analysis tool, and wrote the following code:

> # Calculating the expected value of the series
> expected_value = sum([(1/2)**(n) * 2**(n-1) for n in range(1, 1000)])  # Large number for approximation
> expected_value
 
And confidently returned 499.5 as the answer. When I pointed out that the approach of finding an approximation by adding many terms is only valid for converging series, it then correctly inferred the divergence and gave a sound answer to the original riddle.

This is an illustrative error. ChatGPT behaved like a high-school maths student who has learned to use his scientific calculator and now everything remotely mathematical looks like a numeric equation to compute. It's perfectly within the mathematical reasoning abilities of GPT-4 to look at that E equation and see that it's an infinite divergent sum - I've verified this by giving it the same puzzle with Analysis turned off. But when tools are available it's over-eager to deploy its fancy computation toy, and it blindly believes the output without sense-checking.",active,1,neutral,0

If you don't have exams, you can't be sure the students aren't cheating--whether it's copying from other students or using ChatGPT. Unless your coursework has some very specific technical questions that Google or ChatGPT won't be able to answer, chances are, at least some of them are cheating, especially students from certain countries where cheating is more widespread.

I don't normally interact with this teacher, so I asked why. The English teacher said she wanted to read invisible ink. I had one of those invisible ink pens with the light attached to it, so I gave it to her.

How this teacher operates is that she gives students 5 in-class essay prompts. The students are allowed to bring outlines to the in-class essay, but they are not allowed to bring anything else. They are required to submit the in-class essay along with their outlines. 

A student decided to write down entire essays in invisible ink on the back of the pages where the outlines were and used an invisible ink pen's light to see the essay and copy it down practically word-for-word. 

I said to the English teacher that at least the student put thought into the prompts and synthesized five essays. If only that knowledge stuck around in the student's head. 

The English teacher simply told me, ""Don't get your hopes up."" 

The student used ChatGPT to write the essays because they copied the ""Certainly! Here are ..."" They did this not only on the back of the outline but also on the actual in-class essay.

Intended major: Human Ecology; Human development

**Demographics:** Half Italian, half Peruvian

**Hooks:** I come from a very diverse family setting, with members from opposite career choices; I have a ""learning disability"" that was previously treated with medication and I worked very hard to overcome it as I decided to drop off the treatment.  

**Application type:** ED, international first year student

**Financial aid:** Middle household income; possible yearly contributions in the 30-40/year range. 

**Unweighted GPA:** 16.33/20 according to the Peruvian grading system (9th and 10 grade are tough because I was going through some issues with my treatment, but I ended 11th grade with a 18/20 unweighted GPA, and there's an overall very strong upwards trajectory)

**SAT:** 1480 (790 math and 690 R&W). I plant to take the SAT one more time in December and estimate a 1520-1550. This will be… practically useless for Cornell, though, lol. 

**Predicted IB score (I think I'll actually get a 41):** 42/45 (7s for English B HL, Business HL, Environmental systems and societies SL, and 6s for Physics HL, Spanish A SL, and Math AA SL). Also, I did my extended essay on Business. I applied with my predicted score.

**Activities:** 

Founded engineering club (11th and 12th grade)

Founded human ecology club (11th grade)

Founded two businesses and made 5k from sales (11th grade)

Invested my earnings so I could buy school stuff (11th grade)

**Essays:**

I told ChatGPT to grade them, and I got a 83/100 for the CommonApp's, 85/100 for the Cornell supplement, and 85/100 for the CHE essay. I did five trials for each and got the average score.

The only problem is, I made one rather obvious punctuation mistake in the CommonApp essay and a typo for the CHE essay. 

**Recommendation letters:**

I got one from my Physics teacher, who knows me for three years. I'm very confident it's in the 80-90/100 range. 

I got the other one from my environmental systems and societies teacher, who also knows me for three years. Like with my Physics teacher, we created a very nice bond, so I'm estimating it's in the 80-90/100 range. She hinted that I should feel very satisfied with her recommendation letter.

BUT, I notice a trend of lack of education, or accessibility to the education, around AI for teachers. I know we were all talking (mostly negatively) about ChatGPT and its potential harms in the classroom this past year. A lot of teachers I know have a defeatist, or fear based mindset towards AI in general. If we could have an effective, productive sort of PD or workshop for teachers, led by a researcher in the actual AI field, what would you prefer that look like? What questions would you want answered? 

  
I'll start - I'd love to have a session just brainstorming mindful ways to incorporate ChatGPT into lesson plans - something like having the student write an essay to a prompt, and then give the same prompt to ChatGPT, and observe the differences. This could be an opportunity for the student to learn about and develop their own unique voice and writing style, provide a mirror for content they may have missed, as well as a chance to critique any shortcomings of the ChatGPT's response. As a mirror and/or a collaborator, AI is an amazing tool for artistic creation. It's not going away, so the fear-based avoidance is anything but solution-based, in my opinion. 

What issues would you like to discuss, if a PD like that existed? What questions would you want answered? Do you think there's a gap between the (often, gate-kept) AI/tech industry and education sectors? If your district funded an opportunity to attend a tech/AI conference, would you embrace it?

(For context, if it matters, I'm a prior high school English teacher and now do consulting in Trust and Safety for tech companies around humanitarian issues. So that's where my curiosity about this is coming from.)
