1ftcnn5,6,2024-09-30,Entire Section Seems Apathetic - What Am I Doing Wrong? ,u/Uptightcatlady,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1ftcnn5/entire_section_seems_apathetic_what_am_i_doing/,"Context: This is my first year teaching full-time, though not my first time teaching. I teach composition at a rural CC with a 5/5 load. I have 4 sections of English 101 this semester. They are all in-person. 

While each of my classes has their own quirks and issues, I have one class that just seems incredibly strange. None of the students act like they care to be there, and many of them just outright don't listen to instructions, tune out during lecture, etc. Of course, there are always a handful that do this in every class every semester. But this particular section seems to have a majority of students just straight up not listening and not doing their work. I can only think of about three students in this class who actually seem to care at all, and even that group has given me problems on a more minor scale. 

It may help to add that the class includes several athletes and ESL students. On the surface, I try not to let the demographics of the class influence my teaching, but I can't help but feel like it might be playing a role? Many of the students are just turning in absolute garbage written by what I suspect is ChatGPT (and those who are doing this are not currently passing the course). I have a very high number of D's and F's in this class, and the students just seem completely apathetic. Many of them only come once a week or once every two weeks, most of them turn work in late (despite a 10% deduction per day), and many do not follow instructions. Despite mandatory tutoring, feedback on drafts, in-class conferences, and giving them time to work in-class, I just cannot seem to get them to care about their shitty grades. 

Anyway, I guess I'm wondering to what extent this is normal, and what I can do to help mitigate such a high level of apathy? My other classes are nowhere near this level of bad. Other classes have a few problem students, but nowhere near as many as this particular section. I teach generally the same content to each of my 101s because we have strict departmental requirements for what we are supposed to assign and how we are supposed to grade 101 students (due to accreditation); however, I have tried to vary my instruction so that it is a bit more explicit for this class given the demographic. It does not seem to be working, lol. In fact, it might be getting worse. 

What can I do to help this class of seemingly apathetic students who won't do their work and won't ask for help? ",active,6,neutral,0

Despite how people may say ChatGPT makes mistakes and is not to be trusted, it hasn't had any problem for me. Plus it helps me understand an entire lecture in 3 seconds. 'Chatgpt, I didn't get that, explain it to me like a preschooler'. I've never been good at my maths, I was always into the other subjects. It's good to have a tutor that teaches me faster than any teacher could.  
But what are the drawbacks of this? What's the monkey's paw  
I feel guilty for 'cheating' but honestly, if ChatGPT is cheating then tutoring is cheating as well. They're both intelligent figures that tell you to try it by yourself first and then they give you an explanation on how to do it right (granted that's if you're trying the question first before GPTing it) (Which I'm doing).  
Also I rather cheat than get an F.  Again, is it really cheating if I'm reading a lecture's worth of paragraphing and solving the problem that is of trying to understand what ChatGPT is explaining to me? It's just a teacher. ",User_deleted,0,neutral,0

1ftkh2t,234,2024-10-01,Problems That I Encountered While Trying To Make A Game With Some Friends,u/Single_Investment64,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ftkh2t/problems_that_i_encountered_while_trying_to_make/,"Hello, I just wanted to share my mistakes and experiences in this post, maybe getting some feedback/criticism about it. Also sorry for grammar mistakes since English isn't my native language.

Firstly I think I should introduce myself a little bit, before the main theme of the post. I am a medical student in a different country then USA, currently in my last year of school. When I was in highschool, I caught interest in programming and started it as a hobby and it quickly turned into a passion. Since then, I made a couple of toy projects, a couple of abandoned not-toy projects and a reaaly big/time consuming fullstack project when I was part-timing in a job. Still to this day, I am working on my personal projects as a hobby in my little to no free-time. 

Let's get to the main topic then. Some months ago, in the beginning of April, I was chatting with a long friend of mine from my middle school. Let's refer him as ""Friend A"". He is currently doing masters on game design and also finished a game design major. He is currently unemployed so he suggested making a game with me and I gave a serious though about it. I've made a toy game with Unity while watching Brackeys tutorials in the past and I had a lot of fun. I also am somewhat experienced in coding. *Also I should note that getting instant feedback about what you make/code while making games gives a lot of satisfaction to me. Ah, and i thought maybe I can learn a lot of valuable things from my friends about making games.*

Here is the first mistake I made. I trusted my friend's knowledge without checking his previous experiences making games, and I trusted his major. I mean working with a person that getting a masters degree on game design is a great thing I thought. I was wrong :)

It seemed he had this though in his mind for a while. We talked about making a game that has a quality at least worth to publish on Steam. Then we came to the team. I told him that I can handle the coding part, most of it, but I don't have any knowledge on game design and game art, that he could do the game design part but we strongly need a person to handle the 2D art part. He agreed and we found a friend (Friend B) that can do a simple 2D art for us. Also this friend has a friend that could help in the game design aspects (Friend C), also majoring a game design degree. I said ok, then we got to planning.

  
Since we don't have any real experience making games, we decided on a simple roguelike  game with some money management properties. Small, simple, 2D pixel graphics. Then we decided our roles. The game designer friends will handle the game design and planning (they also offered help with coding, I said okay for the times when I would be unavailable due to school), I will handle the major coding part, the first mentioned friend's girlfriend and my other friend will handle the 2D art part. We were total of 5 people, I had high hopes.

  
Having unrealistic expectations and high hopes for this team was my second biggest mistake.

  
When we started making the game, I figured my teammates have no knowledge/experience working as a team. They never even used version control systems like git, GitHub, they don't know how to communicate and synchronize (idk if this is the correct term). So first, I taught them about simple things like this. No problem. 

  
Then we came to planning part. We brainstormed about a couple weeks. Everytime we make a discord call, Friend A has never have serious ideas about game itself, not a thing like ""I think this should be like this, we can't make this like this, this feature should be in our game."" but more like ""Hey guys, I heard about a few incubation centers for indie game developers. "". Friend A's girlfriend always mutes herself, never says anything. Friend B says okay to all things, Friend C says we should start a company. There is no idea coming from anyone. Then I talked about what kind of game was in my mind and told them. They accepted all of my ideas, never adding anything to it. I said okay, that's fine. I asked Friend A and Friend C to document what we talked about all these talks on Discord. To this day, we don't have any written things about our game's style, features, etc. Also, man, please put some ideas. If I had a solid game idea in my mind, I've probably already started to make it.

When there is no documents about the design, any plan, I don't know what to code. So I asked about a GDD, not like a huge one. I asked one like goes through general aspects of our ideas, I also asked them to open issues on github to give me opinions about what to code. The documentation part is still wonders but they created some issues. We started to work on them.

  
For the first 3 issues, they were player movement, one melee enemy and one ranged enemy. Friend A and C wanted to make melee and ranged enemies so I completed the movement scripts. Then Friend A asked for help for melee enemy so I helped him and waited for more open issues to come since we don't have any written requirements/documents about what the game should be like. Friend C finished his issue and sent it to me for a review. His ranged enemy worked wonderfully, there was some small/unsignificant errors on his part no problem, I told him about those things and he understood and thanked me. Then Friend A said he finished his issue. Sent me to a review, nothing works. I look at the code, the code is a mess. I asked him ""Did you write this code by yourself using some tutorials or did ChatGPT wrote all of it?"" He says chatgpt. I fixed the code for him, tought him about how he should have written this code for it to work.  He said ""I always use ChatGPT, it always worked! IDK about what I did wrong this time but I will not stop using chatGPT! I even made my graduation project using ChatGPT!"" lol. He doesn't even know what a single line of his code does. I always use github copilot as a helper so I am not against LLMs in coding but for someone who doesn't know how to code, I guess using LLMs for everything is a big no no.  There was a couple issues about Friend A like this so I told my friends that I will hande \*all of the coding part\* myself, they accepted it. Friend A wrote really shitty code that it was faster if o wrote it myself then refactoring his code.

  
After some time, i closed like 10 issues. Then we went to a 20 day long overseas vacation with a group. Friend A was also in this group so our progress for the game is halted. When we returned from vacation, i closed all issues on github and asked for news. One week passed, no issues, two week passed, no issues. On the third week returning from vacation, i gathered the team for meeting. I told them I have nothing to work with, I have to know what to code, there is no progress on the design part of the game since the first meeting, that they need to try to pay more attention. Also I asked for a project plan. Maybe a simple GDD. Maybe a simple list of the game features. Friend C says he is leaving. He says he expected more from Friend A. Yes, he was right but he as a game designer didn't do anything about the design. He left. Okay, we didn't lose anything from him leaving. Since then i completed like 30 issues, some of them are opened by myself. Still there is no documentation. We can't see ahead. We don't have a clue what to do next. If I could have handled all the game design and game art parts of a game, with the coding knowledge I have, I could have made the whole game by myself too but neither i have time for those parts nor any knowledge/ability. 



I again asked Friend A for a project plan, 3 days later he sent me a single .png with a 10-11 orange colored bars named Gannt chart. Nothing more. Then I left too.

  
I guess in our universities' game design departmens, they don't teach students anything or my beloved Friend A somehow passed his lessons with cheating/copying/chatGPT. From the start of the project, he played LoL for stable 8 hours a day. Probably has a worked on the game like a total 10-15 hours. I wasted a lot of time doing hours of pointless coding sessions, we still don't have any assets for the game. Everything is a placeholder box. Later I learned Friend A didin't checked any finished mechanics even once. Maybe he didn't opened the game folder even once. What did I wasted my tens of hours for?

  
So I learned if I wanted to start a serious project, I have to find serious people as at least as me. Also please, do not trust friends. In my mind, game design degree is reduced to nothing, choose whom to work with with a great consideration.",active,249,neutral,0

I’m currently taking Biology HL ( grade 12 ) i have almost 7 months left till my externals. I’m aiming for a 7, but I feel like I’m just an average student in bio. In my final school exams, I usually score around 30/40, so I know I need to work harder for the IB.

I typically take notes based on the IB guide, and I’ve started restudying the material I covered in Grade 11. My teacher mentioned that the best way to get a 7 is to memorize the content, but I’m not quite sure how to do that effectively. My usual study method is studying the content ( from my notes ) first and then solve some past papers like revision village or the question bank, but I’m looking for a resource—like a book or notes—that covers everything I need to memorize especially from the guide ig like actually everyything. i just think it'd be easier to just memorize already made notes or whatever instead of making my own but I'm always scared to trust someone's resources o the ones online like what if they missed something.

I’m definitely planning to solve past papers and write down what I remember, but if anyone has tips or resources that ACTUALLY HELPED them get a 6 or 7, I’d really appreciate it!

I also let ChatGPT help me plan my studies, so my plan for the next 30 weeks is to focus on one new subtopic each day ( that i take in class ), and on the weekends, I go over two subtopics from Grade 11 like restudy and solve pp. Right now, I’m using Kognity for my studies, but honestly it suckks it has too much info in some subtopics and in some too little. btw i have a total of 40 subtopics like A1.1,A1.2 .

This form of AI, which can understand and generate human-like text, presents a host of new possibilities for enhancing the learning experience.

In the corporate world, training employees is crucial for maintaining a competitive edge. ChatGPT can be employed to create interactive training modules that mimic real-life conversations, allowing employees to engage in simulated scenarios that improve their problem-solving skills and decision-making abilities. Additionally, it can serve as a 24/7 virtual assistant to answer questions, providing instant support and guidance.

For educators, ChatGPT opens up opportunities for personalized learning. It can help design custom-tailored educational content based on individual student needs and learning styles. Furthermore, it can assist in grading assignments and even giving constructive feedback, which can be time-consuming for teachers.

One of the most significant impacts of ChatGPT is its ability to overcome the one-size-fits-all approach. It adapts to the user's level of understanding, providing explanations, and examples to ensure comprehension. This adaptive learning approach is particularly effective for complicated subjects where learners might require different types of explanations.

However, the use of AI like ChatGPT raises questions about the integration with current educational philosophies and practices. Are we prepared to redesign our curricula to make the most of these technologies? How do we ensure the ethical use of AI in learning environments?

The potential of ChatGPT in virtual learning and training cannot be overstated. But as we navigate this new terrain, it's important to consider the broader implications on pedagogy, engagement, and the human touch that is so integral to the learning process. Let's discuss how we can leverage ChatGPT to enrich learning experiences without losing the personal element that fosters deeper understanding and growth.",active,1,positive,0

In the comments section a lot of people showed their view points, and why they deter students from cheating. A lot of common ones like ""at some point all that information you skipped out on will catch up to you"" or ""school is a place where you are allowed and suppose to make mistakes, and therefore learn, you won't have same opportunity in the job market"". However, one of those was a rather popular take, yet in my opinion most laughable one: ""Cheating hurts student's honor & integrity"".

Personally, I am against cheating. Since if it was allowed mainstream, the people's natural laziness would take over and they'd just cheat their way to all the high paying jobs without putting in the effort of actually processing the hard rough knowledge that makes those positions so high paying (because few can get in). Which in turn would result in a society with underqualified doctors, lawyers, and etc.

However, saying that cheating lowers student morality in this harsh brutal world where everyone fights for survival, is just hilarious. Nobody in real life plays fair. Sure, we might criticize students for having chatpgpt write their essays for them, yet in real world script writers and comic artists are now adopting this technology to pump out their product faster, in turn earning more money. Journals, magazines and news websites actively avoid giving citations to the big claims they usually make. Big tech actively plagiarizes stuff, the only difference between them and a student is that they have thousands of suitcase men ready to jump and devastate any lawsuit about to be thrown at them. Even if we lower down our view to everyday people, backstabbing and gossiping is extremely prominent. If people can, they WILL throw you under the bus. I've even seen this occur in schools, which is ironic considering it's the place that is suppose to teach you about values of Honor & Integrity.

It is no wonder that when somebody tells them that ""you're breaking the honor code"", students care less, because they know that it doesn't matter in real life. Heck, they don't even need to know, they can see it for themselves. All that truly matters is how good are you're at winning, not how fair you're at it.",User_deleted,0,negative,0

School just didn’t click for me, and I eventually dropped out. Fast forward to now, and I’m running my own AI startup. It’s been a long and unexpected journey, and I thought I’d share some of that with you all—just in case anyone else out there feels like they're not following the ""traditional"" path.

# School Didn’t Work, But Coding Did

To be honest, I hated school. I wasn’t good at it, and it didn’t feel like it was leading me anywhere. But then I stumbled into coding, and everything changed. I got into PHP and started learning frameworks like Symfony and Laravel on my own. That was really the beginning of everything for me.

Here’s a rough timeline of how things played out:

* **2009–2012**: Web Developer at R3 GIS – My first coding job.
* **2012–2020**: Backend Web Developer at ADDITIVE – I was the first developer, building the infrastructure and core software from the ground up.
* **2019**: Launched *AutoIdle* as a side project – My first step into entrepreneurship.
* **2020–2022**: Team Lead at ADDITIVE – Managed the development team and oversaw product builds.
* **2022–2024**: Head of Software at ADDITIVE – Led the entire software department.
* **2024**: Launched *MailWizard* and left ADDITIVE to focus on it full-time.

Looking back, it’s been a long, winding road with a lot of trial and error. It took me a while to realize that the traditional route wasn’t for me, but finding something I actually enjoyed—coding—completely shifted my mindset.

# The Road of Many (Failed) Side Projects

Before *AutoIdle*, there were a lot of failed side projects. I spent years trying out different ideas, hoping one of them would take off, but none of them ever really got users. I built *Zebrello*, a news reader that was supposed to deliver articles based on your interests. There was also a recipe app I thought could help organize meal planning, and an app to sell used items on multiple platforms like eBay and Facebook Marketplace. But despite my efforts, these projects never made it beyond a small group of supportive friends.

Honestly, it was frustrating. I'd work on these side projects during weekends and vacations, only to hit roadblocks when it came to getting them out there. But I learned something from each attempt, even if they didn’t go anywhere.

One thing I’ve found: vacations and stepping away from work are often when the best ideas come to me. In fact, *AutoIdle* itself was born during a Christmas vacation when I finally cleared my head and saw things from a new perspective.

# Turning a Side Project Into Something More: AutoIdle

When I built *AutoIdle* in 2019, I didn’t expect much. It was a Heroku add-on that idles unused apps to save resources. The idea was simple—useful for some people, but not groundbreaking. I threw it together over a holiday break, and at first, it seemed like just another side project that might fizzle out.

But over time, *AutoIdle* slowly started gaining traction. It wasn’t an overnight success, but people found it valuable, and by 2021, it had started turning a profit. It wasn’t huge, but it was enough to show me that I could build something people would pay for. After years of failed attempts, *AutoIdle* was the first side project that felt like it had real potential.

More than anything, it gave me the confidence to keep going and the belief that I could build something on my own terms.

# The AI Experiment That Turned Into MailWizard

Earlier this year, I was getting really fed up with how much time I spent writing emails. I tried using some AI tools, but nothing really worked the way I wanted. So, I figured, why not just build something myself? That’s how *MailWizard* started.

At first, I just saw it as another side project, but the more I worked on it, the more I felt like this could be something bigger. I eventually decided to quit my job and focus on it full-time. It was scary as hell, but sometimes you just have to take that leap.

When I started building *MailWizard*, I was using GPT-4 like a lot of people, but after a while, I realized it wasn’t the right fit for what I needed. That’s when I found out about Claude from Anthropic, and after testing it, I made the switch. It’s been a better fit for the app, and it’s helped me take the project to the next level.

I actually wrote a blog series about the whole process, if you’re curious about the details: [From GPT-4 to Claude: Building MailWizard](https://mailwizard.ai/blog/gpt4-to-claude-building-mailwizard-solo-developers-journey).

# The Toughest Part Isn't the Code

One thing I’ve learned is that the technical stuff, while challenging, isn’t the hardest part. What’s really tough is marketing and getting users. With *AutoIdle*, Heroku’s marketplace handled a lot of the visibility. But with *MailWizard*, it’s all on me to find users and get the word out. It’s been a huge learning curve, and I’m still figuring it out.

# Reflecting on 15 Years

If you had told me 15 years ago, when I was failing at school, that I’d be running an AI startup one day, I wouldn’t have believed you. I’m still learning, still figuring things out, but the fact that I’ve gotten this far feels like a win in itself.

At this point, *AutoIdle* provides me with a stable income, which is a relief, but my main focus is on growing *MailWizard* and seeing where I can take it.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that you don’t have to follow the ""traditional"" path to succeed. If you're into tech but feel like you're not fitting into the usual career boxes, it's totally possible to carve your own way. Just keep going, keep learning, and don’t be afraid to take risks. You never know where it might lead.

That’s it! Just thought I’d share in case anyone else is on a similar journey. Would love to hear if anyone else has made the leap from side project to full-time!",active,21,neutral,0

Body:

Hello fellow Redditors,

Today, I'd like to dive deep into discussing the capabilities of ChatGPT in enhancing data analysis and reporting tasks across various industries. Having witnessed the rapid advancements in AI and machine learning, I believe that ChatGPT, with its language understanding and generation skills, stands as a game-changer in the realm of data analytics.

ChatGPT's ability to understand and generate human-like text allows it to assist in creating comprehensive and insightful reports from chunks of raw data. For instance, in the finance sector, ChatGPT can be used to analyze market trends and generate investment reports, which could help in making informed decisions. Meanwhile, in healthcare, it could interpret patient data to assist in diagnosis and treatment plans, streamlining the workflow for medical professionals. 

But what really piques my interest is how ChatGPT can be customized for niche markets. Agriculture, for example, can benefit from predictive analytics regarding crop yields, soil health, and market demands. Similarly, ChatGPT can help educational institutions by evaluating student data to improve learning outcomes.

One key advantage of using ChatGPT is the speed with which it can process and summarize vast datasets, an otherwise time-consuming task. Moreover, its interactivity allows users to request specific insights or clarifications, making the analysis phase more dynamic and user-friendly.

The matter of trust and accuracy is always a concern when AI steps into the picture. However, with proper oversight and continual training, ChatGPT's performance in data analysis can not only complement but in some cases, outperform manual processing.

Now, I'm curious to know your thoughts and experiences with using ChatGPT in data analysis. Have you integrated it into your workflows? What challenges have you faced, and what successes have you celebrated? How do you see AI like ChatGPT evolving to serve data-driven decision-making in your industry?

Let's discuss how this tool is shaping the future of data analysis and reporting, and exchange insights that could help others leverage ChatGPT's potential to its fullest.

Looking forward to an engaging conversation!

Here are a few ways I’ve used it that you might not have thought of:

Graph Creation: Need a quick graph for class? Just instruct ChatGPT to use Python to generate it. Saves time and adds a visual punch to your lessons. This one is invaluable to me when creating new physics lessons.

Handwriting Transcription: Upload images of those hard-to-read student scribbles for easy transcription. No more squinting at illegible handwriting! If you have digital submissions of written work, it just takes a second to take a screenshot of part of your computer screen.

Observations & SPED Feedback: Freeform write your student observations, then prompt ChatGPT to format it into clear feedback for SPED teachers. Streamlines communication and documentation.

1fvrzhe,6,2024-10-04,Has anyone tried a rubric like this to counter AI use?,u/Adventurekitty74,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1fvrzhe/has_anyone_tried_a_rubric_like_this_to_counter_ai/,"My institution says if you dock a student points for cheating you have to file an academic misconduct report. This system works okay when you have a handful of cases. 

Sure the report is an online form, easy enough, but you also need to meet with the student individually and that takes a lot of time if it’s more than a few. If the student appeals you have to present to a committee designed to fail because the burden of proof is on the professor.

I have situations now where I have 50 or 100 students who are cheating weekly on coded projects. A few cases are classic plagiarism - copied another’s work - but now we also have misused ChatGPT and copied another students GPT’d code. We say in the syllabus and often in-class don’t use it because this is a foundations course. It’s running with scissors for you. 

Considering making the rubric on all future assignments maybe 50 points for convincing me through your use of problem solving and code that does not misuse AI/online resources. Then 50 percent for everything else. If it’s part of the rubric surely I can dock points if my checks flag the code? Would still submit academic misconduct forms for egregious cases. Students who want to argue their grade still could too, but then the burden of proof is on them and I can go back to being a teacher instead of this awful either punish everyone or no one choice currently in place. 

The issue to reiterate is that current policies were not designed for AI use and there is no middle ground more reasonable to manage available policy wise.

Think it might work?

The biggest breakthrough of the last month has to be the release of the o1 model from OpenAI. Even though it is a closed-source model. We were able to put a good piece together delving deep into its possible architecture. Is it really smarter than a PhD student or is that just hype? Can it really think so before it answers? The answer is both yes and no. Read the full article here.

Here's a sheet I used to know about AID offered: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQnvgb3sTpNvOijvcrALM2JrTF7o4ydrjeSVpe5CnUZoNLFhywcMnKxVX5E4lF0UVa1x1oJpSHhVmDL/pubhtml?gid=689728477&single=true](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQnvgb3sTpNvOijvcrALM2JrTF7o4ydrjeSVpe5CnUZoNLFhywcMnKxVX5E4lF0UVa1x1oJpSHhVmDL/pubhtml?gid=689728477&single=true)

Questions I'd love to get answered:

* I understand Northwestern and Johns Hopkins are crazy with acceptances, since I would also be applying for Aid, are there any chances of getting in?
* Where should I ED into where I get aid also?
* Any schools I should look into adding/removing? I was thinking of adding UMich as a reach
* Can I get into atleast one of my reaches? I don't really have high expectations. I see incredibly talented students getting rejected so I really have no clue.
* Do I submit my 3 on ap physics?
* Anything I need to switch order-wise on my EC list? anything I should take out/put in?",User_deleted,0,neutral,0

*Throw Away Account Because All My Friends Have My Original Account*

I (25F) am studying for my MBBS (Medicine) and recently married my boyfriend (27M) of five years. We had planned to get married after he could move to the States for work, so I could focus on finishing my degree and starting my career without traditional pressures. My in-laws come from a very orthodox background where men are expected to work and women stay home. To avoid those expectations, we wanted to wait.

However, my parents emotionally blackmailed me into marrying earlier, using lines like “What will people think?” and “You’re embarrassing us by delaying.” So, I gave in and married earlier than we wanted.

Now, I’m living with my husband’s joint family while continuing my studies. This includes not just my husband and me, but also his parents, his aunt and uncle, his brother (cousin) and sister-in-law, and his grandmother. My father-in-law, mother-in-law, and brother-in-law have been incredibly supportive—they treat me like their own daughter and sister, and they respect that I’m pursuing my medical degree. But my SIL (30F), BIL’s wife, along with my FIL’s brother and his wife, and especially my husband’s grandma (80F), have been making things difficult for me.

SIL seems jealous that I’m still studying, and she constantly throws passive-aggressive remarks my way, saying things like, “Not everyone can be lucky enough to have people support their little career dreams.” It’s clear she resents that I have ambitions outside of marriage, and that jealousy shows every chance she gets. But grandma is the worst. She keeps pushing the idea that I should prioritize being a good wife over my education. It’s always something like, “Women who don’t focus on their home will never be respected.” I’ve been holding it in for months, but last night was the breaking point.

I came home exhausted after a long day at the hospital, and grandma immediately started up with her usual criticisms. But this time, she crossed the line. She said, “Why are you wasting your time studying so much? No one’s going to respect you for thinking you’re better than your husband’s family. You’re just trying to make yourself feel important. Maybe that’s why your parents forced you to marry—they knew you’d fail otherwise.”

That comment was the last straw. I snapped and yelled at her. I told her she had no right to speak to me that way and that I wasn’t going to give up my education or dreams just because she had outdated views about a woman’s role. My husband, to his credit, immediately backed me up, telling his grandma to stop, but she just kept going. My FIL, MIL, and BIL tried to calm things down, but it was a mess.

After the fight, my husband didn’t say anything to me. He just stayed by my side, which I appreciated, but I felt guilty about causing such a big scene. I figured things would calm down after that, but a little while later, my SIL came into the room with her usual toxic energy. She said, “You know, you really embarrassed us all today. Just because you’re ‘educated’ doesn’t mean you can disrespect an elder. Maybe you should start focusing on being a wife instead of a student—it’s not like you’re going to work after all this, right?” Her words stung, and it’s clear she enjoys seeing me upset.

It Currently 2:40 am and I’m torn. I do feel bad for losing my temper, especially at an elderly woman, but grandma’s words were so hurtful. I’ve been dealing with so much emotional pressure from both sides of the family. I just couldn’t hold it in anymore, I feel I may have crossed a line and ruined my husbands relationship with his grandma.

Also my english is bad so I used chatgpt to improve my writing.

1fwbmw6,11,2024-10-04,Ideas to make AGI,u/greenray009,ArtificialInteligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1fwbmw6/ideas_to_make_agi/,"Hello! I’m a 4th-year computer science student with a background in intelligent systems, machine learning, and a bit of deep learning, graphics computing, and data mining. I’ve noticed a lot of hype around AI, but it seems that most of the focus is on scaling up existing models like transformers or neural networks (RNN, CNN, ANN), which largely mimic human neural systems.

While we’ve seen exciting developments with generative AI models such as GANs, VAEs, and Diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion), I feel these approaches still feel lacking to me or they fall short. The main issue is that they’re inherently biased due to the datasets they’re trained on and the architecture itself. To truly move towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), I think we need to make fundamental leaps in our understanding of knowledge representation and intelligence itself.

One area I find particularly intriguing is the role of tokenization in building large language models (LLMs). By assigning weights and embeddings to words, we create a form of context representation, which is a step in the right direction. But even with this progress, it’s clear that our models are just approximations - that they don’t have a real *understanding* of the world.

From what I’ve read in some research papers, one proposed path to AGI is to map and mimic a person’s brain at a much deeper level, incorporating elements of consciousness and self-awareness. However, this is more speculative and far from feasible at the moment. To achieve true AGI, I believe we need a new paradigm—a breakthrough in our understanding of intelligence that goes beyond merely scaling up neural networks or refining architectures.

My gut suggests that companies should focus more on the field of knowledge representation and transfer. Basically going back to the basics of information theory. And I think some of the techniques related to this are applied to deep learning but I felt like we needed more like a breakthrough.

This is why I suspect we might be heading towards another AI winter. Historically, when AI research failed to produce expected breakthroughs, it led to reduced funding and enthusiasm like in the early 70s I guess. We might see this again unless a revolutionary discovery occurs. But I’m curious to hear others’ thoughts on this. Do you think we’re close to such a paradigm shift, or are we still stuck at the stage of refining what we already know?",active,13,neutral,0
1fwkpjj,1,2024-10-05,College freshman: Is CS right for me?,u/D_Empire412,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1fwkpjj/college_freshman_is_cs_right_for_me/,"\*This may get a bit long but I feel understanding the whole picture is essential to my story.

I am a CS freshman at Stevens Institute of Technology. Since 6th grade, I felt CS was the right major for me to do because I have been a major tech enthusiast since then. It started when I was given a hand-me down iPhone 5 after my parents upgraded to the iPhone 7, at that time the latest and greatest, the year before. As the iPhone 5 didn't support iOS 11, the newest software at the time, and had trash battery life, I began to religiously research smartphones trying to pick out what I was going to upgrade to. As an Apple user who already had an iPad Pro and several Macs in the house, I naturally gravitated toward the iPhone X, at that time, a completely brand new never-before-seen phone, but of course, as a 12-year-old, I couldn't afford it, so I started religiously watching tech reviews, starting with smartphones, and even how to jailbreak my iPhone 5 to feel like an iPhone X, but eventually getting into laptops, desktops, weird gadgets, and everything else. By 7th grade, I already basically schooled myself on being well-versed in tech specs but that was only the beginning, as that year, I finally got the iPhone XS Max, and from then on, upgraded yearly to the latest ""Pro Max"" iPhone on release day, now owning the 16 Pro Max, while also trying a few Android phones like the ZFold 4 and Pixel 7 Pro. I also shortly after got a 2018 iPad Pro, which I upgraded to an M1 and now M4 iPad Pro, and in 2020, an M1 MacBook Air, which I upgraded to an M1 Pro 14"" MacBook Pro a year later on release day, and the M3 Max 16"" MacBook Pro two years after that (what I am using right now). Point is, I became a major, well-versed Apple (and really all tech) enthusiast, outsmarting Apple Store employees many times, and that inspired me to learn to code, with hopes of eventually learning iOS Development.

So, I applied to one of the top technical magnet high schools in my county and decided to choose CS as my CTE major. I had a great time there as most of the other students were tech enthusiasts and I enjoyed learning Python and Java and taking classes like AP CSP and CSA. However, I still had a major interest in iOS Development, so in 2022, as a sophomore, decided to take it upon myself to learn Intro to Swift and iOS Dev in an EDx course, and with those skills, made a basic storyboard app in UIKit, far from ideal. However, when summer came, I OD'd on it and took a break from it until I had a new idea, which happened in junior year when I began to develop a physics formula calculator in SwiftUI, which was actually looking promising, and I was almost considering releasing it to the App Store until realizing that it would take forever to hard-code the views for 100+ formulas. At that time, I didn't know about MVVM, archetypal views, or anything like that. But, that was also the year, my biggest ""false friend"" came into the picture: ChatGPT. ChatGPT could basically perfect my code and make it do whatever I want; no more searching Stack Overflow and trying to interpret the solutions. It just did it for me like a personalized coding assistant! At that time, I was over the moon about it, and I would say I may have made a mistake and become too reliant on it rather than understanding the actual code running underneath. As a 16-year-old, who was heavily optimistic about the future of tech, I didn't know any better though, and sadly, these AI coding habits have come back to haunt me ever since then.

Anyway, in April 2023, nearing the end of my junior year of HS, I met a fellow 17-year-old Redditor on [](https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/) who was also interested in iOS Development and we started talking and considered collaborating on projects. However, because I was trying to spend the summer on SAT Prep and College Admissions, I didn't really start working with him until after that was done, when, in December, I had the remarkable idea to build an iOS/Mac app to serve as an unofficial client for Google Gemini, written in SwiftUI with a native look and feel like the ChatGPT app. So, we got to work, and I quickly found out how talented of a developer he was as he was able to code complex UI and backend things I didn't even know existed and felt I couldn't hold a candle to with my over-reliance on ChatGPT, while still refusing to try to write the code by hand, knowing it would take so much longer. Anyway, by January, we released our first alpha version to the App Store, and over time, we added feature after feature, all while getting a large amount of downloads. We're now around 200K, and a big reason could be that we were one of the first native Gemini apps, and we were making nearly 1K/month each from in-app purchases. But, he was still leading most of the development, and while I began to feel it was unfair, since I was making good money, I wasn't complaining. I tried developing new features but was too afraid to push them because I know he would find something wrong with them and call me a ""terrible dev"". **But, unfortunately, today, my success with this project is gone. We have been REMOVED from the App Store as allegedly, we were a ""copycat of Gemini"".** We are not, we are an unofficial client, but Apple App Review doesn't listen. I felt like I had a great project on my resume but unfortunately, it is possible it's completely gone and my partner is no longer interested in working on it and IDK if I am either. I feel I would need a lot of catching up to do because I felt I took the easy way (using AI to help solve my code) too much. It killed me in AP CSA as it made it so much harder to think about what code does when running it (i.e. I no longer thought about function call traces).

However, the final nail in the coffin was my declining performance in math classes in high school and now in college. In HS, I got an A- in Algebra 2, B in Precalculus, and B in AP Calculus, but was borderline failing from February to April. At first, I didn't worry about it too much since I already got into a good college and felt like Calculus doesn't matter too much if I want to be a software dev. But, in my first semester at Stevens, a heavily-focused engineering and tech school, I am feeling the troubling affects of this first time. I failed my first exams in MA 125 (Vectors and Matrices) and PEP 111 (Physics and Mechanics) very badly and TBH, don't have a lot of interest in studying these subjects or teaching myself how to do Gaussian Elimination. I would like to get at least a 3.2 GPA so I can stay in Stevens' Pinnacle Scholars (Honors) program but if I get a C in MA 125 and PEP 111, it won't be enough even if I got an A in all my other classes. One semester should be okay but I'm worried this may cause a cascading domino effect. Even my traditional tech enthusiasm is at an all-time low. Personal tech news, especially relating to smartphones and personal computers, what I was typically interested in, is drier than toast, and really, how good could a smartphone even be? Plus, enshittification is a huge problem with many tech services, where they try to nickel and dime users and/or make their software as addictive as possible, and frankly, I can't see myself wanting to code that stuff for the next 50 years of my life. Quite frankly, I can't see myself wanting to be a ""coder"" even if I was paid 1M/year for it. Being a ""coder"" seems like the tech equivalent of a factory worker, and with me not being too interested in the math/theory, and my biggest project getting destroyed, I feel this is the 9/11 moment of my passions in tech and I need to find some kind of way to ""rebuild"". I am considering other majors and fields, like Business and Law and think I would be a good lawyer since I am starting to find my English and History classes more interesting than my Math and Science classes, I am good at defending my arguments to death, and I would like my work on this planet to be noticed. I don't feel the traditional SWE route could give me that satisfaction and it just seems boring. Should I give up on CS?",User_deleted,0,positive,0

So I got two more weeks of my IM rotation with this awful preceptor. She makes me round on patients on my own and doesn’t show up until the end of the day. Then, I present my patients and then it’s just her pimping me while munching on her food in the cafeteria as I present. But that’s not the purpose of this post although I think she should not be a preceptor.

Her expectations from a third-year medical student on his first IM rotation are unfair. She expects a resident/attending level of medical decision making. I’ve used ChatGPT to answer some of her ridiculous pimping questions but she still gives me “homework”. The other day, we had a CHF patient admitted for anasarca. His EF was really low. She asked me why the patient was given Bumetanide and Metolazone when he’s already on Furosemide at home. I told her because those two are fast acting and help take the fluid off more efficiently. She wasn’t impressed. She gave me a hmm and then asked me next steps for this patient. “We’re paying $4,000 a day to keep this guy admitted. What should you do? Discharge him home? Admit?” At this point, I told her to admit because of the low EF and take the fluid off and consult cardiology. I told her to either increase his Furosemide dose at home or put him on another diuretic. “That’s not enough for me. You need to learn about heart failure and present to me the next day.” Okay, I guess. This preceptor will never explain anything. It’s always “go learn this”.

The job market is very tight since last 15-20 months, But Many foreign companies in India especially the American and European continue to aggressively push diversity hiring that many capable male candidates are left unplaced and Girls even with slightly less skill get easily employed. Since foreign companies have better pay and facilities than Indian counterparts, this creates a social imbalance as men earning less than girls or men working in low grade indian companies will be viewed as failed or worthless and Girls' ego boosts as she proclaims herself as a ""Strong Independent Girl"" which actually is a delusion and such girls think ""Males are inferior to them"" and they become entitled and feel that they must dream big and talk about My career My career shit while boys still thinking about Family's economic situation in tough market.

Example: Literally every 2nd girl in this university called ""IGDTUW"" is placed in Microsoft , Uber , Amazon , CISCO to the extent and quantity as if these companies were mass recruiters.

Of All my Guy and Girl acquaintances which had similar skillsets, almost all the girls have got placed very easily (even the girls with slightly less skills and projects) while guys still finding jobs thanks to ""THE RESERVATION GIRLS GET "" by many companies like EY, Deloitte, KPMG, S&P Global, CapGemini,Morgan Stanley , Goldman and Many more.

If Any of you people are working just check the proportion of females in HR/Operations roles into your company, the proportion of females so damn high like 70-80% as if HR positions in a company too are reserved for Women.

Infact during placement drives there are many companies who conduct ""Women only"" drives and straightaway exclude men from the hiring process.

So all the working women before proclaiming yourself as ""Strong Independent OverAchiever"" wake upto the reality. A lot of girls are gifted Jobs , they didnot earn it.

See the Data , the fresher Job placements for females skyrocketed despite overall weak job creation. This shows that A lot more number of women are hired than men even though there are 3-4 times more men in higher education and job seekers, This proves that women are hired at the expense of men.

I was an awful college student, and it took me six long years to finally graduate. I’ve seen enough Reddit posts romanticizing college struggles, but this is not one of those stories. This is my rollercoaster of a journey through college, complete with failing grades, lack of motivation, and somehow still managing to find an IT job at the end.

It all started like any typical college experience. I was optimistic, motivated, and doing fairly well in my first year. Then 2020 hit, and COVID wrecked any drive I had. By the time my sophomore year rolled around, my motivation was completely gone. I stopped going to class, stopped doing homework—basically stopped caring about school altogether.

At one point, I seriously considered dropping out. When I told my mom, she broke down in tears and wouldn’t let me, so I stayed. But things only got worse. I kept failing classes, and eventually, I was placed on academic warning. That’s when I decided to switch my major from Computer Engineering to IT, hoping it would be a fresh start. Spoiler: It wasn’t.

COVID continued, and my academic career kept spiraling downward. Junior year? Flunked that too, with multiple F’s again. This time I was placed on academic probation, and I still didn’t care. I was convinced I was going to drop out anyway, but when I told my mom again, she refused to hear it. So, I stuck it out. My second semester of junior year was no better—I failed another class and stayed on probation.

Fast forward to senior year. Miraculously, I did great during my first semester. I finally felt like I was turning things around. But by the second semester, I hit a wall—Discrete Math. I bombed it and ended up on probation again. Honestly, I should’ve been kicked out, but COVID was considered an “extenuating circumstance” that saved me.

At that point, I was 22 and had no direction. That’s when I heard about cybersecurity and the big money people were making. I knew I needed to get serious. So, I buckled down and made sure I passed all my classes—mostly by cheating. By the time I pulled my GPA up enough to consider internships, it was too late. I had a 6-year degree with a transcript full of F’s, no internships, no experience, and no references.

I figured I was screwed in the job market. I didn’t have much to sell, but I had LinkedIn, and I wasn’t about to waste it. So, I optimized the hell out of my profile. I stretched every tiny project I had ever done in college into something impressive. That half-baked Excel sheet? “Data analysis and visualization project.” That Cloud-Based Inventory Management System app that i built? That was really just ChatGPT doing all the work. Yeah, I don’t even know how to code, but I upsold the heck out of it as “developed a Cloud-Based Inventory Management System mobile app.” I looked up coding languages because it seemed like the thing to do in IT, but let’s be honest—I was mostly winging it.

In total, I applied to over 1,000 jobs, expecting nothing. But, somehow, I got hired as a very low-tier Solutions Architect in Georgia. Sounds cool, right? Well, here’s the kicker—I don’t know jack about IT. The job pays in the low $20s an hour, and I’m basically learning as I go. (Actually received about 12 interviews since May but got rejected because of “no experience”). 

So yeah, college was a disaster. But hey, if I can manage to get a job after all that, maybe there’s hope for anyone. Even if you don’t have a clue what you’re doing. Also, my soft skills are carrying me right now🫡",User_deleted,1,negative,0

I’m a cognitive science student working at the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning. Probably one of the coolest things about the brain is just how freaking efficient it is for what it can accomplish— running on lightbulb. To my understanding, this likely comes from not using all parameters if it is unnecessary for the task. So far, the only ML approach that I have found akin to this has been Mixture of Experts. 
Aside from that, in Deep Learning, optimising the inference process seems to be somewhat neglected — usually just using all parameters regardless of top down context or input statistics. 

I’m almost sure I am wrong, so I was hoping you guys could point me to good papers delving into this? Or perhaps the formal name of the problem? As an example, you might take an LLM. If the prediction of the next word in a sentence is simple (e.g. herbivores eat [plants]) I might not need all parameters to get a perfectly good prediction (Claude and LLama would likely do equally fine, but Claude cost more to solve this one), as opposed to one that is more technical and requires more attention and context into the processing (e.g., solving a mathematical proof).

 I am a Statistics 1st year undergrad student (have not started classes yet).I have spent last 3-4 months on machine learning.


 What I learned is: 

 Python
 Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn
 Data preprocessing + feature engineering
 Data visualization
 Machine Learning Algorithms
 ML metrics, hyperparameter tuning etc. 

 Learned from:
 1)Machine Learning specialization (includes 3 courses)- By Stanford on Coursera
 2) 100 days of machine learning (playlist)-By CampusX on Youtube 

 3)Machine Learning with Python and Scikit- Learn-Full course(18 hours)- By FreeCodeCamp.org on Youtube 

 I will learn more in the future + I am thinking of revising what I have learned and doing projects on kaggle. 

 Problem:
 The problem is that I didn't learn math and statistics separately for machine learning.
 I do understand how most of the algorithms work but have skipped all the mathematical proofs . I know scikit learn for the applications of the algorithms, but I find it difficult to build them from scratch. 
 Besides, in most cases I cannot hardcode Python, I have to take help of chatgpt. 

 The things I seek advice on are:
 1) Should I learn Stats or Maths before starting doing projects? 

 2) Should I learn to build algorithms from scratch? (Eg: linear regression, logistic regression, xgboost etc) 

 3) What can I do to improve hardcoding? 

 4) What or how many projects I should do? 

 5) On what,I should more focus right now?

I was an awful college student, and it took me six long years to finally graduate. I've seen enough Reddit posts romanticizing college struggles, but this is not one of those stories. This is my rollercoaster of a journey through college, complete with falling grades, lack of motivation, and somehow still managing to find an IT job at the end.
It all started like any typical college experience. I was optimistic, motivated, and doing fairly well in my first year. Then 2020 hit, and COVID wrecked any drive I had. By the time my sophomore year rolled around, my motivation was completely gone. I stopped going to class, stopped doing homework-basically stopped caring about school altogether.

At one point, I seriously considered dropping out. When I told my mom, she broke down in tears and wouldn't let me, so l stayed. But things only got worse. I kept failing classes, and eventually, I was placed on academic warning. That's when I decided to switch my major from Computer Engineering to IT, hoping it would be a fresh start. Spoiler: It wasn't.

COVID continued, and my academic career kept spiraling downward. Junior year? Flunked that too, with multiple F's again. This time I was placed on academic probation, and I still didn't care. I was convinced I was going to drop out anyway, but when I told my mom again, she refused to hear it. So, I stuck it out. My second semester of junior year was no better-| faileu another class and stayed on probation.

Fast forward to senior year. Miraculously, I did great during my first semester. I finally felt like I was turning things around. But by the second semester, I hit a wall-Discrete Math. I bombed it and ended up on probation again. Honestly, I should've been kicked out, but COVID was considered an ""extenuating circumstance"" that saved me.

Let’s dive in.


---------------------------------------

## Intro

So, the recent thread about Hinton made me question the sub's (and my) sanity.

For those out of the loop, Nobel Prize winner Hinton, the ""godfather of AI,"" mentioned in his speech that he hopes his words, that LLMs understand, now carry more weight, especially regarding risks and possibilities.

When I heard him, I thought he was talking about how the average Joe has no clue what LLMs can and can’t do. It’s tough to explain, so good for him. ""Nobel Prize Winner"" is quite a credential for the Joes out there.

What I didn’t expect was this sub to completely implode. And for what reason? There are more than 30 papers on LLM ""mental capabilities"", and those are just the ones I’ve read. It’s basically common knowledge that, yes, of course, LLMs understand. But apparently, it’s not. People were spiraling into debates about consciousness, throwing around ad-hominem attacks, and even suggesting that Hinton has forgotten how to be a scientist, because he just stated an opinion, and even worse! an, according to the brains of reddit, WRONG opinion! Who does this fuck think he is? The Einstein of AI? Pffff. 
All the while, I didn’t see a single attempt to disprove him.... just... also opinions? Funny.

I argue Hinton didn’t forget to be a scientist. This sub just never was one. A real scientist would know all the papers, or at least be aware of them, that back up Hinton. So the complete shitshow of a thread caught me off guard. Hinton knows the research, which is why he said what he did. And I thought this sub also knows its science, because it is literally about bleeding edge science.
I always thought, every time someone was saying ""statistical parrot"" , it's like a meme, in the same sense like you do ""and the earth is flat herp derp"" because we are far beyond that point already. But now I'm not so sure anymore.

So, I’m here to fine-tune the meat-transformer in your head and give you a summary of a bunch of the papers I’ve read on this topic. If I missed any important that has to be in this list, drop a comment. And hey, I already won my first challenge. Some nice guy via PM claimed that I'm not able to produce even a single paper hinting in the slightest that LLMs have some kind of capability to understand. Thanks for the nicely worded PM stranger, I hope you also find peace and happiness in life.

And who need hints, when he has evidence? So let's get into it! We’ll go slow on this, so I’ll keep the learning rate low and the batch size at 1. And for those who need it spelled out: evidence does not equal proof, so save your semantic smart assery.

We will explore the ""inner world"" of an LLM, then examine how it interprets the ""outer world"" and ""everything beyond"". We'll top it off by discussing the consequences of these perspectives. Finally, we'll look at an area where LLMs can still improve and engage in a philosophical thought experiment about what might await us at the end of the rainbow.

## Emergent Abilities

Let's start with some conceptual definitions:

Understanding != consciousness. I don't know why, but somehow people in Hinton's thread thought he meant LLMs are conscious, as if they’re living entities or something. He didn’t.

There’s quite a jump from what “understanding” means in computer science and AI research to consciousness. The word ""understanding"" doesn't exist in a CS researcher’s vocabulary (except when talking to the public, like Hinton did) because it's a fuzzy concept, too fuzzy to base research on it indeed, as you could see in that thread. 

But in science, we need a conceptual frame to work in, something you can define, which is how ""understanding"" got replaced by ""emergent abilities"". Emergent abilities are abilities an AI learns to do on its own, without being explicitly trained or designed for it. And to learn something independently, a model needs to generalize its existing knowledge in ways that go beyond simple token output. Over the course of this post we will look how a text generator can do vastly more than just generating text....

Here's a quick primer from Google on ""emergent abilities"":  
[https://research.google/blog/characterizing-emergent-phenomena-in-large-language-models/](https://research.google/blog/characterizing-emergent-phenomena-in-large-language-models/)

#### Most interesting takeaway:

The biggest bomb of all: We don’t know why, when, or what. We have absolutely no idea why or when these emergent abilities kick in; Emergent abilities don’t appear gradually but instead pop up suddenly at certain model scales, like a critical threshold was crossed. What’s really going on at that point? What exactly is it that make that points so special? Can we predict future ""points of interest"". Some argue it's the single most important question in AI research. And to those people who like to argue ""we can't scale infinitely"", I argue it really depends on what kind of emergence we find... or finds us....

Imagine training a model on separate French and English texts. Nothing happens for a while, and then *boom* it can translate between the two without ever seeing a translation. It suddenly gained the emergent ability to translate. Sure, call it a statistical parrot, but if a parrot could do this, it’d be one hell of an intelligent parrot.

But I get it. Even tho seven years ago, you would have been downvoted into oblivion on r/machinelearning for suggesting that there's some random ""upscale"" point where a model just learns to translate on its own. It wouldn’t have even registered as science fiction. It’s crazy how fast the bleeding edge becomes everyday life, to the point where even a model that could beat the Turing test isn’t mind-blowing anymore. We’ve become too smart to be impressed, dismissing models that use our own mediums for representing the world as ""just statistics,"" because an LLM “obviously” has no real world representation… right? Well... or does it?

*(please hold your horses, and don't try to argue the Turing Test with me, because I know for a fact that everything you are going to say is a misinterpretation of the idea behind the test, probably something you got from the one afro american TV physicist I don't remember the name of, because I'm not from the US, or some other popular science shit and therefore is basically wrong. Just know, there was a time, not that long ago, when if you asked any computer scientist when we’d solve it, you’d get answers ranging from “never” to “hundreds of years, and it really was like the north star guiding our dreams and imagination, and we are now at a point where people try to forcefully move the turing-goalposts somewhere out of the reach of GPT. And the ones who don't feel like moving goalposts every two weeks (especially the younger ones who don't know the glory days) take the easy route of ""This test is shit"" lol. what a way to go sweet Turing test. this process from beacon to trash is all I wanted to share. so, leave it be.)
*

## My inner world...

[https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13382](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13382)

#### Most interesting takeaway:

In Monopoly, you have two main things to track: your piece and your money. You could note down each round with statements like, ""rolled a 6, got 60 bucks"" or ""rolled a 1, lost 100 dollars"" until you have quite a few entries.

Now, imagine giving this data to an LLM to learn from. Even though it was never explicitly told what game it was, the LLM reverse-engineers the game’s ruleset. The paper actually used Othello for this experiment, but I guess it’s not as popular as Monopoly. Regardless, the core idea remains the same. Just by the information about how the players state changes the LLM understands how the game state changes, and what constraint and rules for those game states exist. So it came up with it's own... well not world yet, but boardgame representation.

And that’s not even the coolest part the paper showed. The coolest part is that you can actually know what the LLM understands and even prove it. Encoded in the LLM’s internal activations is information it shouldn’t have. How can you tell? By training another AI that detects whenever the LLM’s internal state behaves a certain way, indicating that the 'idea' of a specific game rule is being processed. Doesn't look good for our parrot-friend.

That's btw why plenty of cognitive scientists are migrating completely to AI because of the ability to ""debug"" 

Perhaps you are asking yourself ""well if it understands the game rules how good is it in playing such game then?"" we will answer this question in a bit ;)

## ...and my outer world...

Imagine going out with your friends to dine at the newest fancy restaurant. The next day, all of you except one get the shits, and you instantly know that the shrimp is to blame because your friend who is painting his bathroom with a new color was the only one who didn’t order it. That’s causal reasoning. I like to call it ""knowing how the world works"" This extends beyond board game rules to any ""worldgame"" that the training data represents.

[https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10877#deepmind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10877#deepmind)

#### Most interesting takeaway:

Some Google boys have provided proof (yes, proof as in a hard mathematical proof) that any agent capable of generalizing across various environments has learned a causal world model. In other words, for an AI to make good decisions across different contexts, it must understand the causal relationships in the data. There it is again, the forbidden Hinton word.

The paper is quite math-heavy, but we can look at real-world examples. For instance, a model trained on both code and literature will outperform one trained solely on literature, even in literature-only tasks. This suggests that learning about code enhances its understanding of the world.

In fact, you can combine virtually any data: learning math can improve your French bot’s language skills. According to this paper, learning math also boosts a model's entity tracking ability.

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14811](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14811)

Coding improves natural language understanding, and vice versa.

With extremely potent generalization (which, by the way, is also a form of understanding), a models can generalize addition, multiplication, some sorting algorithms ([source](https://arxiv.org/html/2405.17399v1)), and maybe even a bit of Swahili (this was a joke, haha). 
This indicates that models aren’t just parroting tokens based on statistics but are discovering entirely new semantic connections that we might not even be aware of. This is huge because if we can reverse engineer why math improves a model’s French skills, it could offer insights into optimization strategies we aren't even aware of their existence, opening up countless new research angles. Thanks, parrot!

Like when people talk about ""AI is plateauing"" I promise you... the hype train didn't even started yet, with so much still to research and figure out.....

## ...and the whole universe

All of this leads us to reasoning. You’re not wrong if you directly think of O1, but that’s not quite correct either. We’re talking about single-step reasoning, something everyone knows and does: ""Hey ChatGPT, can you answer XXXX? Please think step by step and take a deep breath first."" And then it tries to answer in a reasoning chain style (we call these reasoning graphs), sometimes getting it right, sometimes wrong, but that’s not the point.

Have you ever wondered how the LLM even knows what ""step by step"" thinking means? That it means breaking down a problem, then correctly choosing the start of the graph and building the connections between start and finish. In state-of-the-art models, there are huge datasets of reasoning examples fed into the models, but these are just there to improve the process; the way of thinking it figured out itself. It’s all about internal representations and ""ideas""

Good ol' Max did a paper showing LLMs even have an understanding of space and time. Btw, if you see the name Max Tegmark, you have to read whatever he’s written. It’s always crazy town, but explained in a way that even a layman can understand. You might think, ""Okay, I got it by processing trillions of tokens, some spatial info just emerges"" and it’s some abstract 'thing' deep inside the LLM we can’t grasp, so we need another AI to interpret the state of the LLM. 

But here’s where it gets fun.

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02207](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02207)

They trained models on datasets containing names of places or events with corresponding space or time coordinates spanning multiple locations and periods - all in text form. And fucking Mad Max pulled an actual world map out of his ass the model that even changes over time based on the learned events.


Another paper also looked into how far apart can dots be so the LLM can still connect them

>In one experiment we finetune an LLM on a corpus consisting only of distances between an unknown city and other known cities. Remarkably, without in-context examples or Chain of Thought, the LLM can verbalize that the unknown city is Paris and use this fact to answer downstream questions.
  
https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14546


## Checkmate ~~atheists! technophobes! technophiles!~~ luddites!

And boy, the dots can be universes apart. I mean, you probably know chess, a very difficult game to master. Yet, our little text prediction friend can somehow also play chess! When trained on legal moves, it will also play legal chess (back to our board game example). But how good is it? Well, naturally, some Harvard Henrys looked into it. They found that when trained on games of 1000 Elo players... what do you think, how good is the LLM? Spoiler: >!1500 Elo!<


[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11741v1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11741v1)

Say what you want, but for me, this isn’t just evidence, it’s hard proof that some understanding is happening. Without understanding, there’s no way it could learn to play better chess than the players it observed, yet here we are. When trained on data, LLMs tend to outperform the data. And I don't know what your definition of intelligence is, but it hits pretty close to mine. Here you have it, you can still have opinions in science, without being a dick to scientists! crazy I know. Like, sorry for ranting, one guy in the thread was like ""Now my opinion of Hinton is ruined"", like obviously the guy doesn't know shit if he's mad on someone saying ""LLMs understand"", but somehow it's of great importance that he felt the need to also announce his ignorance and opinion into the world. 

Why? 

Takes literally 30s to google ""LLMs understanding paper"" to be buried with 50 hits on arxiv. People rather shit on people instead of taking five second from their clock to perhaps gain the chance to challenge their own view point of things. It wasn't always like this, was it?


## Just google it, bro


Another example would be recognizing zero-day vulnerabilities. 
For those who don't know what those funny words mean: 
When software get updated, and because of the update there is a new stupid bug, and this stupid bug is a pretty intense bug that fucks everything and everyone, and nothing works anymore, and you have to call your sysadmin on Sunday, and fucking shit why is he so expensive on Sundays, why does this shit always happen on sundays anyway?, that’s called a ""zero-day vulnerability"" 

Recognizing these is important, so there are vulnerability scanners that check your code and repository (basically trying to hack them). If any of your dependencies have a known ""0day"" it’ll notify you so you can take action.


What’s the discovery rate for an open-source vulnerability scanner? A tool specifically made for the task!

  
Close to 0%.


I kid you not, most of them only recognize 0days one or two days later when their database updates, because their scanning algorithms and hacking skills suck ass.

GPT, on the other hand, has a 20% discovery rate, making our little waifu story generator one of the best vulnerability scanners out there (next to humans). 

**DISCLAIMER***(There's a huge discussion in the community because of the methodology used in the paper, because GPT as an agent system had internet access and basically googled the exploits instead of figuring them out itself, but I chose to include it anyway, because this is how every 'security expert' I know also works. Also tool using is cool. Always cracks me up when AI gets measured more strictly than humans.)*


## Context is everything

Like with Hinton and the meaning of ""understanding,"" context is also super important when talking about LLMs. 
Some might say, ""Ok, I get it. I understand all this talk about training! When you train a model on trillions of datapoints for millions of dollars over thousands of hours, something happens that makes it _seem_ like it understands things."" 

But they still think they have an out: in-context learning! 

""BUT! A system that truly understands wouldn’t be so dumb when I give it new information, like --INSERT BANANA PUZZLE-- (or some other silly example, which even humans fail at, by the way). GOT YA!""

And I agree, in-context learning and zero-shot learning are still areas that need more research and improvement (and that’s why we aren’t plateauing like some think). But even here, we have evidence of understanding and generalization. Even with completely new information, on completely new tasks, as shown by this Stanford article:

[https://ai.stanford.edu/blog/understanding-incontext/#empirical-evidence](https://ai.stanford.edu/blog/understanding-incontext/#empirical-evidence)

If you think about what the article say, you can see how this disproves the ""statistical parrot"" theory, proving there’s more going on than just predicting the next token.

And perhaps you remember my XTC Sampler thread? 

For those who don’t know, the XTC sampler is a LLM token sampler that cuts away the MOST probable tokens to allow more creativity. 

People in the thread would say, ""But doesn’t that make the model unusable?"" 

No, it still does what it does. 

Even if you only let sub-1% tokens through, it still produces coherent text! 

even at the limits of its probability distribution, when the information encoded in the tokens is so improbable it shouldn't be coherent at all, but here’s the kicker: even when I cut away all the popular tokens, it still tells roughly the same story. This means the story isn’t encoded in the stream of tokens but somewhere within the LLM. No matter what I do with the tokens, it’ll still tell its story. Statistical Parrot, my ass.

## Where does it lead us?

Who knows? 
It's a journey, but I hope I could kickstart your computer science adventure a bit, and I hope one thing is clear: 

Hinton didn’t deserve the criticism he got in this thread because, honestly, how can you look at all these papers and not think that LLMs do, in fact, understand? 

And I also don’t get why this is always such an emotionally charged debate, as if it’s just a matter of opinion, which it isn’t (at least within the concept space we defined at the beginning). 

Yet, somehow, on Reddit the beacon of science and atheism and anime boobas, only one opinion seems to be valid. like also the most non-science opinion of all. 

Why? I don't know, and honestly I don't fucking care, but I get mad if someone is shitting of grampa Hinton.

Well, I actually know, because we recently did a client study asking the best question ever asked in the history of surveys:

“Do you enjoy AI?” (sic)

 
90% answered, “What?”

Jokes aside, most people are absolutely terrified of the uncertainty it all brings. 
Even a model trained on ten Hintons and LeCuns couldn't predict where we’re heading before it self destructs. 

Does it end in catastrophe?

Or is it just a giant nothingburger? 

Or maybe it liberates humanity from its capitalist chains, with AGI as the reincarnated digitalized Spirit of Karl Marx leading us into utopia.

As you can see, even the good endings sound scary as fuck. 

So, to avoid making it scarier than it already is, people tell themselves, “It’s just a parrot, bro” or “It’s just math”, like saying a tiger that wants to eat you is just a bunch of atoms. 
In the end, if I had a parrot that could answer every question, it doesn’t matter if it’s “just a parrot” or not. The mobile phone number of your mum is mine anyway, and “it’s just a parrot” won’t save you from that reality. 

So, better to just relax and enjoy the ride, the roller coaster already started and there's nothing you can do. 
In the end, what happens, happens, and who knows where all of this is leading us…

This paper from MIT claims it leads to the following (don’t take it too seriously, it’s a thought experiment): All neural networks are converging until every model (like literally every single model on earth) builds a shared statistical model of reality. If there’s anything like science romanticism, this is it. 

""Hey babe, how about we build a shared statistical model of reality with our networks tonight?""

https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07987

  


In that sense, have a good one, and maybe we can dive into the counterarguments next time :)

Or if you have any other idea of something you want a deep dive into, let me know. Do you for example know, that in a blind test Professors can't decide if a paper abstract is written by GPT or one of their students? Or did you know, that LLMs literally have their own language? Like there exists (probably?) an infinite amount of words/prompts that look like this ""hcsuildxfz789p12rtzuiwgsdfc78o2t13287r"" and force the LLM to react in a certain way. How and why? well... it's something for future me... perhaps ;)",User_deleted,23,negative,0

This powerful language model, thanks to its ability to understand and generate human-like text, is revolutionizing the way we approach learning in both academic and professional settings.

In the educational sphere, ChatGPT is being harnessed to personalize learning experiences. As it adapts to individual student queries, it facilitates a tailored tutoring approach that augments traditional teaching methods. Students who might not have access to one-on-one tutoring due to economic or geographical constraints can now receive personalized assistance, potentially leveling the educational playing field.

Corporate training, too, is undergoing a significant transformation thanks to ChatGPT. Interactive training modules powered by AI make learning more engaging and cost-effective for businesses. Employees can have real-time conversations with the AI, asking questions and receiving immediate feedback, which helps in better retention of information and practical application of skills.

Moreover, the instant availability of ChatGPT means learning opportunities are not confined to the walls of a classroom or office. Learning can happen anywhere, anytime, breaking down the barriers of traditional education and corporate training schedules.

However, this technological revolution raises questions about the sustainability of conventional teaching and training roles. As AI becomes more integrated into our learning processes, it's crucial to examine how educators and corporate trainers can adapt to work in tandem with AI tools rather than being replaced by them.

Let's discuss how ChatGPT is already impacting virtual learning and training, and what potential it holds for the future of education and professional development. Share your experiences, insights, and thoughts about the integration of AI in learning and how we can navigate through this technological evolution while ensuring that the human element remains at the core of education and training.",active,1,positive,0

I ended up getting the tooth removed, then getting dry socket. So i was absent for a while. In the meantime of me being absent i tried getting as much schoolwork done that i missed as possible. I currently have an F in every class and its because im missing a test in some classes. 

I take honors classes, but for my english class (which english is my favorite subject) i have the worst teacher and shes making me hate it. I would transfer into a different class, but unfortunately she is the only teacher who teaches honors english. 

I had a stupid quiz on a crash course video today and i got a 18/30. The only reason i even got that grade was because it was on one of those sites if you press something, thats automatically your answer and you cant go back. I pressed 2 questions wrong by accident because i clicked to the next question which yes, is my fault but when i told my teacher she said thats not her problem and i shouldve been more careful. I understand that yes, it very much was my fault but i was maybe hoping she could just let me retake it..

Today, she emailed my mother telling her that i do not belong in a honors english class and that i should consider transferring to cp. I have always gotten good grades in my honors classes and i never had a problem with them. 

I dont think im going to take her “advice” but im now in trouble for having such bad grades even though in some other classes, my teachers didnt even notice i was absent and wont take any “late” work (even though i was absent and the work was due before i came back)

She also accuses students of using chatgpt if their essays are good.

2) using ChatGPT to create examples in a personal narrative (!) (that was not all ChatGPT did, but okay)   
3) admits that sources were used but were not documented (hastily throws a Works Cited at me---still more questions about why that's in a narrative essay, and still constitutes academic dishonesty for not citing sources in the first place)   
4) student finally admits that the paid version of Grammarly did all the writing, so that's probably why it sounds like AI (because it *is*)

The chair: well, I can see that the student has a passing grade so far. Will assigning a 0 mean that she won't pass the class? If so, can you use this as a teaching moment and reassign her the essay?

Bruh, the student admitted three times that they didn't write the assignment and tried to lie about it, and you want them to pass the class? Yeah ... not the sort of teaching job I was looking for here. 

Not sure if anyone needs this context, but, yes, students have had academic honesty drilled into them in the first six weeks, which also includes a lengthy lecture on using online tools to write for them.

It’s my first year so I had no say over it but a ton of kids with no art experience or any passion at all. A ton of behavioral issues and 13 IEPs out of 36 kids.

The principal suggested to me, after exhausting several PBIS strategies, to introduce textbook work to the students who were disruptive. It’s an art class but I don’t have to teach them how to draw or paint. They can learn theory if they can’t handle behaving according to class standards. 

We have routines in place. We have expectations (that we review every day to reward one student with a positive call home). Anyways. A kid today stole another kid’s hat and then ran through my room and threw a stool to the ground behind him. I gave him the textbook assignment right away. I followed through. 

He threw the textbook down on the desk and started yelling at me that it was so unfair and he shouldn’t have to do it. I calmly explained that he could not yell at me and that it was so inappropriate to yell at a teacher. He then leaned back and told me he wouldn’t do the assignment and that I couldn’t make him.

I agreed and told him that it was worth the weight of his original assigned project and that he would just have to take a zero. 

I gave one to another student who pushed someone. He began telling me why he should be allowed to chatgpt his response. I explained again that the assignment was on paper written by hand without the use of Chromebooks. He started yelling at me.

I went home crying today. I wish they were not in my class. I don’t know what to do other than try to be positive again on Monday and stand firm in the decision to assign that work. But I also went home crying because I feel like the rest of my class is suffering over two students who can’t get their behavior in check.

   although I spent a lot of time writing the prompt words, because in order to derive these formulas I needed to integrate knowledge from multiple papers, but the latest ai agent's information is hot, I think everything I do now can be automated by having a powerful ai agent and then collecting the information from the papers I provide him with and then automatically deriving and completing the code according to my instructions, if this technology matures in the next few years, I think everything I've done so far can be done in less than an hour, so where is the value in that for me?

   Also I'm learning C++ now and in the future I want to become a programmer in the future, but I think AI can drastically reduce the number of programmers in the future, AI has powerful computing power, almost unlimited memory and powerful enumeration and almost limit-less chain of thoughts, I think this AI will be able to outperform human beings in writing C++ code without memory leaks and high concurrency C++ codes, this AI will be able to learn all the code bases and all the coding experiences in the world. AI can't do it now, but what about 5 years from now? transformer architecture was proposed in 2017 and then 5 years later there was an explosion of AI applications like chatgpt, who knows what will happen in the next 5 years?

It is foreseeable that with the rapid development of AI, the importance of knowledge will become less and less, some people may say that the results of the AI still need to be checked by human beings, but fewer and fewer human beings are needed,  And now that AI is already an asset-heavy industry, massive GPU cluster are more important than human resources, and if AGI is born, what will this mean for countries that don't have AGI? I've already thought about it, first there will be massive unemployment then all the foreign exchange reserves will flow into the big foreign tech companies, then there will be total collapse and famine, a lot of people will die in the process and then others will become slaves of the big companies because these people don't have any economic value any more, I don't know what skills I should learn right now, it's likely that my programming skills may be rendered useless in a few years, I'd like to learn blue-collar but I have nearsightedness and astigmatism, I can't see even close things when I take off my glasses, I don't know if I can adapt to drastic exercise, maybe it's a good idea to kill myself when AGI is born or my skills are completely obsolete, I bet there won't be a UBI for a few decades and for those countries that haven't gotten a handle on AI they'll be even less likely to have a UBI

Our website uses AI to give you insight into how college admissions officers might read your essay and whether it meets their expectations. Our AI is trained on essays from students who got into top universities, so we think it could be a game-changer for your writing process. While using AI to write your essay might not be the best idea, using it to get feedback can be super helpful.

We’re also serious about data privacy — we never sell your data, and you can opt out of having your essay data stored. This is different than ChatGPT and most other AI-powered tools online. You can learn more in our privacy policy. Our site has three main features:

1. Evaluator: This gives you a thorough explanation of how an admissions officer will read your essay and what they might think about it. This will give specific ratings of 1-5 in different categories, similar to how actual admissions officers will at many top universities. It will also give you specific written feedback on your essay's strong aspects and what can be improved.
2. Feedback: Feedback takes a closer look at your essay, providing line-by-line insights. While Evaluator gives a holistic view, Feedback focuses on the finer details—catching lines that lack clarity, need more explanation, or don’t fit the context of your essay. This tool helps you refine every sentence in the context of the prompt, paragraph, and essay, ensuring your writing is sharp and impactful. The feedback is similar to how a teacher/college counselor would give you feedback. 
3. Brainstorm: A brainstorming tool that will evaluate the potential strength of your essay ideas as well as give short texts prompting you to think about what/how you might write an essay based on your particular idea.

We’d love to hear any feedback you have on the site to improve it as much as possible. We know how stressful this process can be, and we wish everyone here the best of luck. If you have any questions about the admissions process, feel free to comment/DM. Thanks so much!",User_deleted,2,positive,0

I consider myself fluent in english and our native language, but I can't really explain or translate the instructions and course material for him in a way that he understands it; so I help him a lot with his work, but sometimes these ""tutoring"" session has me doing half or most of an assignment he may have. These tutoring session happen almost every week, I don't mind helping out sometimes but I think he's being overly reliant on my help. I also learned that he's been mostly getting by most of his class by using ChatGPT. We're about half way through the first semester, and I absolutely don't think this is sustainable in the long term so I'm reaching out for some advice on what I can do to help him. 

Also I've been talking about this with my cousins (they are all in their 3rd or last year of college) on what I can do, and they've suggested that I should be asking for money or some kind of compensation if I'm to keep helping him because I'm spending quite a lot of time helping him (more than just a couple hours a week). I really don't like this as I know we're both broke college student and don't wanna create pressure financially. Any advice on what I can do to help my friend would be greatly appreciated.

For starters, the customer service sector has been revolutionized. ChatGPT's integration into chatbots and support systems is making response times lightning-fast and incredibly efficient. As AI continues to learn and adapt, it can handle an increasing range of queries, allowing human agents to tackle complex issues that require a personal touch.

In content creation, ChatGPT stands out as a paragon of efficiency, churning out initial drafts and creative ideas at an unprecedented pace. This is not to say it's replacing human creativity, but it's certainly a powerful tool for beating writer's block and enhancing productivity.

The educational realm is another key beneficiary. ChatGPT is becoming an indispensable assistant for educators, formulating lesson plans, and supporting students with personalized tutorials. It is transforming the one-size-fits-all education model by enabling tailored learning experiences that can adapt to each student's pace and style.

Software development has also seen a significant impact. ChatGPT assists programmers by debugging code and generating coding snippets, thus accelerating development cycles and promoting a more streamlined workflow.

Moreover, in research and data analysis, ChatGPT helps professionals comb through massive datasets and extract vital insights, saving hours of manual work. 

Though ChatGPT is making waves, it's essential to recognize that these tools are meant to augment human capabilities, not replace them. As we adopt AI more broadly, the focus should remain on leveraging these advancements to enhance skills and productivity rather than solely on automation.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this topic. Which sectors do you believe will be next in line to experience the productivity revolution thanks to ChatGPT?

They were assigned a 2-3 page health campaign analysis and were required to cite at least 4 objective, peer-reviewed sources. 

Because of the proliferation of ChatGPT, I list the following statement in my syllabus:

“It is understood that AI programs have become popular among students. However, you should note that all AI generative tools are prone to making up incorrect facts and fake citations, and image/art generation tools
can produce copied work or offensive products. If you choose to use AI tools in
the development of your work, you will be responsible for any inaccurate, biased, offensive, or otherwise unethical content you submit regardless of whether it originally comes from you or an AI tool. If you use an AI tool, its contribution must be credited in your submission. The use of an AI tool without
acknowledgement is cheating and constitutes a violation of the University’s Code of Academic Integrity.”

Despite this statement and a class discussion, I have received several papers with fabricated citations. After submitting grades, I receive emails from students feigning ignorance and requesting redos. I do not allow redos considering that the grade received is a slap on the wrist compared to the consequences that can be handed down by the Office of Academic Integrity.

1g57nfd,6,2024-10-16,A direct approach to understanding CS employment,u/I-am-ALIVE--,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1g57nfd/a_direct_approach_to_understanding_cs_employment/,"

First and foremost, for about 20 years, there was an extraordinarily high demand for computer science majors. In fact, this demand was so high that coding camps popped up across the country.

At one point, coding was the best way for people to get out of homelessness. Coding camps in the Bay Area would accept homeless individuals who went from being homeless to making $80,000 in six months.

This could be referred to as the high point of the market.

Then came the grifters—a bunch of people promising this kind of prosperity to gullible individuals.

This includes people like ""Profit with JavaScript."" Some of these people promised that you could make six figures just by learning HTML or JavaScript, leading to a flood of low-level coders entering the market.

By the way, pretty much all of those jobs can now be automated with AI, so the low-skill positions in the the west have been heavily impacted and can now be automated or outsourced offshore.

This caused a major changein the low-level computer science job market around 2022.

This outcome was inevitable—those repetitive jobs are now easily handled by artificial intelligence. Unfortunately, people who bought into the idea that they could make six figures in three months were completely misled. Many of these low-level positions were also internships, leaving many college students and graduates struggling to get internships, as the entry-level roles that used to provide a way in have disappeared.

This issue is compounded by the fact that someone with a PhD in computer science in India can be paid $25,000 a year. This is not to suggest that the work is equivalent to that of a Western coder—such comparisons won’t be made, nor is this meant to encourage toxic arguments in the comment section. Discussions around this topic often devolve into accusations of racism, resulting in unproductive debates that should be avoided.

Regardless of how high-quality the overseas work may be, the reality is that the competition for computer science jobs has become fierce. Most of these jobs can be done remotely, meaning an American who needs to earn $150,000 to survive (given how absurd the cost of living in this country has become) is competing with someone willing to do the same job for as little as $15,000. This is not to say the two workers are equal, but the competition is real, and most CEOs will opt for the cheaper employee.

Another major factor is artificial intelligence. Whether AI will fully automate these jobs or not, the promise of automation has led many companies to reduce hiring, hoping to save money by using large language models to replace significant portions of the workforce and increase profits.

Whether this will actually materialize remains to be seen. Regardless, the possibility has already encouraged companies to scale back hiring.

The final factor is increasing investor hesitancy due to fraud. Scandals like the Theranos debacle, along with other overhyped promises that never materialized, have made investors more cautious. Many have pulled back their money, demanding profits from companies that were never profitable. This has resulted in reduced hiring, as there is now less free capital to support bloated workforces.

Taken together, these four factors have created significant challenges in the West. It’s a nightmare situation for many tech workers or aspiring tech workers. For those just entering the industry from college, landing a job is not impossible, but the competition is fierce—and it may require some serious butt-kissing to succeed.

There it is—a streamlined, direct, no-BS overview of the situation.

Due to which I didn't get a good score in 11th which continued in my 12th grade due to which many of my teacher felt deep repulsion towards me. But somewhere in between my hectic Sechdule for the first time I dreamt and had plans different than what would make my parents happy and see pride in them. I wanted to study abroad specifically the uk specifically in Oxford(until then I planned to take whatever engineering degree available under top3 iit but now I wanted to study computer science specifically). I knew I had to make up a good rep as my predicted grades were in my teachers' hands I worked tirelessly and my school grades were improved slightly, which somehow made my teachers happy. So I was working towards this dream in secrecy of my parents. I prepared my essay, dug through old extracurricular certificates or anything extra to mention. I was doing it without any expert guidance and google, YouTube and chatgpt were my best friends during these times. I was in delusion that I'll definitely get selected.

I can't change destiny no matter how hard I try. Somewhere I was at fault I know, but it wouldnt have been so crushing if my destiny already didn't have plans for me. How dare I dream of being amongst young prodigies when I couldn't even get an 80% in my 11th grade CBSE. Destiny just hated my audacity and looking back I'm ashamed to admit it too.

I'm working with carpentry students, and I need them to understand the formula for finding the area of a triangle: 1/2 base × height.

What I’m noticing is that they’re calculating base × height and then dividing by two, which is essentially finding the area of a rectangle and then halving it. We did a few examples today, and they all got the correct answers.

ChatGPT explained that both methods are equivalent. When students multiply the base by the height first and then divide by two, they are performing the same calculation as 1/2 × base × height. This approach is more intuitive because it follows a simple multiplication and division process. As long as they consistently divide by two, either method gives the correct result.

Here’s where I’m a bit confused: Is there a difference in dividing just the base or dividing the whole calculation by two? Math was never my strong point, and I’ve told the learners I’ll help them figure out if their approach is correct for pricing.

This is important for gables on houses since they often have different cladding (like cedar feature cladding), and accurate pricing is key.

Recently, I have been working on an Llama 3.1 and Ollama based tutoring system for my research project. In our design, we have 3 agents (or as I understand them) with their own system prompts describing tasks, behaviour and other sets of instructions. TeacherBot, QuestionBot and EvaluatorBot. Currently my intention is they should work sequentially, more like a  *Teach-Quiz-Evaluate-Repeat* cycle.

One of the key factor that we want to introduce is **Progressive Difficulty**, which is in short to gradually introduce complex lessons on a particular topic. Just like a human teacher would teach 1D matrix, then 2D and then more complex stuff based on his/her interaction and performance evaluation of the student being taught. 

My current challenge is to how to prompt the LLM to introduce such manners, where it will understand the student performance and level up the next complex lessons. I have a plan to invoke the mentioned cycle in the 2nd paragraph to understand the student's current situation via the Evaluatorbot, based on the interaction with QuestionBot. Thus I could tell the TABot to upgrade or downgrade the lesson to teach in the next cycle.

My supervisor asked me if I could make the QBot and EvalBot simultaneously interact with each other while quizzing the students, and to level up the question difficulties gradually just like a interviewers would do in a viva. 

I am finding this is the hardest part since that would do the handing off between two agents frequently, leading up excessive compute resources and thus breaking down the whole system.

I am seeking help in this regard what to do? What agentic approach to follow to serve this automation? I saw videos on CrewAI but that doesn't serve my purpose. OpenAI's swarm has the near perfect solution to my case, but we want our work to be based the Open source LLMs as our novelty.

My exams used to be mostly MC, some short answer/fill in the blank, and one essay. Since moving online and AI's impact, I rewrote my exam to 5 short answer, 2 longer answers, and 1 essay. I tested all of my questions in chatGPT and reworded/tweaked them a few times to try to make it at least harder for the students to cheat (I know this isn't perfect, but I figure it helps). The students knew they couldn't use AI or talk to others, besides that it was open book/notes etc.

I'm only on my third exam and immediately could tell this student used AI. Not only was her answer wrong, it was talking about things we didn't cover in class or the readings. I typed the question into AI, and her exact answer popped out. She did this (with various levels of rewording, but mostly using the SAME EXACT WORDS) for every question except the essay question.

So,  I know that 1. our honor board is awful and even when I've caught even more obvious cheating in the past it turns into a nothingburger and 2. it's harder to prove using AI I sent the entire class an email saying that I've detected AI use on the exams, this goes againts honor policy blah blah and that I'm extending an olive branch to anyone who is honest and let's me know by Tuesday that they used AI. I said if they told me now, I would handle it at the assignment level versus escalating it where they would earn an XF for the course.

  
It has been SEVEN minutes since I sent the email and two students have already emailed me confessing to using AI on the exam. Neither one is the one I even thought used AI!!!

As a student who failed Compsci101 in the first semester but passed in the second, I’ve realized how much coding has changed my life. Here’s my story on what I did to succeed in this course: starting at around June or July (I don’t remember the exact month, but it was either one of the two), I stopped using social media that wasted a lot of my time, such as Discord, Instagram, and Snapchat. Not once during those four or five months did I log into my accounts on those platforms. Instead, I used social media that helped me improve my coding skills, like YouTube and Reddit. Additionally, rather than spending time chatting on Discord or any social media that eats up my time, I used those hours to learning the basics of Python and practicing how to code in Python. I continuously practiced almost every day for more than two hours and I didn't stop there, because when I got stuck on a particular question or didn’t know how to solve a Python question on Coderunner, I used ChatGPT as a tool to give me the solution and help me understand how to do it, and then I wrote the code myself (not by copy-pasting the code onto Coderunner, but by genuinely writing it out even if I were to copy it). Also I used AI, like ChatGPT, to explain what went wrong with my code and why the error occurred whenever I encounter an error or problem with my code. This helped me learn from my mistakes and avoid repeating them in the future. That’s how I managed to improve significantly in Python coding. And I also occasionally watched YouTube videos to enhance my skills further or ask people on Reddit if I am unsure about something.

After passing this course this semester, I realized the mistakes I made last semester that prevented me from succeeding. The main issue was that I didn’t even try to code or write programs in Python myself, instead, I relied entirely on ChatGPT for solutions. Then I would copy and paste the code from ChatGPT into Coderunner to answer the questions. That made me realize and understand that I am actually not learning anything if I just copy and pasting code to answer the questions on Codeunnrer. This semester though, I recognized that this approach was not helping me learn or improve my coding skills. So I changed and I treat ChatGPT as a tool to assist my learning. Whenever I’m stuck on a question, I use it to ask for help, then I wrote the code myself to understand and learn how to do it. If I make a mistake when writing it, I look back and see what went wrong, and sometimes, I take the opportunity to learn from it. And I was extremely motivated and self-disciplined to pass this course. This change in my approach has significantly improved my coding skills. 

My overall grade in Compsci101 this semester was a B-, but I believe I could have performed much better if I hadn’t been in the morning labs or had anxiety about failing the course a second time. Typically, I am not a morning person, so I tend to have difficulty waking up early in the morning. Without enough sleep, I can’t function properly. Being in the morning classes meant waking up early, which left me sleep-deprived. This sleep deprivation affected my mood and concentration, leading to drowsiness and itchy eyes, all of which impacted my overall performance on tests. Most of the time, I attended labs after 1PM, but I had to take the tests during my lab time due to the rules. Out of the four tests, my highest score was 7/10, while my lowest was 5/10. I didn’t manage to get more than 7 questions right or fewer than 5 in any of the four tests. Also I tend to have anxiety especially if I have morning tests or exams because I'm afraid I might fail the course a second time or forget everything. If only I hadn’t been in the morning classes or didn't have anxiety, I feel like I could have done better and achieved a higher overall grade, sad I only got B-, but I manage to pass somehow.

Also Mathmokiwi and everyone who said this course is easy, you guys were right, compsci101 ain't this difficult as long as a student spends the time practicing and learning how to code in Python, anyone could easily pass the course.

After passing compsci101, it made me realize that there is no course at UoA that I cannot pass, as long as I put in the time and effort into each and every one of my courses, I can easily pass it.",active,0,positive,0

1g78nic,193,2024-10-19,Today I took the HSK6 exam (again)! Here's my postmortem.,u/BeckyLiBei,ChineseLanguage,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/1g78nic/today_i_took_the_hsk6_exam_again_heres_my/,"First, my previous marks:

- July 2021: HSK5: listening 86; reading 75; writing 88.  (total 248 = 82%)  Postmortem [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/omq7cw/today_i_took_the_hsk5_exam_heres_my_postmortem/).

- March 2022: HSK6: listening 52; reading 63; writing 55.  (total 170 = 57%)  Postmortem [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/toio6w/today_i_took_the_hsk6_exam_heres_my_postmortem/).

- October 2022: HSK6: listening 56; reading 55; writing 45. (total 156 = 52%)  (I didn't to a postmortem for the second time; it was quite upsetting getting worse marks after 8 months of full-time study.)

Two years of full-time Chinese study later, this was my third time taking the HSK6.


**How did I do?**

I did as good as I could hope for in the reading and writing sections.  The reading section I timed to perfection (doing the sections backwards: 4, 3, 2, 1)---the lady announced there was 5 minutes left when I had 3 语病 questions unanswered.  The writing section this time was much easier than the last two times I took it (I think there was only one proper noun in the whole exam, and it wasn't essential to narrate the story), so that was just pure luck.  The handwriting was not an obstacle for me; normally, if I forget how to handwrite a character, I can switch to a synonym and/or rephrase the sentence, but there wasn't really any characters I needed to handwrite which I couldn't handwrite.  (The real problem with the handwritten exam is editing.)

My listening section was not ideal, but that's expected as it's my weakness.  Occasionally the audio contained the answer word for word, but usually you have to understand what was said and infer the correct answer.  There were two ""不 questions"" in the listening section (which option is incorrect).  This time, there were no technical difficulties with the recording.

For the HSK6, I feel like my marks this time are as good as I can achieve at my current level.  I was considering taking the HSK6 again (just in case), but I do not believe I'd get better marks just through luck.  (If my marks are poor, I think next time I'll take it in Australia, and see if there's any truth to the notion that it's easier outside of China.)

This is my third time taking the handwritten HSK6 in China, and I'm yet to see anyone who didn't look east Asian.  The exam in Qingdao took place at a Korean school, so most (maybe all) were children with Korean passports.  (There was a lady from El Salvador in the HSKK高级, however.)

It was also my first time taking the HSKK高级, which I did absolutely disasterously on.  For the first two 复述 (""re-narrate"") questions, I basically said a few key words and gave up.  The HSKK高级 audio seemed to be harder than the HSK6 audio.  I spoke with 4 students who took the HSKK高级 with me, and they also said they had no idea what was said in the 复述 section.  Maybe it's just sour grapes, but this seems like a poorly designed exam.  Certainly, my marks on this exam won't reflect my oral Chinese level.

*My HSK6 mark predictions*: listening 65%, reading 80%, writing 70%.  [The marks will be published: 19th of November.]  Last time I overestimated my marks significantly, so maybe I'm doing the same this time (maybe -10% from all three estimates to account for this).


**How did I prepare this time?**

I took something like 20 classes on iTalki with [Jenny Chen](https://www.italki.com/en/teacher/1294454) who helped me with the HSK6 and HSKK高级 specifically.  (I used 并 and 于是 on today's exam because of her feedback on my writing.)  I had several other iTalki teachers along the way too.

As usual, I studied multiple textbooks.  I studied the New Practical Chinese Reader 5, from start to finish (spending something like 8+ hours per chapter).  I also re-studied all 40 chapters of the HSK6 Standard Course textbooks (digging much deeper than before; usually I spent 10 hours per chapter).  I tried 《新汉语水平考试教程》 but I couldn't find the mp3s, so it wasn't much use for me.  (Out of curiosity, I tried doing the listening section without the mp3, and got 38/75 = 50% before I got bored, which is a bit unsettling.)

Two years ago, I thought the HSK6 Standard Course Workbook exercises were too hard.  Here's my marks this time around (only including the listening and reading sections; not under exam conditions):

上: 1. 83% 2. 75% 3. 75% 4. 83% 5. 89% 6. 86% 7. 78% 8. 89% 9. 95% 10. 86% 11. 92% 12. 95% 13. 75% 14: 56% 15: 75% 16: 72% 17: 83% 18: 75% 19: 89% 20: 83%

下: 21. 72% 22. 78% 23. 67% 24. 69% 25. 72% 26. 78% 27. 75% 28. 64% 29. 67% 30. 78% 31. 83% 32. 81% 33. 69% 34: 58% 35: 81% 36: 69% 37: 75% 38: 86% 39: 83% 40: 94%

Note the inconsistent marks (e.g., in section 14 I got 56% and in section 40 I got 94%).  Some of these questions felt unhelpful, and even demotivating (especially when they deliberately set ""traps"" rather than help you learn Chinese).

There's a mock exam at the end of the HSK6 Standard Course Workbook; I got: listening 78%, reading 88%.  I did the writing sections throughout too, but they were unmarked (ChatGPT gave me feedback though).  I usually found I mis-handwrote two or three characters, and made some poor word choices and clunky grammar choices, but there's not much I can do to improve this without additional years of practice.

I did the 汉语水平考试真题集 HSK 六级 2018版 Official Examination Papers of HSK (Level 6) again, but untimed this time.  It contains 5 HSK6 exam papers from 2018.  My marks this time:

1: 听力: 86% 阅读: 88%  [2022 marks: 听力: 66% 阅读: 64%]
2: 听力: 90% 阅读: 90%  [2022 marks: 听力: 74% 阅读: 68%]
3: 听力: 88% 阅读: 90%  [2022 marks: 听力: 64% 阅读: 76%]
4: 听力: 84% 阅读: 92%  [2022 marks: 听力: 64% 阅读: 70%]
5: 听力: 78% 阅读: 80%  [2022 marks: 听力: 64% 阅读: 70%]

I tested my handwriting with the 3018 simplified characters in Heisig and Richardson's *Remembering Simplified Hanzi* (which splits into two volumes, the first with 1500 characters); I turned it into a handwriting printout (posted [here](https://www.chinese-forums.com/forums/topic/63251-handwriting-practice-with-heisigs-character-list)).  I think I did this 3 times over (I did 100 characters each morning for a few months).  I estimate I can handwrite maybe 85% of the first volume, and maybe 40% of the second volume.

The other major change in my study was ChatGPT.  ChatGPT has massively increased my reading volume.  ChatGPT was especially helpful for actionable feedback in the writing section.  Nowadays, using headphones and a lapel mic, I talk with ChatGPT (the free version) for 2+ hours straight, and it barely feels like I'm studying.  ChatGPT is also rather encouraging.

I read all sorts of things, such as 《锐阅读》 (which contains articles suited for Chinese middle-school students), or news articles on Sohu (I feel some of the HSK6 contents are copy/pasted from sites like this), or I'd get ChatGPT to convert r/todayilearned posts into HSK6 reading material, or I'd just read novels.  I make sure I have no ""I've read nothing today"" days.

It seems when studying vocabulary, I've gone through three phases: (a) initial study of the word, (b) becoming more familiar with the word through input, (c) studying the word to exhaustion.  This way, if you tell me an incorrect meaning of a word, I no longer think ""maybe it's a rare usage I don't know"", and now think ""no, I know all the meanings of this word, that's not one of them"".  This helps a lot with sections 1 (""faulty sentence"") and 2 (""fill in the blanks"") in the HSK6 reading section.

I also got into Genshin Impact, and some of its stories are quite entertaining (Kachina's storyline especially), which provided a fair amount of listening practice.  And the characters actually react to what is being said, which helps understanding.  I feel the small subtitles on my phone are unpleasant to read, so I'd rather just listen.  This game is a bit of a double-edged sword though, because a lot of the time you're not learning Chinese, and you're saving primogems to pull for Nahida in the 5.2 update.


**Did I improve over the two-year gap?**

Absolutely!  When studying the listening section, I often repeated what I heard in the audio into English in my YouTube videos, which I would not have been able to do if I were just listening for keywords.  I listen with the aim of understanding what they're saying.  My reading speed has increased to the point where I didn't feel rushed in today's exam (although I didn't have time to dilly dally).  Having read lots, I've become familiar with collocations, so I zip through part 2 in the reading section (I can sometimes deduce how to fill in the blanks without even looking at the answers).  My writing has improved, but the HSK6 writing section is just one silly ""abridge"" task and nothing else (sometimes I call it the ""second reading section""); my improvements in writing are more like building suspense, conveying emotion, character developement, pursuasive writing, plot twists, etc., which does nothing for my marks in the HSK6 writing section where I'm instructed to mentally copy/paste some uninspiring story.  ([Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WriteStreakCN/comments/1frwapc/i_wrote_a_satirical_mock_hsk6_question/)'s an example of my writing.)

There was an important change in my study mindset: **I'm not learning Chinese to take the HSK6, I'm taking the HSK6 to help me learn Chinese.**  So...

1. I didn't practice under exam conditions, but studied past/mock exam papers with the goal of learning as much as possible (I can get 80%+ with unlimited time; I just need to get faster [I have the theory, but not the practice]);

2. when I was in the exam, I didn't feel stressed because the HSK6 is merely a tool to help me learn Chinese, and my Chinese has objectively improved regardless of my HSK6 marks;

3. the reduction in stress led to better concentration during the exam;

4. and if I want better HSK6 marks, then I will genuinely improve my Chinese skills, which will have long-term benefits.

I wish I had had this realization years earlier.


The first time I took the HSK6, I wrote:

> If I had a time machine, I would go back and tell myself not to think about the HSK6 until (a) my vocabulary is above 20000 (characters above 3000), (b) I've read 10 million characters worth of input, and (c) my reading speed is 160+ characters per minute.

What about now?  My (passive) vocabulary is in the ballpark of 15000 words, and I probably know a bit more than 3000 characters (it becomes meaningless to count words at this level: you know so many variants of words, and so many proper nouns, your vocabulary size is determined by your choice of dictionary).  So 20000 words is too many.  While 15000 words doesn't guarantee I know every word on the HSK6, I read with relative ease today's HSK6 exam (although there were some unknown words on the HSKK高级), so I don't think 15000 words is necessary.  Still knowing 15000 words helps a lot on the HSK6 exam.

Did I read 10 million characters worth of input?  Over 2 years, that's 13700 characters per day, so probably no.  I'd guess in total I've read more than 10 million characters by now (but it's not like I keep track [I wish there were a browser extension that just counted how many characters you've read]).

PS. I have noticed there's a HSK7-9 exam where I live (in three weeks).  Do you think I should ""YOLO"" it?  I will almost surely not pass, but it might be worthwhile getting an idea of what the exam is like for a future, more serious attempt.",active,216,neutral,0

- Academia is a dumpster fire, to put it mildly. Too many applicants, not enough jobs, extreme elitism, paid very little, and you're still bottom of the totem pole.

- Research jobs in industry are kind of antonyms, industries want immediate profit, and ""research"" isn't really a thing you can guarantee results from

- Master's student admissions are a piece of cake compared to PhD admissions, allowing them to focus purely on what they want to learn, instead of the huge barriers there are to a PhD program (e.g. Standford M.S. vs Harvard PhDs are in entirely different universes for applicant requirements, like the difference in difficulty between bachelors at a no-name school and admission into a medical school)

- Fudging of data and ChatGPT are probably taking their toll on how seriously outsiders take research. Only so much research data can be faked before it starts to reflect on everyone, even if most people don't do it.

- Network: Takes time to build relationships (4-6 months, or more) and even then that ""network"" might not translate into a role.   
- Shoppers: Okay without, but I have student debt.

It's fine if I can land something by applying to 3-4 roles every day but so far it has not been working, I have a good boring resume (ones that work) minimal white space and good pointers.

Here's how I did it.,u/LimeWire34,WGU,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1g8czej/i_passed_both_d317_a_core_2_and_d316_a_core_1_in/,"Hey there fellow Night Owls. I just wanted to give back to the community by sharing the strategies and resources I used to be successful on the CompTIA A+ exams.

First of all, DO NOT use the reading material on CertMaster Learn's lessons content as a learning resource. The content on CertMaster Learn goes way outside the scope of the certification and you'll be overwhelmed with information that isn't even within the exam objectives. It's also very dry. I'm the type of student that prefers learning by reading as opposed to learning by watching videos, and even I was put to sleep by CertMaster Learn. Seriously. Do not use it.

What you should instead use is Professor Messer's CompTIA A+ playlists on Youtube. He is a CompTIA Authorized Partner and he has two playlists on Youtube for both Core 1 and Core 2. I used his videos as my primary learning resource and it worked wonders for me. His content is very professional and to the point. I watched about ten of his videos each day to prepare for the exams. I also watched each playlist three times over to completion to prepare. 

Also, go on [www.professormesser.com](http://www.professormesser.com) and buy his notes for Core 1 and Core 2. They're only $30. Review the sections of the topics that were covered from the videos you watched for a given day. This will help with your understanding of the material and your retention of the material as well.

To further increase your retention, obtain the exam objectives sheet for both Core 1 and Core 2 and create flashcards for each term. I used ChatGPT to write these flashcards for me. Review the flashcards of one of the Domains of the exam objectives each day. 

Once you have watched the playlist twice over, it's time to take a practice test. I used Jason Dion's practice tests for Core 1 and Core 2, which are provided free of charge by the school through the Udemy platform. Dion's practice test questions are phrased similarly as the questions on the exam. Aim for at least an 80% on the first attempt on the practice exams. After you have achieved an 80% or higher on four of Dion's practice tests, then you're exam ready! It's time to set up an appointment and pass!

And that's all she wrote! With the above strategies, I passed A+ Core 2 with a 754 and A+ Core 1 with a 769. I also finished both A+ exam classes in under a month using these strategies and resources. I hope this post was helpful to you.

1g8fwlw,9,2024-10-20,SOLID TIPS since im done with my SAT's 😇,u/Substantial-Skirt-58,Sat,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sat/comments/1g8fwlw/solid_tips_since_im_done_with_my_sats/,"I took the October SAT and I got 1410 (770 maths & 640 r&w), it's my first & last test

okayy I might not be the excelling sat taker like other ppl here but I'm talking from personal experience

I was quite a failing student in high school ngl, my first practice test was abt 2 months before the test (1130)

for math:
- I honestly don't really find question bank that useful (I'm sure lots of questions come out from there tho) as I don't have the patient to do it and mark it one by one *me problem im sorry*

- khan academy is the GOAT for me, I finished the course & repeated the course challenge about three times per day (helped so much)

- after you finish ur practice test, please review it, it is really important (if you're impatient like me just look at questions u got wrong/was hesitating in test, and look up tutorllini test prep's practice test vids, and review the questions u got wrong)

- write notes of the formulas you encountered frequently when you do questions, so you can read them before ur sat's 

- if you don't know how to do a question, try and use chatgpt to explain it (if you cant find it anywhere on the internet explaining it) and make sure to write the question down, and redo it before your SAT !!!

- may not be the most accurate but some of the questions in those ""questions in the XXXX month SAT"" youtube vids actually came out, so you should try them out

- LEARN DESMOS THROUGHOUT, it helps and saves alot of time (but make sure to check ur answer again with ur calculator if you aren't sure)


for reading and writing:
- honestly I find memorising vocabs hard-to-do for me, so instead, I just remember the prefixes, suffixes and roots (and also do a ton of vocab questions on khan academy)

- ok for reading and writing defo do use the question bank & khan academy together (more questions)

- finish khan academy's standard english convention course, and do a ton of standard english convention questions because they are the easiest to learn and it SAVES UR SCORE (I went from 490 in my first practice test -> 640 in my oct SAT's r&w) 

- start from q15/q16 and finish them, then go back to q1 for the vocabs

- for notes questions, although most of the times you can get answers by reading the question, some questions would require you to kinda skim through the notes (so it depends)

- while many people would say you can just read the question fast, but I would recommend to read the question slowly and comprehend it. You wouldn't wanna read the question again and again quickly then ending up not understanding it

- repeating khan academy course challenge helps too

- KEEP THE TIMER ON so you can kinda keep track of the time and get used to the flow & speed of the exam

lastly, good luck for your SAT!
hopefully it'll help out, I'll reply if u have any questions ^^",active,11,neutral,0

1g8nusm,185,2024-10-21,Caught 2 students cheating and they continue to deny,u/Straight-Stay3830,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1g8nusm/caught_2_students_cheating_and_they_continue_to/,"I teach an English language course to foreign exchange students from non-English countries. Today we had a test and I caught 2 students cheating (in different sections) as clear cut as any cheating case could ever be. Yet, they both vehemently deny any wrongdoing.

For context, they take tests on their electronic devices, mostly because I’m an underpaid adjunct who doesn’t have time for grading and because they find it easier than writing by hand. Plus I can test them on more content if it’s not handwritten. The questions are fairly similar to the questions in their textbook although I do change them up slightly or throw in a few curveballs.

During the listening portion, one student was behaving very suspiciously. She had her tablet on the lowest brightness setting which is odd considering it’s a dark room and I can’t read my own phone or iPad on that same setting. She also positioned herself against a wall and pivoted her tablet screen toward the wall so it was hard to see what she was doing. I was immediately suspicious and monitored her closely. Lo and behold, I caught her looking at a screenshot of a page from our textbook which conveniently was exactly the page that the video I was playing happened to be about. I immediately confronted her and she denied having cheated. She said she was doing something unrelated and that just happened to be something she had open (that doesn’t even make sense). She says she had the photo from a day she forgot her textbook so she took a photo of her friend’s. First, you shouldn’t even be navigating away from the Canva test interface in the first place. Second, it’s obviously not a coincidence considering she had that page open right while I was playing a video about that exact page of the textbook AND she was behaving so strangely during the test.

As for the student in my other section, he was also behaving strange so I casually approached him from behind. I caught him recording the audio of the listening test using the speech to text function of ChatGPT. I assume it was either because 1) a lot of my Asian students (he was of Asian background) have trouble with listening but are good at reading so he probably wanted to read the dialogue rather than listen to it, or 2) he intended to interact with the text once it was produced and ask ChatGPT to answer the related questions. The point is I literally caught him WHILE he was recording the audio with ChatGPT RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. I saw EVERYTHING clear as day. He vehemently denies all. HOW?!

It just amazes me. I will be giving them both zero but I’m just baffled how they can deny it with such confidence despite so obviously cheating. I admit I actually laughed while hearing both their excuses but they were completely serious. How? How can you actually say this with a straight face?

I think the problem is that first year students are so immature and childish, when any sort of problem arises they go into damage control mode. How can I get out of this? How can I avoid consequences? They don’t have the maturity, experience, or wherewithal to realize that when you are caught with your pants down, it’s going to be better in the long run to just admit your wrongdoing, apologize, deal with the consequences, and do your best to move forward. That’s what they need to learn the most.",User_deleted,190,neutral,0

I am an associate professor in Software Engineering and I am trying to create content for a workshop on Python programming. The workshop is a self-study, and the evaluation criteria is a simple pass/no-pass.

Until recently, I would have created the workshop around a major exercise, like implementing tic-tac-toe in Python, but seeing as that is a simple task to instruct ChatGPT to do, that is not a route I want to do anymore. Instead, I would like to embrace the possibility of turning the workshop away from being a learning experience on the fundamentals of Python and instead having the students doing prompting and having to evaluate/adjust the generated responses. The students are already well familiar with Java syntax and programming paradigms in general, so I judge there is no need to learn this again with Python. As long as they can recognize the programming structures they know from Java in Python, I am good.

But I am struggling with how to formulate the exercise; if I make it too detailed and technical, students will simply throw these instructions into ChatGPT and have no reflections at all. I get the sense, it must be formulated in a way, that makes it approachable for the students, but cannot be directly prompted to ChatGPT, but then I am speculating if that is even possible at all.

Any suggestions from human peers will be welcome, as I have already tried asking ChatGPT and it cannot grasp the issue.",active,0,neutral,0

1g9q4ud,47,2024-10-22,iSchool Expectations/Accountability Rant,u/swamblies,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/1g9q4ud/ischool_expectationsaccountability_rant/,"TLDR; iSchool does not hold students accountable for actually understanding the material. The classes aren't necessarily 'easy' themselves (difficult enough concepts/assignments/etc.), but they just hand out A's like we are in elementary school. The expectations are nonexistent. People get away with it through the excessive amount of group work and using generative AI, and I wish so badly that projects were solo because they'd just be less work than babysitting a bunch of adults with lackluster performance.

Disclaimer: I am not saying this is ALL iSchool students/professors/classes. This is just a trend I have experienced myself over and over and I am so sick of it.

I am an Information Science major for reference (along with another major & minor in CMNS). I took on the major last year. Going in, I thought it was going to live up to the expectation that everyone gave it: easy enough, full of comp sci dropouts, some projects but not nearly as much outside work as comp sci, etc.

Since being in the major, I have realized its more than just ""easy comp sci."" Not only do the rooms stink just as bad of B.O. as the computer science classes, but many students are incredible slackers/cheaters and the professors rarely hold them accountable. At least in comp sci (I assume) students literally cannot slack off without failing a class (seen it happened to several people freshman year who chose League of Legends over CompSci).

 Scrolling through weekly discussion posts, I see the same conventions being used again and again with the same comments, evident that students are either copying from previous posts or all just using AI like ChatGPT to write their code/discussion post. I am willing to bet that half of these people graduate with an Information Science degree and can't write a program more than 50 lines without the use of generative AI. To clarify, I do think that AI can be very helpful when learning (asking it what certain functions do, to help you remember the name of a function, explain syntax, debugging, etc.), it just shouldn't be used to straight up complete assignments.

The classes themselves are not as ""easy"" as they are made out to be. They're nothing crazy, but they do require some though to understand concepts like objects or keys. But they just don't seem to hold any students accountable for actually doing the work and understanding the material. People are passing these classes having not learned a thing. You can literally finish an ""intro to \[coding language\]"" class and pass with flying colors without knowing a thing about coding in that language.

In my other major, you HAVE to put in the work to get an A. Exam averages range from 50-70 and the grade distribution is a bell curve, with the peak being usually around a B or B-. These classes require you to put in work after class and practice what you learn independently. If you do not study outside of class, do the homework, and actually understand how to apply concepts, you will absolutely fail the class. I assumed that this was the case for all majors. In the iSchool though, I can't imagine anyone getting less than an A- in most of these classes unless they literally didn't do any assignments, simply because the expectation for many classes is less than the bare minimum. 

Many iSchool classes love to assign groupwork. This is a great idea in theory, since many of us will be pursuing careers that require us to work with others, since no one person can realistically write hundreds of thousands of lines of code within a ""normal"" timeframe. However, all these group projects are giving the opportunity for students to slack off further by waiting for the one or two people to do the work for them. I have spoken to several other upperclassmen iSchool majors who feel the same way. Almost every single group project I have been involved in within INST courses have included several underwhelming teammates who do less than the bare minimum. 

For instance, one of my classes required a formal write-up along with the final presentation of our project. I had word-for-word written out everything that my teammate needed to add to the document (I even wrote HER script for the presentation, which she read robotically off of instead of paraphrasing. Did none of these people take a communications class???). All she had to do was format my shorthand bullet points into a short paragraph. Instead, she simply copy and pasted the bullets into a formal essay that specifically asked for paragraph format, leaving me to do that entire section myself.

Also, loads of these classes are grading on completion??? We aren't in elementary school, there should be no ""participation"" awards. The average for major assignments hovers around 95% in many classes. Having seen what other people are submitting for these assignments, I am astounded that instructors are handing out full credit to the majority of students. 

For example, INST327 is many student's first introduction to SQL, a database coding language. The class itself is not exceptionally challenging, but it is understandable why many people would find learning a new coding language to be a daunting task. We have ONE weekly individual assignment graded on correctness. My professor decided to grade last week's individual assignment on completion AFTER everyone had submitted. The topic covered was arguably the most challenging subject in the entire class: Normalization. I spent hours going to TA office hours, communicating with the instructional staff, and working on it independently, just to get the same grade as the people who started it the night it was due (I am in a group for that class and they were all looking for help on the beginning of the assignment at 10pm that same night). Even worse, I looked over the answer key and saw that I did the entire process correctly, and will not be credited for that.

This is literally the only type of assignment in the class that holds people accountable for actually learning, understanding, and applying what we learn. This wouldn't be so bad if the only other assignments we have graded on correctness were the semester-long group project. This means that the lack of accountability towards these students indirectly impacts me through this group work. My group members have a concerning lack of understanding about SQL and have not once attended office hours to seek assistance. Not only do they have an inability to code, but they don't seem to have a conceptual understanding of databases either. For instance, one group member simply had to write 10 questions that our database could answer (who, what, when, where, why level questions. Nothing crazy or groundbreaking here; anyone could accomplish this without any coding knowledge). I went to look over the questions they wrote and not only were they incomplete, but every single one was completely unrelated to our database, meaning I had to do that section on top of what I was originally assigned to complete (the sections I ended up doing were literally worth over 50% of the entire assignment). Imagine having a database that listed employees names, date of hire, and where they got their college degree. A question you may ask would be ""from what college do we hire the most alumni?"" My group member was writing questions along the lines of ""how much money do our employees make,"" which is literally not available in that data.

This next group assignment for the project requires everyone in the group to understand and apply Normalization to our dataset. It includes a writeup about why we chose to Normalize in that specific way. It is the EXACT same thing as last week's individual assignment (the one that was spontaneously graded on completion). So basically, because nobody was held accountable for understanding Normalization with last week's assignment, I am once again stuck normalizing a complex dataset without the help of my group members (I have been communicating this to the instructional staff and there's not much to do besides give them poor ratings/explanations during peer-check ins). Even worse, because they also lack the conceptual understanding, I don't think they will be able to do the writeup either, since they can't explain relationships, linking tables, composite primary keys, etc.

My professor sent out an ELMS announcement to let the class know that last week's individual assignment was graded on completion. Myself and another student posted a public comment that we felt it was unfair and requested extra credit for the students who were correct. Another student replied ""I disagree since that would lower another idea and expectation, which leads to unfairness."" What does that even mean??? Not only is that sentence borderline unintelligible, but what on god's green earth could ""lead to unfairness"" when you give credit where credit is due and hole people accountable? Have we really sunk so low as to believing that on a college level, students applying their understanding to an assignment, and then being given a grade that reflects this, is somehow ""lowering an idea and expectation?"" I know we aren't an ivy league, but I really thought that UMD was better than this.

I'm genuinely so tired. I would have no problem doing these large projects solo over groups. It has become more work being in a group than just doing everything myself because I have to constantly be the one to reach out to them with reminders, tell them when to meet, set up meetings, ask them questions, tell them what they need to do, etc. Nobody ever seems to just figure out what they need to do on their own. Its like they need a chaperone to hold their had all the way through. I shouldn't have to feel like an elementary school teacher in a college level class. I've done everything in my power to try to communicate this to groups time and time again, and I've gone as far as reaching out to the instructors to request guidance. Its ridiculous that these people are getting the same grade as me for an assignment they didn't do so much as READ. I have to genuinely BEG group members to communicate, to come to a 20 minute weekly Zoom meeting, and to just DO their part of a project.

I'm literally exhausted for all the wrong reasons. It would be one thing if the course load was what was pushing me to my limits, but it is entirely the issue of how iSchool professors grade and how iSchool students act in group projects.

I (23M) have been working professionally for 3 years and returned to uni to pursue a new career. I recently had a midterm in a management course where the professor didn’t provide a rubric for the long-answer questions, only stating that 3 questions were worth 15 points total. I asked her during the exam how the points were split between questions, and she said she wasn’t sure but the first question (which was much longer) would count for more. I ended up getting zero on the last two questions, which were worth 8 points total (27% of the entire exam). Nearly half the class also got zeros. It’s also not a curve based system.

I emailed the professor afterward, asking about the point distribution and expressing surprise at the weight of the last two questions. I didn’t think they were worth as much based on her answer during the exam. She responded by saying she was shocked by my email, and we arranged to meet in person.

At the meeting, I explained that I wanted to learn from my mistakes and understand the exam better. She seemed frustrated with all the questions she was getting from students and repeatedly expressed surprise that so many people got the last two questions wrong. When we discussed how she distributed the marks, she said those two questions were the most important. I was confused since they only took up one slide in the lecture and weren’t emphasized much.

I asked if she was open to constructive criticism, and she said yes. I started by saying I liked her lectures, but maybe more time could’ve been spent on the important questions in class. She cut me off, saying my feedback was an excuse and that I had no right to criticize her because she’s taught the course for years, while I’d only taken it once.

She then went on a long rant, saying I was rude and disrespectful for questioning her in the email. She said that in the “real world,” I’d be seen as unprofessional for questioning a superior like that. I apologized multiple times, explained that I never meant to be disrespectful, and told her I just wanted to learn.

Now I’m confused. Did I go too far? or did she go too far? Is this okay for a professor to say things like that? Although I think what she did is wrong I’m still questioning myself if I’m the asshole and I’m just not understanding it since she’s a management professor and the head of the masters in management department. Surely she knows a lot more about management and teaching than me. I’m also trying my best not to offend her any further because she does mark my exams so  I don’t want to jeopardize my grade.

TL;DR: My professor called me disrespectful for asking how she graded an exam, then said questioning a superior is unprofessional.

It’s exhausting. Most of the tasks require a lot of time are making annotations on my resources and actually preparing/writing the assignment or essay. 

I can see how ChatGPT can make things four times as efficient for me and I am not tempted to cheat. I’d get my degree and then I’d be fucked in the real world. My college obviously has a non-ChatGPT rule. However for students like me who without using ChatGPT as a tool, have to go through really fucked up barriers. The education system has always been fucked up that I am thinking of quitting and moving onto my alternative career path.

HOWEVER I want to see how to utilize ChatGPT for school. I want to know how to navigate around some of the ethical issues. For example, ChatGPT could give me ideas/insights that I’ve never thought before. How do I think about that? Another example would be that I am not permitted to utilize ChatGPT during an exam and I have to write an essay which would take hours.

\---------------------------------

TL;DR by ChatGPT:

The Ministry of Education (MOE) in Singapore will introduce new device management applications for students’ Chromebooks and iPads starting in November 2024 and January 2025, respectively. Lightspeed Systems will be deployed on Chromebooks by the end of November 2024, while Jamf will be introduced for iPads in January 2025, requiring a guided onboarding process at schools. Windows devices will continue using Blocksi.

This update follows MOE’s removal of Mobile Guardian after a cybersecurity breach in August 2024 that affected 13,000 users. MOE confirmed legal action was taken against the contractors involved in the breach.

The new applications were selected for their mobile device management, usage management, and classroom management capabilities, as well as their compliance with security standards. Schools will receive training in November to ensure smooth deployment, and MOE will provide ongoing support during the transition, acknowledging that some initial challenges may arise.

\---------------------------------

SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Education (MOE) will roll out new device management applications to students’ Chromebooks and iPads from November 2024 and January 2025 respectively. 

Lightspeed Systems will be centrally deployed to Chromebook personal learning devices by the end of November 2024 with no additional steps required by parents or students, MOE said in a statement on Thursday (Oct 24). 

For iPads, Jamf will be deployed in January 2025 because students will need to go through a guided onboarding process in school, said the education ministry. 

Windows devices will continue to use Blocksi. 

The update follows MOE’s decision in August to [remove device management application Mobile Guardian](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mobile-guardian-application-remove-cybersecurity-incident-moe-4526676) from students' devices the day after a global cybersecurity breach

Mobile Guardian suffered a cyberattack on Aug 4 that affected 13,000 users from 26 secondary schools. In September, Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing confirmed that MOE [took legal action](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mobile-guardian-cybersecurity-breach-attack-legal-action-contractors-chan-chun-sing-4597791) against ""relevant contractors"" after the breach.

For parents who want “greater say” over how their children use their devices at home, MOE will continue to provide them with options to manage the devices after school hours, it said. 

Noting that no software solution is “entirely foolproof”, the education ministry said it has taken steps to ensure that the new applications “meet schools’ needs effectively”. 

The new applications were selected for their ability to meet “core technology requirements”, including mobile device management, usage management and classroom management, said MOE in its statement. 

They also comply with security standards, including independent third-party security attestations and certifications, said the ministry. 

To prepare to deploy these applications, schools will be trained on how to use them in November, said MOE. 

“MOE will provide resources to schools to guide them through the deployment process as well as to engage students and parents,” the statement read. 

Both schools and parents will need time to familiarise themselves with the new applications and may encounter “some teething issues”, MOE acknowledged. 

“MOE will provide the necessary support throughout the transition period and address any issues that may arise.”

I am from a tier 4 local college in India, qualifications: currently in 5th semester, B.Tech.

I do not think I am academically challenged, I personally think I did pretty well in engineering entrance exam and state board exam. Even though my rank was good enough to get into ""good"" private colleges in Bangalore, I decided to stay in my home and attend a ""supposedly"" good private college close to home.

Needless to say, the college isn't good. It's pretty bad to be honest. Now I'm in my third year of computer science and engineering degree and the amount of problems in this college is ridiculous. Anyway, that's besides the point.

One of the problems in Indian engineering educations, is, according to most people, ""outdated syllabus"". I don't think this is a big issue, the standard CSE curriculum consists of all basic foundations of computer science. I don't see any problem with teaching the basics. Basic foundations of the field cannot be updated. I don't think such a thing is possible. 

However my college tries to fix this ""outdated syllabus"" issue 3rd year onwards. We are taught Web technologies (react, spring boot etc.) and I have checked that we have a blockchain elective, there's more, but this comes at the expense of theory of computation course taught in other colleges. My college also fixes the outdated syllabus problem by updating the machine learning course.

That is fine and all, but I think I might be stupid because I simply do not understand our machine learning course.

I have seen that all computer science programs in our country do have a AI/ML course in 3rd year. But in my college, it seems like we ONLY have AI/ML courses for a comp sci program 3rd year onwards because there's too many mandatory courses on AI that I am forced into (I didn't sign up for this, the program got updated this year, just before I entered 3rd year).

The mandatory courses are ""Machine learning and deep learning"" in 5th semester and ""NLP with generative AI"" in 6th semester, I am aware only of these, but I'm pretty sure there's one more in 4th year.

I will get into the syllabus but let me talk about projects. We have mandatory project in the ML/DL course, a mini project (also in AI/ML but we have a choice, though about 70% choices are in AI/ML), a minor project (similar to mini project), and senior year project (most likely the same structure as minor project in 3rd year).

It's evident that there is too much emphasis on ML in this college.

But I have problems with this, please correct me, I think I am stupid, please free to criticize my thinking.

My problem is that there is TOO MANY WORDS, TOO MUCH technical jargon thrown around without really explaining why things work.

Let me outline the syllabus:

1. Introduction to AI/ML, linear regression, logistic regression, Bayesian classification, decision trees.

2. Regularization, support vector machines.

3. Ensemble learning, bagging, boosting.

4. Neural networks, introduction, convolutional neural networks.

5. Sequence to sequence models, attention mechanism, transformers.

I have omitted many more parts of the syllabus, if interested, I can share the whole course plan.

In the above syllabus, only chapter 1 and neural network introduction has mathematics, the rest of the syllabus is just prose after prose. I feel like the course is way too abstract for an engineering course. They use fancy words but never ever explained anything deeply. 

Now the thing is, I don't have any problems with abstraction. Operating system course was also abstract, but not THIS abstract. We had plenty of low level concepts already taught in digital design and computer organization course so operating system, though abstract, made complete sense. But this course has been taught with no background in mathematics and statistics. None of the concepts which are taught in maths courses are linked in this course. Most of the course is just fancy diagrams and technical vocabulary thrown around, which I cannot seem to understand one bit, because I believe I do not have the necessary prerequisites to even understand these concepts.

I would like to say that, I would just move on by memorizing the fancy words (which is what I believe our teachers are doing) and passing the course somehow. But the problem is projects.

Projects are a massive part of my CGPA. I had no knowledge of AI prior to signing up for a mini project in AI, and once I signed up, there is no going back. I have no choice but to make projects in ML/AI for mini, minor and senior projects, the system is like that (I will come back to this later).

Problem with projects is that these problem statements are just... way too high level. I have looked up online, and it seems like most of these projects require at least a PhD to understand. I was required to do a literature survey on my problem statement (all on my own), but I did not understand A SINGLE WORD from whatever research papers I found. I somehow just memorized the key words and passed the review (thanks to ChatGPT), I had to present a power-point presentation with 5 research papers.

Some technologies (?) on which projects are made include: 

\- Generative Adversarial networks, 

\- Explainable AI, 

\- NN architecture search, 

\- Vision Transformers, 

\- Optimization, 

\- Proving the existence of a computer that can solve halting problem, 

\- Bringing back dead people 

(last two are obviously sarcasm, but I can make projects on the latter 2 as well as I can make on the others. Some problem statement are in an Alien language, I can tell you more about it if you want).

I just don't know why no other student seems to have any problems with this. This is just my personal opinion but I don't think knowing technical jargon is equivalent to understanding the concept. I don't say I understand something until I understand it as well as I can understand for example, elementary calculus, and I am pretty confident on my understanding of elementary calculus that I studied in class 12.

All other students just find some ready made project on GitHub and copy paste the research papers and use Humanize AI to somehow bring down the plagiarism rate.

I don't like doing projects like this one bit. I feel trapped because I cannot switch my problem statement. It also doesn't help that the professor coordinating mini, minor and the machine learning course is a big bully who threatens to fail me if I even think if changing my problem statement now. He's a bully in general, he has made it clear that whoever doesn't publish papers for mini and minor project (and cite his research and give him authorship) will not be eligible to pass the course. And he seems to mean it.

I also have to mention that, the course's lecture classes were finished in 7 days, with some 2.5 hours of lectures a day, a week before the semester officially began. Yes, entire syllabus I mentioned above was taught in 7 days, with 2.5 hours of continuous lectures every day. And now I am expected to make two projects in ML/DL and write papers about them.

I don't know what to do now. AI is getting shoved down my throat. I don't like making projects by plagiarizing others' work. I think I will like ML/AI if I learnt it slowly at my own pace, but it will probably take years until I begin understanding these research papers, let alone come up with a novelty.

Please help me, maybe I am completely wrong and all this is completely normal. But I don't see the same issue being raised by my friends in other colleges. It might be possible that my friends too don't care about the project and are like others in my college. I want to learn stuff deeply and not just at an abstract high level. That kind of learning feels so superficial and shallow. I understand that many people in computer science feel that there is no need to reinvent the wheel, but how can I make a car without ever understand how the wheels work, in as much detail as possible?

I would love to hear your thoughts. Thank you for your time. I know this post was too long. ",User_deleted,9,negative,0

My class is culturally diverse, with many ESL students, who tend to use AI to translate their thoughts into English from their native tongue, while other atudents use AI to skirt doing work in general. 

Could I get some recommendations on the fairest policy I could implement in this context and perhaps some samples of policies that work for you?

An In-Depth Review,u/gptgabe,stealthgpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stealthgpt/comments/1gbepz3/are_openais_o1mini_and_o1preview_truly/,"read here: [https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/are-openai-s-o1-mini-and-o1-preview-truly-undetectable-an-in-depth-review](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/are-openai-s-o1-mini-and-o1-preview-truly-undetectable-an-in-depth-review)

Since its inception, StealthGPT has understood that the most optimized form of AI content is humanized, undetectable AI content. Detectable content has no utility as an output than informing the user.

For the longest time, this undetectability is what was lacking from OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other mainstream llms. All the easily decipherable watermarks of bad AI writing were present in what ChatGPT users were delivered as outputs. If a student dared use ChatGPT for their schoolwork, any AI detector would immediately flag the text.

However, [with new AI models, o1-mini and o1-preview, being released to the public today](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/openai-previews-o1-ai-model-212105543.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADjyIPmLqZauF1QYsDT4MSEje1cFg-yq3l_RmaWxerdw4pig0q2PndnPBvif0vMgYdWqfqidqNscFMHU0rvm6NQ_ko39UCHjDBv_zlOGK0MUOA_goo-3mu2GoFHQbWNE3nJ1sQCIE47455SpjY_yRyKem73NgBPnDeLg73-TBSdj), the OG’s of AI content might’ve finally wised up about the future of AI and optimized their text to bypass AI Content detectors. That’s at least what we’re going to find out in this review.

# Table of Contents

# What is OpenAI’s o1-preview?

OpenAI’s o1-preview is the first of a slate of new AI models that take more time thinking so they can take on complex tasks and solve harder problems. New levels of reasoning have been input into the process of how these models generate their answers so that like the human thought process, o1-preview will try different strategies and recognize its own mistakes.

This makes for longer time generating outputs, but also more correct answers. o1-preview still does not have the capabilities of browsing the internet as GPT-4o, but for advanced reasoning, o1-preview touts itself as the new benchmark.

# What is OpenAI’s o1-mini?

OpenAI released two new AI models today. The first of which, o1-mini is a cost-efficient reasoning model meant to take on all the demands of STEM, specially math and coding. For 80% cheaper than their o1-preview tier 5 users of OpenAI’s API can o1-mini as a lower latency of o1-preview. Testing for speed against o1-preview and GPT-4o, o1-mini was 3-5x faster in delivering outputs.

After undergoing human preference evaluations, like o1-preview, o1-mini was determined to outperform GPT-4o in reasoning-heavy domains but gets outperformed in language-focused domains, something that spells doom on the detectability front.

# What is Undetectable AI?

OpenAI made these two models to address the STEM fields and made note of their capabilities in math, science and coding, however English or linguistics was largely amiss from their analysis and most likely from the new model’s machine learning.

Odds are it’s just as detectable as GTP-4o. That said, you may still be wondering what Undetectable AI is then. Undetectable AI is AI writing that has been made to feel like human writing by fine-tuning the language and removing the watermarks of AI writing such as low [perplexity and burstiness](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/how-do-perplexity-and-burstiness-make-ai-text-undetectable). Those watermarks of AI writing are the exact elements that AI detection tools use to flag content as being AI generated.

AI tools like ChatGPT might have some use cases, but the only way to make it useful as an essay writer or blog writer is to run the text through an AI humanizer, the likes of which are usually available from tech startups like the best, StealthGPT.

Now that you understand what undetectable AI is and [how to make ChatGPT undetectable](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/make-chatgpt-undetectable), lets see if the new AI models are worth using or if they’ll be detected.

# Are OpenAI’s o1-mini and o1-preview Truly Undetectable?

The only way we can determine whether these new Open AI models are undetectable is by passing them through AI detection tools like Turnitin, Originality, and GPTZero. First, lets see our outputs from each model.

Here is o1-preview’s essay about Los Angeles and San Francisco:

As you can see, the output now includes the duration of the AI’s thought process. When you click on that duration, an analysis of the AI’s thought process will drop down for you to see. More insight into this should open up new possibilities in terms of prompt engineering for more effective outputs.

At 7 seconds, we should expect o1-mini to be faster. Lets see:

o1-mini thought for only a second and didn’t provide a drop down menu of its process. With these two outputs, we’re gonna determine how detectable they really are.

# vs Turnitin

Running o1-preview through the most popular and widely-used AI detector, Turnitin gave us this result:

Turnitin immediately detected this was 100% AI generated content with 10 instances of plagiarism found. Here’s the result for o1-mini:

Slightly worse, 100% AI generated content detected with 11 instanced of plagiarism found. Not good. These new AI models need to come with a disclaimer about its actually utility.:

>“Only use this content it to inform yourself, not actually for anything useful.”

It should read.

# vs [Originality.AI](http://Originality.AI)

[Originality.AI](http://Originality.AI) came up with the same conclusions:

o1-preview was detected as 100% AI-generated content.

o1-mini was also detected as 100% AI-generated content. This exercise has become a closed case of low expectations.

# vs GPTZero

Lastly, before I move on to less obvious questions than the new ChatGPT’s detectability, lets run it through one last detector, GPTZero:

Same as the others. GPTZero detected o1-preview’s text to be 100% AI generated content.

And as for the new AI-model’s little brother, GPTZero detected o1-mini’s text to be 100% AI generated content.

# Conclusion

Nothing is new under the sun. ChatGPT’s ambitions in automation never included using their content in professional or academic settings. Thus, their new models are as completely detectable as GPT-4 turbo.

If you’re a student, thinking about using o1-mini or o1-preview to write your essays, don’t. You will need an undetectable AI software if you don’t want to be accused of academic misconduct. You will need StealthGPT, the most undetectable AI writing tool in the game. You can visit our [pricing](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/pricing) here, where plans are tailored to your needs and discounts are abundant to make sure everyone has the opportunity to use the most optimized AI-content on Earth.

# FAQ

# Can OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4 Be Detected By Plagiarism Checkers?

Yes. Absolutely. Though we tested their new AI models, certainly their old one is just as unable to bypass AI detection tools as the new.

# How to Avoid AI Detection

You will need to humanize your text by removing the watermarks of AI writing such as low perplexity and burstiness. Undetectable AI services like StealthGPT humanize text by making it feel like human writing with high complexity and randomness in the text’s word choice, sentence structure, and sentence length.

# Is StealthGPT Undetectable?

Yes. We’ve proven it time and time again, against AI detectors large and small. No matter if it’s the largest tool on the market, or some free tool in some dark corner of the internet. We’ve tested our software against the best of the best to prove no AI detector or other undetectable service compares to StealthGPT.",active,1,neutral,0

`Define the course parameters: SUBJECT=[subject name], AUDIENCE=[target audience], DURATION=[course length in weeks]~Create a course outline with main modules, each focusing on a key aspect of the subject~For each module, list 3-5 specific learning objectives that align with the overall course goals~Develop a detailed syllabus including module titles, topics covered, estimated time for completion, and required materials~Create an introduction module that explains the course structure, expectations, and provides an overview of the subject~For Module 1, design a lesson plan with lecture content, practical exercises, and multimedia resources~Develop assessment methods for Module 1, including quizzes, assignments, or projects that test the module's learning objectives~Repeat the lesson plan and assessment development process for the next half of the modules~Create interactive elements for each module, such as discussion prompts, group activities, or hands-on projects~Design a mid-course project or assignment that integrates concepts from the first half of the course~Develop lesson plans and assessments for the remaining modules, incorporating more advanced concepts and building on earlier modules~Create a final project or exam that comprehensively assesses the entire course content~Develop a resource list including textbooks, online materials, and supplementary reading for each module~Create a glossary of key terms and concepts covered throughout the course~Design a feedback mechanism for students to evaluate the course and suggest improvements~Develop a guide for instructors, including teaching tips, common student challenges, and suggested solutions~Create a course completion certificate template and criteria for earning the certificate`

Make sure you update the variable in the first prompt, SUBJECT, AUDIENCE, and DURATION and then you can pass this prompt chain into [ChatGPT Queue](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chatgpt-queue-save-time-w/iabnajjakkfbclflgaghociafnjclbem?hl=en&authuser=0&utm_source=reddit) extension and it will just run autonomously.

But, at the same time, it worries me just how much of a disaster a ChatGPT outage would have been for me. I am doing an extensive project right now which needs wayy too many skills I don't really have, and the only way really to fill these gaps given how it's also time-sensitive is chatGPT. My notes at university are all o1-preview generated, after all it will most definitely know about my lecture's subject more and so it can focus on the important stuff better than me. But it struck me that actually never in my lifetime will I ever learn to make proper notes completely on my own.

i have read and read uni’s AI policy and i 100% abide by it. i don’t use ChatGPT as its generally unreliable but i do use Grammarly to touch up on grammar (i ignore their clarity suggestions and don’t use their genAI function) and i use Elicit AI to search for papers (this has been specifically recommended and permitted by our uni).

anyway, i write all my essays myself and never copy and paste anything. however, after some students have been caught using AI on our course which lead to academic misconduct, i have been running my essays passed online AI detectors. whilst most of it deemed my essay as human content (which it should be as it was), some have highlighted certain parts of my essay as AI-generated when it is my own words and work. this is particularly when there is a part that involve a lot of research references.

this generates a lot of paranoia and emotional turmoil that my work can be incorrectly taken as AI by AI detectors and i could be falsely accused of academic misconduct. it means im constantly rewording my work before submission but even then AI detectors still highlight parts of my work as AI generated. 

i have recently took 2 years out of uni and AI have bursted onto the scene during this time so i never dealt with this problem before. i know i should have nothing to worry about as i used AI responsibly as per my uni’s guidance but it is worrisome that maybe my writing style is triggering AI detectors to detect it as AI and the vague accuracy of these detectors can put my academic integrity into jeopardy.

this is causing significant worries before submission and waiting for the coursework to be marked. 

i have started using google docs to write my essays so i have the whole version history to back me up should i be called up to the meeting regarding any academic misconduct concerns. i think our uni use a VIVA style interview with the module leader to assess learning outcomes if there’s suspect use of genAI but it is so stressful even just thinking they may be a chance that i will need to defend myself.

Reportedly, 86% of students are using generative AI in their schoolwork. AI is everywhere and both academic and professional moderators are using AI detection tools to try and limit the new technology. Students, creators, academics, and professionals are all using AI-generated content and AI content detectors at the same time, and in this chaotic environment, one software offers a free alternative without moral condemnation of those using AI. That is AI Detect, the free AI Checker.

AI writing will be a necessary tool of the future and the future is now. You need the only free AI Detector able to put weak algorithms like ChatGPT, [Undetectable.AI](http://Undetectable.AI), and Stealthwriter in check.

# What is an AI Content Detector

Because generative AI like OpenAI’s ChatGPT became so popularized for use in professional and academic settings, AI detector tools were developed and integrated into the each institution. These AI detection models are able to spot the watermarks that come with large language models.

# How Does AI Detection Work?

AI writing from ChatGPT utilizes machine learning that makes its writing low in perplexity and simple and precise in word choice, sentence structure, and sentence length. Meanwhile, human writing features plenty of randomness and complexity in word choice, sentence structure, and sentence length. AI content detection just looks for this simple, precise features and identifies it at AI-written content, often mistakenly flagging human-writing that is just simple and precise too as false positives.

The most popular examples of AI detectors are Turnitin, [Originality.AI](http://Originality.AI), GPTZero and more. And these all still generate false positives, with a 4% rate on the sentence level by Turnitin.

Once you understand AI Detection and how AI writing tools work, you can understand [how to bypass AI Detection](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/bypassing-ai-detectors-stealthgpt).

# What is AI Detect: The Free AI Checker?

If Ai Detection is going to be an inherently flawed process, you might as well not be paying an arm and a leg for it which is what more prominent AI Writing Detectors expect from their subscribers and our educators. To solve this problem and offer AI detection that neither shames AI writing tools, nor abandons academic integrity, AI Detect offers a service open to everyone.

Students, content creators, educators, professionals, you should all use AI detect whether you want to check if your humanized essay will be detected, or if you want to check a student’s work for AI plagiarism.

# How Accurate Is AI Detect in Identifying AI-Generated Text?

There’s only one way to find out if an AI detector works, by testing it against various content creation tools. The first LLM we’re going to test is the original generative artificial intelligence, ChatGPT:

This is our ChatGPT essay about the best actors of all time. Now, lets run that through AI Detect to see how human this essay really is:

At 1% human, AI Detect knew right away that this was AI-generated content. Now lets compare AI Detect to Stealthwriter’s detector and to ChatGPT’s detectability.

First, here is what our ChatGPT essay looks after it was humanized by Stealthwriter.

The less words that pass through an AI detector, the more unreliable the result, however the words allowed by the stealthwriter’s free trial were enough to seal its fate.

With a 44% human score, AI Detect successfully flagged Stealthwriter at its most undetectable setting. AI Detect is much more than a ChatGPT detector, whether you’re using GPT-3, GPT-4 or undetectable AI, AI Detect has your number dialed in.

# Ethics of AI Detect

As the ethics behind academic integrity and academic misconduct are beginning to shift in lew of AI technology, AI Detect is here to embrace both users of AI content checkers and users of generative AI.

AI Detect is for everyone. It is not the essay police like Turnitin. With AI Detect’s ethics integral to its mission, content creators can feel comfortable supporting a technology that doesn’t jeopardize their process.

[Using AI isn’t exactly plagiarism](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/is-using-chatgpt-plagiarism-academic-dishonesty-in-dishonest-academia) in the first place. Because they generate original content, generative AI doesn’t usually get flagged by old school plagiarismcheckers. That’s why academic institutions have coined the use of AI writing tools in school work as “AI plagiarism”.

This is why if you’d like to use AI writing, you need undetectable AI tools to make your AI-generated text feel like human-written content.

# Conclusion

If you need a powerful AI engine to check your content for detectability, AI Detect is the Free AI Checker that will change your process forever. Whether you’re generating undetectable AI and need to see if it’ll really bypass detectors, or if you’re just reviewing work handed in to you, AI Detect is the most user-friendly, best-value, most effective tool to find AI writing in any piece of text.

# FAQ

# Who uses AI Detectors?

Everyone from students and professionals, anyone that deals with text-based content has a use for an AI detector. Whether it’s a blog moderator or a teacher, these positions deal with so much content that to ensure the content’s integrity, they need to implemenet AI detection software. AI Detection is utilized in content creation for social media and blogs, for SEO to ensure the best content climbs to the top ranks of search engines, and more.

# Do AI Detectors Work?

Although their process is flawed enough for [MIT to declare AI Detectors don’t work](https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/teach/ai-detectors-dont-work/), they’re the best technology people have to ensure academic integrity isn’t completely leveled. As a whole though, they’re an imperfect tool because they don’t even claim to be the final word on a document’s origin. Software like Turnitin that has a 4% false positive rate at the sentence level, only claims to point reviewers in the right direction, whether a document is AI-generated or not.

# How is AI Changing Academia?

Beyond integrating AI detectors into the submission process and a reported [86% of students using AI for schoolwork](https://campustechnology.com/articles/2024/08/28/survey-86-of-students-already-use-ai-in-their-studies.aspx), academia has implemented AI at nearly every level of the institution.

AI has not changed my feelings towards teaching. However, it has increased instances of cheating, and it has changed student behaviors *around* cheating in a way that I resent because it gets in the way of actually *helping* the student.

I have been doing this job for a long time. I know what student writing sounds like, and I can also immediately recognize the word salad that results from plugging an assignment prompt directly into ChatGPT.

I have long since stopped trying to *prove* that something is AI and will just give the paper the bad grade that it deserves, but occasionally I used to tell a student “hey, whether or not this is AI, it *sounds* like AI for a, b, and c reason that you should fix.” (My philosophy in my class is that papers that could be mistaken for AI earn bad grades because they are *bad writing*.) From here I would have loved for the students to recognize that they were caught and that I was both *giving them a break* and explaining why their getting caught was inevitable— but the few times I did this they always always always adopted a defensive posture and started lying unconvincingly in a prose style entirely different from the paper they turned in. It’s just exhausting and insulting, and I’m tired of the feigned shock and confusion. I miss old school plagiarism because students would usually fess up and we could move on to the problem-solving stage. 

The behavior seems very high school to me. I’m trying to have a conversation with an adult, and they’re still acting like a teenager who reeks of schnapps trying to convince his parents that he didn’t get into their liquor cabinet, totally focused on *avoiding punishment* rather than listening to what I’m trying to tell them.

Currently finishing up my first 5 exams. I didn't have a tutor. DM me if you have more questions. Hopefully this isn't too long lol

\*series = anytime during the year that exams are held. May/Jun, Oct/Nov and Feb/Mar (India Only)

  
1) There are no mandatory subjects. Typical number is 7 but you can do less or more (I'm doing 5 this series)

2) You will need to find a centre to sit your exams. You will have to pay. And they ain't cheap. 

3) You already said this but download and print off your syllabuses. Tick off what you already know and are confident with. The exam board can only ask your questions related to the content in those documents.

4) (IN THE UK ONLY) You need to decide if you want to do GCSEs or iGCSEs. I stands for international, typically sat by students outside the UK. iGCSEs are considered harder and they are more expensive to sit. GCSEs are what UK 15/16 years olds will do.

5) You then need to decide on an exam board. Look the the syllabuses, the paper formats and find a centre for that exam board near you. I was stuck with either CIE or Edexcel for my exams but I went with CIE becasue I struggled too much with the Edexcel maths papers. fyi, you can pick different exam boards but it's unlikely that you will be able to do this in the same series. Decide off those factors. DM me if you'd like the list of centres that I've found. 

6) You can 100% homeschool iGCSEs and GCSEs. I'm doing mine without tutors. Find teachers on YouTube that you like for your exam board. Have websites you go to for notes for each subjects. Get some second hand text books (pretty cheap, £4 or less per book.

1. Print off your syllabuses, preferably in checklist form. Tick off what you know. The thing with the syllabus is that the exam papers can only ask you about content on those syllabuses.
2. Find YouTube teachers you like for each of your subjects. These will be your main teachers.
3. Gather up as many resources/websites as you can. Quiz websites, flash cards, websites with notes, pdfs of books, ect.
4. GET YOUR ENTRY TO SIT THE EXAMS IN EARLY. DON'T PROCRASTINATE.
5. For me I find it's best that I don't stick to a fixed study schedule. I'll just pick whichever subject I feel like doing on that day and do it until I'm bored. That might be 20 mins or in might be 2 hours.
6. Have a space for studying that is only used for studying. Have a desk. Keep it 'tidy' with only school materials. How tidy is just personal preference.
7. Read through this website: [https://he-exams.fandom.com/wiki/IGCSEs](https://he-exams.fandom.com/wiki/IGCSEs)
8. Motivate yourself if you're teaching yourself. It's hard but I had to learn at a pretty young age. 'Ban' yourself from your phone until you've at least tried to study. Switch it off. Don't use Instagram/Discord, ect on your tablet/computer. Only associate it with study.
9. Past papers are your best friend. Do as many as possible.
10. Watch videos for fun. Documentaries are great for geo and bio. Goof around a bit a watch Marc Rober or CrashCourse for physics.
11. For sciences, watch as many people doing practicals on YouTube as possible, even if they aren't in the syllabus. You need to be prepared for semi-random ones.
12. Don't rely on ChatGPT to mark your English. It will give you great feedback but the mark will be very inaccurate even if you give it the mark scheme.

TLDR: I left teaching after 1.5 years due to overwhelming workload and stress from handling all curriculum planning alone in a one-form entry school. Now at 26, with more life experience and tools to manage time better, I miss working with kids and am considering returning to teaching, but teaching A-Level English (AP English). I’m concerned that the same challenges might resurface, and I’m seeking advice from others who’ve returned to teaching after leaving. What did you change, and was it better the second time around?

I taught primary (elementary) school for 1 1.5 years, back when I was 22 - 23 years old. As I’m sure many of you can relate to, my training didn’t prepare me for the realities of having my own class. The added responsibilities that add up over, e.g. setting homework, spellings, reading books, marking, the endless paperwork. I also only worked in one form entry schools (one class per grade/year group), so curriculum planning for the whole grade was overwhelming and I felt alone. I crumbled under that stress and so I left teaching.

I’m now 26 and feel like I have a bit more life experience behind me. I don’t crumble under pressure as easily and I follow some teachers online who showed me some tools to save time as teachers, e.g. Teachermatic, ChatGPT (controversial), etc.

I just really miss working with kids and I was wondering if teaching would be different if I taught A-Level English (AP English), where the students actually choose to be in class. Maybe it would make my life a little easier. Plus finding a job in the industry I want has been tough. But I’m scared that if I go into teaching again, the same issues I had before would resurface.

So I’d love to hear your opinions, fellow teachers! Have any of you gone back to teaching after leaving? Or transitioned from younger to older kids? What was it like?

I have bad health problems too, but like mini ones, so I am always getting infections, acne, hair falling out, bad teeth, bad vision, ugly fingernails, wrinkles, etc. So basically nothing about me is good, and honestly, I just want to die. Like, what is the point of living when there isn't a SINGLE good quality about me? I’m a germaphobic b\*tchy freak, and my mom genuinely hates me because of how big of a failure I am. I have failed every single math test since the beginning of this year and got straight Cs last year, which was my junior year, the most important year ever for colleges. Now I haven't been doing any work because, first of all, what the hell is the point? What's worse is that my sister is better than me in every aspect, and every time she comes home, my whole family is like, “\[her name\], yay! You’re home! I haven't seen you in so long” (this is maybe if they missed seeing her yesterday). And like, I get it because I miss her too even when she's gone, and no one misses me. I was gonna say ""no one SEEMS to miss me,"" but it's genuinely true how nobody misses me. My mom treats me like I'm 12, but I’m not—I’m 17 and have no responsibility. She doesn't teach me how to do anything, and I don’t know if it’s because she hates spending time with me or thinks I'm so incompetent (which I am). She would rather just do it herself or have someone else do it. So I’m incompetent, but I don’t know how to do anything. I genuinely don’t know how to do anything. She tells me to give up on education, and I’m Chinese, so honestly, education is THE MOST important thing to someone’s child, and being a good student is the best trait anyone could possibly have. I have no competitive drive, and I am not even beautiful, which is, unfortunately, one of the most important things a woman needs: beauty, to marry rich and become a housewife. But I’m neither. I don’t even have qualities to be a housewife. Like I said, I can’t do basic household things because my mom 1) won’t let me, 2) I don’t know how, 3) I was never taught. I am not smart and definitely won’t make any money in the future. It sucks because all my friends are talking about going to top colleges, and I’m happy for them because their futures are so bright. They worked so hard in high school, achieving 4.0+ GPAs despite having extremely horrible home situations and financial struggles, while my family is upper middle class and I have tutors, etc. I'm also constantly being invalidated because I am upper-middle class, am the youngest, etc. and I know I can't blame others and my situation for being incompetent because naturally this way, I should be in the best spot to become a successful, well-rounded individual. Why was I born this way? Why can't I just have the natural drive and competency to have a successful future?

I’ve been thinking about offing myself ever since I was 10, and it has shown because I genuinely don’t have the drive or anything to do anything. The only time I actually tried was freshman year, but after that, I got a C in my first-semester chemistry class. Since then, it just spiraled from being an A student to an F student. I don't do any work unless it's classwork they force us to do in class, and once I go home, I just doomscroll on TikTok to forget about everything. I know Reddit isn't a nice platform where the communities are supportive, so honestly, I’m not expecting a positive response. I'm so freaking lazy and unmotivated that I even used ChatGPT to make this post grammatically correct. What's the point of anything?? ask me anything ! ",User_deleted,1,negative,0
1gdqiio,2,2024-10-27,Career Advice Needed: Struggling to Find the Right Path ,u/Apprehensive_Share93,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1gdqiio/career_advice_needed_struggling_to_find_the_right/,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently a junior in college, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in New Media Arts. Lately, I’ve been sitting down and contemplating what career would be most suitable for me. I’ve been thinking about this for years, starting back in high school, but I had a hard time envisioning myself in any specific career path. None of the subjects I was exposed to in school really sparked my interest in terms of my future.

Since then, I’ve done A LOT of questioning and introspection to figure out what I actually enjoy. Choosing a career to commit to has been daunting, and even now, as a 21-year-old college student, I still find myself sorting through my likes, dislikes, and personality traits.

Here’s what I’ve narrowed down so far:

# What I Like:

* **Writing**: I enjoy writing anything—essays, stories, ideas—whatever comes to mind.
* **Arts**: I love the creative problem-solving aspect of art and thinking deeply about the meaning and purpose behind artwork.
* **Psychology**: I'm fascinated by how people think and how the human mind works. I’m interested in understanding mental disorders and how relationships affect us. However, I don’t want to be a therapist or psychologist because dealing with others’ emotions sounds draining.
* **History**: I find history fun, especially when I get to understand how the world was built and how people thought in the past.
* **Art History**: Since I love both art and history, it’s a natural fit.
* **Graphic Design**: I’ve always wanted to learn Adobe tools, and I’m fascinated by how people use visual design to communicate ideas.
* **Pattern Recognition**: I get excited and proud when I recognize patterns that help me solve problems or make predictions. This skill made me think I should pursue Computer Science since I notice patterns in numbers and coding, but I’m not passionate about it.
* **Aesthetic Sensitivity**: I have a good eye for what looks visually appealing, not just in art and design but in clothes, music, and patterns of any kind.
* **Music**: I’m deeply passionate about music—it feels like it affects my soul. I used to play piano but stopped for personal reasons.

# What I Don’t Like:

* **Physics**: I’m not a huge fan of physics or memorizing all the formulas. I’ve always doubted myself in this subject. Hence, why I crossed out being an engineer. 
* **Math**: I don’t hate it, but I’ve never been passionate about it.
* **Biology**: It’s never sparked any interest in me. 
* **Chemistry**: I was good at it in high school, but I wouldn’t want it as a career.
* **Finance**: I was originally a finance major and after taking microeconomics and macroeconomics, I wanted to shoot myself (not literally, but you get it).
* **Statistics**: Nope, not for me.
* **Law**: No interest in being a lawyer.
* **Medical Careers**: I don’t want to be a nurse or spend years getting an education in medicine.
* **Dentist**: Cleaning people’s mouths just doesn’t appeal to me.

# My Personality:

* **Empathic and Emotionally Intelligent**: People tell me I have a great personality and that I’m in tune with others' emotions.
* **Shy and Withdrawn**: I’m not much of a talker, and I worry this might make certain careers (like psychology or therapy) difficult for me.
* **Analytical and Detail-Oriented**: I like breaking concepts down and understanding everything on a fundamental level.
* **Imaginative and Fantasy-Prone**: This is where most of my creativity comes from and why I’m a good creative thinker.
* **Cooperative and Collaborative**: I prefer teamwork and collaboration over competition.
* **Deeply Self-Aware**: I’m always mindful of my thoughts, feelings, strengths, and weaknesses. I would love a career that encourages self-improvement.
* **Strong Moral Compass**: I’ll fight tooth and nail for the people and causes I care about.
* **Even-Tempered**: I’m pretty easy to get along with.
* **Intellectual**: I’m curious about the world and don’t want that side of me to die as I get older.
* **Cautious and Deliberate**: I like to think things through before committing to anything.
* **Achievement-Striving**: I love earning the things I want in life.
* **Self-Efficacy**: I have confidence in my ability to accomplish things, it’s just about prioritizing.
* **Modest and Humble**: I have a realistic self-image and never put myself on a pedestal.

# My Flaws:

* **Self-Doubt**: This is my biggest flaw. Logically, I know I’m smart, kind, and hardworking, but emotionally, I act like I don’t believe it.
* **Perfectionism**: I struggle with this.
* **Thinking without Acting**: I tend to overthink and let decisions slip by without taking action.
* **Fear of Commitment**: I fear being stuck in situations I can’t escape, whether that’s a bad relationship, a career I don’t like, or a toxic environment.
* **Sensitive to Criticism**: I take criticism to heart.
* **Procrastination**: Classic flaw.

# Things I Want in a Career:

* **Work/Life Balance**: I want to live to work, not work to live.
* **Decent Salary**: I don’t need six figures, just enough to pay the bills, live comfortably, and have some peace.
* **Remote Work**: This is a bonus, though not a necessity if the work/life balance is there.
* **Non-Toxic Work Environment**: This is non-negotiable. I’ve struggled with social anxiety and fear of bullying, so I won’t tolerate toxic environments. Good communication and collaboration are essential.

# So, Any Advice?

What career paths should I look into based on my interests and personality? Any guidance or thoughts would be really appreciated. Thanks!

1gdz3w9,2,2024-10-28,I am triggered too much when people copy in assignments or tests in college,u/an_underachiever_,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gdz3w9/i_am_triggered_too_much_when_people_copy_in/,"So I've been brought up as an honest guy and I pride myself on my honesty. But when I look around me and I can't help but do it, almost everyone in college cheats/copies in literally every assignment or test or project. It riles me up so much. In assignments, few assignments of students do the rounds in the student groups and everyone copies from it. Very rarely I do that. And some people are smart enough to take the best parts of different assignments doing the rounds. In tests, people hide phones in their dresses, even females, bring materials into the examination room, talk to neighbour's when no one is looking and what not. I know it's not possible to have eyes on everyone all the time but still even if caught no action is taken since the higher ups are all corrupt. There's no one to complain to. Projects are downloaded straight from the net and so on. Even in contests, people use chatgpt and Google and what not to get answers. Now, I can't sleep generally if I do such things and hence I live up to my values. But I can't help to wonder where the hell is everyone's ethics and honesty ? This is absolute nonsense. I'm getting so mad, I feel like I want to complain but I also don't want to ruin someone's life because it's not like I'm perfect in every way or haven't done anything wrong. Sure, I may have done less cheating than most kids if not all, but still I feel like this could backfire on me if my name is known. This happens every single day. The worst is when the teacher compares my work and their work and shows me how great there's is compared to mine. It's so damn awkward and frustrating",User_deleted,2,neutral,0

The more AI technology advances, the more students are using it in their every day lives. Most people are well aware of students using AI to write their essays and do their homework, but this isn’t the only use students are getting out of these AI tools.

Studying and reading is subject to AI integration just as much as academic writing. Generative AI is able to read the assignments either from an uploaded document or the web and create summaries, pinpointing relevant quotes and points so students can quickly get all the necessary proof that they did their assigned reading.

The use of AI in studying and reading has caused higher education institutions to rethink how they assign reading, signaling larger changes on the horizon for academia.

# How Are Students Using AI to Study?

For the longest time, college students have looked for ways to skirt this schoolwork, either by reading Cliff's Notes, web summaries, watching YouTube summaries, or simply skimming the material and crossing their fingers that they glossed over the material that’ll end up on the [quiz.Now](http://quiz.Now) though, with advanced artificial intelligence at their fingertips, students only need to ask these AI chatbots to read the material for them and generate a summary.

Many of the caveats of using generative AI tools to create essays aren’t present when summarizing pdf’s. For instance, misinformation that an AI-generated essay might have aren’t present when the AI is tasked with simply reading a piece of text. This was once one of main hallmarks of AI writing for plagiarism detection, however in this case this fatal flaw is lacking from AI-powered studying.

AI powered studying takes many forms. With students even asking AI to generate flash cards, so they can educate themselves the right way.

Still, professors are not convinced that academic integrity is not being tarnished with this less intrusive use of AI tools. If students use AI to read everything assigned to them, professors will have to change what, why, and how they ask students to read in the first place.

# How is Academia Rethinking Reading Assignments

Unlike high school students, some college students have anywhere from 100 pages to 300 pages a week for varying fields of study. Whether because they deem the reading unnecessary busywork, they just don’t have the bandwidth to juggle the load, or for their own mental health, there has been a larger decline of reading for Gen-Z and younger students than previous times in academia.

You can look to [studies from the 90’s and see a steady decline in reading](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2000-07173-017) begin only to dip further and further all the way up to [70% of students saying they don’t read the texts their professors give them in a 2021 study](https://theconversation.com/up-to-80-of-uni-students-dont-read-their-assigned-readings-here-are-6-helpful-tips-for-teachers-165952).

Where most professors take issue with the refusal to read and use of AI to take on reading assessments for students, is that such practices deprive young learners of the student learning experiences that are required to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

The solution as many professors have found, is conducting more in-class assignments, including in-class reading that teaches them how to read larger loads in a given period of time. Cognizant of declines in reading, some professors assign large reading loads for homework with intentions to quiz students on such hyper-specific material that no chatbot could possibly prepare the student for the quiz.

Other solutions may involve explicitly advocating for using AI as well as changing the way students read. One of the many factors as to why students aren’t reading is surely changing technologies and mediums from which student derive information. Some professors advocate for joining this trend and assigning material to watch or listen to, in the form of YouTube videos or podcasts, instead of traditional reading.

# Why Are Students Studying Less?

Technological advancement holds a large share of fault for the decline in reading by college students, however, there are numerous factors beyond these advents. The Coronavirus pandemic served a large role in changing the way Gen-Z students learn, from shifting school to fully-remote settings and making mental health play a larger role in academia, students were tasked to read less and became used to these behaviors.

With social media, podcasts, streaming services, and an infinite amount of media choices available to them, people have shorter attention-spans than ever, constituting a threat to reading at large, beyond school work. Even English students, who love to read and write, are using AI to complete and summarize the reading their assigned from less interesting classes.

Lastly, economics has a role to play in why students read less. More students are working simultaneously to doing college work and this limits the bandwidth for school work they’re able to take on.

This isn’t just students that need to work at the same time as they study to afford tuition and other bills, it’s student taking advantage of job opportunities that have been made available to younger candidates with remote capabilities that allow them to work anywhere and anytime. In our changing world, young people don’t see graduating as a pre-condition to starting their hustle, and studying often gets in the way.

# AI Solutions to AI Problems

Artificial intelligence is unique from previous Edtech advances that have changed the world. Any problem is subject to new solutions with unlimited capabilities to improve student learning experiences without having to sacrifice academic integrity.

AI tools will soon be able to customize curricula down to each professor’s student and address all of their personal needs, whether they have jobs, mental health concerns, or simply prefer other media to text to get their information. Once curricula are personalized towards students, learning experiences can be crafted that ensure students acquire the skills they need to truly educate themselves, that students don’t just consider boring busy work, and that professors approve of.

# TL;DR

More than half of students are using AI tools to study. Some reports suggest it’s up to 86% of students, meanwhile as previously cited in this article, 70% of students are refusing to read. Obviously, if we truly care about student learning experiences, AI is not the issue. Students are already being deprived of learning experiences simply because they don’t care.

AI should be considered an opportunity to reengage students in academia. AI’s impact on academia has yet to materialize, but we can already expect that it will be responsible for more positive results than cases of plagiarism. [OpenAI’s updated versions of ChatGPT](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/are-openai-s-o1-mini-and-o1-preview-truly-undetectable-an-in-depth-review) alone are capable of more computing power than ever, making it essential in scientific fields. When the humanities become subject to such advancements, they will make AI essential to educating yourself in a field.

# FAQ

# Is Using ChatGPT plagiarism?

[Using ChatGPT or any other generative AI software to do your homework is not traditional plagiarism](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/is-using-chatgpt-plagiarism-academic-dishonesty-in-dishonest-academia). It may be considered academic misconduct, but plagiarism is defined the theft of words or ideas without proper credit, which is not what AI does when generating text. Generative AI creates original content, so having it ghostwrite your essay is not plagiarism but the newer classification of “AI plagiarism”.

# How Many Students Use Generative AI?

A recent [Digital Education Council survey reported that 86% of students use AI](https://campustechnology.com/Articles/2024/08/28/Survey-86-of-Students-Already-Use-AI-in-Their-Studies.aspx) at varying capacities for their studies. Given that using AI for schoolwork is often prohibited, some students may have felt pressure confessing that they use AI as well. Meaning the actual percentage of students using AI may even be higher than 86%.

# What Are People Using Generative AI For?

Students use generative AI for homework but professionals also use these AI tools for all sorts of tasks from writing blogs, to SEO, to social media posts on platforms like LinkedIn and X. Using tools like Stealth Writer and SEO Writer give digital content writers huge advantages for making content personalized to any audience.

I've read many threads here about AI, cellphone policies, laptops, etc., but I am currently burnt out this semester, and I'm at a loss regarding what to do about my classes regarding AI and class conduct. (I apologize for the long post/rant!)

I am an adjunct teaching two courses at a good state school while completing my PhD. Both my courses are 60 students each, which is an interesting size—not quite a large lecture and small enough that you can have discussions, be mindful of class conduct, etc. I'm usually known as the ""approachable"" professor. I'm fairly young (mid-30s), very accommodating, and have flexible deadlines. (I'm also a woman, so sometimes, female professors get the ""nice"" label.) I teach gender studies and religion. They are lower-level courses that I try to keep easy and fun. 

My courses usually go well, but this semester has been a struggle. I grade attendance because my chair advised me to do so post-COVID. I have added a strict no-cellphone policy this semester because cellphone use was terrible the previous semester. I also have other course conduct policies on my syllabus. I implemented a ""syllabus quiz"" this semester, which tested them on these policies. I also have a strict no-AI policy. In one of my courses, their class conduct has been very distracting—cellphone use, exiting excessively during class, being distracted by their laptops, etc. While meeting with the dean of students last week about another issue, she told me it's good to reset expectations for the rest of the semester, which I sent to my students last Friday in an announcement (I reminded them about cellphones, told them there's been too many class disruptions and class exits, and reiterated that these policies are on the syllabus.)

In my other course, I have several quizzes throughout the semester. This last quiz, I noticed use of AI and so, I audited their first quiz and found A LOT of AI that I had missed. I'm talking bad AI--copied and pasted from Gemini or Chat GPT. These take-home quizzes should be easy because they're open book/note, so using AI for a 150-word short-answer question is appalling to me.

Today, I lectured both classes about AI use and gave both classes an in-class essay to write on the spot. I was pretty hard on them and warned them that I might ban laptops for the rest of the semester and change our assignments to in-class essays. This semester, it all just feels so demoralizing—I have a lot of good students, and I have others who have tried to bully me this semester, have terrible attitudes, and now the rampant AI use. I'm definitely going to get tanked in my evals, because one student just complained on my Rate My Professor: ""bothered about students leaving early, being on your phone, and is very strict about attendance. It's really annoying because it's not that deep.""  (This is all they care about 🙄) 

I'm a former writing teacher, so I used to do fewer lecture-style classes and more classes on close readings, discussions, in-class work, etc. I switched to lectures because lectures seemed better suited for these intro courses, but I fear that lecture-based courses just fuels this behavior...

I'm wondering if anyone has had success with 1) banning laptops and 2) going back to in-class essays / BlueBook exams? Do you think it would be excessive to ban laptops? Do you have any tips on redoing your assignments because of AI or in-class behavior?",User_deleted,0,neutral,0

I’m an undergrad in college. I did 3 semesters right after I graduated high school in 2016, but took a few years off to work and establish myself. I’ve now returned and things feel…different. Students don’t seem to engage in Class at all. Everyone has laptops and isn’t paying attention, browsing other sites. Nobody can stay focused. The lights are just completely off and when they get called on, it’s clear they weren’t tuned in at all. The professors are all either frustrated or demoralized by this. I’m also in several WhatsApp groups for my classes and every student is complaining about the professor, about grades and due dates, and asking how they can use ChatGPT to do their work for them. This is so astonishing to me because it’s different than the class environment I had in 2016/17. 

I’ve also noticed standards are just gone. Every exam, test, or essay must be supplemented by a curve or every student fails. It feels unfair when I spend weeks studying and consuming the material. 

I know I sound like an old man hating on younger generations already. I’m okay with that. I’m more so confused by what appears to be such a rapid shift. Are you teachers watching this happen in real time? Have you noticed this too? ",active,8,negative,0

I’m a diploma (a 3-year course taken after matriculation) student and now has a final semester project to complete. In our course, we mostly learn the basics and fundamentals, so I’m struggling to make this project on my own. For the past three months, I’ve been trying to put it together by researching resources on the internet and using ChatGPT, but I haven’t been successful. Now, with only a month left before the presentation and submission, I’m feeling really stressed and desperate for help. Please see the project details below. 👇

I have an ESP32-CAM mounted on a 2-axis servo arm that can pan and tilt. I want to stream the live feed to a browser or app, allowing the user to click a point on the screen, causing the camera to pan and tilt so that the selected point becomes the center of the view.

Additionally, I plan to attach a water hose connected to a water pump, operated by a servo linked to the ESP32. The goal is for the pump to spray water on plants that I tap on the screen (as seen through the camera). After identifying and tapping on each plant, I want to store these coordinates as plant1, plant2, etc., so I can water them later. Each plant would receive a specified amount of water, based on a set time period for the pump (which operates at 1L/min) with the device converting the water volume (in liters) to seconds.

I want to build a web interface that:

•Displays the live camera feed with joystick controls for panning and tilting.

•Shows the coordinates of each marked plant.

•Prompts the user to specify the amount of water (in liters) for each plant, which the device will convert into seconds.

Please provide the code and procedure for setting up the ESP32 and the website.

Of all the AI Detectors StealthGPT has bested throughout its storied history of wins, Originality is a standout among them. Known as the 2nd most deadly detector in the game, only after Turnitin, we don’t take the task of bypassing Originality as lightly as we may take, oh I don’t know, [DetectGPT](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/how-to-bypass-detectgpt-s-ai-detector).

Still, we’ve beaten them before and we shall beat them again. Simply put, [StealthGPT has Originality’s number](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/originality-ai-s-content-detector-case-study-stealthgpt-is-confidently-seen-as-human). Every time they update, we’re always one step ahead. To show you precisely how we defeat Originality AI, I’m going to run some beautiful AI-generated content from ChatGPT through their AI Detection tool, then I’m gonna run StealthGPT’s undetectable AI content and we’re gonna compare the results.

Users of StealthGPT know Originality will lose. Users of Originality need to learn their lesson the hard way.

# What is an AI Detector?

Before we execute, lets educate! For those of you new to the undetectable AI space, our software was created to make content that no AI Detector could possibly flag so you can create content safely and without punishment.

When ChatGPT was creating content in a vacuum, without AI detectors to rain on an AI writer’s parade, there was no way of comprehensively concluding that any piece of text was AI-written text. These days, that’s still not completely the case, you can’t ever be 100% sure that any writing is AI but when it comes to ChatGPT, most AI Detectors have no trouble analyzing ChatGPT’s output and declaring that it comes from an AI writing tool.

So, how does AI content detection work exactly? By knowing the watermarks of a large language model’s writing style, you can pinpoint the presence of AI writing on the sentence level. Artificial intelligence is programmed to write for utility and precision, meaning it uses simple, precise word choice, sentence structure, and sentence length. AI checkers simply measure for the perplexity and burstiness of a piece of text and from those metrics determine its source.

# What is Undetectable AI?

To bypass AI Detection so you can actually use AI-written content in academics or professionally, undetectable AI tools were developed to make AI text to feel like human writing and beat AI detection systems.

Among the many undetectable AI services, no software is stronger than StealthGPT.AI at generating high-quality humanized text with its Stealthwriter tool and its AI humanizer tool. StealthGPT has proven it can bypass Turnitin, bypass Originality.AI, bypass GPTZero, Content at Scale and more frequently and comprehensively than the competition.

Just as AI-generated text from ChatGPT has certain watermarks that can be picked up by AI content detectors, the way StealthGPT humanizes its text is simply by flipping those watermarks on their head. It makes text human-feeling by making it more complex and random in its word choice and sentence structure and in doing so, the text can bypass AI Detectors and beat Turnitin or [Originality.AI](http://Originality.AI), all while increasing the text’s readability and quality.

Furthermore, undetectable AI services like StealthGPT offer much more capability than beating popular AI detectors. StealthGPT works for all sorts of purposes, from inserting essay citations to ensure your work isn’t flagged by plagiarism checkers, to chatting with pdfs, SEO writing, and more.

# Testing Originality AI Against ChatGPT

Now that you know the players, lets begin our game. OpenAI just released two new models of ChatGPT, so I’m going to run the new o1-preview against [Originality.AI](http://Originality.AI) to see who prevails. Here is our essay from ChatGPT about ninjas and samurais:

Now, lets paste this into Originality's content scanner and see what it finds:

As I suspected, Originality.AI was able to detect the text was 100% AI generated. ChatGPT should never be used to generate essays you intend to directly hand in because whether it’s against Originality.AI, Turnitin AI, or any detector, chances are you’ll get [caught and punished severely for academic misconduct](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/professor-catches-students-plagiarizing-with-ai).

# Testing Originality AI Against StealthGPT

I want to show you the power of each of StealthGPT’s tools, it’s AI humanizer and it’s Stealthwriter. First, the humanizer. Simply paste ChatGPT’s output into the bypass tool and in moments you’ll get humanized text as you can see below:

Now let’s input that text into Originality AI’s content detector and see if we can ninja past their radar.

With a 98% human score, Originality AI determined StealthGPT’s AI humanizer’s content was likely original content.

With the AI humanizer proven to be as sharp as ever, lets rev up the Stealthwriter to give us a ninja/samurai essay from scratch and compare the results.

First, here's our essay:

Now, lets input that Stealthwriter essay into Originality:

With an even better score, Stealthwriter has slashed through Originality’s defenses to bypass their detection system with a 100% originality score. Meaning it was found to be likely human and likely original.

If you want to pursue AI content creation without fear of consequences, only StealthGPT can guarantee your safety.

# Conclusion

No AI Detector is safe from StealthGPT. Stealth AI is simply too powerful for the likes of Turnitin, Originality, Copyleaks, GPTZero, Content at Scale, Quillbot, Winston AI, or any Detector you can name.

For content creation, no other undetectable AI software has more functionality and can generate higher quality, human-like content. We understand human writing, its style, flow, rhythm and randomness better than other AI chatbots. With dynamic writing style in StealthGPT’s machine learning, our AI becomes a better English scholar with every undetectable essay it generates.

Our free trial allows for unlimited words so once you take it for a spin and see how StealthGPT elevates your content creation and academic writing, you’ll want to make it a constant fixture in your process.

# FAQ

# Does StealthGPT bypass Turnitin?

Absolutely. As important as it is to be functional against Originality AI, if StealthGPT couldn’t bypass Turnitin AI, then it wouldn’t truly be undetectable.

[StealthGPT has always beaten Turnitin](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/bypassing-ai-detectors-stealthgpt), no matter how often they update, they simply can’t compete against us. And since Turnitin is integrated into [Canvas](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/what-is-canvas), the most popular online student submission portal, if you plan on using AI writing for academic work, you’ll need StealthGPT to be able to bypass anything.

# Is Using AI For School Plagiarism?

Using AI to ghostwrite your essay is considered “AI plagiarism” and academic misconduct. It is not however, traditional plagiarism. Traditional plagiarism is the stealing of words or ideas without proper credit. When you use AI to generate your essay, you’re creating original content, not stealing someone else’s.

Many schools are changing their policies and implementing [more progressive codes of AI ethics](https://teaching.cornell.edu/generative-artificial-intelligence/ethical-ai-teaching-and-learning) in accordance with the changes in how people use the technology. It is safe to assume that the use of AI for school work will have a changing stance as the technology reshapes academia as we know it.

# Do AI Detectors Work?

You’ve seen for yourself how poorly Originality AI fared against StealthGPT. Given most students have wised up to undetectable AI when it comes to submitting work, can it really be said these detectors even work? The answer is no.

Even [MIT declared AI Detectors don’t work](https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/teach/ai-detectors-dont-work/) given that Turnitin has a 4% false positive rate at the sentence level and that many detectors show bias against non-native English speaking students. They’re a flawed technology implemented by an institution that has run out of options. Academia can either change or die, and it’ll do everything it can to avoid changing.",active,1,neutral,0

1gfqrb4,1,2024-10-30,"""ChatGPT's Impact on Virtual Learning and Corporate Training: Effectiveness Explored""",u/cporter202,ChatGPTautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTautomation/comments/1gfqrb4/chatgpts_impact_on_virtual_learning_and_corporate/,"As the landscape of education and professional development continues to evolve, one of the most intriguing developments has been the integration of AI-driven platforms like ChatGPT into virtual learning and corporate training modules. The key question that this raises is: How effective is ChatGPT in enhancing the learning experience and outcomes for students and employees?

ChatGPT, created by OpenAI, is a sophisticated language processing AI that can understand and generate human-like text. Its capabilities allow it to engage with users in a conversational manner, which could revolutionize the way we approach education and training. From personalized learning paths to interactive Q&A sessions, ChatGPT seems poised to offer a range of benefits.

In the realm of virtual learning, ChatGPT can provide instant feedback, answer questions at any hour, and even help students struggling with complex concepts by breaking them down into simpler terms. The idea is that this could lead to a more inclusive and customized learning environment that caters to individual needs.

Corporate training, on the other hand, can be significantly streamlined with ChatGPT's assistance. It can simulate various business scenarios, facilitate skill development, and serve as an on-demand mentor for employees. This accessibility and responsiveness could potentially increase employee engagement with training materials, leading to better retention of information and improved performance on the job.

However, some skeptics question whether a machine can ever truly replace the nuanced guidance of human instructors or the collaborative learning that happens between peers. There's also the concern about integrating this technology responsibly and ethically within existing educational frameworks.

So, where do we stand with ChatGPT as a tool for learning and development? Have you had any experiences with it in your virtual classrooms or corporate training sessions? Let's discuss the practical implications, the benefits we've seen, and the hurdles that we need to overcome for ChatGPT to effectively enhance our educational and professional landscapes.",active,1,positive,0

I'm posting here because I want you to know BEFORE you join college. Not after.

I'm currently a 3rd year student at IIIT Delhi. My college was supposed to have ~fancy~ placements. I have DTU / NSUT / IIT Delhi friends near me. Let me tell you, placements are a shit show everywhere.

My friend sitting in CS @ DTU tells me that he's expecting 7-10 LPA despite being very smart (my personal opinion) and having done over 700 LC questions.

It's October. Placements started in August. 3 months gone, only ~100 students have been placed in my college. Other than that, around 70 pre-placement offers. So 170 offers in total. Total batch size? 600+. Also, only around ~100 people got internship this year. Out of 600.

Last year, only around ~400 people got placed by the end of placement season. Around 150 people remained unplaced. Any other statistic that you see from my college has been heavily manipulated.

Do you know what's worst? The fact that I'm spending all my time learning to build things that somebody with ChatGPT can build with half the knowledge as me. And most of these are ignorant people - not even trying to learn, just prompt engineering throwing everything at GPT.

Everyone is using GPT for assignments. People are cheating in company tests, interviews, competitive programming contests, LeetCode contests, everywhere. It's a shit show. Why am I even learning so hard to code? It feels purposeless.

VoiceDocs allows you to upload any document and start ""talking"" to it instantly. Ask questions, get insights, get summaries, learn new concepts, jump back and forth with easy. It's my dream tool.

I am a pharmacy student who recently just started my first semester of pharmacy school recently. Who knew that during the first week of classes, my biochem professor would quit? So instead of my school finding a capable professor to teach, they decided to just call a random professor to teach biochem. Not only was it a random professor, but it also had to be my orgo professor. I hated that professor I dropped that class as soon as I could. He doesn't know what he's doing, whenever someone asks him what's going to be on the exam he just laughs and says ""everything that's taught in class"". When we ask him for an outline he also just laughs. He's like I'm not giving you guys shit. Throughout the semester we would ask him what chapters are on the quiz but the thing is he doesn't even know what chapter he's teaching. He would just say I don't know. Like what do you mean you don't know, you are the one that's writing the quiz so you must know what chapters, but no he just laughs. Like, give us a fucking answer. A few days ago we had our midterm and I got my grade back and I failed. Like how did I fail? He said that as long as you read your notes and look at his sample questions you should be fine. Come exam day, the exam looks like it's from ChatGPT. He basically just asked ChatGPT ""Give me questions that are as confusing and difficult as possible and don't bother with making it about bicohem, what about making it about orgo instead?"" None of the sample questions were on the exam and there were topics that we never even learned before. He also said that he recycles his quiz questions, but no he doesn't. The exam looked like it was for the wrong class. Only 20% of the people in my class passed and there are 152 students in my class. He came to class today and wrote on the board and it said that he ""curved"". By curved he just took out 2 questions. The exam is out of 50 btw. That curve didn't do shit, like wow I went from an F to an F. As a class, we tried to ask him about extra credit but he would just laugh it off and I'm just like what's so funny? This is a professional program, if I fail one class I'm basically on my way out of pharmacy school. It's like you'll still have a job, but I won't have a future because of you and all you do is laugh. No sympathy from this guy whatsoever.  We all as a class have already started talking to the Dean and she said she'll figure something out for us, but what the fuck is my professor's problem. Stop laughing every time we ask a serious question and do your job as a professor and teach us things that will actually be on the exam. We don't want you to constantly avoid our questions. We need to know what's going to be on our exams and not have every answer be ""I don't know"" because you should know it's your fucking exam that we are being tested on. Also is it that hard to make slides? Your messy ass handwriting combined with your accent also isn't doing it for this class. Also, I tried YouTube and reading textbooks, but they just don't align with what he teaches in class. I honestly won't even be surprised if he's been teaching us orgo all this time.

I’m not really sure who talk to about this, so I thought why not come to Reddit lol.

That is due to the fact that I’m rapidly losing interest and overall passion in CS. When I first started my cs major I was actually having a good time. I had a great calc 2 professor and learned so much from him, it was genuinely really fun going to school everyday and learning things from him. I also had a good intro to programming professor which made coding fun for me (it was the basics though). Now fast forward to now, I’m taking upper division classes and my entire world feels like it got turned 180. Never used chatGPT before but now I feel like I always have to use it or Google things to look stuff up and copy/paste the code because the coding assignments are too complex for me to figure out. I feel so guilty and unworthy knowing that I have to do this to pass a class. It’s so demoralizing. They don’t really teach coding anymore, a lot of my professors have the “go figure it out yourself” mentality, which is fine since I know many other universities do this aswell but I just don’t think I learn well off that. 

I’m always a person who loves a same old routine. So being a CS major and always having to think outside the box or figuring out different ways to solve complex problems, I just don’t think it’s for me anymore.  But what do I do? I’m too deep in to fully switch out this major + telling foreign parents that I gave up software engineering isn’t really the best idea. Plus scrolling through tiktok and Reddit, all I see are these amazing projects people have done while I’m here being a below average cs student. It’s also just been affecting my overall mental health feeling this lost in life. I can probably type all night about this but my phone is dying so I’ll end it here. Any advice or just overall thoughts would be nice. Please don’t roast me too much my mental is already down lol.",User_deleted,2,negative,0
