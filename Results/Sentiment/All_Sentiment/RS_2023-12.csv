18857qc,13,2023-12-01,My own honors in stats experience,u/threesaltedeggs,universityofauckland,https://www.reddit.com/r/universityofauckland/comments/18857qc/my_own_honors_in_stats_experience/,"Hello! The holidays have been a bit dull, so I've decided to jot down my experiences of pursuing honours in statistics. This might help anyone struggling to decide whether to go for it. ChatGPT has paraphrased this post to preserve anonymity and prevent recognition; hopefully it works well. PLEASE DON'T TELL ME YOU SEE THIS POST IF YOU KNOW ME!!!!)

I come from a background in mathematics and statistics at the bachelor's level. Still, my coding experience is almost nonexistent—the only undergraduate stats coding course I took was maths 162 and stats 20x (which I have forgotten everything).

My honours project revolved around some theoretical learning. It required no coding but leaned heavily on knowledge from mathematical analysis, drawing mainly from maths 254, 332, and 333.

In the first semester, I enrolled in stats 779, 782, and 720. As I've mentioned, my R programming skills were virtually non-existent, which made stats 782 and 779 quite challenging.

In stats 779, we had weekly homework consisting of coding tasks and multiple-choice problems. My unfamiliarity with R made the workload seem heavy, but I'm confident those well-versed in R would find it manageable. 

Stats 720 covered queuing theory. It was a small class where the lecturer sweetened each session with chocolate. The first half was straightforward, essentially a review of stats 320 and 325. The second half, which delved into renewal equations and such, was more demanding but manageable. Assignments usually comprised 3-4 questions, each with multiple subparts. While the questions were quite 'classic' and solvable if you were familiar with the material, some required considerable thought.

Stats 782 felt like a foundation of time series; it contains a group project. My experience was less than ideal; two group members were absent until the last few hours before the deadline. However, the lecturer patiently clarified our questions in great detail. The course involved extensive coding, which I found challenging. It's a data analysis course with plenty of practical examples. If you're aiming for a data analysis role or project in the future, take stats 782.

This semester, I was assigned some reading materials for my project, which were more mathematical—like measure theory—than statistical. I completed this reading in the first six weeks. During the study break, I began drafting my dissertation summarising my reading material. By around week 9, I had a draft of the initial chapters but paused to prepare for exams.

Over the holiday, I focused on the main paper my report was based on. My supervisor was incredibly patient and met with me weekly—a blessing indeed. Family commitments limited my work time to roughly two hours a day. By the start of the second semester, I had completed the preliminary chapters.

The second semester felt more enjoyable. I took stats 726, 766, and 782.

Stats 726, another course on time series, was more theoretical and very much to my liking. It covered multivariate techniques and models, emphasising theorems and proofs. Without tutorials, the approachable lecturer was an excellent resource for any uncertainties. I found this course very inspiring. The lecturer aimed to balance theory with application, considering some students might lack a stats/maths background. With a foundation in stats 310, this course wasn't challenging and proved to be enjoyable (at least for me).

Stats 766 was a small class on multivariate analysis, exploring distributions, multivariate techniques, and copulas. It felt like a natural follow-up to 310 but less intense. The course included some coding, but mainly in assignments and tutorials, requiring only pseudocode. Some assignments were challenging and time-consuming, but the lecturer was always willing to answer questions and give extensions.

Stats 782 was purely about coding. If you're proficient in R, it would likely be straightforward. (However, the class environment, regarding inclusion and diversity, was not my liking. ) Before the exams, many students appealed to Piazza to cancel the double pass requirements, presenting some solid arguments. Eventually, final grades were scaled, and the double pass was based on a weighted combination of midterm and final grades.

In the second semester, I invested significant effort into my dissertation. Despite enjoying my project, writing it was stressful. I studied around 7 hours daily during the study break and up to 13 hours as the submission deadline approached. I completed about three-quarters of my report during this semester. My supervisor's prompt feedback on my extensive dissertation was invaluable. It's always crucial to have a supportive advisor.",User_deleted,21,neutral,0
1887t72,1,2023-12-01,chatGPT in math - diploma thesis,u/NecroTMa,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1887t72/chatgpt_in_math_diploma_thesis/,"Hello sub,

I am university student in my last year of masters, to be a lower secondary teacher of math. 
I am trying to write diploma thesis on the topic ""Use of conversational AI in lower secondary education"" (6-9th grade)
I am basically trying to find out in what ways can chatGPT be used effectively.

I came here for inspiration, help, experience etc.

My question is: Do you have some experience in using chatGPT in school? And I mean in any way possible - in class, in your preparation, as a demonstration, letting students use it, anything?

My focus is on mathematics, but I'd appreciate any input.

Thank you all. :)

Ps: I know it's probably another AI post, but I am trupy trying to find some effective and useful use for it.",active,1,neutral,0

I'm a game developer student and a total nerd. I'm super into making games and I'm using my school projects to build up my own game and portfolio. My husband, who used to just play games, got inspired by me and now wants to be a game developer and do 3D printing too. It's kinda cool, but that's not really what I'm here to talk about.

You see, before I went back to school, I had a job that paid well, like $30 an hour, but I really didn't like it. My husband was the one who pushed me to go back to school. He promised to support me until I graduated, giving me two years to start making money again. I was scared to depend on him, worried that he'd hold it against me if I wasn't working. But he assured me it would be fine.

So, three years later, I got brave enough to go back to school. It was the best decision I've ever made! But, after my savings (which lasted about three months) ran out, my husband started nudging me to make money again. He'd bring up the fact that I'm not earning whenever he was upest or if I broke something by accident and would randomly joke about it. It really hurts when he does that.

In school, I'm all about game development. I'm working on game assets, levels, and even drafting a trailer that I'll animate soon. Plus, I'm networking (in person, and online) and getting my portfolio ready. When I show my husband my work, he's either not interested or just says ""nice"" and that's it. Sometimes, he doesn't say anything.

 When he saw me messing around with AI and making a mini diary ebook for fun, he got ideas to make money from it. He's like, ""I need you to use ChatGPT to create an ebook to sell,"" or ""Come up with a business idea,"" or ""Make me a game trailer and music,"" or ""3D print stuff for me."" But he's not clear about what he wants and doesn't help much. I will try to give list of names ideas for a business,  he wouldn't respond or don't like them, I will try to give tips for him to brainstorm like ""what are your favorite words?"" ""What is your passion?"" ect. He will always say I don't know and it's like hitting a brick wall. But he will see a glimpse of me making music for my game then ask me to make music for his trailer and the style he wants i can't do he assume i can because he only sees the software. (He never heard any of my music I would send him my music through chat for him to listen and he will say he can't because his phone can't play mp3. He has a Samsung galaxy,  or i will actually play it on my phone for him to hear and i swear to god he zone out on tiktok or reddit ignoring it, no comment.) 

At first, I tried to do some stuff for him, like 3D printing and designing logos. But then he gets upset when I haven't finished his projects. I'm super busy with my schoolwork. I'm taking 4-6 classes to keep my financial aid, so I've got a lot on my plate. When I tell him I'm doing alot (probably not but it feels like it to me.) He said he was going to school full time and working full time. I mean that's cool and I know what I got isn't alot but to me I can get pretty overwhelmed with my classes. 

When I asked him to learn some of the stuff he's interested in and offer him the courses I bought to teach me even more how to start game development and 3d modeling, he said he's too busy and wants me to do it, but he just play games all day. I never complain because I love games. He even brings up the ebook project that I started but stopped. I've asked him why he can't do it himself since I have homework, but he thinks my school stuff isn't as important. I lowkey just want to work on my projects and now I'm actively looking for a job because I don't like feeling like a burden but he's telling me I don't have to do that which is confusing the hell out of me. Don't get me wrong I would love to work together but his new goals being push on me feels one sided.

I'm just here to rant, 'cause I don't really have anyone else to talk to about this stuff. Thanks for reading.

Whether you're a student navigating the complexities of academic integrity or a professional exploring the bounds of AI in content generation, understanding what undetectable AI websites are and why they exist is crucial. This exploration not only uncovers the technological advancements behind these platforms but also delves into the ethical and practical implications of using AI in writing. Join us as we unravel the mysteries of undetectable AI, shedding light on its purpose, functionality, and the impact it has on the landscape of digital content creation. 

# Consequences of Getting Caught Using ChatGPT by AI Detectors

The use of AI tools like ChatGPT for tasks such as essay writing or content creation can lead to significant consequences if detected, especially in academic and professional settings. Detection can lead to: 

# 1. Academic Repercussions

Plagiarism Concerns: Using AI tools like ChatGPT to create academic work can be considered a form of plagiarism if the content is not original or if the use of such tools is not permitted by the educational institution. Many schools and universities have strict policies against plagiarism, which includes presenting AI-generated content as one's own work.

**Breach of Honesty Codes**: Academic institutions often have honor codes or integrity policies that mandate honesty in academic work. Utilizing AI-generated content without proper acknowledgment can be seen as a breach of these codes.

**Immediate Academic Consequences**: Students caught using AI tools like ChatGPT for assignments might face immediate penalties, such as failing grades on the assignment or course, or nullification of the work.

**Institutional Disciplinary Measures**: More severe disciplinary actions can include academic probation, suspension, or even expulsion, depending on the severity of the violation and the institution's policies.

**Record of Academic Dishonesty**: A record of academic dishonesty can have long-term implications for a student’s academic journey, including impacting their reputation, relationships with faculty, and eligibility for honors or scholarships.

**Effect on Future Opportunities**: Such a record can also affect future academic and professional opportunities, as some institutions and employers require disclosure of academic disciplinary actions.

**Undermining Educational Objectives**: Relying on AI for academic work can hinder a student’s learning process, as it bypasses the opportunity to develop critical thinking, research, and writing skills.

**Dependency on AI Assistance**: Over-reliance on AI tools for academic tasks can lead to a dependency that might disadvantage students in situations where independent work is required.

**Erosion of Ethical Standards**: Using AI in this manner can contribute to an erosion of ethical standards in academic environments, promoting a culture where the ease of technology takes precedence over the hard work and integrity of learning.

**Impact on Peer Dynamics**: It can also affect peer dynamics, creating an uneven playing field for students who adhere to academic integrity. 

# 2. Damage to Professional Reputation

**Perceived Dishonesty**: If professionals are caught using AI tools like ChatGPT for work-related content without proper disclosure, it can be perceived as dishonesty or a lack of integrity. This perception can severely damage their credibility in their professional field.

**Erosion of Trust**: Trust is a cornerstone in professional relationships. The revelation of using AI-generated content as one’s own can lead to a loss of trust from colleagues, supervisors, and clients.

**Negative Performance Reviews**: Getting caught could result in negative appraisals or performance reviews, impacting the individual’s career progression, including promotions or raises.

**Professional Sanctions**: Depending on the industry and the role of AI in content creation, there might be professional sanctions or disciplinary actions, which can have long-term career implications.

**Termination of Employment**: In some cases, using AI tools inappropriately can be grounds for termination, especially if it breaches company policy or contractual agreements related to content authenticity and creation.

**Damage to Personal Brand**: Professionals often work hard to build a personal brand based on skills, knowledge, and trust. Getting caught using AI tools unethically can tarnish this carefully built image, affecting future job opportunities and professional relationships.

**Online and Social Media Repercussions**: In today’s digital age, such incidents can quickly become public, leading to reputational damage on social media and professional networks.

**Violation of Ethical Standards**: Many professions have ethical standards regarding honesty and authenticity in work. Using AI in a manner that breaches these standards can raise serious ethical concerns.

**Setting a Negative Precedent**: Unethical use of AI tools can contribute to setting a negative precedent in the industry, potentially encouraging others to follow suit and undermining the overall ethical standards of the profession. 

# 3. Ethical Implications

**Misrepresentation of Capabilities**: Using AI-generated content, like that from ChatGPT, without proper attribution can be seen as a misrepresentation of one’s own capabilities. It raises ethical questions about authenticity and honesty in both academic and professional work.

**Authenticity in Work**: There's an expectation, especially in professional fields, that the work produced is a genuine representation of one's skills and knowledge. Circumventing this expectation with AI assistance, without disclosure, breaches ethical norms.

**Undermining Educational Values**: In academic contexts, the use of AI tools to complete assignments intended for learning and skill development can undermine the very purpose of education. It raises concerns about the commitment to the learning process and academic honesty.

**Fairness in Assessment**: Ethically, academic work should be an accurate reflection of a student’s understanding and abilities. Using AI tools covertly disrupts the fairness and accuracy of academic assessments.

**Breach of Professional Ethics**: Many professions have codified ethics and standards that emphasize the importance of integrity and honesty. Using AI-generated content without disclosure can constitute a breach of these professional ethics.

**Long-term Impact on Professional Fields**: Relying on AI for tasks that require expert knowledge and judgment without transparency can have long-term implications on the trustworthiness and reliability of the professional field.

**Need for Transparency**: Ethical use of AI tools like ChatGPT involves being transparent about their usage. Concealing their use in work that is assumed to be human-generated raises issues of accountability and openness.

**Responsibility of AI Usage**: There's an ethical responsibility that comes with using advanced technologies like AI. Users must consider the implications and potential repercussions of their use on others and the broader context.

**Erosion of Trust**: Covert use of AI tools can contribute to a broader erosion of trust in academic and professional communications.

**Setting a Precedent for Future Use**: The way AI tools are used today sets a precedent for future norms and practices, making it crucial to consider the long-term societal implications of how these technologies are integrated into work and education.

188pe33,1,2023-12-01,I feel like ChatGPT is making me dumber and more incompetent,u/El_Shark7,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/188pe33/i_feel_like_chatgpt_is_making_me_dumber_and_more/,"I'm a student in my second year in a business school ( specific program aiming at a master ), and I've been using chat gpt more and more. 

\- At first, it was out of desperation during a fiancial math test. Heard a lot of people were cheating with chat gpt, I was struggling with the concept of this specific test and time was running so I rolled with it. It only gave me one question right and it was pretty obvious to me that the other answer the AI gave me were wrong, so I basically only used it twice. I didn't really believe Chat GPT was useful.

\- I didn't use it for a while until this year. I have an English class since I'm not in a English speaking country, and I was struggling to find inspiration for the text of a presentation and since time was running, I used ChatGPT. I made some small change but I basically just ran with the text which worked very well for me.

\- This year, I also started financial analysis as subject. The subject was hard for me since it relied on accounting knowledge which I'm not very good at, the professor explaination didn't work for me at all and I was struggling to keep focus in his class. So, after the sucessful use of ChatGPT for English, I tried it because I had no idea on how to solve the exercises given and at this point anything was good. I didn't just ask it to solve my exercise, I rather asked it for step by step explanation on how to solve it without giving the result in number... It worked so well, not only did I did well with the exercise, but I was finally starting to understand how financial analysis worked!

\- Similarly, I had an incoming exam on tax law. While I had more understanding, I was also struggling in some way with the subject so to study for the exam I pretty much did the same thing as finance: take exercise and ask step by step explanation how to solve it without result. I did an exercise without the AI after to see if I had learned and I managed to do everything without trouble... Went to the exam ( on paper no AI ) and I did really well.

\- It started an habit where for each exercise/exam preparation in those two subject, I automatically went to ChatGPT. I was using it quite often.

\- It started to creep on other subject too: Exercise out of my level in German? ChatGPT. Need to find more information on a very specific topic for Sociology class? ChatGPT. Not sure I'm understanding well what is asked in my Marketing project? ChatGPT. It even came to my life outside of scool with dumb things like asking where to find a specific printing option, or if there was a specific twitter hashtag on a specific topic.

That leave with me now. I have a very important presentation in Sociology. I love this class, I love the subject of the presentation, I love the people and event I'm going to talk about. Really, I'm doing this presentation more for myself and my desire to learn on this topic than for a grade. But, I found myself using ChatGPT. Unlike in finance or tax law, I think I pass the line where I get the topic considerably deeper than surface level AI: for this presentation, I even made a quite specific plan that I'm very proud of, I genuily think it's really good. But when it came to write it... I need to summerize some historical events and struggled with how to do it, I was also really scared to forgot some important point or badly explain them so I asked ChatGPT out of insecurity ( still doing throughout research on each event to complete and change things, but still ). Despite being even more risky with AI than history, I had the same fear with some concept and author in sociology and phylosophy so I did the same. If I keep that my text will be technically 80% ChatGPT before all the modification I plan to do ( reogarnisation, adding transition, adding further details, removing part that are useless or will come later, modifying sentence so that they're easier for me to say naturally during the presentation, etc ).

And I'm so scared because of that. If I continue using ChatGPT when I struggle with wording and summarizing, won't I just become worst at it? Am I even incapable to focus and work enough on subject I love? Won't I risk to become dependent of AI? Am I already becoming dependent? Are my academics sucess with its help just lie?

I always though ChatGPT as a great tool, but I feel it's becoming a crutch that just make me worst. It's hard for me to event try to stop using it, because I'm someone with bad organisation and a lot of trouble focusing who survive on the motto fake it until you make it (I basically went throught highschool with pretty good gardes because I understood concept quickly and was more invested than most in the various subject, which don't really work anymore once you go through the years in college ). I just want to succeed, I can't afford to fail my semester but on the other hand I really want to seriously understand what I'm learning.",User_deleted,0,neutral,0

Failed both midterms and need an 85 to get a B.,u/coding10198,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/188uogk/genuinely_in_one_of_the_worst_possible_situations/,"I go to a t5 cs university in the U.S. I'm taking an intro python class. Throughout the year I have continuously did things that are counter intuitive to my learning and now I am in a situation where I need an 86 on the final in order to get a B in the class. A C would be legitimately the worst possible because I would be inches away from losing my scholarship. An 86 doesn't seem terrible considering it's an intro python class but here's the problem the exam is this coming Friday and legitimately I only have a bare bones understanding of python and when I say bare i mean bare. We've had 10 homework assignments with 5 coding problems on it and the last one I did on my own without chat gpt was homework 2. It all started with an extreme amount of procrastination. I said that oh I'm just using chatgpt once I'll catch up but I never did and ever week I messed around and didn't focus and so now here I am. If you asked me to solve any homework after HW2 I would fail to do so and I've failed both midterms meaning if I don't get an 86 I get a c. 

&#x200B;

I've told myself over and over that I would change but I have a problem where I just let myself escape by doing anything but work so when i look back at the weeks that have gone by I realize just how much time I've wasted and I feel like a complete fool. Even now here I am still procrastinating and so now I have to ask where can I go from this. Procrastination is a habit that has been engrained in me since high school I've always been smart enough to screw around and still get high A's which is how I got into this school but I've been completely unable to do that here and so whenever I got a little anxious I would avoid everything and bam another day has gone by and no work is done. 

I keep rambling but this is probably one of the worst cases of procrastination in my life. It feels like the walls are collapsing and because of how insurmountable everything is I feel like I want to learn but because of the vastness of content I just don't know how I'd go about this and so I continue to escape. If I continue on my foolishness I'll end with 3 A's in easy classes and a C in Cs my major and a B or a C in calc which the same situation is occurring only difference is I have one extra week to study. I've been a complete disappointment to myself, my parents, and my goals and all I want is a restart but even then I feel like it's a self fulfilling prophecy I've always said to myself I'll make a change on procrastination but each time I got away with but I always felt like if i look back at my life (18 yrs) I could've done more with everything yeah i got into a t5 but I could've been even better. 

I feel like if I don't figure something out I'll fuck around until friday and fail the exam and fail the class so now I am at my wit's end and I'm essentially begging anyway to tell me is it possible to learn enough to get an 85 on an intro python course in one week or six days. All I know right now is just some stuff from lecture like I went to lectures but I never learned to actually implement anything so all I've got is random words floating through my head and half thought out concepts. Is there anyway i can do this in a week i've got the time if I essentially didn't stop studying for each day. Can anyway tell me what to do with my problem and where to go from here and how I should go about studying what resources I could use and whether it is possible. I've regretted what I've done everyday and each day I feel the weight of existence pushing down on me and I hate my life right now. I've never been under this much pressure and I just need to succeed but nothing is looking good so what do I do. I always use any distraction to escape the feeling of dread I feel whenever I wake up not any substances but going to parties, yapping to people about nothing, and just general avoidance.

Ours has been here 3 years, and two years ago he simply forgot to sign up 3 students for their math AA SL tests so they were unable to take them. They showed up in May to take their exams, and were sent away. Thankfully 2 were juniors and the other wasn’t full dp but that seems insane. He doesn’t check with students to make sure they’re testing and I am not confident he has signed me up for all my tests. Aside from IB coordinator he teaches 2 Tok classes, most of those lesson plans coming from chatgpt (he told us this). So I’m not really sure why he’s this awful. Does this seem to be something other people have experienced? Is there some way to report this?

18ac5jz,7,2023-12-03,Explicitly using AI language models to facilitate learning (Seeking insights from academics),u/Name-minus-Number,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/18ac5jz/explicitly_using_ai_language_models_to_facilitate/,"Good day everyone!

I am interested in what your experiences in utilizing AI in facilitating learning. when referring to AI I mean language models like chatGPT, Claude etc.

Specifically, for those who have allowed and/or integrated AI langugae models in your teaching, I am interested in learning where have you applied it, what was your rationale, and what are your strategies. I assure everyone that I am not doing research for a manuscript but I am trying to learn from fellow acadmics (young and senior) on what have been your practices. 

For context, this is my experience:
I am m social science teacher hence my insights are mostly limited to pedagogies in sociology, political science and history. 

From personal experience and reflection as a university level lecturer, I see two distinct ways in utilizing AI: first is outright allowing it to be used to process readings, answer quizzes and write essays; and second is integrating AI in learning activities such as explicitly requiring students to utilize AI tools as part of the learning. I refer to the former as copilot style, and the latter as co-learner style. 

In assessing the two, I lean more towards the latter--. The former is simply too unpredictable if not checked or supervised, and it also leads to dilemmas of grading, attribution and assessment. I however see value in it in terms of assisting students in making sense of oftentimes, overwhelming information like ancient readings or thick rims of data (e.g. government documents). This is especially true when students are ESL or EFL students. Language models have been useful for them to make sense of complicated data that requires them to translate information in several layers (e.g. from academic english, to their langauge, to conversational english). 

In terms of the co-learning model, I explicitly require students to use AI language models i  their learning activities. I do so to either demonstrate a point on the value of critical thinking, ease the process of managing info, or even using as an opportunity to teach ethical ways of using AI. For example, I ask students to use chatgpt or bard to summarize and identity key points from classical sociology scholars like Weber. I give them a basic prompt to ask, and they are to ask to critique it in class. They can obviously use AI to critique it  but I find that language models tend to be bad in self-critque and reflection. They usually go around to the same point. I have other activities but I hope my point is clear here. 

I know that AI in teaching is a complicated topic, and the current consensus or at least the more popular take is to ban AI language models. I, however, prefer to approach it from a lens of opportunity to address existing challenges and anticipate potential challenges that may arise from it.

I am therefore in your experience with AI as a learning tool. Feel free to debate and disagree but I encourage you to indicate your reasons. My objective, again, is to seek insights. 

Thank you everyone!",active,10,neutral,0

 I'm looking to create a student advisor chatbot that can answer questions related to study programs, which field of study suits a student best, what subjects and focuses a particular field has, and more. As I'm relatively new to this field, I've experimented with QLoRa fine-tuning using a German fine-tuned Llama 2 model for testing purposes. I'm in the process of preparing my dataset from study advisory books, and I expect to have around 2000 question-answering data points. I've read that Instruction tuning can bring more advantages to tasks like this. I've used the same format (Alpaca) for fine-tuning that was used for the German fine-tuning.

I have a few questions:

1. I want my bot to learn how to respond based on the  information(##input) in the dataset. Would having 1000-2000 rows of data be sufficient to teach it the format of responses and what's relevant from the instructions for the response?
2. Are there any good German models that are well-suited for such a task?
3. What's the best way to evaluate if the fine-tuning was successful for such a task? How can I effectively test the model?
4. Is there a good script I could use for my training, where I can experiment with parameters and conduct tests?

(Already cleared this post with a mod so hopefully it doesn't run afoul of any rules).

We’re former educators (10+ years teaching math+physics and running educational outreach at the HS/college level) turned AI Researchers (ex-Alphabet). We’ve been building an AI tutoring chat agent to help both students and educators/parents, and we were wondering if some of our fellow Redditors here could play around with our demo and give us some honest feedback and discussion. We built everything custom, and did not use ChatGPT in any way to train our AI model, since we don’t believe the current big models are very capable of being good teachers (versus just telling users the answers). Since we’re just two random people working out of our garage, **things are still very rough especially in terms of accuracy**, although the model should become more accurate as we improve data/compute. But we are optimistic that our from-scratch model already seems more tutor-like than other AI bots.

**You can access the demo here:** [**https://aitutoringproject.info**](https://aitutoringproject.info).\*\* It’s free and we don’t collect any info other than what’s typed into the chat window. Any chance the folks here could let us know what you think? We’d like to understand what you like and don’t like and how we can better serve learners and educators moving forwards.

A lot of software tools in my field are poorly documented, unsupported, and ultimately abandoned. I'd like to do better.

Since I use ChatGPT every day to generate code and learn new applications, I've found that the quality of the answers it gives depends strongly on how popular the software is online, and how many different versions and changes it's been through. Popular, static software is best; unpopular, mutable software often yields wrong results.

I've seen [Tyler Cowen's book GOAT, ""the first book written in AI.""](https://goatgreatesteconomistofalltime.ai/en) That and this documentation problem I face got me thinking: wouldn't it be great if there was a way to write documentation for software that was specifically designed to be ChatGPT-compatible (or LLM-compatible more generally).

I know about but haven't used the GPTs that OpenAI recently released. I also know that ChatGPT can now read PDFs, although I have found that trying to verify or troubleshoot ChatGPT's answers in these sorts of situations can be more trouble than it's worth.

I am a new teacher. I did my student teaching at a High School and now work at a Middle School. I have a student who is very very low. I also had them all create origin stories for their characters. I put the prompt into Chatgpt. I got a story kinda similar. Since then, I haven’t gotten that story again. I think I may have fucked by attaching the kids story, or part of it and just created something similar. I accused this kid of AI. On his Google Doc, I saw the keystrokes of a few minutes and so I just assumed he copied and pasted. I got some similar words from the internet — nothing identical. I had a kid plagiarize his reading guide so I just thought this kid did. Besides, all the upper kids use chatgpt like it’s nothing. The vocabulary didn’t align with his. Using words I just didn’t think he knew. The sentence structure for the first time was really good. It was logical, incorporated must things I wanted. I just thought it had to be the work of AI. Now, this kid went home sobbing that he hates our school more than his last and it’s my fault. The principal said no resubmitting and that set the parents off. They hate me now and they’re right. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m tired of always having to be on the look out for chatgpt and never really knowing when it’s truth and when it’s real. I am tired of having issues I cannot control. If it was me, I would have let the kid redo it. But then again now I’m discouraging vocabulary usage. Maybe the keystrokes were because he was working really and I just thought the worst. All I can do is just hand in my resignation at this point. I can’t take my mental health decline. The kids don’t care. I don’t care. What’s the point? I feel awful because they just hired me, but I don’t feel good enough. You’re gonna tell me “everyone makes mistakes.” But my mistake damaged my irreputably damaged my relationship with my student and I can’t repair it. I’m not smart enough to be a teacher anyways.

⚠️This video is a response to a highly controversial video posted on Instagram by a teacher about identifying if their students have used ChatGPT for their homework. The video sparked a huge discussion among the ChatGPT for Teachers group members on Facebook, so I decided to state my point of view on the matter. 

ChatGPT for the classroom is super beneficial for both teaching and learning, but if you follow this approach, your authority will diminish and your students' trust will fracture.

It was a real challenge. The teacher wanted us to use five different sources, and I thought it would be a breeze. But as the deadline approached, I found myself struggling.

I had a hard time finding those five sources. The library visits and online searches didn't go as smoothly as I hoped. I ended up submitting the paper with just three sources, feeling a bit defeated.

But you know what? It turned out to be a big learning experience. My teacher gave feedback, pointing out the importance of diverse sources for a well-rounded paper. Instead of feeling discouraged, I decided to do better next time.

From that point on, I became more organized in my research. I learned how to find reliable sources and plan ahead. It wasn't an instant improvement, but over the next assignments, I gradually got the hang of it. Looking back, that small failure was a stepping stone to becoming a more effective and resourceful student.

18bme8w,2,2023-12-05,I created NexusGenAI — a No-Code Large Language Model Configuration Platform,u/NextGen-Trading,ArtificialInteligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/18bme8w/i_created_nexusgenai_a_nocode_large_language/,"Two months ago, I was trying to fix a bug in my AI-Powered automated investing platform, [NexusTrade](https://nexustrade.io). Specifically, the issue was with the “Create a Portfolio Prompt” feature, which is designed to generate a unique set of trading strategies based on user inputs. It was frustrating trying to perform the prompt engineering in the source code, and it was difficult to isolate and test the functionality.

At the same time, I had a sorta revelation: the AI-Powered Chat is NexusTrade’s most popular feature by far. It allowed the configuration of highly sophisticated trading strategies, even for people without a technical background. The core principles of the chat — automating complex processes and improving the user experience — can be applied to a wide range of applications. For example, imagine if a teacher could generate a highly customizable lesson plan for their students that’s tailored depending on each student’s interests and personality. If only they had a platform that made this easy.

That’s why I set out to build [NexusGenAI](https://www.nexusgenai.io/). NexusGenAI branches off from NexusTrade and abstracts the AI-Powered Chat to a separate application. At the same time, it allows the configuration of Large Language Model (LLM)-Powered applications in an easy-to-use user interface.

This article will describe the current functionality of NexusGenAI and the migration of NexusTrade’s Chat to the platform. It will then describe the next steps before the application is ready for a large-scale public release.

# Transitioning NexusTrade’s AI Chat to NexusGenAI

The initial step in developing NexusGenAI involves establishing a minimum viable product (MVP). The primary goal is to integrate the sophisticated capabilities of NexusTrade’s chat into this new application. This will encompass features such as the creation and backtesting of trading strategies, along with advanced financial analysis. For a comprehensive understanding of NexusTrade’s chat architecture, refer to the detailed description provided in the [following article.](https://nexustrade.io/blog/architecting-an-extensible-maintainable-ai-chat-bot-for-your-web-application-20231014)

To summarize the article, the NexusTrade application operates through a sequential process:

1. It identifies the user’s request as pertaining to a specific “Prompt.”
2. It utilizes the corresponding Prompt to formulate a response to the user.
3. Optionally, it engages in post-processing steps, which may include executing additional function calls.

This established workflow was successfully transitioned to NexusGenAI, culminating in a user interface that encapsulates these functionalities.

18bv4tv,12,2023-12-05,Textbook review: 新实用汉语课本5 （New Practical Chinese Reader 5: Textbook),u/BeckyLiBei,ChineseLanguage,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/18bv4tv/textbook_review_新实用汉语课本5_new_practical_chinese/,"TL;DR:

- ""Reader"" does not imply ""graded reader""; it's a textbook similar to, but less comprehensive than, the HSK6 Standard Course.

- I spent 8 to 10 hours per chapter (10 chapters total) studying it in detail.  I discussed things I didn't fully grasp in detail with ChatGPT.  Most of the vocabulary I already knew (it'd take longer for a student who doesn't know these words prior).

- It starts off easy and gets harder.  The texts towards the end are more diverse and interesting than vs. other textbooks.

- No answers to exercises are provided (ask ChatGPT).

- Like the HSK6 Standard Course, vocabulary is defined via English (and thus imprecisely), and the grammar points are explained using Chinese linguistics jargon (and thus are harder to fully appreciate and understand).

- I feel it's useful for preparing for the HSK6.  While HSK6 Standard Course textbooks are more comprehensive, I found 新实用汉语课本5's grammar explanations and exercise more helpful.

- Where relevant, I suggest reading the original texts online as they differ from the textbook version.

In preparation for the HSK6 exam, my iTalki teacher suggested I study the textbook 《新实用汉语课本5》, which I've just now finished studying.  It has 10 chapters: 51 through 60.

First things first, while the title uses the word ""reader"", it's not a graded reader (for years I saw ""reader"" and thought it wasn't a textbook, so never thought about using it).  There is a lot of reading involved, though.

It's quite similar to the HSK6 Standard Course in style: the main thing is texts with vocabulary translated into English (no Chinese definitions are given, but Chinese is used for grammar explanations).

It uses a standard chapter structure: (a) main text with 50 to 70 new words; (b) relevant grammar with collocations and example sentences, (c) exercises (e.g. write words using a specified hanzi, fill in the blank, true/false questions, answer questions using vocabulary; it varies); (d) auxiliary text with 10 to 20 new words; (e) questions about the auxiliary text; (f) dialogue (text) with ~10 new words; (g) listening (mp3) with ~10 new words, usually less than 2 minutes long; (h) questions about the recording.  The textbook is weighted far more heavily towards reading than listening.

I spent something like 8 to 10 hours studying per chapter, this included reading the texts aloud (sometimes multiple times); doing the exercises (I skipped a few I thought were pointless); discussing details with ChatGPT; reading the original text where relevant (sometimes the text was modified from an original source), and listening (sometimes multiple times) to the mp3.

I knew most (maybe 80%+) of the 1000+ new words it includes.  (Obviously this is not enough to cover all 2500 HSK6 vocabulary.)  There were a greater proportion of words I didn't know towards the end.

Some of the texts are ""less bland"".  E.g., 初为人妻 (in chapter 57) is somewhat anti-feminist, where a woman finds that her feminist ideals are inhibiting her from 幸福 (the audio in chapter 57 is also fairly anti-feminist, portraying a woman being unreasonable, and then just deciding to stop being unreasonable and everything is fine).  背影 (in chapter 58) was written about 100 years ago, and is super-emotional, about a father's breakdown after his mother dies, and his son who regrets distancing himself from his father; it was a struggle to get through this, both grammatically and emotionally.  The text 十八年的秘密 (in chapter 59) actually has intrigue and mystery, but it feels like ""hijinks"" in that people don't simply do the obvious thing, like tell each other the truth (I guess it's fictional).  The dialogue 梁山伯与祝英台 (in chapter 59) reads a bit like an unfunny Monty Python sketch.

I recommend reading the original texts where relevant (I found them online by Googling the title and author's name); a few passages are modified from an original, which can make the story sound awkward.  E.g., in one passage words to the effect of ""died in combat"" were replaced with words to the effect of ""crushed by a rock""; in another passage, the textbook changed it so that an adult Chinese woman had never cooked before (which wasn't part of the original story).  I found the plots make more sense if you read the unmodified version.

The audio for chapter 58 is weird.  A youth convinces a frail old man (who they just met) to sell their house for 1/10-th of the price, making all sorts of promises.  The audio presents it as if the youth is doing a really lovely thing, and not scamming an old man.  The audio for chapter 60, which I was hoping would be a grand finale, was weak.

All in all, while not perfect, I found this textbook to be a reasonable way to study at the HSK6 level.",active,16,neutral,0

What the fuck is going on in your schools? Do you guys not block chatgpt? Kids just being on their phones the entire time? Kids just swear in front of the teachers without consequences?

I live in America (Maryland if it matters). The worst teacher I've had was a 4th grade advanced classes teacher who was the worst possible teacher for a child with undiagnosed ADHD and Autism. (Many nights of crying in bed and extremely low self esteem even now)

Last year, my geometry teacher DIED. The school was too cheap to hire another teacher so they sent somebody who had to cover 18 other classes and they sent a sub so we wouldn't burn the school down. (Though that was middle school and the normal kids behaved terribly in middle school, we were in advanced classes.)

I'm a first year college student, and ChatGPT helps me learn with quite a bit. Here is a recent chat I had when I asked it to help me study for finals.

There are a few times in the chat where I ask it repeatedly if it is done yet; I know OpenAi doesn't give time stamps but that was over the course of the entire 5 hours.

However, I work in engineering and if these kids were working as grad/undergrad engineers and had _that much capability_ with the cheating tools available to them in just _middle school/high school_, I can only imagine how creative and resourceful they will be by the time they are in the workforce (and AI/user-assisting technologies have got their feet off the ground). They'll be fully able to generate efficient and computer-checked solutions by blending together AI prompting, design software, the vast array of knowledge from Google, all with minimal human intervention therefore reducing human error, saving time, and streamlining the design process.

Obviously this comes with its negatives, for example if the engineers don't know how to design it without their fancy AI, who is actually checking it's correct? I don't condone cheating but given that it's already occurring, I find it funny that these kids put more effort into finding efficient cheating solutions instead of actually doing the work - it's become an entire skill in itself.

Please give your inputs in the comments as I'm not a teacher and would love to hear your thoughts for the effects of efficient (sadly) student cheating on their workplace proficiency with creativity and tools. Disclaimer again that I completely understand cheating in school bypasses the important learning to actually be able to engineer anything in the first place, but hopefully you can see what I'm talking about.

18d8qum,2,2023-12-07,Thoughts on true strong AI like Data,u/galtoramech8699,agi,https://www.reddit.com/r/agi/comments/18d8qum/thoughts_on_true_strong_ai_like_data/,"So I have been looking at AI for about 20 years, mostly as an enthusiast or amateur.   I have an engineering degree and do software engineering now I follow the AI field but not my core focus.  I read papers from time to time.  We may been doing machine learning at the company but ML is ML and ChatGPT are ...just that.

A little history and thoughts.

So I wrote small chat bots like Eliza and do basic pattern matching and respond with some proper response.  And I am surprised that Chatgpt was so far advanced from Eliza.  Just thinking, I guess in software, there is still a difference between an amateur developer playing around, student doing programming, open source projects and major companies doing development.  For example, MS may add AI into their OS in future.  Can't imagine Linux will do that anytime soon or Ubuntu really not the Linux kernel. I would like to be on those discussions if they are though.  


But anyways, ChatGPT is interesting.  I am still not that impressed for the reasons I will list later.  But a good project, it is not like I came up.  And it could be a disruptor if used the right way. I don't think it is the internet.  When I got on the Internet in 1995? with netscape, I didn't necessarily had to use, but I was pretty addicted and if you to 2000, 2010, we had to use, no other options essentially. Chat gpt, I use about once a week I guess because I still search stuff on google. Even then I use chatgpt for 10 minutes.  Basically I ask it stupid questions I wouldn't get away with on reddit.

I think Chat GPT is deficient in a couple of ways and I will lead into my strong ai question.

&#x200B;

* The hallucinations are still a big deal.  Isn't it basically that wrong information can influence Chat gpt.  And I guess like fake news, how would it know?
* Chat GPT prompts go one way, a user has to prompt chat gpt essentially, prompt, prompt with questions.
* The responses are canned and not really changing much, you ask 100 times, get about same response.  You ask a human the same question, it may change from day to day, which is fine.  And maybe the answer for chat gpt do change over time, but not like a human would
*  I still think chatgpt is advanced transformer, language model, doesn't really think.  I still think about really good chat bot, like eliza with a large database.  Which is basically google, google has probably a larger database but not no real language there.
* And let's not discount the technolgies that have been out there.  Google, Internet Search, Alexa, Wolfram Alpha, Siri.  I am surprised like google didn't come out there first.  I guess they are always search focused and advertising.  Really I think Alexa was the first big chat bot, maybe Siri, siri just always seemed annoying to me for some reason.
* It is not like... this thing is bad technology.  And I wonder in 5 years, where it will go.  I think the big buzz is over and people will use it like they do now.  Writing and summarizing documents, search , researching things.  Customer service maybe, better help chat bots.  Improving canned algorithmic software code.

Here is what I think on strong AI, and a question.  Are there good papers on strong ai, the kind of psychology driven AI, human like AI.

* So Chat GPT can do the language and seems life like with the canned questions and responses.
* So the closest amateur research thing I did.  I was really interested in the low level, bottom up AI and evolutionary algorithms.  My thought was, I would replicate earth like beings.  If you think about it, we share a lot of dna with a lot of smart animals, like dolphins, dogs, pigs, monkeys, ravens.  They are all smart if you think about .  I just got a dog.  And I pour dog water and I wondered, how does it know to drink the water.  And I think it is the same way we do.  The dogs parents probably drank water and then they learned to drink water and how to find it.  So when I pour the water or hear it splash into the container, they can probably assume this is water and they should drink it. I still dont think it was smell but anyway...  I was interested in low level AI, not just dogs  or dolphins, but the evolutionary process from amoeba life to humans.  And if you really go back, you have to understand the environment we live in too, so almost have to go back 4 billion years and replicate all that in some time simulation.  I think it is a cool idea but computationally impossible.  And I looked artificial chemistry research, evolutionary biology, cellular automata, stuff like that.  I think it was cool, because the dynamic nature generated interested results.
* Anyway, taking that above, I thought the key to AI was understanding early life.  I am done with that but I still think we need to look at the nature of animals and how that leads into Strong AI.  So think about humans, and not all humans are smart.  Chat gpt is probably smarter than 95% of them certain areas.  For example you can ask the fast food restaurant person to analyze markets from 10 years ago.  Chat GPT can.  But at the same time, why would Chat GPT analyze markets anyway.  Maybe the fast food worker, does look at stocks in their free time and maybe 10 years later, they could make some side money with basic knowledge on it.  And then maybe come back with basic ideas on how they do that.  But here is the question, the fast food worker is motivated to look into stocks because they have some ""desire"" to do so for their family or friends or to enrich themselves.  Why would chatgpt do that?  It couldn't unless you prompt it and just happened to have that knowledge.  Will chatgpt do this?
* Like I said, I wont back to the amoeba.  But I am curious what motivates a dog to drink water.  What motivates people to want things?
* The other thing I hate about things like Chatgpt and canned tools.  And really even AI in games.  I have always wanted bad AI?   Even I create an AI or game or something.  I want a bad actor, a bad AI.  Just like we have bad people and google people. We need bad AI and good AI.  I really think Open AI should create an AI that actually steals, cheats and lies to people.  They wont, but then then create an cop AI.   Better goverance in their AI system will function better when their is some bad actor to protect against.  As it stands now, we basically expect chatgpt to always act perfectly and lawfully.
* Basically current AI is not strong AI, it has no desire, no issues, no depression, no anxiety, no fear.  And from that, maybe not ability to respond to bad situations unless we program it.  Current AI does not act organically or dynmaically or adapt as well as humans or other animals.  AI has no memory because it doesnt need one.  Our fears, sometimes drive our memory to avoid certain things, AI doesn't do that.  


&#x200B;

Anyway, will chat gpt go there?  When? How long?  Is there research on this?  Does it make sense at all?  


Sorry I am not an academic so my terms may be off here.

Because each cohort is very small the students you are in class with make a huge difference in terms of your educational experience- whether it will be completey silent, interesting work will be produced, etc. I have a classmate that I've been in classes with for a year and a half now. In every single class I see him turn in work that was created by using a template with very very minimal changes- the background is the same, layout, colors, fonts, site structures and content, etc. Basically just some words are changed. Which brings me to the words themselves- they are clearly straight out of ChatGPT ( you can tell just by reading them and I've also thrown them in some chatgpt detectors and they come back 99% chance written entirely by AI). Here's my question- am I right to call him out during our next critique? My thinking is why should we waste our time giving him critique when he hasn't designed any part of his project.

This is my fourth year. I try very hard to really vary the assignments in regard to difficulty. Historically, my classes average an 80. The course is broad and I provide a lot of assignments. I’ve found that the students in prior years were much better equipped to do well. I was able to challenge them when appropriate, and they performed as expected. 

This semester…..oh boy. I may be experiencing the effects from COVID academic easing, and it’s put me in a pickle. 

Class average is 58, median is 59. There are 19 students. 4 of which are between 77-80. All others are below 70, which is the C- threshold. 

The remaining 15 students, by the standard rubric, are failing. Not only do they not do well on the assignments (after multiple attempts), they don’t have a grasp of requisite arithmetic, or simple algebra. Many don’t know how to use a calculator. None have approved special accommodations. They are simply unprepared. I blame the school for moving them along. 

Now I have to submit grades soon and I don’t feel comfortable in “curving” according to the bell or inflating grades 20 points. Given that I also teach the class that requires this to be a pre-requisite, my gut is to fail them because that’s the rubric and they don’t know the material to even merit a C. 

I’ve already provided 15% extra credit, which they did poorly on. It only benefited the top 4 students. Some submitted extra credit, got 100% on it, and then could not answer THE SAME question on the sit in exam with a study guide at their disposal. Thanks ChatGPT. 

I haven’t spoken to my chair yet. I’m a bit embarrassed. I understand the implications of failing students but also don’t want to lower the standard in my own field of work.

I am also collecting material on actual experiences from both sides from other people.

Could you share with me your experience with chatGPT (or similar) in the field of teaching or learning? I am obviously also interested in opposing opinions or problems derived from its use, as long as they are justified and you have experienced them firsthand. You can also write to me privately.

My hope is to bring a balanced reflection on the topic, hoping that the integration of these tools into the educational system happens in a sensible way in my nation. Thank you very much for the help!

18djx1z,5,2023-12-08,How to shift away from teaching (to admin/leave faculty to become staff?),u/Global-Worth2175,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/18djx1z/how_to_shift_away_from_teaching_to_adminleave/,"Any thoughts on how to get out of teaching, while staying in higher ed/my university?

I'm a (woman) tenure-track faculty member at a private R2 in the humanities (think English literature, philosophy, history, etc).

I'm struggling with DEEP discouragement and dislike of teaching in this era of increasing grade-grubbing, accomodations requests, ChatGPT, and the pressure from course evals to keep the students feeling good about themselves regardless of whether they did any work, etc. This week felt HORRIBLE in terms of stress, as I was just completely buried under special testing requests, grading of essays that may or may not have been written by humans, students miffed because I didn't give them a study guide detailing exactly what terms and quotes to study for the final, difficult office hours meetings with students unhappy because I wasn't agreeing to let them make up X or Y assignment from September. Ugh.  I don't see the dynamic getting any better, since my uni just approved a whole 'student personal days' policy and everything... All the university-level movement seems to be towards giving more reign to student demands rather than less.

In the next 5 years, how could I shift to some kind of more administrative or staff role? I know that I probabably need to stick it out another 2 years and get tenure, since to be tenure-track and then not seek or get tenure would surely invite some stigma and close doors. But assuming I do, what kinds of other roles could I shift into at the university and how does one do that? 

What comes to mind is...

**a) staying faculty but doing departmental administrative work**. Our chair and various program directors get course releases, so this may be one way to teach less. I know the dept admins deal with a lot of student complaints up the chain, which could be depressing. But it seems anything would be better than the viscerality and vulnerability of being on the front lines so much myself. I really struggle with the exhaustion of teaching and struggle not take personally the course evals pettiness, cheating attempts, constant demands from students to give exceptions/re-dos, etc. I do think I have colleagues who enjoy teaching more than I do -- so, could I do more good on the back end of department admin, trying to support them in holding the line, and be myself happier? But I would still have to teach some classes, so it would just be a lessening of student contact if I went this way.

And I am not sure realistically how soon I could get into a role that would make a tangible difference in reduced teaching. Although of course all the lingo around the university is about equity and representation and whatnot, the reality is that my department (a couple dozen full time faculty) has never had a woman chair and/or a minority chair, so I actually don't know if I could get such a leadership role? It is not that long ago that these admin roles were always white male priests in particular (Catholic university). In general, I think I am well-liked and considered competent, so I think I could eventually end up in some kind of department or program leadership -- but the problem is that it would take a while and I'm not sure I can survive the stress of full-time teaching for too many more years. I'm extremely tired (and admittedly part of that is because of my own family circumstances of being mom to several small children at home), and not really sure that I can face another  4 or 5 or 6 years of day-in-day-out teaching and student demands requiring me to do my job multiple times. But even if I could  get into the program admin roles that come with course releases, that's not going to happen overnight.

**b) shifting to some kind of (non direct student suppor?) staff role on campus.** Overall, our university staff seem to have much better quality of life in that they have all the university benefits (like 100% tuition remission) but, depending on their roles, not having to be on the receiving end of so much teaching stress and student haggling. Students have much chummier relationships with the Student Support and Accomodations Office and DEI staff on campus , since they are seen as friendly advocates for success, while the faculty (no matter how much we bend over backwards to give students what they want) are seen as the enemy holding their 'A' hostage. So though I resent somewhat how this staff/faculty dynamic plays out in student culture, maybe if you can't fight them, you join 'em? If I switch to the staff side, would life be more pleasant with students, or at least more distanced from students?

Unfortunately, I suspect it wouldn't make sense for me to try to shift into the kinds of academic support staff roles that I undersatnd and see most on the day-to-day, like Offices of Student Support, DEI, Accomodations, Pedagogy Teaching & Learning Office). Admittedly,part of the mis-fit is me, since  I've developed a sort of internal beef about them (in my perception) undermining student perceptions of faculty and hijacking the process of students taking responsibility for their own learning. It's not that I don't care about diversity or compassion since questions of genuine inclusion are actually very important to me personally and in my research (I study history of immigrant religious populations, religious and ethnic minorities, etc). But it's just that I have gotten jaded these last couple years after seeing how the campus culture of 'the student customer is always right' has in practice made my life (as in fact a pretty vulnerable female/minority faculty member swimming upstream in a lot of ways) more hellish and difficult. None of the campus discussion of mental health accomodations for students has helped my mental health as a faculty member pulling all nighters responding to demanding student emails for special requests! None of the university pedagogy teaching institute people, urging us to reflect on our course evals every term so we can do better, seem to themselves face the psychological onslaught of having to read whatever 18 year olds might decide to write about them during the most stressful end-of-term weeks when they are resentful about assignments and worried about grades! None of the DEI office people has ever actually advocate for policy changes that would actually help me as a woman/minority/mother faculty member, like being able to use start-up 'research' funds for summer childcare so I can get research done. Sorry for the rant (obviously, I don't express this stuff out on campus), but my point is that I am so discouraged or cynical about what I consider the hypocrisy of these student support type offices not really supporting good teaching and learning, that it probably rules out a chunk of staff roles for me. I would not be a good fit. So what are the OTHER, more faculty-adjacent type roles that I could shift into? My sense is there are a lot of 'Director or Associate Director of X Office' people or 'Program Coordinator of Z Center' people floating around campus, probably earning higher or comparable salaries as I do... though I don't know exactly what most of them do, or whether I could realistically pivot to get those kinds of jobs. Have you ever seen a faculty member be able to shift to some kind of staff role that wasn't teaching but really did seem to support the education of the place? How did they get those jobs? What enabled them to turn their very faculty oriented CVs into viable candidates for those 'good' staff jobs?

I know some people will just say 'go to industry' -- but very practically, I don't see a way or much hope in getting out of academia entirely, since a) I'm in the humanities/social sciences and b) financially, I am still hoping my children could get 100% tuition remission or exchange down the line. We are barely affording basic living costs since we've faced these terribly high rents and home/mortgage prices of the last few years in settling down recently; so since my salary is pretty low, and we have not been able to save for retirement or for the kids' college. Without a better paying 'industry' to go to, I think my best bet to keep supporting the family is still to somehow stay in higher ed and hope for that tuition remission/exchange to work when my kids are old enough to go to college.

(PS. I'm sorry for the selfishness of this question! I went into academia wanting to be a good teacher and to make a difference educating students; so I'm sad/ashamed to have gotten so cynical about university life that I am thinking in such self-defensive ways about trying to just minimize my vulnerability to student haggling while keeping a job... But I'm feeling pretty hopeless, since I thought teaching would be better than it is and just cannot see any light at the end of any tunnel in faculty life these days).

What's my next move? I'd really appreciate any examples of non- or minimal teaching roles around campus that a faculty member could shift into!",User_deleted,6,negative,0

I'm a 3rd grade med student. While I was practicing writing in German for a student exchange program, I've noticed the positive effect of ChatGPT on my journey.

Now with GPT-4 I've seen major improvements especially in evaluation phase.

After that I started to develop a website specifically for language learners who want to practice writing but don't have anyone to take feedback from.

18efjh1,7,2023-12-09,AI tools used for determining whether or not a body of text was written by a human or AI are flawed. They cannot be relied upon and I will explain why.,u/seeking-immortality,ArtificialInteligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/18efjh1/ai_tools_used_for_determining_whether_or_not_a/,"I've spent the majority of my spare time for the past 4-6 weeks, researching each induvial case on social media. Mainly due to the influx of student (mainly US based), raising complaints against their faculty when it comes to marking their assignments invalid due to the use of ""AI"". Or more specifically the AI tool ""ChatGPT"".

This peaked my interest and I wanted to test these free online tools that it seems many educational systems are reliant on to spot AI plagiarism. My findings are pretty simple in hindsight:

There is a significant correlation between writing from an x person perspective and these tools incorrectly specifying bodies of text as AI generated content. As well as the level of writing with exclusion of gender specific words. 

1. If you include a lot of first person words and gender denominations and write at primary school level or high school level. Free tools will return 0-10% possibility of AI generated content.
2. If you include a lot of first person words and gender denominations, write at University level or Level 7. Free tools will return 10-60% possibility of AI generated content.
3. If you include a lot of third person words and no gender denominations, write at University level or Level 7. Free tools will return 10-86% possibility of AI generated content.

This shows that:

* When AI models/services are learning from user input behaviour they are expecting the majority of humans to write at a lower grade than expecting. potentially proving that a lot of ""undereducated"" humans are using the tool and therefor training models to expect lower than level 7 writing. 
* Following on from the above when asking AI models for information or specific situations major of the time users will ask it for ""I need x, can you do this?"" or ""Using the information given, can you give me x?"". More specifically I've seen that AI services are being used to reword paragraphs or rewrite passages to sound more intellectual.

Therefore, when work written by students completing a standard or master level degree, is looked at by one of these tools. It's flagged as AI generated because the models expect a lower level of writing and from a first person perspective. This level of writing isn't what these modes are trained on, which results in false positives.

Another aspect is because AI generated text is majority genderless by default, unless requested by the user. This can also result in false positives when writing about something that doesn't require gender to be specified or needed.

Tools I've found are very inaccurate are:

1. [https://writer.com/ai-content-detector/](https://writer.com/ai-content-detector/)
2. [https://gptzero.me/](https://gptzero.me/)

4. [https://undetectable.ai/](https://undetectable.ai/)
5. [https://sapling.ai/ai-content-detector](https://sapling.ai/ai-content-detector)

I find it odd how intensive testing hasn't been completed on these models considering that majority of people are using these tools in positions they shouldn't be. All AI detectors mentioned have been established since 2023, meaning not only have they been around less than a year but most of these are built from ChatGPT services, adding to the unviability of these tools.",active,10,neutral,0

If you're gonna use it in the workforce use it in school.

I'd turn the tables and accuse the professors of being lazy not the students. Since GPT exists you should expect and encourage your students to use it, and instead just up the essay requirements to exceed the context window. This will force students to focus on research and fact checking which is what they should be doing anyway.

Calculators are cheating on a 5th grade math test and are encouraged on a 9th grade one. You shouldn't be expected to master something by hand you should just be expected to understand the building blocks.

In order for technology to keep progressing we need to cull the stuff not necessary to learn anymore. Why waste time teaching someone something that GPT will do for them when they could devote that time to teaching them something else.

At a certain point the progress of tech will be too much to expect an entry level scientist or engineer to know. Because at a certain point the scientist could spend his entire life only learning up to level 20 when society is at level 150.

The idea is for the AI to be the scribe for the building blocks of tech and instead let us start at level 150 in college.

Microsoft Word started spell checking and then grammar checking. Grammarly took that to the next level and started suggesting rewrites of whole sentences or paragraphs.

Personally as a masters and doctorate professor, it has made my emails sound more professional and more efficient in their message. It has also cut my workflow down from 10 hours per new lecture hour to about 2 to 3. I give it a prompt, it gives me some pretty good information tailored to the education level of my students. I then review this information, make sure it's correct (and sometimes it's not), add or remove information, and then put it into a PowerPoint. I then have it write test questions from the reading material and the Power Point. Overall, my lectures are way better. They have clearly presented and summarized points. My test questions are clearly worded and sourced so less challenges against them. Overall, it's been great.

I teach a creative writing class next term. I've taught it before, and currently, I have the students writing a ""final story / narrative"" as their final assignment (exams are not a thing my program). 

This is supposed to be a 10-20 page story with analysis of how they chose to structure it, create characters, etc. Obviously, this is ChatGPT-able. 

My admin advised to add ""interim assignments"" e.g. put in multiple assignments to see the process of their rough drafts, which I did. However, I know students will just skip all the rough draft assignments then Chat GPT their final paper. 

Is there anyway around this? Is there someway to include the grades of the rough work with the final project? Figured I should ask the educated masses.

If this proves impossible, my plan is to just lower the value of the final report, and have the students complete an interview with me instead as their final exam.",User_deleted,6,neutral,0

I've been at the same institution for many years teaching Humanities and, as many of you have, I've witnessed a steep decline in manners, preparedness, and general kindness of students in all kinds of interactions since the pandemic began. My question is: when you're knee-deep in grade grubbing, plagiarism, ChatGPT, students emailing your dept head because you didn't answer a non-urgent email within 24 hours, etc, how do you manage not to completely loose your compassion and develop a cold, untrusting demeanor towards all students?

18ghd5i,1,2023-12-12,How I use ChatGPT in the Classroom: A use case,u/3rdplacewinner,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/18ghd5i/how_i_use_chatgpt_in_the_classroom_a_use_case/," I don't know if this will be useful for anyone, but I use ChatGPT in the classroom quite often and wanted to share how I've used it in the past. I teach English as a Foreign Language in a high school outside of the US.

**Rubric Building**: It's fantastic for creating and populating rubrics. You can provide it with a few criteria like grammar, fluency, and poise, and it can generate a rubric based on that input. It's simple to tweak the points, weights and definitions. 

**Writing Advice**: I've found that it's most precise when I walk through the process step by step. To provide writing advice, I first had ChatGPT brainstorm 30 different issues that students like mine might encounter. Then, I replaced some of the more serious issues with lighter ones (e.g., from pregnancy to wanting a new iPhone). Afterward, I had ChatGPT compose letters to a friend as if they were facing these specific problems, changing gender and names for each scenario. I also asked it to use more advanced vocabulary and syntax earlier in the letter. As I copied and pasted the letters into my Word document, I numbered them for easy differentiation when assigning them to students. I did it all step by step to ensure quality and make sure we stayed on task, but it allowed me to give individualized problems of differing difficulty to all of my students.  It's really nice when you can give a football player a problem from another football player, and a preening girl a problem of another preening girl who has 4 boys wanting attention.  

**Famous Person Jigsaw**: A jigsaw assignment involves students seeking answers from various sources. For this, I had ChatGPT generate a list of famous people, which I tweaked to include the individuals I wanted. Then, I devised matching data to include in the assignment. For instance,you might have Abraham Lincoln and your friend has Mandela, on the first sheet, I included all the famous people's birthdates, and on the second sheet, details like how they died or any other relevant information. Students had to interact with each other to gather the necessary information to complete their tables. I also had ChatGPT create cloze articles (paragraphs with blanks) about each person, excluding key information, so students could fill in the gaps based on their research.

**Desert Island Lesson**: This is a variation of the classic scenario where you have 20 items on a boat but can only keep 5, and you're stranded on an island. I provided students with a list of 30 different items to choose from, with each group receiving the same list, numbered for reference. Then, I assigned a random disaster, such as an earthquake, flood, or hurricane, and students had to select 7 items they wanted based on their disaster scenario. I set up ChatGPT to play the role of ""Danger Ranger,"" understanding the lesson and providing feedback directly to the students about their choices.  I put ChatGPT up on the big comptuer screen and it would let them know what was good and bad about their selections and estimate how long they might survive. ( ChatGPT does not want to kill students, no matter how much I tried, it  was always wary about telling them they were going to die - maybe that  is good for our future. The students loved hearing that they only had a day to live, but ChatGPT wouldn't say it, so I had to tell them. In fact, ChatGPT edited out all of this and I had to put it back in.) 

It's highly effective for differentiation, simplification, and translation. I can provide it with something I've written and ask it to simplify it to an A2 language level or translate it into the target language, and it is useful in both areas. I use ChatGPT 4, which allows me to create drawings and use the art for lessons regularly.

**Lesson Writing**: I frequently use it to brainstorm various ideas and methodologies for presenting material. Although I'm not always sure about its evaluations because ChatGPT tends to respond positively, even when the ideas might not be all that great.

...In conclusion, ChatGPT has proven to be incredibly encouraging in my  classroom, even though it may have occasional difficulties with timing and numbers. Its versatility and adaptability have significantly enhanced my teaching experience....

Final Interview: 1

Offer: 1

Somethings I'd like to say: 
1:Make your cv solid asf, I used tools provided by my uni and chatgpt, and my CV passed screening in most of the applications. 

2: Try to get small work experiences in your 1st year and early stages of 2nd year. I had two small 50 hour web developer internships that I got through my uni.

3: Be open and a bit friendly in interviews (my opinion), don't be nervous and shi, I was getting a bit nervous before the interviews but once it got started I was in the zone, I was smiling throughout, throwing small things that made Interviewers chuckle basically it was a very friendly and positive environment. In the final interview I got 1 question wrong out of 3 technical questions and I still passed it because the communication part was very good from my side.

4: I've been very depressed, stressed and worried about my future in these past 2 years of uni in UK because of the financial pressure that I have put on my parents (I realized this after coming to UK otherwise I wouldn't have), but the day I got that call, when they told me I got the placement, that shit was so fucking satisfying. My plan is to return to India after earning atleast the amount of money I spent on my studies.

5: Last thing: you gotta be a bit delusional, stay in that main character vibe. I didn't knew shit about advance topics of languages but few days before the Interviews I learnt all the basics like OOP, Error handling,  threading and etc. Never in my life I said ""I am worthless"" ""I can't do it"" ""I am shit"" and etc. Even tho I was shit some times lmao🤷‍♂️

I would like to know what kind of material I should research for a IA that describes what is happening in a comic book/manga for the user; I am mainly doing this in order to present the project to a professor of mine, so that i can get closer to the field of Machine Learning and Computer Vision. The purpose of all this is so that manga and comics can become more accessible for visually impaired people, which are very well described here:  [Accessible Comics for Visually Impaired People: Challenges and Opportunities](https://hal.science/hal-01651358/document)  


Ideally, the project should be an app that takes a comic/manga and describes it to the user the same way a normal book or light novel tells a story. But i know that an IA that can do that is really hard to develop, but i am optimistic to ate least study the problem around it.  


I have gathered that at least the segmentation of at least the text inside a comic book or manga is somewhat simple, like in [Unconstrained Text Detection in Manga](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03997) or in [Text Block Segmentation in Comic Speech Bubbles](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353206709_Text_Block_Segmentation_in_Comic_Speech_Bubbles).  


And the detection of characters is also understood, like in [Comic Characters Detection Using Deep Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8270235).

  
The challenge seems to be the description of the content, as it is hard to tell a machine to analyze art, since comics books and manga are a medium of art, since it is very complicated to understand actions, inferring narratives, cultural differences and language barriers;  the best approach seems to be the use of the technologies such as the ones behind Midjourney and ChatGPT. But I would like for my solution to be opensource or at least as free and accessible as possible, because I am studying in a public university and it is good for the visually impaired community.  


In summary, what should I search for in order to build an AI that understands a comic book or manga, so that it can translate the content into a traditional book form.

I am third year law student who is about to start winter break, and I thought it'd be fun to make a little side project (because after my time boils away in finishing up the semester and getting ready for the bar!) to try and learn to build something to make my life a little easier! Finding time for job applications while dealing with classes, research, exams, and externships has been overwhelming this semester. I’ve barely had a moment to breathe, let alone apply to as many jobs as I had hoped. I only got applications out to about 5 places when I really wanted to cast a wider net. Now, with winter break finally here, I’m hoping to make up for lost time. 

I am absolutely spending my entire break focusing primarily on job applications, that is my sole priority! But writing a cover letter is so tedious, it does help a ton but it's the biggest amount of friction I deal with. I'll get everything else needed and then push it off - which is just a lack of discipline on my end but I really want to try to get rid of that friction.

So here’s my idea: I want to take some of the tedious work out of the process by creating a web app to help jumpstart my cover letters. I’d upload my resume and enter key details about the job posting and company. Then, with the click of a button, it would auto-generate a draft cover letter. 

The program wouldn't write anything final - I still want to customize and refine every letter. But having a framework to start from would make writing and revising each one so much easier. I could even build in some variability so that each draft comes out a little different. That way, I won't be sending out carbon copies. The letters will still sound authentic, retain my voice and style, and highlight what makes me a good fit.

Also I am so aware this could also be a form of procrastination (I just have a fear of rejection I have to get over) but this is just something to do when im not applying.  


I wanted to post this in public because I want to be able to see a project to the end, so the accountability helps!  


Though I would love some advice! I am not entirely technical, so I wanted to build it in someway that I dont need to code. I have ChatGPT, but I really don't know enough about coding to even know what to ask or even have a small idea of what is going on. I learned about something called Bubble or flutter flow, apparently I do not need coding experience to use this!

I was sporadically contracting at start-up at the time and he had just come out of another start-up that was wiped out by the pandemic.

We hit it off, talking about ideas, sharing what other indie-hackers were doing, and given GPT-3’s prominence at the time, we started throwing around ideas about things we could build with it, if nothing else, just to learn.

I should caveat, neither of us were AI experts when starting out, everything we learned has been through Twitter and blogs, my background is as an accountant, and his a consultant.

Here’s how it went since then:

&#x200B;

**Nov 2022 (+$50)**

\- We built a simple tool in around a week using GPT-3 fine-tuning and a no-code tool (Bubble) that helped UK university students write their personal statements for their applications

\- We set some Google Ads going and managed to make a few sales (\~$50) in the first week

\- OpenAI were still approving applications at the time and said this went against their “ethics” so we had to take it down

&#x200B;

**Dec 2022 (+$200)**

\- We couldn’t stop coming up with ideas related to AI fine-tuning, but realised it was almost impossible to decide which to pursue

\- We needed a deadline to force us so we signed up for the Ben’s Bites hackathon in late December

\- In a week, we built and launched a no-code fine-tuning platform, allowing people to create fine-tuned models by dragging and dropping an Excel file onto it

\- We launched it on Product Hunt, having no idea how to price it, and somehow managed to get \~2,000 visitors on the site and make 2 sales at $99

&#x200B;

**Jan 2023 (+$3,000)**

\- We doubled down on the fine-tuning idea and managed to get up to \~$300 MRR, plus a bunch of one-time sales and a few paid calls to help people get the most out of their models

\- We quickly realised that people didn’t want to curate models themselves, they just wanted to dump data and get magic out

\- That was when we saw people building “Talk with x book/podcast” on Twitter as side projects and realised that was the missing piece, we needed to turn it into a tool

\- We started working on the new product in late January

&#x200B;

**Feb 2023 (+$9,000)**

\- We started pre-selling access to an MVP for the new product, which allowed people to “chat with their data/content”, we got $5,000 in pre-sales, more than we made from the previous product in total

\- By mid-February, after 3 weeks of building we were able to launch and immediately managed to get traction, getting to $1k MRR in < 1 week, building on the hype of ChatGPT and AI (we were very lucky here)

&#x200B;

**Mar - Jul 2023 (+$98,000)**

\- We worked all the waking hours to keep up with customer demand, bugs, OpenAI issues

\- We built integrations for a bunch of services like Slack, Teams, Wordpress etc, added tons of new functionality and continue talking to customers every day

\- We managed to grow to $17k MRR (just about enough to cover our living expenses and costs in London) through building in public on Twitter, newsletters and AI directories (and a million other little things)

\- We sold our fine-tuning platform for \~$20k and our university project for \~$3k on Acquire

&#x200B;

**Aug 2023 (+$100,000)**

\- We did some custom development work based on our own product for a customer that proved pretty lucrative

&#x200B;

**Sep - Oct 2023 (+$62,000)**

\- After 8 months of building constantly, we started digging more seriously into our usage and saw subscriptions plateauing

\- We talked to and analysed all our paying users to identify the main use cases and found 75% were for SaaS customer support

\- We took the leap to completely rebuild a version of our product around this use case, our biggest to date (especially given most features with no-code took us <1 day)

&#x200B;

**Nov - Dec 2023 (+$53,000)**

\- We picked up some small custom development work that utilised our own tech

\- We’re sitting at around $22k MRR now with a few bigger clients signed up and coming soon

\- After 2 months of building and talking to users, we managed to finish our “v2” of our product, focussed squarely on SaaS customer support and launched it today.

&#x200B;

We have no idea what the response will be to this new version, but we’re pretty happy with it, but couldn’t have planned anything that happened to us in 2023 so who knows what will come of 2024, we just know that we are going to be learning a ton more.

&#x200B;

Overall, it is probably the most I have had to *think* in my life - other jobs you can zone out from time to time or rely on someone else if you aren’t feeling it - not when you are doing this, case and point, I am writing this with a banging head-cold right now, but wanted to get this done.

A few more things we have learned along the way - context switching is unreal, as is keeping up with, learning and reacting to AI. There isn’t a moment of the day I am not thinking about what we do next.

But while in some way we now have hundreds of bosses (our customers) I still haven’t felt this free and can’t imagine ever going back to work for someone else.

Next year we’re really hoping to figure out some repeatable distribution channels and personally, I want to get a lot better at creating content/writing, this is a first step!

The class I teach is a quantitative reasoning course, primarily designed for nursing majors. The class covers mathematics that nurses need to know: metric/customary conversions, dosage formulas, medication preparations, etc. Then we cover mathematics for everyday life, such as financial and statistical literacy. For the nursing school on our campus, the students must earn at least a 76% in their required courses in order to count as a pass. This student, who is a nursing major, earned a 74.6%, which is short of the threshold.

Anyway, she comes in upset that her final score was below the threshold. She demanded why was that the case since her homework, quiz and exam scores didn’t reflect the score. She had misread the gradebook and the breakdown of the overall course grade. I explained to her multiple times that it was the final exam that caused her grade to go down (she earned a 50%, leaving several problems blank or incomplete) and that it was worth a quarter of the overall grade. I literally had to do the math on the whiteboard in my office to explain that the final score was correct. 

Even after that, she demanded that she needed to pass my course. I said that there was nothing that can be done and the final grade must stand. She asked for a makeup assignment but I explained that the semester is over. All assignments have been submitted, there aren’t any more. She then asked for extra credit but I explicitly state that there are no extra credit opportunities for any reason*. She noted that the lowest two quiz grades were dropped from the final calculation, which is correct. But she wanted me to drop two more quizzes! I declined. Finally, she asserted that she should get bonus points for attending class. Ummm…I’m sorry but I will not award points for something that you should be doing in the first place.

I had a student come into my office today (yesterday at this point), opened her laptop and told me that she needed to pass my class. The class I teach is a quantitative reasoning course, primarily designed for nursing majors. The class covers mathematics that nurses need to know: metric/customary conversions, dosage formulas, medication preparations, etc. Then we cover mathematics for everyday life, such as financial and statistical literacy. For the nursing school on our campus, the students must earn at least a 76% in their required courses in order to count as a pass. This student, who is a nursing major, earned a 74%, which is short of the threshold.

Anyway, she comes in upset that her final score was below the threshold. She demanded why was that the case since her homework, quiz and exam scores didn’t reflect the score. She had misread the gradebook and the breakdown of the overall course grade. I explained to her that it was the final exam that caused her grade to go down (she earned a 50%, leaving several problems blank or incomplete) and that it was worth a quarter of the overall grade. I literally had to do the math on the whiteboard in my office to explain that the final score was correct. 

Even after that, she demanded that she needed to pass my course. I said that there was nothing that can be done and the final grade must stand. She asked for a makeup assignment but I explained that the semester is over. All assignments have been submitted, there aren’t any more. She then asked for extra credit but I explicitly state that there are no extra credit opportunities for any reason*. She noted that the lowest two quiz grades were dropped from the final calculation, which is correct. But she wanted me to drop two more quizzes! I declined. Finally, she asserted that she should get bonus points for attending class. Ummm…I’m sorry but I will not award points for something that you should be doing in the first place. Of course I didn’t say that since I’m too nice. But I firmly held my ground and told her no. She left still clearly upset. I feel that this isn’t the end and I’ll be hearing from her and/or her advisor.

**1. Setting the Scene: December 16, 1773, Boston Harbor**

Picture a cold, moonlit night in Boston Harbor, 1773. The air is tense with the whispers of rebellion. This historic event occurs in a period of escalating disagreements between the American colonists and the British Parliament, primarily over the issue of taxation without representation.

**Historical Significance:** Boston Harbor, a symbol of colonial trade and British control, becomes the stage for a defining moment in the struggle for American independence.

**3. Unfolding the Event: A Night of Rebellion**

As the night unfolds, members of the Sons of Liberty, disguised as Mohawk Indians, board three British ships. In a bold act of defiance, they throw 342 chests of tea into the chilly waters, protesting the Tea Act imposed by the British Parliament.

**4. Contextualizing the Event: A Fight for Rights**

The Boston Tea Party is a direct response to the Tea Act, a British law designed to save the financially troubled East India Company. This event reflects broader historical themes of taxation without representation and the struggle for self-governance.

---

**5. Impact and Relevance**

**Immediate Impact:** The British government's harsh response with the Intolerable Acts further alienates the colonies.

**Long-Term Impact:** This act of rebellion is a key catalyst for the American Revolution and the eventual establishment of the United States.

I loved this program, but I’m also really glad to have free time back in my life. I thought I would do a quickish write-up, both for the sweet, sweet catharsis but also to put my review out in the wild for anyone that’s curious what it’s like to cross the finish line, or thinking about starting. First, the quantifiable stuff most folks are curious about:

Me:
- Graduated with a B.S in Computer Science from a state school in 2015
- Married, no kids
- Living overseas
- No CS industry experience

Coursework:
Spring 2022
- CSE 6242: Data Visualization
- CSE 6743: Simulation, Modeling, and Military Wargaming

Summer 2022
- CS 6601: AI

Fall 2022
- CS 6035: Intro to Information Security
- CS 7641: Machine Learning

Spring 2023
- CS 7646: Machine Learning for Trading
- CS 6300: Software Development Process

Summer 2023
- CS 6603: AI, Ethics, and Society

Fall 2023
- CS 6205: Computer Networks
- CS 7650: Natural Language Processing

Thoughts:
My motivations for starting CS were mainly career-motivated (looking to get into the software industry in the next 3-5 years) but also a personal love of academic work. I was also really curious about how ML works, and I felt like OMSCS would be a productive way to go down that rabbit hole. I started in 2022, before ChatGPT was a thing and the AI boom we’re in had taken off. The timing couldn’t have been better for me, personally. 

When I first enrolled in the program, I was concerned that it would be tough for me to get back into the swing of things. I haven’t ever programmed professionally, and it had been quite a while since I was last in school. I found two classes I thought would be easy-ish, (a good call) and dove in. Overall, I found that I was a much better student as an adult in my late 20’s than when I was fresh out of high school, so the stress was misdirected on that one.

I kinda did a mild speed run of the program [23 months, Any%], but that’s due to specific career constraints. My job was paying the bills, so I needed to be done within two years. It’s a pretty difficult pace, and lead to a few sleepless nights and a lot of stress and juggling priorities. I was working full-time while enrolled (8-12 hours a day, usually 5 days a week), and my typical workday schedule was:
4:00am - wake up
4:30am - start studying
7:30am - get ready for work
8:00am through 6:00pm - work
6:00pm - 8:00pm - dinner and get ready for bed

I decided to wake up early to do schoolwork because that’s when I’m at my peak focus. I definitely don’t think that’s required for everyone, but it works for me. 

On the weekends, I just churned away at stuff until it was done. Definitely a few weekends where I didn’t get to do any social stuff, but I was usually able to go out to eat with friends or hang out with my spouse in the evenings. I was also still able to travel for work or family events (weddings and such), and could usually put off school stuff until I got back, so I still got to do a lot of neat stuff while working on the program, but YMMV. Between workdays and weekends, I typically spent about 15-30 hours a week on OMSCS. 

If you’re reading this and wondering if you should give the program a go, my first piece of advice is that you need to get your family’s endorsement. Look at the schedule I discussed and honestly ask yourself “is this a commitment I can support while meeting the needs of those in my life that depend on me?” My wife definitely had to endure (or occasionally relish in) spending less time with me, and I wasn’t exactly going above and beyond on the chores around the house. If you have kids, this probably becomes a *much* more difficult decision. 

My second piece of advice is that, if you’re nervous about being out of school and jumping back in, don’t be. You’re probably a much better organized person now than when you were in your late teens, and can manage deadlines and other commitments. 

My third piece of advice is to consider what else you’re losing. This program is cheap in terms of money (really cheap, actually), but if you have hobbies you really enjoy, you’ll find that you’ll have far less time to pursue them. Personally, I really like video games. 2023 has been an excellent year for them, but I spent most of my time in Jupyter notebooks. Even when traveling, I had to sacrifice time I would have spend wondering around to watch lectures and ensure my assignments were getting submitted. 

Conclusion:
All in all, I accomplished what I set out to do. I satisfied (and fueled) my academic curiosity about Machine Learning. I think I’m a much better programmer as a result, and my mindset has shifted in a lot of ways. I think of myself as someone that can solve hard problems now, the kinds I would have probably shied away from before. It’s been great for my confidence and sense of self-worth, and it’s hard to quantify how valuble that is. 

In a way, I see posts on this sub from others asking about auditing courses to continue learning after graduation. I get it. I kind of don’t want that part of this experience to end. But the sacrifices I’ve made to get here were pretty steep. I’m writing this from an airplane on my way home, and for once I’m not hunched over the try table, trying to take notes and get through lecture material so I can go home and churn away on a new assignment. I’ve got a relived spouse and a new Steam Deck OLED (graduation gift to myself that I’m pretty jazzed about) waiting for me at home, and I think it’s time to get back to regular life for a while. I’m thinking that I might find some open source projects to contribute to, so I can stay fresh and put my new-found skill set to use for the greater good, and I’m really excited for the future.",active,65,positive,0

I am interested in two topics related to middle school education:  
\- How to lessen the workload for teachers (this study is part of this topic)  
\- How to help students with cognitive challenges by creating a feedback loop between their cognitive abilities and the results they get from a GPT assistant.

The result is impressive, and I hope to see more sophisticated GPTs and assistants that can achieve these goals in a way that reduces the workload for teachers and enhances the students' development.

Picture this challenge: guiding AI systems that outsmart human intelligence. It's like trying to keep up with a super-smart friend—tricky, right?

&#x200B;

[A simple analogy for superalignment: In traditional machine learning \(ML\), humans supervise AI systems weaker than themselves \(Left\). To align superintelligence, humans will instead need to supervise AI systems smarter than them \(center\). Open AI says they cannot directly study this problem today, but they can study a simple analogy: can small models supervise larger models \(right\)?](https://preview.redd.it/p1ic2ii51i6c1.png?width=2041&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a2922fd13876620616b74278d3c6d7a2d8d9339)

P.S. If you are into the AI world just like me then consider checking out [my newsletter](https://businessbloopers.beehiiv.com/). Back to the post. 

So, here's the cool part. The researchers tried something new, kind of like using a smaller buddy to guide a bigger, smarter friend. They used a GPT-2-level AI as the guide for GPT-4, and guess what? It worked! The super-smart model started performing closer to the level of GPT-3.5. It's like giving your friend a few tips, and suddenly they become a pro. 

Open AI says (to clear this up in case some of you got confused), ""We can significantly improve generalization in many settings. We use a simple method that encourages the strong model to be more confident—including confidently disagreeing with the weak supervisor if necessary. **When we supervise GPT-4 with a GPT-2-level model using this method on NLP tasks, the resulting model typically performs somewhere between GPT-3 and GPT-3.5.** We are able to recover much of GPT-4’s capabilities with only much weaker supervision.""

They go on to say that this is just a proof of concept with important limitations; for example, it still doesn't work on ChatGPT preference data. They found signs of life with other approaches, such as optimal early stopping and bootstrapping from small to intermediate to large models.

[Typical weak-to-strong generalization across NLP benchmarks: They use a GPT-2-level model as a weak supervisor to finetune GPT-4.](https://preview.redd.it/qhhu6zl65i6c1.png?width=1186&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cb7c26944bd2d683a50ba7a8887ba16a517c048)

What's really cool is that the researchers aren't keeping this discovery to themselves. They're sharing the secret sauce—the open source code for experiments with this guiding idea. Plus, they're throwing in a whopping $10 million to support graduate students, academics and other researchers to work on superhuman AI alignment broadly.",active,17,positive,0
18josyn,2,2023-12-16,Unraveling the Web of Words,u/the-fire-in-flame,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/18josyn/unraveling_the_web_of_words/,"Greetings, fellow educators of the English language,  
As I sit down to share a peculiar incident that unfolded in my English class, I find myself both amused and slightly perplexed. Today, I stumbled upon a revelation that brought into focus the evolving landscape of learning in the digital age. Let me regale you with the tale of a student, a tool, and a twist in the tale.  
In the midst of a riveting discussion on Shakespeare's timeless soliloquies, I noticed a student, let's call him Alex, immersed in his phone rather than the Bard's prose. Now, as any seasoned teacher would do, I approached Alex, ready to dispense my sternest lecture on the importance of paying attention. To my surprise, I caught a glimpse of an oddly familiar interface on his screen – Reddit, a platform I frequent to engage in discourse with fellow language enthusiasts.  
As I peered over Alex's shoulder, my eyes widened in realization. There it was, unmistakably: ChatGPT, the very tool I had been introducing my students to for honing their writing skills. Caught between a desire to applaud Alex's resourcefulness and a responsibility to maintain the sanctity of classroom discussions, I decided to probe further.  
""Alex,"" I asked, feigning innocence, ""what intriguing thoughts are you sharing with the Reddit community today?""  
Caught off guard, Alex stammered but eventually admitted to using ChatGPT to craft a post on the intricacies of Macbeth's character development. Now, while I couldn't help but commend his initiative to seek additional insights, I couldn't ignore the potential implications for his academic integrity.  
The story doesn't end there, my dear colleagues. Determined to unearth the extent of Alex's reliance on AI assistance, I delved into his recent essays. Lo and behold, the digital fingerprints of ChatGPT were scattered across his submissions like breadcrumbs through a forest.  
It dawned on me that while ChatGPT is a marvelous tool for enhancing linguistic prowess, it should be wielded ethically. As educators, it is our responsibility to guide our students in the ethical use of technology, fostering critical thinking and genuine engagement with the subject matter.  
So, here I am, sharing this tale of intrigue and discovery with you, my esteemed colleagues. Let it serve as a reminder that as we navigate the ever-changing landscape of education, we must be vigilant guardians of academic integrity, encouraging our students to tread the fine line between innovation and ethical conduct.

Everyone keeps saying jobs are going down and competition is going up (which is obviously true, the population of the world is rising, duh) but the PERCENT of competent SWEs, I believe, is the same. 

This is coming from a graduate teaching assistant that teaches a high level Object Oriented Programming course (one of the last undergrad courses students take before graduating). And let me just say… you can REALLY tell who took CSE because they saw it on Tiktok and the ones that even know about r/CSMajors.

Now that isn’t to say, I haven’t seen many incompetent people (that can’t even reverse a linked list) get FAANG jobs because of… reasons (I think most of you know someone like that). But, I promise you (cross my heart, hope to die) that it will not be hard to find a job if you don’t use ChatGPT and actually learn from your classes/mistakes.

After my graduation, I would like to work on one specific problem that was only superficially addressed in the previous literature. And now I have an issue: I don't know where to do actual science!

Of course, I thought about the academia. But I was following several projects in different labs and I noticed some strange patterns. First, since the KPI is about h-index and a number of papers, most of other criteria are ignored. You need to publish in a top venue, and that's it. This results that phd students with more trendy and less rigorous works are getting higher chances to stay in academia. Second, I noticed that (some?) people do not work on problems but they work for grants. For example, recently, I found out that one whole lab jumps closer to the LLM/ChatGPT topic, since it will be simpler to obtain a grant. The same happened with two other research groups I follow: they never really worked deep with LLMs (e.g., chatGPT) and now they write grant proposals with LLMs. Third, I can see that many postdocs don't have much time to do actual rigorous research: they write grant proposals, supervise students, chair conferences, write papers, teach, do networking. So, I ended up with the conclusion that for me the rigorous science would be hardly achievable in academia.

So, here is the question. I really want to solve one specific applied research problem. Should I consider making a startup? Or, should it be some form of non-commercial? What other forms can you suggest for doing rigorous research?",User_deleted,0,neutral,0
18knssp,5,2023-12-17,I'm frozen in indecision,u/L4ndd3ld,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/18knssp/im_frozen_in_indecision/,"Sorry for the length in advance but I wanted to be thorough.  


I've spoken to a lot of people about the issue I'm about to express and, to a person, they have all given me advice that simplified the problem or gave solutions that failed to address all the nuances of the situation.   


For length's sake, lets get right to the point:  

* I have been unemployed for 8 months now.
* I have a wife who is 16 weeks pregnant.
* My mother, who is 56, is dying in a nursing home and is suffering from dementia from an as of yet unknown source.
* I have a 15-year-old violent felony (a fist fight) on my record that cannot be expunged in my state, and there is no 7-year background check restriction in my state.
* I graduated in 2021 with my BS in Computer Science, yet am 38 years old (I wanted to change careers).
* I was a C student and would consider myself a mediocre programmer.
* I was born to a single mother, with a father that was not part of my life. My grandparents are dead. I have no extended family from which to ask for help.
* My family was always poor, and thus I have no intergenerational wealth to fall back on.  


 Now for the context: 

The state my life is in now all really started when I was 23. I got into a fist fight at a party in a small town of only 5000 people. We only have one local newspaper here, and thus the whole thing ended up on the front page of the paper. Between that, and the fact that I pled guilty to get probation and go home, meant that the charge of assault ended up being on my record forever.

This has always made it harder for me to get jobs. So, I did the thing everyone told me to do: go back to school and demonstrate my skills and my ""reformed responsibility."" I needed something that was skill-based and not highly regulated, so, on the advice of many, I chose computer science. I was told that programming was in high demand and thus would help to offset my record when people went to hire me.

Upon graduating, I immediately found that the story was more nuanced than that. As it turned out, all the ""in-demand"" jobs were for senior positions, and in most cases, the person who hired me would be younger than me. If all that wasn't enough, I found that having a record made it just as hard to get a programming job as anything else. I found that I would never be hired to work in a job that needs clearance, never be trusted to program for finance, healthcare, education, and almost every other one of the biggest industries in the country.

This whole process led me to work as a freelancer and for a few small local firms that needed a one-man-show kind of thing. All of these were temp gigs but nonetheless, for a moment, I was making a good living. I worked primarily on Upwork and made quite a bit of money for a year or so. I had thought that everything was finally working out for me, but then ChatGPT hit the market.  


Now I'm faced with a stark choice: 1) try to skill up and get into AI to stay relevant, or 2) do something else.   


Now, scenario  1 might seem like a no brainer but as I've said there are nuances. I said above that I'm a ""mediocre programmer"" and I meant it. What I mean by this is that I got my degree at a community college and was able to bypass much of the complex mathematics needed for programing. Essentially, I'm a code monkey. I've always struggled with math and failed college algebra 3 times before finally passing with a C.   


Now, I do believe that with enough time and effort I could learn the mathematics needed to get into AI, but where it would take others months it will take me years. I simply don't have the foundations that others already have in place.   


I've laid out a possible path for myself which begins on MIT's open course ware website and finishes at a university getting my masters in AI. But, this whole process I estimate will take about 3-4 years. Meanwhile, how do I eat and support my family?   


Scenario 2 is even more stark, as I have spent so much time and treasure even getting to the point I am now that I don't even know where to begin. Again, the felony thing really keeps me out of almost everything. Manually labor is all that's really left and my medical issues won't let me do much of that.   


Besides, if I'm really honest I don't want to do anything else. I was proud of making it as far as I have and won't even know where to begin if I switched careers now.   


In the end I'm up wracked with indecision and don't know where to turn to from here.

Here I wanted to share more specifics about my experience with each class, as well as my master’s project, working as a TA, and internships. 

# Specialization: Computing Systems

I planned to specialize in ML because that’s most relevant to my research interests, but I also wanted to make sure I learned OS, hardware, and algorithms for the sake of covering my CS basics. I settled on systems because, once I knew I was doing a master’s project, it let me graduate a little earlier.  

# Courses

## Fall 2021
**Artificial Intelligence (A):** This was a great survey of the field with well-defined projects and clear expectations. It took a lot of work on my part (20 hours per week on average), in part because it was my first exposure to a lot of the material, but it was ultimately manageable.  


**Network Science (A):** I love this class (I came back to TA for it), but it's a weird one. I think your math background is the main determining factor in how difficult this class is for you. I spent a lot of my TA office hours reviewing hypothesis testing, the different properties of distributions, and eigenvalues. Students should take the ""suggested background knowledge"" for this class seriously. The course page lists ""calculus, probability, linear algebra, and programming"", but I would add statistics as well. At the very least, read some blogs on t-tests and make sure you understand p-values if you never took a stats course.

## Spring 2022
**Grad Intro to Operating Systems (B):** As someone without a CS background, this was BRUTAL. I spent winter break working through K&R's ""The C Programming Language"" and Beej's Guide to Networking, but I really needed more prep time. I easily spent 30 hours a week on this class at times, just wrapping my head around C and the project requirements. I learned a ton though. Highly recommend for anyone who is coming from a non-CS background.


**Machine Learning (B):** I took the class with Dr. Isbell, so my experience is maybe less relevant now. The lectures do a good job developing intuition and the textbook gives you the rigor. The assignments were a bit of a nightmare for me, but by the end I had grip on how to think about applying ML models to real problems. I like the emphasis on data over models and that framework has served me well in my internships and research. 

I would NOT recommend pairing these classes. I knew it would be rough going in and I'm glad I got my toughest semester out of the way early, but this was a bad time.

## Summer 2022
**Applied ML research internship:** I got to do some cool applied NLP work before ChatGPT blew the whole field up, and I got to work at the intersection of where I used to be and where I was hoping to go. 

## Fall 2022
**High-Performance Computing Architecture (B):** Another must-take for those of us transitioning from non-CS backgrounds. Between GIOS and HPCA, I got a solid understanding of how computers actually work and got much more comfortable with C and C++. I found the projects much more manageable in this class and missed an A by just a fraction of a point. By this time, I started to realize I was interested in distributed computing as well as ML.


**Master's Project (A):** I spent this semester getting familiar with the codebase and writing documentation. Not exciting, but it was a good onboarding process. At the end of the semester, the new students all pitched project ideas. 

## Spring 2023
**High-Performance Computing (A):** Oh, how I loved this class. This is where I fully realized that algorithms are absolutely my jam. The parallel and distributed algorithms are maybe a little more mind-bending than what you learn in GA, but ultimately this class was kind of...easy? At least relative to my previous experiences. Part of it was that I'd already been thinking about parallelism and distributed computing in GIOS and HPCA, and part of it was that I was finally comfortable with C and C++. This was the first class where I felt fully and completely prepared and didn't have to do any self-teaching on the side to fill in gaps in my knowledge. It's not an *easy* class by any stretch, but it's very well-organized and no more difficult than it has to be.


**Master's Project (A):** The project I worked on at DILab relied heavily on NLP, and this is the semester when ChatGPT blew everything up. All plans went out the window and my project proposal was no longer relevant. Most of the team pivoted to incorporating this new technology while I focused on performance analysis. It was a little frustrating, but exciting at the same time. 


**Network Science TA:** This was my first semester as a TA! If you have the opportunity to do this for a class that interests you, do it. There is no better way to firm up your understanding of a concept than helping someone else understand it. This class leaves room for discussions about the big picture, too, which is a lot of fun as a TA. 

## Summer 2023
**SWE Internship:** I got lucky and was placed on a team doing distributed ML. I spent the summer building a prototype of a classification system that could scale up to huge training sets. This is exactly the kind of work I want to do in industry. This was also my first SWE experience and I loved it. Most importantly, I got a return offer!


**Master's Project (A):** I ran a preliminary study over the summer and “finished” my master’s project by submitting a plan for a Fall 2023 randomized controlled trial to measure the effect of the lab’s AI agents on student experiences in the classroom. Data collection just wrapped up this week, so I’ll be able to do the analysis and write up the paper soon. 


I didn’t think I could manage TAing on top of everything else, so I skipped this semester. This was a smart move, I definitely would not have had the bandwidth. 

## Fall 2023
**Graduate Algorithms (A):** Honestly, I wish there were more classes like this in the program. the material is challenging but I like the format a lot (lecture, problem set, rinse and repeat). It felt familiar (like an undergrad math class) and predictable, which let me focus on the material. 


**Software Development Process (A):** It’s not the most exciting class I took in OMSCS, but the lectures and projects are well-designed and, as someone who hasn’t worked as a SWE full-time yet, it was probably worth it for me. I got lucky on the group project and got placed on an awesome team. I mainly took this because I needed another core class to wrap up my systems specialization and I wasn’t going to pair GA with AOS. 


**Network Science TA:** Since my first semester as a TA, the class has been added to the ML specialization and was opened up to OMSA. That boosted enrollment a good bit and made the experience a little more stressful. Overall still a good time and I’m really glad I had this experience.",active,33,neutral,0

This blog post will cover on whether or not WriteHuman, an Undetectable  AI tool, can bypass popular AI detectors such as GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn. WriteHuman claims to be the world's most powerful AI humanizer tool. A big statement to say the least but we will test it out to see if what they claim is true.  Finally, we will compare WriteHuman against StealthGPT to see which undetectable ai website reigns supreme.  Here's what we will cover:What Are Undetectable AI Websites?What is WriteHuman?What is StealthGPT?Test PreparationWriteHuman Against GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItInStealthGPT Against GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItInFinal Thoughts 

## What Are Undetectable AI Websites?

Undetectable AI websites are platforms that use advanced artificial intelligence algorithms to create content—such as essays, articles, or reports—that is indistinguishable from human-generated material. They utilize sophisticated natural language processing and machine learning techniques to mimic human writing styles. This makes the content produced by these AI tools difficult to detect by algorithms designed to identify AI-generated text. These websites are particularly useful in scenarios where the authenticity and human touch in writing are essential, such as in academic settings, creative writing, or digital marketing. 

## What is WriteHuman?

WriteHuman is an advanced tool described as a powerful AI detection remover. It is designed to work seamlessly with plagiarism detection systems like Turnitin and ZeroGPT, among others. The primary function of WriteHuman is to help users maintain their online privacy and anonymity by supercharging their text to eliminate AI tracking and bypass AI detection. This feature makes it a valuable tool for those looking to create content that appears authentically human-written, avoiding detection by AI algorithms used in various online platforms and services​​.

## What is StealthGPT?

StealthGPT is an advanced artificial intelligence tool designed to generate written content that is undetectable by AI detection systems. It uses sophisticated algorithms and natural language processing techniques to produce text that closely mimics human writing styles. The primary aim of StealthGPT is to create content that bypasses the detection mechanisms of systems like Turnitin, which are designed to identify AI-generated text. This makes StealthGPT particularly useful in scenarios where the authenticity of human-like writing is crucial, such as in academic writing, creative content creation, and other professional fields where originality and the human touch in writing are valued. The tool is part of a growing trend of AI applications that blend seamlessly into human-centric environments, offering solutions that are both innovative and indistinguishable from human-created work.

## Test Preparation

We will use ChatGPT for our experiment. Let's take the content written by ChatGPT and place them to WriteHuman as well as StealthGPT. We will then take the content produced by WriteHuman and StealthGPT and place them against well known AI detectors.  Popular AI detectors such as GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn will be used for this experiment. We will provide images showcasing how StealthGPT compares against WriteHuman.  Finally, we will make a conclusion based on the experiment to see if whether or not WriteHuman actually works.

# Final Thoughts

In conclusion, it turns out that WriteHuman doesn't really work against major AI detectors such as GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn. Especially against GPTZero which saw over 91% AI written content. While WriteHuman achieved over 93% AI written on Originality, it's a large margin of AI detection which can be detrimental for students or professionals who want to avoid AI detection on their work. TurnItIn was no better at over 100% AI detection which proves that WriteHuman is not the best AI humanizer tools out there.

Comparatively, StealthGPT goes beyond expectations and achieved over 0% on TurnItIn and Originality with a slight 15% AI detection from GPTZero. It's clear that StealthGPT reigns supreme as the best AI humanizer platform out there currently.  

## StealthGPT: Write AI text, Get Human Results

[StealthGPT](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/) is currently the best Undetectable AI website out there, beating even TurnItIn. Check it out in here. If you are a highschool or college student looking for the best AI humanizer tool in the market then look no further. StealthGPT consistently beats GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn. It's simple, easy to use, and give you the assurance you need to make sure you stay undetected. StealthGPT is able to beat most AI detectors due to the way it was built from the ground up. We cannot speak to how WriteHuman was built but we are aware most AI tools are built with very simple prompts from OpenAI's GPT models. Unlike most AI tools out there, StealthGPT was built and trained on hundreds of hours of human styled writings that make it uniquely different from any other AI writing tool on the market. That is how StealthGPT is and continues to remain the best Undetectable AI on the market.

I'm not the best in my field, but I'm not the worst either. I told myself that by working hard, I could consider doing more and more web development and why not even fullstack later.  
  
However, I worry about the future of my job. I don't fear ""the big replacement"", but I realize that my work will be greatly devalued while in France, developers are already underpaid. It will be more and more difficult to get paid and a senior developer will be able to do the work of 3 junior developers with AI. This is even more so in the field of geomatics, where salary increases are only considered from the moment we touch on web or backend development.  
  
Many in my class would deny it, but I see it in the field: a lot of students in my class answer the exercises using only ChatGPT, and it's only a matter of time before companies say ""let's hire someone 'a less expensive and less qualified person who will be able to do the same work at bachelor's level rather than master's level'. Personally, I am impressed by this tool and have already completed projects using only ChatGPT.  
  
It made me very depressed a month ago. I realize that I may have made the wrong career choice. I worry about my financial situation and my financial future in general and I give a lot of importance to my pay.  
  
The field of geomatics is even more doomed to die when we see that ChatGPT can be integrated into QGIS or ArcGIS.  
  
Should I consider retraining in AI? I can't afford to redo my studies because I'm in France and I have to start contributing to my retirement. But I would like to train alone with personal projects. I came across this github which has some very good resources for learning AI: https://github.com/duncantmiller/ai-developer-resources. I have already done classification with Random Forest and SVM, as well as Python scripts in Natural Language Processing.  
  
I am in France. We are a little behind in the world of AI, but I have no doubt that it will end up developing more and more in a few years, and that jobs in the field will be more and more in demand.",User_deleted,0,neutral,0

The resources I have includes LinkedIn Learning and O'Reilly.  Along with this, LinkedIn Learning gives me 50% off on taking technical exams from famous companies like IBM.

Currently, I am preparing for AZ900 from Microsoft Learn. I keep chatGPT as my study guide for general questions/doubts I get while reading. It has helped me a lot. Other than that, I follow the [AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals Exam Quick Prep](https://learning.oreilly.com/course/az-900-microsoft-azure/9781800206175/) by Vijay Saini on O'Reilly. 

**Are these sources reliable (in terms of learning skills quality) and in demand?**

As soon as I get the above-mentioned cert, I will try to implement that learning through self projects.

I was exposed to Data Science a few 2-3 years ago. I liked the idea of Data Analytics; how systemic it works and my work would actually make sense and have purpose.   
At that time, I did not have any resource. Now, I have both time and resources. 

I have observed this a lot, many people are hoarding in CS field just for the sake of making money. Having genuine interest and dedication is also necessary I think.

However, my last period class can be pretty rowdy. The students don't make any comments that are rude toward me, but at the same time they don't listen. Usually, some students are standing and chatting randomly, playfighting/wrestling with each other, or on the phone while we do a lesson or activity. 

Today, it was particularly rowdy as they started interacting with students in the hallway, wouldn't listen to any instructions, wouldn't sit down, wouldn't keep quiet, etc. I try to stay pretty calm and even joke around with them for them to calm down, but they were still at it.

Near the end of the period, I actually got pretty upset with them and threatened to call their parents/guardians tomorrow if this continues this week. I gave them a mini lecture on behaviour and called them out on many other things I haven't been impressed with (using ChatGPT, not using work periods, gaming on their phone during a lesson, etc.). 

I really don't like doing this because sometimes I think ""what if I'm being too mean"" or ""what if they turn it against me now because I got mad""

They had to bring their discussion points to class, showing they were prepared, then broke into small groups to discuss the material together.  It was really great and I had a lot of fun teaching it.  

It wasn't perfect though, I knew not every student was reading their chapters and some would have bullet points entirely based on the first page of the chapter, but it was still a great way to keep the class engaged throughout the semester.

I'm trying to figure out how to have this translate into an online class though.  Online discussion boards tend to be full of fluff and little genuine engagement.  I think chatgpt would struggle to write effective discussion points based on the chapters I assign, but that possibility for cheating is still there.  It's easier for students to fudge and BS their way through pretending they knew what was in the chapters than being put on the spot to discuss the material together during class.  So building an entire course around having them read a book seems like a risky proposition for an online class.  I thought about incorporating chapter quizzes as well to verify they are reading, but the teaching online classes training we've been receiving is pretty clear on being opposed to multiple choice quizzes now for ""equity"" and ""academic integrity"" reasons.

Any other good ideas?  I would really like to have them read the book as I think they will get a lot out of it and its perfect for the course, but not sure if the old school seminar discussion format is suitable for an online asynchronous class.",active,1,positive,0

i am not going to lie, i have used it on every assignment so far this year. i am a profound, professional procrastinator… and if i can finish an assignment that would take me hours to do, and just have it finished in less than two minutes… i will.

i understand that you guys can EASILY scan it through a detector, but here is two problems.

1. detectors tend to be inaccurate, i ran an assignment where i have not type a single letter, and it did not detect any form of AI.
2. even if it does get detected, you can filter it through a paraphrasing site to make it undetectable.

now, if they were caught, how would you go about the situation? i mean, it isn’t plagiarism, really. even ChatGPT itself mentioned that using it’s generated text is not plagiarism and is fair, free use. so to fail the assignment would be a little counterintuitive. as you also cannot prove it was ran through AI as it generates a different, original text every time.

now, getting to the ethical side of this, how big of a problem does this seem to you in the world of education? in my opinion, to pass grade 11 english, not that big of a deal. but if you are in university becoming a doctor, this can turn out very bad, as let’s say.. you become a surgeon. you only achieved your degree via AI and you learned nothing, putting others life at risk.

if you were a student in todays age, would you use it?

edit: it appears i have started a war by this, which you guys have completely ignored my question. so i’ll ask again… if you were a student in todays age, would you use it?

you guys also seemed to ignore the ways i’ve mentioned the work-arounds, instead made baseless accusations of me. oh well, ignorance is bliss.",active,0,neutral,0

Is the main promise of these prompts that it just write more professionally? 

If so, I can totally see why I'm so unimpressed. Maybe I just had wrong impression on what these engineered prompts could do. But can new or better/more correct information be extracted with an engineered prompt?

My, and probably a lot of others', biggest gripe is that there's no way to know whether the information is accurate or not. Unless this prompt engineering helps with that.. to me it's just putting lipstick on a pig (so to speak, chatGPT is far from a ""pig"", but the notion of improving it with prompting definitely seems overhyped).

It has become infuriating and I don't know how to bring it up with my teacher as I talked to him about this (on our first test) after the cheating student asked if I wanted a link to a quizlet with the test answers. My teacher is very unorthodox, to say the least, he allows you to use ChatGPT and an A.I. he recommends as a source to help you understand material that is not stated in the textbook (such as the nativism Chinese immigrants faced). He achieves great AP scores and is a great teacher but I am worried that he will brush off what the student has done as merely a lie formed. Should I bring this up with the teacher or a principal? I don't want my teacher to get in trouble as he has no free period since he teaches three different AP subjects and has seven periods to teach (every single period besides a fifteen-minute lunch break). Some other students have told me I should let the student cheat and then completely bomb the AP exam due to his lack of studying, but he is still retaining a good GPA for work that he doesn't put effort into.

I'm a straight to the point kind of person so you're going to have to bash the info out of me if you have other questions since I sometimes lack creativity but here's my experience:

My History:
- Degrees in cyber and digital forensics.
- I did not go to a fancy school but found myself 1 of extremely few very proactive students and never had a mentor that knew what he was talking about cyber wise.
- Went to multiple CTF competitions in college.
- I took OffSec's OSCP course, certified in the WiFi hacking, and took ECCs CEH course & Web app attacks course (all during college so I never focused on testing).
- Job searched shortly but went into family business (non cyber related) for 5 years (COVID prolonged) so I have no ""working experience"". I thought refreshing my knowledge may help now that I'm restarting my job search.

What I Did:
1. Bought the Mike Myers Udemy.
2. Bought Jason Dion's 6 test exam question banks on Udemy.
3. I got the study book but sometimes I found myself rereading the same lines and wasting time. So after 2 chapters I quit reading and fully focused on the course. Played it at 1.25-1.5, and rarely, x1.75.
4. Test exams: I would do test 1 on day 1. Test 1 and 2 day 2, test 2 and 3 on day 3, etc.. I ALWAYS got ~75 in the test questions the first round and found myself constantly 2nd guessing myself. I would sometimes review my wrong answers and retest the failed test the same day. 2nd rounds I always got 80-100. By the time I got to test 6 I would restart test 1 on the same day since my memory of the correct answers would fade and represent ""better accuracy of performance"". As I got closer to when I wanted to test I ramped up how many tests I would perform but lowered the frequency the day before to keep my mind fresh. The day before, the only information I couldn't retain I reviewed the Udemy Mike Myers videos and asked ChatGPT to explain to me how to reason why a particular answer was correct or to define things I just couldn't grasp from Google or the Udemy videos.
5. As I failed or had difficulty with questions I would make notes and throw them onto an Excel sheet i.e. every question to do with unknown services or ports #s, encryption types, and had someone test me on them on a daily basis. <- this did not help me in the exam AT ALL (YMMV) but each day I added 1-3 more ports or encryptions/hashes with the sizes. It obviously helped me memorize them as each day I would be retested on the ones from before + the new ones.

Exam:
I ran out of time reviewing all my marked answers and  I had a lot of them. I did correct a few 2nd guessed questions and passed ~780. When others say skip the performance questions DO IT. I wasted time and rushed back to do them before reviewing my marked answers. I've seen some people ask about memorization and the test has nothing to do with that junk (in my experience). HOWEVER, based off my time in competitions I can vaguely remember the ports for SSH, Telnet, FTP, DBs, what they do, etc..

Although the practice tests represented the difficulty of the exam I found they were very much not so relevant in terms of material per se; again YMMV.

So, what would I recommend? Ive never done practice PBQs that I've heard some people discuss here and I did fine so, I can't say they'll be relevant as I've not consumed that content. But, you may want to do them anyway, along with Udemy Mike and JD test questions. YOU WILL NOT FEEL READY. For me, failing every test bank the first time didn't instill much confidence. You can only do test questions so much before you're answering off memory. Just take the test.

I listed my experience not to pupu on others but to illustrate you may need more or less time studying based off similar experience. I have crap memory, learn by doing, and even though it's been 5 years with fried COVID brain I did fine. If you don't have experience maybe take longer, and read the book too. 

Post Feelings:
If you got this far you read enough of my ramblings so I'll just summarize my feelings quickly. Despite being extremely happy that I passed and now have relief to move on to other projects to renew my resume, I feel like a wasted a bunch of time and money. That's just me, and sometimes you need the cert to buy credibility anyway, which is why I did it.

Good luck to anyone with future plans to take it! And don't worry if you can't make it your first time through, it wasn't made to be easy. Keep at it!",active,10,neutral,0

I mostly want to do research which perplexity is an expert in, since Ive heard that GPT with the browser plugin sucks. Will be doing a lot of research for school.  However, I would also like to learn math, and also have something proofread my works, does perplexity pro also excel in that? I also like how perplexity has both claude and gpt, I use both extensively, claude for writing and gpt for more instructional based prompts. 

Would also like to say that Im part of the student council, and claude has been a massive help for me in writing up project proposals, can perplexity pro do that as well? Or is it really more research focused.

Was wondering if which premium model I should invest in as a student? Help is very much appreciated!!",User_deleted,11,neutral,0

The decision raised quite a few eyebrows amongst my peers, but after a year, I can say I have little regrets.

Yes, the teaching load is heavy (3-3 as opposed to my previous 1-1), but the experience is incomparably rewarding. Grade grubbing is a non-issue. The students are driven and genuinely interested in their studies and so polite. Despite their packed schedules, they’re fully committed during class time, giving their all in every session.

The students are surprisingly open-minded and socially engaged. I've also observed various types of leadership. I've witnessed 20-sometime-year-old women, weighing around 50 kg, masterfully lead group projects alongside their gymbro peers. I've seen crew-cut guys from rural areas write thoughtful essays on sexual assault and harassment in the military. I've seen an entire classroom erupting in cheers when a student with a slight stutter completed an oral presentation. It has shattered my preconceptions. 

We're not immune to the challenges posed by things like ChatGPT, but the small class sizes (think 10 students, not 400) have allowed me to use other grading methods, including one-on-one oral exams.

It’s a different world here, and maybe one worth exploring. Like I told a friend,  I didn't manage to destroy the neoliberal university from the inside, so I decided to see what I could do with military education. ",User_deleted,110,positive,0

This type of thinking needs to vanquish and rid itself from mainstream discourse. It's the idea that we should all pack up our bags and go home because there is no future for humanity as AI will take over anything and everything. Elon Musk's Universal Income bullshit. 

It's the notion that all of math and science has been solved, the secrets of the universe have been solved and therefore there is nothing left for you and me to do. We should just quit now and not look back. 

**FUCK THAT** 

This is a defeatism that only benefits the elite class. Don't even try it because AI has already solved it. You're thinking about this over here. Don't, because it will be obsolete in 6 months. AGI is coming, AGI is here, what is AGI, wait for it, ASI. What the hell does any of it truly mean? 

Let me be clear, Matthew Berman, intentionally or not, is pushing a narrative that is very harmful that is being felt in TODAY'S society. You hear it in the whispers on this sub where people ask what should I tell my kids about their future. Where are the jobs? Reports coming out that AI is replacing jobs. Fear, FEAR, FEAR. 

Anecdotally, I can tell you that enterprise data is SHIT and is years away from even remotely being able to clean up their act to even reap the benefits of general AI today. Also, how many of you(engineers) are seeing in the workplace where managers are just spitting out low level GPT ideas and expecting them to be built in a ridiculously short timespan that when they then go to the users the users actually don't want or need the product? How many? Raise your hands. I see a lot of hands up. The ideas guy is not winning here. They're making things worse. If anyone is not needed...

You have kids that are finishing high school wondering should i go into computer science? Maybe not there's no future there. That is extremely HARMFUL. Should I become a data scientist? All of the work is now just a GPT API. That is extremely harmful as a bright young mind might be swayed to pursue something else other than their true potential. 

The narrative that Matthew Berman is pushing is FALSE and seems to have an agenda. I think him and people like him should be careful when promoting the **Doomerism by Proxy** narrative. 

He tries to clean it up towards the end by admitting it's not ""all good."" Funny after you just spent the huge chunk of the video saying the exact opposite. He posts this meme to gently, but failingly, roll back everything he just said; as if to say, ""with this huge grain of salt."" But then sadly says again, sorry to say this we're going through an explosion of AI coding and there will be ""no more programming.""

First, off he completely just contradicts himself over a 15 - 20 minutes span of the video.

Let's start here at about **5:30** into the video.

**BEGIN CONTRADICTION**

""TODAY Copilot can know and look over the entire context of the code base today."" FALSE

[https://youtu.be/ZV6Sz42l0hY?si=EXlK74b1pCaFRbSt&t=328](https://youtu.be/ZV6Sz42l0hY?si=EXlK74b1pCaFRbSt&t=328)

He states that copilot can span the entire code base and understand your entire code base. No it can't. lol. Go watch the plentiful videos showing that the current power of github copilot is an often annoying autocomplete tool. I've railed about this before but it is a wonderment why people keep shilling this over and over again. Hmmm. I wonder if there is an ""agenda"" related to MONEY?  Of course there is.

We'll get to that. TLDR: Low code/no code BULLSHIT and companies trying to capitalize on OBVIOUS capabilities directly into the core of OAI

Next, Matt Welsh: ""[Copilot is as if we had pong and then a month later we had red dead redemption 2](https://youtu.be/ZV6Sz42l0hY?si=6eqfufx3O_1CppxS&t=347)"". LOL WTF are you talking about? Who thinks that?

Who is Matt Welsh? Of course he is the CEO of Fixie.ai <<< this has to be the closest tool yet to being a direct siphon off of ChatGPT technology. It is literally a chatGPT passthrough proxy. Down to him reselling tokens for his service.

If this isn't the classic example of a wrapper project that will go BUST by next year I don't know what is. He is doing absolutely nothing innovative other than trying to resale you ChatGPT as a ""low code""/""no code"" tool set with a token price markup to boot.

The overall quote is just ridiculous.

The core **CONTRADICTION**

Today AI has A LOT OF LIMITATIONS. ONE OF THEM IS CONTEXT WINDOW LIMITATIONS.

[https://youtu.be/ZV6Sz42l0hY?si=TKND2\_\_eqc9ZgNP6&t=652](https://youtu.be/ZV6Sz42l0hY?si=TKND2__eqc9ZgNP6&t=652)

He's goes on for a huge swath of the video explaining why this is an issue and a current limitation but we'll get around that. I mean, did he think we would just miss that fact?

He even admits that most AI code bases want you to start from scratch and can't deal/iterate on existing code bases.

Other points of BULLSHIT

Next, Matthew has a new paradigm shift to programming that doesn't involve humans. They're just gone! [https://youtu.be/ZV6Sz42l0hY?si=XpKw0P91Of5FiUyh&t=837](https://youtu.be/ZV6Sz42l0hY?si=XpKw0P91Of5FiUyh&t=837)

What coding will look like in the future. Ahhh we're here again. The ideas guy. The human project manager. You're going to do research and talk to users right? P.S. why this is so funny and a great meme/joke is that A) we all have ideas. B) Most times PM's don't talk to users and or understand what the hell they are truly asking for from a business use case which could translate to a technical solution. They are glory hunters that often fail at their jobs. It isn't until the technical person is there to clean up the telephone game of nonsense. Often I find designers and UI/UX people to be of much more value along with actual USERS. IMHO.

Then Matthew, for some reason, brings up Amjad Masad and some complete bullshit hackathon that by the way has the video removed from Youtube for some reason. We'll get to that later. Which Amjad Masad person is this?

This guy. The Repl.it or now replit.com that is of this controversy. [https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/nuh2qj/how\_replit\_used\_legal\_threats\_to\_kill\_an\_interns/](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/nuh2qj/how_replit_used_legal_threats_to_kill_an_interns/)

and [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27424195&p=2](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27424195&p=2)

The entire point that story isn't really important it's about some kernel that an intern took to try and do their own thing. Not important. What is important is replit's business model. Low code / no code. That's what they're selling. Pay me this and I will spit out this boilerplate solution for you. Why Matthew seems to be underlyingly shilling this I don't know. Smells of money though.

Don't believe me? It's already happening Berman says. [https://youtu.be/ZV6Sz42l0hY?si=\_yd1S\_Gf76SsjC\_t&t=903](https://youtu.be/ZV6Sz42l0hY?si=_yd1S_Gf76SsjC_t&t=903)

Just look at the hackathon that Amjad Masad put on. Spoiler the human pm is the one who wins the coding challenge. Apparently and $10,000. Weird right! F\*\*\*\* Crazy if you ask me.

[https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1659423752881586176?lang=en](https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1659423752881586176?lang=en)

>At a hackathon where a winner is a “nontechnical” PM and her work — powered by Replit + AI — is more technically impressive than teams of engineers! Was surprised at first but it struck me that PMs must be exceptional prompting, afterall that \*is\* their job.

So with all of this, you might expect something amazing right? Nope.

[Here's the actual project that apparently won $10,000.00](https://twitter.com/pritopian/status/1659431102258507777) with a huge cardboard check. Interestly, when I tried to find the video about what was so amazing that was built. It was taken down from Youtube. I searched for it and found this. [https://devpost.com/software/doctok](https://devpost.com/software/doctok) docutok. The proud winner of how AI is going to blow the socks off of every engineer and programmers are going the way of the dodo bird.

Until you try and go to this link and hmm funny it's been removed. [https://youtu.be/WtGdyjZQMWc](https://youtu.be/WtGdyjZQMWc) I'm interested because I want to know what was actually built. Was it something amazing? Truly showing the power of engineerless future that Matthew Berman is prophesying? Hmmm?

https://preview.redd.it/jk6qtyqf438c1.png?width=2464&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc553c07175fa5ac6e87385bea413bd3697b8ebf

Well, i found the video on [LOOM.com](https://LOOM.com) Thank you loom. This was probably from the hackathon.

[https://www.loom.com/share/df8a242e87394ef3a3083415e8249368](https://www.loom.com/share/df8a242e87394ef3a3083415e8249368)

Now, I am not trying to criticize Priya the person who won because she did a thing. But let's get real here. What kind of hackathon was this? What was scope and direction and directive? I mean if it was just people putting together code examples with ChatGPT and Repl and nothing else the level of wow facts here is a 1. On any standard. With or without GPT. Just watch the video. What would you use that for? Was it a 10 minute hackathon? If was like most hackathons which are 24 or 48 hours I mean holy shit that's what was built?

This is literally what every engineer was tasked to do as soon as GPT came out by the ""ideas guy"" in every organisation. I guarantee you. Put in this doc and summarize it and do this. Lame. This could have been coded in 3 hours by an engineer not using GPT 4 other than the parts of the summary.

Also, in the video she says ""I programmed a few voice agents"" at the 3:03 mark of the video. She didn't say that she prompted out code with copilot or GPT or anything. Nowhere in the video. She literally even says she used to work at Microsoft so in the least her technical knowledge is at a high level. She only mentions in the video she uses GPT4. I don't know how much she programmed by herself or got code spit out from GPT4 and or copilot.

No coding abilities whatsoever? I don't know.

[But her reply which seems as a marketing stunt for Replit is this.](https://twitter.com/pritopian/status/1659435302723936256)

>Helllooo! I had a lot of fun building DocuTok with [@Replit](https://twitter.com/Replit) and a huge fan!📷 [@Replit](https://twitter.com/Replit) has collapsed the distance between a vision in my head and a fully functional product.

Frankly, this part of the Matthews video is the most cringe because it lays out this point that somehow the ideas guy is just going to spit out ideas and code bases without any need of an engineer.

To be fair Priya does seem like she is trying to take the idea somewhere and I applaud her for that.  [LICA](https://www.lica.world/)

However, A) many people are going to be getting into this space as we speak.  [Gen-2 by Runway (runwayml.com)](https://research.runwayml.com/gen2)  has a working product now. Probably won't be good until gen-3 but it's a great start.

Here's a good overview of all 3  [3 Incredible Text-to-Video AI Generators You Have To Try! (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLxNbLY12NM&t=6s)

What I will say is that why is there advertised VC backing for Lica and a hackathon that was using Replit and GPT with no human engineers but yet no product that is available still today? No alpha or beta product at all. Hmmm, I wonder if it's because they would need real funding and actual engineers to create the product?

I can assure you that the other 3 products are actively using real human engineers that have real product design and ideation with limited ""the ideas guy"" input.

The critiques and criticisms of tools like copilot are out there. They just don't get any full scale attention like the doomerism prophecies do. It's not this isn't good enough as of yet. It's beta test your ass off and just use it. It will mean the demise of you and your job function so I want YOU to USE it now. That's what's really being said here.

This was a smartass post about why you should be using copilot. And to be fair, you can but not a lot of developers feel this way. In fact to be fair it's a 60(against)/40(for) split in their interpretation of that post.

The damage potential is clearly laid out here by real people. It's not that it's not a tool worth having IT absolutely IS. I use it each and every day. But my knowledge of coding is vast and I know when GPT is doing something correct or wrong. I've already said that GPT is a true stack overflow killer and I stand by that claim. But until we get a true ASI agent this is nothing more than a TOOL in your toolbox. It will make you better and stronger. Not replaced.

He criticizes the the legacy media's incessant focus on a small group of AI proponents and calls for a larger debate. Matthew Breman is one of these people to me and this is my debate. 

The **REVERSAL CONTRADICTION**

Going back against all of that he spends the next moments show how this is all going to play out. Humans be damned. Doomerism by Proxy full steam ahead. 

Matthew again dives into an unfounded and simply ridiculous example of some hype bullshit he found on the internet. 

[https://youtu.be/ZV6Sz42l0hY?si=8JgivNQbLAiT2bWN&t=1088](https://youtu.be/ZV6Sz42l0hY?si=8JgivNQbLAiT2bWN&t=1088)

If Matthew didn't realize this is click bait trolling level 9000 I am questioning his skill level as tech bro at all. 

**The JARVIS from Mckay Wrigley Bullshit: TLDR IT'S FAKE**

Obviously, like the Google demo (that was fake) there is a lot of hand movement code bullshit going on here. To give the credit he did the Google demo misdirect before Google even had a chance to do theirs. LMAO. I mean can none tell what's going on here? He's literally showing another computer with GPT running on it. I don't even think at this time GPT even had voice and it's not on anything other than mobile. 

Because we all KNOW this is not how latency works for GPT4. F\*\*\* AT ALL. He says in the video he optimized some speed things. Just wow. [https://youtu.be/ZV6Sz42l0hY?si=8JgivNQbLAiT2bWN&t=1088](https://youtu.be/ZV6Sz42l0hY?si=8JgivNQbLAiT2bWN&t=1088)

This IS OBVIOUSLY FAKE people. This is the fraudster marketing that people use to get clicks and funding. 

He obviously kicked off a Github action to get the codebase built. I don't believe for a moment that GPT built anything in this crazy demo because A) he was obviously using a Siri voice over trick thing and B) He's not even using an Azure or OpenAI development account to actually build something like this. 

Meaning, you could actually build something like this but not in the way that he prompted it at all and have it working as a code release. It's complete and utterly bullshit. This is the type of nonsense that Silicon Valley is priding itself on now? 

All his links to any of his work is all sign up and get interested. I can tell investors this is a great idea because I have 100 signups type of thing.

The **Final Contradiction**

Is it still worth learning to code? Yes. Lol. I can't even keep up anymore. [https://youtu.be/ZV6Sz42l0hY?si=5nH-UX320BrIrfud&t=1457](https://youtu.be/ZV6Sz42l0hY?si=5nH-UX320BrIrfud&t=1457)

I really wish people like him would stop thinking this way as it is not useful. True innovation and problem solving will be a thing until a true ASI is achieved. I believe the tools will get better and stronger and this is an interesting time. But don't tell your kids not to learn to code or not learn about computer science or data science. It is still as viable as it ever was and will continue to be so.

18pfnnp,3,2023-12-23,"What are your thoughts on using AI detection (e.g., Turnitin) in academia?",u/GenomeWeaver,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/18pfnnp/what_are_your_thoughts_on_using_ai_detection_eg/,"I am curious to know about everyone's thoughts on AI detection tools being used in academia. Turnitin especially seems to give false positives and cause a lot of problems for completely innocent students lately, and several universities have stopped using Turnitin's AI detection feature.

I attempted to compile the abstracts or introduction sections of approximately two dozen random PubMed papers into a single document and submitted it to Turnitin to assess for false positives. I was initially surprised to observe over 90% AI detection, with most paragraphs being flagged entirely as AI. The majority of these papers were written before any language AI models were developed. The results were pretty much the same with other popular AI detection tools such as originality.ai, gptzero.me, copyleaks.com, or zerogpt.com.

But this started to make sense when I recalled that language AI models are trained using precise and high-quality human written text. These articles are the foundation of what they use to train the language models. Therefore, AI detection algorithms may very well detect accurate and precise human written text, especially when it is error-free and the sentences are well-structured. I later even found articles claiming that AI detectors ""don't work.""

The problem seems to exponentially increase as the precision and accuracy of the text increases. Try submitting the abstract sections of random papers to the tools I mentioned, or try writing some precise paragraphs conveying scientific information. As a molecular biologist, I get generally more than 80% detection when I do this. This, in my opinion, is quite concerning.

Therefore, I have negative thoughts on this issue. I would want to know what everyone thinks and whether my thoughts are valid. It leaves me in a great dilemma when my students have a high AI percentage in their reports and assignments, which is usually the case. I do not want to be unfair in any way, either by falsely accusing them of plagiarism or by ignoring instances of plagiarism. It might not be considered plagiarism if acknowledgment and citations are provided, but students cannot do that since we restrict the usage of AI.

If you ask me for a solution, I have none. Thus, I am in need of help. What could be done about this issue? I am open to innovative ways, but I believe that students should write their essays/reports themselves so that they can learn.

The challenge is choosing the appropriate and most fitting specialization to continue my career.

+ I tried to make it as structured and organized as I can, I hope It's clear and not so messed up.
+ I'm not a native English speaker so excuse the mistakes.

### Background

A little background about myself, I was born and raised in Algeria, a relatively poor country in the north of Africa, I was my entire life a grade A student who thrived academically, and with minor efforts, but not for once was there a subject or even a talk for proper career orientation or college major choice during my 12 years through primary school, middle school, and high school. We were expected to figure it out on our own, by the time we get to our last year in high school and before passing our BAC exam. Most students were either forced by their parents into a college major, chose one randomly, or took another person's experience as a reference that is always true. The average on that BAC exam is what decided The choices you're offered and the priority you're given to get into one of the majors you chose. For top notch students like me it was always between medical school or engineering in one of the prestigious institues of the country. Anyway, when I got to my high school graduation year and before passing my BAC exam I started conducting some research and I finally decided to et into Computer Science as my college major, and I'm glad I did. I joined one of those prestigious institues I mentioned earlier (Higher School of Computer Science), and in my first few weeks I faced two main problems:
1. Academic difficulty gap between high school and college, so suddenly it required much more effort to be one of the best student in my batch.
2. Noticing the talent gap between me and other extremely skilled students who seemed to have started playing around with computers and code editors since the age of 10.
These two problems led to a lot of stress, feeling of being late in my career advancement, fear of missing out on things, and a lot of self doubt, which I now know was all unnecessary and ridiculous. I also started being biased by those extremely talented people, in other words, if that person was good at something, and was good at making it seem cool, I would think to myself that hell yeah, this is what I'm doing with my life, which was where I fucked up the most.

I eventually started experimenting with some specializations like web development, cyber security (mostly by playing CTF competitions), and graphic design.

The self doubt and bias I encountered were some of the reasons I kept jumping from one thing to another, without actually getting a deep view into any of those fields, just to satisfy my need to be as good as other students. This led to two things:
1. Wasting my first two college years in jumping from one thing to another, without actually fully experimenting and getting a deep understanding of the field and building real projects in any of those things.
2. Delaying the talk of what I ACTUALLY want to do with my life, so there was never an unbiased opinion in my head of what specialization I want to get into.

Now I moved to France, and I'm actually redoing my 2nd year in college in one of the french universities (which is something you have to do, you can't continue to 3rd year directly), and I'm still facing the same struggle. Fortunately it's in a much less severe way, I overcame the feeling of having to be as good as everyone else in my batch, and I'm also conducting a lot of research, asking a lot of people, about the potential career paths that might be good for me.

### Things I believe to Be True

1. In order to stand out in the job market and be one of the best people in what I do, I have to start learning, practicing, and building projects from now.
2. I'm pretty damn late regarding the first point, given that I haven't started building a profile and a name yet.
3. Most of my time should be dedicated to learning things about that one particular specialization, because it will give better results in the end. Which leads to me thinking that I should have as little hobbies as I can.
4. Sometimes, even when you do everything the right way, you still don't get to where you want, which is quite scary.

### Important Things to Know About Me

I believe myself to be smart, creative, innovative, and a very fast learner (sorry if this sounds like I'm bragging or something because I'm really not). I like to be recognized and appreciated for the good things I do. I am quite biased when it comes to this particular struggle (choosing a career) by my close friends and the people I love. I have a huge fear of missing out on things, for example in this case, I tell myself what if I choose this path but in reality the other path was more fitting for you?

I am a bit of a perfectionist person (which is why I'm struggling anyway). I want to find the absolute perfect thing for me to do, which I know is impossible but also fail to believe.

I want in the future to lead my own projects and startups.

I like to manage and lead people. The ideal thing that I see myself doing in the future is leading a group of creatives and developers to solve everyday problems, using my creative and technical skills.

I have a small experience in brand identity and visual identity design, I have been doing it intermittently in the past two years and had some clients. For someone who hasn't dedicated so much time to doing it I'm somehow good at it, and I really like it. I don't consider design a career path but more of a side hustle, and definitely a skill that will help me in the future, when it comes to building brands or launching startups. It can also be my creative gateway when things get too technical in my everyday life, or some tool I use to express my ideas.

I studied some web development concepts and built small projects over the past two years, so far I have dealt with HTML, CSS, JS, Tailwind, React.

I played some CTF competitions (3 or 4) and done good in most of them.

I want to start making money through freelancing or part time jobs in the next 1-2 years.

### Main Point

After doing some research on the things I have discovered so far, I found myself leaning to one of the following career paths: full-stack Web Development, and Cyber Security engineering or Pentesting. I will in the following sections discuss what I like and don't like about each of those career paths.

I was introduced to web development before joining college with a month or so, I was moving slowly but steadily in one of the online courses I found (freecodecamp). I liked it, but soon after I started focusing less on the course. In the months that follow it was an on again off again type of thing. I made some small projects in my first two years in college, and I really enjoyed it. Web development is much more available for freelance opportunities than most other CS fields, and companies also hire remote workers frequently, which is an advantage in my opinion. Skills acquired in web dev are applicable in many other software engineering fields, or even entrepreneurship. I can create a website for any idea that I get, making it a very creative field which suits me pretty well. Simply my heart leans to web dev than any other field. BUT, I still have some problems with it. Lately I have noticed that a lot of people have been getting into web development and not so many positions are open, which increases competition and make it harder to get an entry level role. The rise of AI and drag-and-drop website builders may impact heavily the need for big web development teams in the future, I'm not saying all web developers will be replaced by chatgpt, but the number of devs required per company will drop. It's not as exciting as cyber security roles (offensive side), and not as mentally challenging, meaning not everyday is an opportunity to learn new things. Not something I see myself doing for the next 10 years, at some point I would like to either switch careers, to something like AI or cyber security maybe, or move to a management position. Doesn't offer opportunities for academic research.

For cyber security I was introduced to it by one of those highly skilled people I met during my first year in college, ironically I discovered later that the guy was just trying his best to look talented while in fact he really wasn't. Anyway, I started by solving chalenges in platforms like PicoCTF, and participating in online CTF challenges, which I loved. CTF competitions made me realize that the person in me that likes to solve puzzles after being mentally challenged  and after doing a lot of research and learning so many things was really drawn to cyber security. Maybe that was a mistake, since most cyber security roles aren't really similar to CTF challenges (maybe only the offensive roles but still not as similar and exciting). Another thing that I like about cyber security is that it's really technical and mentally challenging, and it presents new things to learn everyday. There's a big skill shortage in the job market, and not enough talented people to fill in those gaps, so with enough effort put over some time, it will be easy to land a high paying job. It will acquire me skills that are really cool and allow me to do great things, but can't be used in other fields. Moving on to what I don't like about cyber security. Fist thing is that there's little to no coding, I've seen many videos on YouTube for cyber security analysts that insist on the fact that they're not coders, and I particularly don't like that because coding is one of the things I enjoy the most about CS. Networking is big a part of cyber security and unfortunately I find it really boring and not enjoyable. It's more of an IT subfield than it is a CS subfield, which I don't like as well. Less opportunities for remote work and freelancing than web dev. If I specialize in cyber security I would like to be a Pentester, which is not really available for entry level jobs, unlike roles like Cyber Analyst. The biggest advantage I'm seeing for cyber security is how unsatisfied the job market is and how much talented people are needed, so given I put enough time and effort in it I will land a high paying job in a short time.

### What Do I Want to Know?
+ Am I being too hard on myself? and making this problem bigger than it should be?
+ How real are the things I mentioned about both web dev and cyber security?
+ How real are the things I stated in the ""Things I believe to be true"" part?
+ I've seen a lot of Linkedin profiles for people with cyber security roles who started their journey by being web developers, is that a common thing?
+ What do you believe is the most fitting specialization for me?
+ What are your insights and advice on this topic?
+ Can I combine the two and still be really good at both of them?
+ Is it a good idea to specialize in web dev and keep CTF competitions as a hobby?
+ Should I still discover more CS fields before I make my choice?
+ If anyone has had the same struggle before, I hope you can share how you overcame it.

&#x200B;

I don't know if you've noticed your inbox recently, I've certainly received some interesting emails from organizations I've never heard of, but are certainly trying to get a foothold into the next ""AI revolution."" I thought only the deep learning folks got these types of emails, but seems I am not immune from basking in a bit of the limelight from the rest of the community receiving their 15 minutes of fame.

&#x200B;

Rather than sending them to the spam folder like I should, I made the bold decision of answering some of them to see where the conversation would lead. Certainly there are the usual organizations trying to get an inside peek into what I'm working on and how they can leverage it for their own goals. Buried among the other emails like this, are emails from those who ignored the deep learning hype bubble as one should, but are now suddenly interested as machine learning is a technology ready for productionizing for commercial reasons.

&#x200B;

Like I said, it was the best of times, it was the worst of times.

&#x200B;

I hardly noticed when ChatGPT made the front pages of Time magazine and some of the people I knew started cashing out their stakes, monetary or otherwise. There are a few ways one can beat the market, at least from what my finance friends tell me, and timing the peak is one of them.

&#x200B;

When one of the students I know presented their research work leading to a thesis, I tried to see if ChatGPT could muster sufficient intelligence to craft an introduction to a reasonable thesis proposal. No luck. It's just ELIZA with a bigger database of responses and more clever at fooling you into being convinced of its intelligence.

&#x200B;

I feel like one of the old timers now, watching bubbles and hype waves come and go. Still content working on what I enjoy with its consistent and predictable rate of return like a government bond. Sadly, I am a confidant for many depressed individuals both senior and junior lamenting the lack of progress in their careers since the fateful year of 2012.

&#x200B;

Alex, Ilya, and Geoffrey. Their brief sojourn into corporate ended in giving up on machine learning, fired, and giving up on life, respectively. I hope the three of you enjoyed the revolving door.

&#x200B;

Far be it from me to disrespect an engineering discipline, especially one so lucrative as deep learning. To do so would be to insult the history of computing as a discipline, both on the short and the long scale. If anything, I would meekly raise an objection whether the discipline is being misrepresented as something more than what it is. There's no silver bullet in computer science, except maybe a one-page proof of how P is not equal to NP.

&#x200B;

So where was I? Oh yeah, a confidant.

&#x200B;

Surprisingly, every field except the field of machine learning is happy. It seems that every field from database, programming languages, systems, security, and even theory can see deep learning for what it is. I'm just going to say deep learning, as I'm too lazy to say deep learning/reinforcement learning every time. The mechanism of improvement for both is the same.

&#x200B;

Considerable engineering discipline and effort went into the revolution. The revolution was televised. Now it's time to face the music. What's the source of the improvement... is it the algorithms or the hardware? I suppose we will never know, but certainly the CEO of Nvidia and Satya seem very pleased with themselves. Oh Satya, to have such centralization of power. How you are the envy of tyrants and dictators throughout history.

&#x200B;

Now for the tragedy of my colleagues who thought to resist the revolution. I say to you, Nuts! It has been a decade of marginalization as paper after paper is churned out. All non-sycophantic reviewers slowly succumb to the prevailing beliefs, or are otherwise pushed out or silenced as non-believers. The sad truth is, the numbers are against us. It's simply impossible to push against the axiomatic system on which academia is built: citations and publications. They have more than us. As many of my vanguard colleagues defend their right to fight to the last man or woman, I espouse the view that it's not worth it. This too shall pass.

&#x200B;

So as we are all in the holiday spirit and I see the bells toll. The senior leadership of deep learning is going through a phase of, ""don't let the door hit you on the way out."" The Andrew Ngs of the world are pivoting faster than you can say ""iceberg!"" All of my esteemed colleagues are heading for the exits with their stock options and awards in hand. Schmidhuber is licking his lips with a foreboding sense of, ""I'm not locked in here with you, you're locked in here with me!"" What are we to think and do?

&#x200B;

Who are the winners and the losers? What will the road ahead be like? I'm always one for collaborative discussion, but here's where my money is on for the near future:

&#x200B;

Shareholders of MSFT and NVDA

It's a close one between this and the next item on the list. Safe to say, incorporating significant advances in machine learning into a programming and engineering discipline is no small feat. My colleagues who have been holding since 2014 are, well, it's hard to see them behind all the ferraris and mansions. My colleagues who have been holding since 2018, well they'll have to settle for the porsches. The road ahead is still bright, but the discussion has turned into which frameworks, which development paradigms, and which algorithms. I can hardly distinguish those discussions from the C/C++/Java/C#/Win32/Vim/Emacs discussions of old.

&#x200B;

Baidu, Alibaba, Huawei et al.

A deeply incestuous relationship between technology and governance structures. I'd say more, but my colleagues advise me discretion is the better part of valor.

&#x200B;

The customer

The customer may not always be right, but they're often very happy. I don't think anyone cares how the sausage is made. ChatGPT is a great tool, and consumer focused applications are expanding rapidly. Me, personally, after learning how to use the damn thing, I've been able to get insight into open problems that have been bothering me for years. I don't think, even I, as critical as I am, can be unhappy for too long after that.

&#x200B;

The Andrew Ngs of the world

He grows on you. By the time you have him figured out, he's already on the next train having caught the next wave and saying, ""surf's up."" Hang ten, my dude.

&#x200B;

Machine learning graduates between 2010-2016

The start and end dates are approximate. Certainly there's some sort of Gaussian here over the dates on the reward distribution. Certainly there's a long tail. Everyone I know in this group has a bright future in a senior position within a technology company.

&#x200B;

Other communities in computer science and quantitative disciplines

Yeah, deep learning is a great tool. Don't need to understand it to use it. The publishing output and overall satisfaction from my colleagues in this area has been very positive.

&#x200B;

Prompt engineers/researchers

This area still looks very promising. For me, using LLMs as an environment to do your research on will give many dividends in the future.

&#x200B;

Interpretability, ethics, and explainability

I've lumped the three together, since the group that does them tend to overlap. Out with the GDPR anxiety, in with the AI Act anxiety. In the past, I may have had more harsh words for this group, but, well, age tends to mellow everyone out.

&#x200B;

Long term vision researchers, even in machine learning

This one is hard to evaluate. They're still kicking around, hardly noticing anything to do with ChatGPT or whatever the kids are calling the next new thing these days.

&#x200B;

Computational Learning Theory people

I mean, even when it's bad it's not so bad, right? Plenty to do. Many interesting and challenging problems are presenting themselves.

&#x200B;

Theory of Computing people

Yeah, losing a bright student to machine learning sucks. What can you do?

&#x200B;

The ""get off my lawn type""

Yeah, what can you do? Just have to figure out a time to move on and get with the times.

One of the most intriguing developments is the use of artificial intelligence, particularly ChatGPT, to revolutionize how learning is delivered and absorbed.

ChatGPT, with its advanced natural language processing capabilities, can offer personalized learning experiences, adapt to individual learner's needs, and provide instant feedback, which is invaluable to both educational institutions and companies looking to upscale their training programs.

In an educational setting, imagine a classroom where each student has access to a personal tutor, a virtual one that's powered by ChatGPT. This AI can gauge the student’s understanding, clarify doubts, and even challenge them with complex problems tailored to their learning curve. It's not just about personalized attention; it's also about creating an inclusive learning environment that addresses various learning speeds and styles.

Switching gears to corporate training, ChatGPT can be a game-changer here too. It can simulate real-world scenarios, walk employees through new protocols interactively, and serve as a round-the-clock resource for learning and development. This results in a workforce that's not only well-trained but also continuously improving through adaptive learning strategies.

This approach to training and education not only scales with ease but also provides rich data on effectiveness, learner engagement, and areas of improvement. It can transform how outcomes are measured and ensure that learning is a continual process rather than a one-off event.

The writer is a current senior at SNHU, juggling online courses and assisting in their family's pizzeria since opening 5 months ago. Despite working around 60 hours per week and completing the workload of two regular semesters so far, they feel they're falling behind in LeetCode and programming skills. Struggling with medium-level problems and applying concepts like DFS, they worry about their competitiveness in the job market. Graduating in August with one internship, they express concern about competing with candidates from prestigious companies and top 50 schools. Despite diligent efforts, they've received rejections and question their viability as a candidate. They desire a software engineering role with a $65k salary and work-life balance. Their LeetCode stats and three recent side projects showcase technical skills and application of programming languages like React, .NET, MySQL, Django, and C#.

///////

I am just now a senior doing online school with SNHU. I am a first gen college student and my parents recently started a pizzeria which I help out at (5yrs experience from mid/high school days). Over the last 5 months that we've been open I've been working \~60hrs a week and have completed 2 regular semesters worth of school work on an over loaded schedule (3 full courses over 2 months at a time). I have regular downtime which I do homework/side projects/leetcode but I feel like I'm falling behind in leetcode and even general programming skill now. I struggle with mediums and while I know DS&A, applying the concepts like DFS to misc problems is difficult and it takes me a long time to make the connection on how to use it.

I graduate in August with 1 internship under my belt (no name 1-10 member company) and feel like I'm not going to be able to get a job at all. I see people with FAANG experience, companies freezing entry/new grad hires, leetcoders with 200+ problems and t50 schools...like there is no way I can compete with that. Even I would toss my resume away if I saw some of the candidates I've seen on here struggling to get work. Which makes sense because I religiously receive rejections.

How do I know if I am falling behind and not a viable candidate, it feels like I am not going to be considered for any roles. I've been applying since June 23' and have spent hours revising my resume using other peoples resumes and the r/EngineeringResumes wiki. All I want is a SWE role with a min $65k salary and decent WLB. I want to work hard and get there and could use some guidance on where to focus my efforts.

**Leetcode stats:**

\- 46 easy completed

\-15 med (2-3 solo, the rest with help)

\*\*Side projects (3 most recent \~5-6mo, all fully functional and in use with low user count):\*\*ProfitGuard:  ProfitGuard is an internal profit management system. The goal is to allow my parents pizzeria to increase the net profit without a large investment into marketing to spike sales. ProfitGuard allows users to create an item category, steak, and then add items tied to that category with specific data like cost, sale price, orders per case and vendor. It will then compare items of the same category and compile a list that contains the most profitable items from the respective vendors. It will also show users their inventory total cost, total profit and, gross value.

ATK: ATK is built using Django, a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. The tool is integrated with various modules and functionalities, including user authentication, forum post creation, and deletion. Users with staff privileges can manage posts effectively. ATK allows upper management to easily create dynamic daily tasks that can be viewed across different in store teams. This has helped lower the failure rate of certain tasks that get lost throughout the day.

I can do basic math okay and I will probably be able to pass classes like algebra and probability and statistics but discrete math, calculus, physics, etc. would be a lot and even when I took pre-algebra I had to study for months to finally get the concepts down to be able to graduate high school and get some type of diploma).  
  
I am 21 years old and currently a cybersecurity student but I've realized slowly over the time with working, interviewing, and pursuing my degree that I really don't like the constant fast pace metrics customer service environment of IT (I don't mind talking about direct straight-forward issues/topics, but when it comes to complicated issues it's very hard to deal with that day in and day out combined with the constant talking over the phone), but I did take and graduate from the front-end web development ""bootcamp"" from freeCodeCamp awhile back in around 2022 (learned HTML/CSS, and some JavaScript but really only HTML/CSS in-depth).  
  
The only real stuff I've ""coded"" myself is very basic HTML example pages that someone helped me with and told me (in their own words) that my code was looking ""rough"", and a survey I made with HTML and CSS as well, the rest were either copied code or a mixture of copied code and my own code that I have from memory (but more copied code than my own I would say).  
  
I also participated in my schools hackathon online... and it was an experience let's just say (went way in over my head with all of the technology used, hard to get instructions since it's not in person, and I only lasted 10 minutes before tapping out after pure embarrassment because I also had to share my screen/files and one of the titles was super embarrassing... in a huddle teams room of like at least 3-4 other people and the instructor.  
  
The good news is though that I am not horrible when I put time into things, I am pretty good at PowerShell scripting (although I suck at Linux scripting), and basic Python scripting as well as some coding that I've done creating password managers, port scanning, and simple games like rock, paper, scissors (I would link my GitHub and CodePen but that would reveal my personal info which I am not comfortable with sharing).  
  
Anyway with all of that being said I have thought of switching my degree (probably switching online schools as well since the current schools structure isn't for me), to either computer science (nervous about the math), or either a straight up IT degree (with a software development concentration possibly) while learning coding on the side.  
  
I am just worried about my fears and where to start (I imagine I would have to start from the ground-up with learning HTML and CSS all over again, and possibly JavaScript if I have to), besides that I just am not sure what resources to use since freeCodeCamp was okay for me but it got kind of confusing and The Odin Project looks awesome.. but once again it gets confusing with little direction/guidance from outside support, and the only other resources I can think of are w3schools, youtube tutorials, and chatGPT (bootcamps are also too expensive for me and are like 10k and I really can't afford much at all, even books unless they're free downloads online).  
  
Looking forward to hearing everyone's thoughts and words of wisdom, thanks.

18schr2,3,2023-12-27,Two Problems in the American High School System I've Notices After My 3rd Semester,u/yoshi8869,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/18schr2/two_problems_in_the_american_high_school_system/,"Hi. I'm new to the community, but I recently got into a back-and-forth on a YouTube channel with a very conservative guy. I'm rather left-wing on all issues, but he and I reached a unique accord, so I wanted to open it up to others and find a forum where I could expand the topic to a larger audience. I hope this is the right place for it. Feel free to share your own experiences or thoughts!

The topic was largely over assessments (grades) and a lack of structure in the high school system, though originally it was just a blanket statement of ""what's wrong with our public schools"".

ACADEMIC PROBLEMS:

So, when I first started teaching, I had my kids (11th grade U.S. history) write essays. Every essay was the same: Provide the causes and effects of a particular event and then explain, in your own words, why we consider this event to be ""significant"". The only thing that changed every unit was the event. I even gave them a list of 3 events every unit to CHOOSE from.  
  
What I got back was extraordinarily subpar. Some students really did excel, but it was maybe 2-3 total across all 90 kids in all 3 of my U.S. History periods. I scaled it down to just ""short answers"". I also forbade anyone from writing these essays online--good thing I did, because ChatGPT made that even worse today. They write everything by hand in my class now during exam day without ANY devices. I still feel like I'm short-changing them, but the fault lies at the elementary English level. Too much of early education, I feel, is about ""coddling"" the child to success instead of challenging them to get there.  
  
I'd nearly lost faith in the system, and I nearly quit my job after my first semester. The bright side of the story is that I also teach Honors-level World History. Two kids in particular went above and beyond in that class and restored my faith in my career path. I credit both of those kids with single-handedly preventing the utter weight of the broken education system from collapsing down on me. Because of them, I kept the essay writing in my World History classes, and I still use it now. While my best class (with those two kids) is long in the past now, I still see around 30-40% of my kids do quite well on the essays each unit. In fact, the essay structure/prompt is identical to what I used to do in my U.S. History.  
  
I was also fortunate that those two kids liked me as much as they did, because their friends told their other friends and so on it expanded that I was a ""popular"" teacher in the building by the end of my first year. The administration, I believe, sees me as an asset now. Students often choose to be in my class. I don't say this to gloat, but to point out that I can now get away with a LOT more--in a good way. My philosophy on education is now: I am going to push these kids to succeed, but if they don't put in the work, they will fail. If parents or admin want to chew me out for it, I can find a job elsewhere. I have leverage now.

However, my kids can still choose skip the final exam if they have a C- or higher at the end of the semester and have missed not more than 3 classes in the semester (required by the school board), which is such grade A bullshit, I tried to take it up with the school board, but the vice principal told me I have no case, so I chose to back down.  
  
While I'm extremely proud of my work, I know I'm just a drop in the bucket. The real existential problems lie at the foundation. Elementary education needs to be stricter in how it approves or denies people for that line of work. Too many ""babysitters"" and not enough ""teachers"" are educating our youngest children. They're just learning to be ""polite"" and not how to ""read and write"". Especially with the lack of education during the COVID gap, it's only going to be worse for us secondary educators to teach Gen A.

STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS:  
  
I also believe my high school (and maybe others) struggles from a lack of structure and discipline. Students are allowed to just not show up to classes in certain circumstances and leave campus entirely in the middle of the day (called ""flex"" periods). My best and brightest kids are still teenagers at the end of the day, and I know one of my former students chose to leave campus and shoot an old musket at his friends during his 4th period this year.

He often gets up to no good when left alone, which I knew well while teaching him (a 4.0 student, mind you). He suffers from lack of structure, and while he can be as chaotic as he wants after school hours (though I go the extra mile to dissuade him when he tells me about it), while we're responsible for him, we shouldn't be allowing him to go do things that'll get him arrested during school hours. The lack of structure just encourages him to do whatever he wants, which is the exact OPPOSITE dynamic I tried to provide him while he was in my class. I gave him structure, discipline, and strict expectations, and he relished in it. It was like he was seeking out the structure. His behavior improved and he matured, but now I see him regressing due to an abundance of teachers that don't teach him and let him not come to class and buzz off to the forest and do God-knows-what.

POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS TO BOTH:

What I propose to be done is to increase regulation across the board.  
  
Master's degrees used to be required--they still should be. Districts should also receive more money in the form of categorical grants that are to be put to specific purposes. Money also should NOT be withheld or reduced toward districts that are struggling more. That only reduces the chances for those children to succeed. I work in a VERY poor, rural district in the middle of nowhere: about 40% of the student population falls below the poverty line. They need school for structure and even basic necessities like food (which should be free).  
  
Students also need discipline and structure, especially in adolescence. I think requirements should be laid down MUCH more strictly than they are. Students shouldn't be allowed to leave the building at all during the school day, unless it is a unique circumstance preapproved by the teacher and parents/guardians. Students should also be LEARNING while they're in the building, and not relegated to glorified study halls or busy-work electives (which is another rant for another day).  
  
And finally, as an alum of a private, Catholic school, I do believe our public school system needs a full overall. I may even suggest following more of an Eastern structure: one homeroom all 4 years of high school and teachers remain tied to a homeroom the entire time, as in 1 social studies teacher for a select few homerooms that teaches the kids the whole 4 years. And we should do away with busy work and petty grades. I'd have exams and essay writing take up ALL of my grades, if I could. Summative assessments should be the ONLY assessments. Formative assessments can be given to check progress, but not entered as grades in the book.   
  
Feel free to disagree. I'd love to hear some other opinions. Admittedly, I have a LOT to say about this stuff and often don't have a place to write about it. Cheers!",User_deleted,3,neutral,0

I'm a 6th year HS Soc. St. Teacher. ChatGPT is here to stay, and the AI is only going to get better. There is no way the old/current model of education (MS, HS, College) can continue. If it is not in-class, the days of ""read this and write..."" are in their twilight. 

I am in a private school, so I have the freedom to do this. But, I have focused more on graded discussions and graded debates. Using AI and having the students annotate the responses and write ""in class"" using the annotations, and more. AI is here to stay, the us, the educators, and the whole educational  model are going to have to change (which will probably never happen)

Plus, the AI detection tools are fucked. Real papers come back as AI and just putting grammatical errors into your AI work comes back original. Students can put the og AI work into a rewriter tool. Having the AI write in a lower grade level. Or if they're worried about the Google doc drafts, just type the AI work word-for-word into the doc (a little bit longer, I know).

ChatGPT Response; **The Unruly Classroom**

In the quaint town of Bellsville, Mr. Thompson's classroom was known for its old-world charm and his strict, traditional teaching methods. A silver-haired Southern gentleman with a penchant for discipline, he prided himself on imparting knowledge with grace and dignity. Today's lesson: the Pythagorean theorem.

""Alright, y'all,"" Mr. Thompson began, chalk in hand, ""The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse—""

*Prrrfft!*

A loud, unmistakable sound echoed through the room, followed by muffled giggles and snickers. Piggy, a notorious troublemaker with a penchant for pranks, had struck again. The classroom erupted in laughter, desks shaking with the force of stifled giggles.

Mr. Thompson's face turned a shade redder. Taking a deep breath and regaining his composure, he continued, ""As I was sayin', the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares—""

*Prrrfft! Prrrrrrrrft!*

Another round of uproarious laughter filled the room. Piggy, unable to contain himself, reveled in the chaos he had created. The other students exchanged glances, torn between amusement and fear of Mr. Thompson's impending wrath.

""That's enough!"" Mr. Thompson thundered, veins bulging in his forehead. ""Piggy, you've had yer fun, but I won't tolerate such behavior in my class!""

But before Mr. Thompson could utter another word, Piggy let out another deafening blast, louder than before. The classroom was in chaos, students doubled over in laughter, tears streaming down their faces.

Enough was enough. With a determined glint in his eyes, Mr. Thompson marched toward Piggy's desk. ""Young man,"" he growled, ""this ends today.""

With one swift motion, Mr. Thompson grabbed Piggy by the collar and dragged him out of the classroom. The door slammed shut, leaving behind a stunned and silent class.

Minutes felt like hours before Mr. Thompson returned, his face flushed but composed. ""Now,"" he said, wiping the chalk dust off his hands, ""where were we? Ah, yes, the Pythagorean theorem.""

With renewed vigor, Mr. Thompson resumed his lesson, ensuring that every student understood the intricacies of the theorem. The room was silent, the previous antics forgotten, replaced by a newfound respect for their teacher.

As the bell rang, signaling the end of class, the students filed out, whispering amongst themselves about the day's events. But one thing was clear: Piggy's reign of flatulence had come to an end, and Mr. Thompson had emerged victorious, ensuring that the Pythagorean theorem—and respect for the classroom—prevailed.",User_deleted,3,neutral,0

Body:

In today's data-driven world, the ability to analyze vast amounts of information and generate insightful reports is invaluable. This is where ChatGPT comes into play, offering an advanced AI-driven approach to handling data analysis and reporting tasks.

ChatGPT, with its natural language processing capabilities, can interpret and analyze data from various sources. It streamlines processes in multiple sectors - healthcare, finance, marketing, and more - by providing intuitive data interaction. With its capacity to understand context, ChatGPT can assist with identifying patterns, anomalies, and trends which are critical for strategic decision-making.

In the healthcare sector, it can manage patient information, track treatment outcomes, and even predict patient admissions. This can significantly improve care delivery and operational efficiency. For finance, ChatGPT can handle transaction analysis, fraud detection, and generate reports that help in making investment strategies or in monitoring financial health.

Within marketing, this tool is a game-changer for parsing through customer data, helping businesses understand buying behaviors, and tailoring their strategies to market trends. And in customer service, analyzing inquiries and feedback via ChatGPT can enhance the quality of support provided.

Furthermore, educational institutions can leverage ChatGPT to analyze student performance and customize learning plans. In the public sector, it can handle large amounts of administrative data, aiding in policy analysis and governmental reporting.

However, it's not just about the analysis; reporting is equally crucial. ChatGPT simplifies the transformation of complex data findings into readable reports for stakeholders, complete with narratives that elucidate key points without requiring advanced analytical skills to understand.

The integration of ChatGPT into data analysis and reporting is transformative and continues to evolve. It paves the way for more informed decisions, operational excellence, and a competitive edge in an increasingly analytical business environment. Collaboration with AI like ChatGPT could be what sets apart leading organizations in their respective fields.

Tell them to go chat with GPT or whatever LLM they prefer and learn as much as you can about the topic. The students who dive deep into asking questions will know all sorts of interesting facts!  
Then, after that, have them ask the LLM to write a paper on all the questions they asked. You will see the students who asked ""Tell me about Abraham Lincoln"" vs. ""Tell me about Abraham Lincoln"" and had 50 follow-up questions.

You get 1 hour lecture on React and then the content to code and they hope you get it with a partner (bootcamp hope the students teach each other).

With ChatGPT you can do this yourself. I understand that other people need help to learn and that’s why they go to bootcamp, but really good software engineers are self learner and self starters. They ask a lot of questions. But it shouldn’t be your cohort peers. It should be paid instructors with multiple years of real experience, not previous students that never got a job outside of bootcamp systems. 

Bootcamp worked before with COVID because there was a huge demand for it. Companies couldn’t be picky because they would just get a better offer. Now, there is a less of a demand for software engineer jobs so they mainly hire seniors. That’s why you need real experience or lie about it lol (bootcamp I went to definitely did)",User_deleted,7,negative,0
18tqfg8,1,2023-12-29,When did things get so messed up?,u/randomemployee2023,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/18tqfg8/when_did_things_get_so_messed_up/,"**Topic: I've seen a lot on the news, a lot of social media posts and a whole lot of statistics pointing at a crisis in education. Academically and behaviorally, it feels like the education system (both public and private) is failing kids who aren't too much younger than I am now (25).** 

Intent: Trying to understand and offer my POV on solutions.

Disclaimer: I'm not a teacher, I graduated college three years ago, these are observations from a total outsider. Take them with a grain of salt.

Part 1: As teachers, are you personally seeing the aforementioned issues in your classrooms, or do you think it's all media hype?

Part 2: Working off of the assumption that these issues are indeed happening regularly and we are indeed facing a crisis in education, these are a few ideas I want to throw out:

*Academic*

1. **Essays/Research for older kids.** We have to recognize that the world has changed even more in the past 20 years than it changed in the previous 40. We've gone from blackboards to internet to iPhones to AI. There is no longer any real need to go to the library-- any kid with half a brain can google just about anything that they want to know in two seconds. In a similar vein, ChatGPT is here and we're stuck with it. Expecting kids not to use it, especially when they see how easy it is to get away with it, is just silly. I'm inclined to believe that in coming years, if assignments stay the same, the dumb and the unlucky ones who get caught will be in the minority. 
   1. **Suggestion:** switch homework and classwork around. Instead of assigning essays/papers for homework, assign the research for them as the homework. They can ChatGPT all they want at home, but it won't help them (and if they bring a fully-written essay as their ""research notes"" to class, you can just tear them up). Then, dedicate a few classes to writing time. Assuming they've brought legitimate notes and done the legwork as their homework, I don't see why students can't do the writing in class. ChatGPT-ing is much harder when your teacher can see what you're doing.
2. **Exams need to stop**. The only thing exams do is show which kids are better at retaining short and medium-term knowledge. I don't know about you all, but I don't remember much of any subject in high school or college that I wasn't/am specifically interested in enough to continue learning independently (history, in my case). The point of school should be to teach the soft skills that allow a person to be a functioning, productive member of society-- not to fail them for not being able to cram chemistry, calculus or Shakespeare the night before a meaningless exam. Standardized testing are just an even worse form of exams, but that's a whole other discussion I don't have space for here.
   1. **Suggestion:** Shift the focus to coursework (essays, problem sets, lab work etc.) and away from exams. These are much better learning experiences for the students, allow them to pick up soft skills they'll actually use instead of knowledge that will very rapidly fade away, and be a significantly better reflection of their abilities and areas for improvement. By all means, scatter in pop quizzes and tests here and there, they do have value as far as keeping students on their feet, just ensure that it only covers recently-taught material. 

*Behavioral*

1. **Get phones out of the classroom.** There was a certain point, around when I was in school, where tech in the classroom was alright. You'd pull out your phone for a second to text your buddy, or whip out a game on your laptop to stay awake in class, and every once in a while, you'd get caught and punished accordingly. Today, however, it isn't just a quick text or game of rocket league, it's a generation with a freakish, compulsive *need* to be on tiktok, instagram, snapchat, etc. It isn't about staying awake or making fun of the teacher, it's an addiction. It's part of a greater public health crisis (that I won't get into in this post) related to social media use. 
   1. **Suggestion:** They can kick and scream and suffer withdrawal, but phones go in a bin at the start of class and laptops/tablets don't come out unless it's for a specific assignment. Thanks to remote class, we now have software that allows you, the teacher, to monitor what students are doing on their laptop without even having to get out of your chair! And no, no one (except certain people with specific accessibility requirements) NEEDS to take notes on their machine-- people have been writing by hand for millennia and we've come pretty far. 
2. **Ride the mental health wave.** The stigma around mental health issues is slowly drifting away. Kids are freely talking about mental health and are being encouraged to do so. Be a supportive figure, guide them to the right resources, steer them away from bad influences (e.g. andrew tate). A lot of kids are very lonely nowadays. Reach out to them.
3. **Model values**. Listen, it isn't your job to teach kids values. That's a job many parents seem to be failing at. What you CAN do, however, is be a good role model. This means keeping your instagram tame, be polite to them (yelling is much more effective if you only do it every once in a while), keeping a professional distance (e.g idc if you smoke weed, but your students don't need to know), being a good listener, and...
4. **Bring back consequences.** I know, I'm preaching to the choir here. I know that this one is hard because well, parents are uncooperative, school administrations suck, etc. I know this isn't something teachers can or should have to fix alone, it has to be a whole-of-society effort. Still, it has to be said-- rampant and increasing behavioral issues are an inherent part of the crisis in education. I'm not talking about cheating (students have and always will cheat if given the chance and depending on their tolerance for risk-- in fact, I encourage cheating when it comes to busy work because you shouldn't be doling it out anyways). I'm also not talking about sex/drugs/alcohol (again, being stupid is a hallmark of being young. We definitely should be doing better when it comes to sex education and preventative measures against early addictions, but again, that's a whole other post). **I am talking about** the feeling of impunity students seem to have nowadays.
   1. **Suggestion 1:** In cases where the student is violent/otherwise dangerous/sexually aggressive to you or classmates, get other adults involved asap and have that student transferred elsewhere. Dealing with these students is not your job. Again, a whole other post could address where those students should go/how to prevent them from joining the pipeline to prison but for the purposes of this one: just don't engage, get them out of your classroom. 
   2. **Suggestion 2**: In all other cases, go for the jugular. Students want to \[insert instance of misbehavior\]? One warning and then after-school detention. That's right, more time spent in school WITHOUT their phones/electronics. Oh no, they have to miss X or Y event, so sad. Also, though this should be used sparingly and with good judgement, collective punishment might just help a stray student find their way via social pressure. I know that when I was in school, the best teachers were the ones who were supportive and kind, but didn't take disrespect and didn't feed it with attention. They just gave you detention and moved on. If you threw a fit, you'd get sent out of the room until you were done. That simple. If you tried to get your parents involved and they actually took the bait, your parents would come out looking dumb and be much, much madder at you than if you'd just taken your detention and moved on.

Anyways, these are my very long two cents. I'm interested in peoples' reactions/thoughts. More than anything this is me venting over an issue (no, a crisis), that is incredibly frustrating to see but that I'm helpless to do anything about at this stage.",User_deleted,0,negative,0
18ttn71,1,2023-12-29,Does Humbot Work?,u/joshstealth,stealthgpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stealthgpt/comments/18ttn71/does_humbot_work/,"https://preview.redd.it/m666o60jz99c1.png?width=2876&format=png&auto=webp&s=4eebd6a19a5ee63a6b9c75ee799c64b0f5c1f3f3

This blog post will cover on whether or not Humbot, a cutting-edge bypass AI detection technology tool capable of getting 100% human score, can bypass popular AI detectors such as GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn. 

Humbot claims to be the ultimate solution to bypass AI detection. Humbot can easily humanize AI text into authentic and original content undetectable by most detectors. Humbot claims to be a trustworthy AI humanizer to bypass AI detection capable of being undetectable by most detectors such as: GPTZero, Content at Scale, Winston AI, Copyleaks, TurnItIn, ZeroGPT, and OpenAI's Text Classifier. 

Finally, we will compare Humbot against StealthGPT to see which Undetectable AI Website reigns supreme. The results will shock you. 

Here's what we will cover:

* What Are Undetectable AI Websites?
* What is Humbot?
* What is StealthGPT?
* Test Preparation
* Humbot Against GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn
* StealthGPT Against GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn
* Final Thoughts
* Content at Scale vs StealthGPT's Value and Pricing 

## What Are Undetectable AI Websites?

Undetectable AI websites represent a significant leap in digital content creation. Leveraging advanced AI algorithms, these websites produce content that closely mimics human writing, both in style and substance. The key attribute of these websites is their ability to generate content that is almost indistinguishable from that written by humans.

### Characteristics of Undetectable AI Websites:

**Human-like Content Creation:** The AI-generated content is fluent, coherent, and contextually appropriate, making it comparable to human writing.

**Scalability:** Capable of producing large volumes of content quickly, these websites meet the growing demand for constant content updates.

**SEO Optimization:** The content is often optimized for search engines, improving the website's visibility and search rankings.

## Test Preparation

We will be using ChatGPT for our experiment. We will use the content produced by ChatGPT and place them onto Humbot and StealthGPT's bypass tools. We will then test to see if they can bypass against well known AI detectors. 

Popular AI detectors such as GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn will be used for this experiment. We will provide images showcasing how Humbot compares against StealthGPT. 

Finally, we will make a conclusion based on the experiment to see if whether or not Humbot actually works. 

## Humbot Against GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn

Firstly, let's come up with a text written by ChatGPT. Here's the prompt that we will be using for the experiment. 

https://preview.redd.it/2ccovx9nz99c1.png?width=2360&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa9d3170416447578bfdabe4f5bd8dfd355fd93c

Now, let's place this text within Humbot's AI bypass tool.

https://preview.redd.it/0wpfey3pz99c1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c6cdcbbbadb22f746bb19be029b0f40109d68ae

https://preview.redd.it/zyduebjpz99c1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=188e556fa669b72943897ff35b160d73c5a3d20d

## Humbot Against GPTZero

https://preview.redd.it/vh0zu2zsz99c1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1f7961d2b93af467e6b4ba46652ae4444098589

A 94% AI written score from GPTZero is not a good sign for Humbot. All 20 sentences were detected as AI generated. While it's possible for Humbot to bypass the other websites, It's not looking too good for them right now.

## Humbot Against Originality

https://preview.redd.it/9of1nw1uz99c1.png?width=2874&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cbd4c205d49094cb32062c1295665da92b51148

100% AI detection score from Originality already proves that Humbot does not work. Let's see how Humbot does well against TurnItIn to make sure.

## Humbot Against TurnItIn

https://preview.redd.it/z28at7hvz99c1.jpg?width=1954&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ef6dfcc3613e2b32f64d07705ffcbedafc6e89f

100% detection score from TurnItIn is the nail in the coffin that proves that Humbot cannot go up against major AI detectors such as GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn. 

## StealthGPT Against GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn

Now, let's compare StealthGPT against GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn. We'll take the same text from ChatGPT and convert it to StealthGPT beforehand. 

https://preview.redd.it/pmv2vs0xz99c1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=d690b86ae96b794bc0fd0c4ee42588212ee87e08

## StealthGPT Against GPTZero

https://preview.redd.it/jz0o01ryz99c1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbbf20bb35655d898da78bb0e360ff05d82cdb1e

Wow from 94% from Humbot to just 0% AI written content from StealthGPT. This is a good sign but let's not get too hopeful just yet. We still have Originality and TurnItIn to see if StealthGPT is legit.

## StealthGPT Against Originality

https://preview.redd.it/83ov6x200a9c1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=488a5d33c700faec8125049c78be014c3e7e4be0

Okay maybe StealthGPT is legit. However, TurnItIn is one of the most powerful AI detectors out there. If StealthGPT can bypass TurnItIn, StealthGPT can bypass any AI detectors out there.

## StealthGPT Against TurnItIn

https://preview.redd.it/3vhh2nf10a9c1.jpg?width=1812&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd5c729ebf627f276be90991824f8d65bf6644c7

StealthGPT can bypass GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn. That is an impressive feat considering how Humbot failed against all three AI detectors. 

## Final Thoughts

In conclusion, it turns out that Humbot fails to bypass major AI detectors such as GPTZero at 94% AI generated content, Originality at at 100% AI written content, and TurnItin at 100% AI detection score. Humbot fails to claim itself as the ultimate solution to bypass AI detection.  

In comparison, StealthGPT goes beyond expectations and achieved over an impressive 0% AI detection score on GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn. Humbot could not achieve what StealthGPT could in this experiment. It's a major breakthrough for highschool, college students, or other professions out there seeking to bypass AI detectors. It's clear that StealthGPT reigns supreme as the best AI humanizer platform out there. StealthGPT currently ranks as the best AI bypasser website and this experiment proves it. 

We will continue to experiment other undetectable AI websites to see their capabilities and trustworthiness. Check out our blog post here. 

## Humbot vs StealthGPT's Value and Pricing

### Humbot Pricing

https://preview.redd.it/hcytsg170a9c1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c8d4a552146b8d8112b82c67bf13c486eecfa88

Starts at $9.99 per month for 20,000 undetectable AI words, 1 user, ""totally undetectable outputs,"" no grammar mistakes, and fast rewrite speed. Annual price starting at $60 for 20,000 undetectable AI words. There is a slide feature that lets the user adjust according to their needs. Max of $209 per month for 760,000 undetectable AI words and yearly plan of $1,253.04 for 760,000 undetectable AI words.

### StealthGPT Pricing

https://preview.redd.it/prt1f5g80a9c1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5974525176638bda7024ae832ded9664cd13aa9

https://preview.redd.it/vkhxl4p80a9c1.png?width=2876&format=png&auto=webp&s=50a02acdd9b794e87562d4714477c0901a5a02b2

Starting at $14.99 per month for 100,000 Undetectable AI words, 1 user, and with chrome extension. $19.99 for 500,000 words per month and $29.99 for 1,000,000 words per month. An annual option of $99.99 for 100,000 words per month, $199.99 for 500,000 words per month, and $299.99 for 1,000,000 words per month. StealthGPT has a flexible pricing option compared to Content at Scale. Making it a more affordable option for users especially highschool and college students.  

### Humbot vs StealthGPT's value

When we are looking at the pricing alone, Humbot does have a cheaper pricing option; however, Humbot only allows for 20,000 words per month. StealthGPT offers 80,000 more words per month while also being effective. Humbot does have a flexible plan option for users, making it an enticing option for highschool or college students, but there is an increase risk of getting caught by AI detectors. Would you pay as cheaply  as you can in exchange for a higher chance of getting caught? The consequences aren't worth the hassle. In the end, StealthGPT's value and pricing beats Humbot without a doubt.

I notice so many posts in this sub that are weirdly misdirected anger and frustration. So often teachers post about ""bad behavior"" ""lazy parents"" ""lazy students"" ""CelLpHonEs!"" ""ChatGPT"" like those are the things that are collapsing the field of education in America. 

It's disheartening to see so few people talk about the collapse of public sector bargaining, the rise of McDonalds-ass-charter schools, the depoliticization of curriculum. 

Putting this out into the internet that maybe the reason your students ""don't care"" is because they work jobs at night to support their families in our capitalist hellscape, maybe they have an undiagnosed learning disability (because those diagnoses are so often limited in services based on your race and wealth). 

&#x200B;

Maybe those ""lazy parents"" are working three jobs. Maybe they're trying their best. Maybe no matter how hard students, teachers and parents work job opportunities are increasingly becoming limited in a world that is dying. 

&#x200B;

Your job is political, but so often teachers act like it's not. We talk about ""students rights to this and that"" when we live in a country that has grown enormously wealthy off of depriving the rights of others.

I am a M19 alumni, meaning I studied and took my exams before either COVID or widespread LLMs were a thing. My HLs were History, Econ, Lang&Lit, and my SLs were Bio, Math Studies and Mandarin.

I am posting here because I am curious as to how various IB schools around the world are handling the rapid rise of LLMs like ChatGPT. I now work full-time and utilise ChatGPT a daily basis, and I keep thinking about how helpful it would have been to assist me with studying. But of course, it also raises questions of plagiarism which the IB is notorious for being strict on. So I wonder: 

**Are IB schools embracing AI to enhance learning and research, or imposing strict measures to prevent its misuse?**

Any input is appreciated, as I am very curious. 

Thanks and best of luck in your studies!  ",active,6,neutral,0

## What Are Undetectable AI Websites?

Undetectable AI websites represent a new frontier in the digital world. These platforms are designed to function under the radar of conventional AI detection systems. Typically, AI detection tools scan websites to identify if the content is generated by AI algorithms. Undetectable AI websites cleverly mask their AI-generated content, making it appear as if it's created by humans. This is achieved through advanced algorithms that mimic human writing styles, including nuances and idiosyncrasies that are typically absent in standard AI-generated content. The purpose of such websites can vary, ranging from avoiding algorithmic penalties by search engines to maintaining the authenticity of the user experience.

## What is Bypass AI?

https://preview.redd.it/hp1wbwnorh9c1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=6405d6eeb5394bf69794c291eb8d651c9de335fb

Bypass AI refers to the set of technologies or methods used to circumvent AI detection systems. These systems are often employed by search engines, academic integrity tools, and content moderation platforms. The primary goal of Bypass AI is to create content or perform actions that seem natural and human-like, thereby evading detection. This involves sophisticated programming that allows AI to adapt, learn, and modify its approach to mimic human behavior more closely. However, the effectiveness of Bypass AI is a subject of ongoing debate. While some claim significant success in evading detection, others argue that as AI detection systems evolve, they become more adept at identifying even the most advanced Bypass AI techniques.

## What is StealthGPT?

https://preview.redd.it/zsz7wowprh9c1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d732d8ab356b871dff681550706ae73bb6fd2ab

StealthGPT is a term that has emerged in the context of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models. It implies a version or use-case of GPT that operates stealthily, often in scenarios where AI-generated content needs to be undetectable. The concept of StealthGPT revolves around creating outputs that are indistinguishable from human-generated content. This can be particularly useful in areas where the authenticity of content is crucial, such as in journalism, academic writing, or creative writing. StealthGPT employs advanced techniques to refine the output, reduce patterns that are typically associated with AI, and incorporate human-like elements in the content.

## Test Preparation

We will be using ChatGPT for our experiment. We will use the content produced by ChatGPT and place them onto Bypass AI and StealthGPT's bypass tools. We will then test to see if they can bypass against well known AI detectors. 

Popular AI detectors such as GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn will be used for this experiment. We will provide images showcasing how Bypass AI compares against StealthGPT. 

Finally, we will make a conclusion based on the experiment to see if whether or not Bypass AI actually works. 

## Bypass AI Against GPTZero, Originality, and TurnItIn

Stealthwriter is one of the many tools that claim to offer undetectable content generation that search engines, your audience, or even your teacher will not be able to detect. It says it can offer you unique writing if you simply input a few prompts, and they will create something that cannot be traced by AI content detection tools like Originality.ai, GPT Zero, or TurnItIn. Some people find themselves short on time and want to use an AI content creation tool to generate their content for them, but in a way that ensures no one knows that they generated it. That might be because they have too many pressures at work to find time to write, it might be because they aren't confident in their writing skills, or it could simply be because they want to take a quick shortcut and save time.

Whatever the case may be, it is easy to see why the world of AI content generation is exciting to some, given the seemingly bottomless well of knowledge and insight and the speed at which content can get created.

What is StealthWriter?
