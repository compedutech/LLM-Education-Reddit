yx75o9,1,2022-11-16,Degree Apprenticeship vs University,u/Freemxn62,UniUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/yx75o9/degree_apprenticeship_vs_university/,"I am a student who has taken a gap year in the hopes of finding a little more direction in what I want to do in life. Firstly, I have completed my A-levels and secured a spot at the University of Liverpool on a foundation year in engineering (I did not do Maths A level) which i then would follow on from into an engineering discipline. This was going to be Aerospace but when the time to go to uni arrived I got cold feet and wondered whether there were better options available to me. Although i know i shouldn’t be, i feel very motivated by salaries as I have a deep passion for Cars and would love to be able to own something impressive in the future (along with the financial freedom of course).  Currently, I see a few options for myself. I could wait it out and attend university next year onto my desired course (i could even go to software engineering if that would benefit me more), or I could try my luck at applying to a Digital and Technology solutions apprenticeship near me at a company called CapGemini, where i would gain a degree in Digital and Technology solutions from Aston University. Or, i could go to BAE systems for an aerospace engineering apprenticeship that awards a Beng in Aerospace Engineering and 2 diplomas. Obviously with both apprenticeships i would have the benefit of free tuition, and experience leading into a job at the corresponding company at the end of the apprenticeship. I would have to move away for Liverpool and the BAE systems routes, so that’s another consideration. I want to make the right choice for my life and not feel like later down the line i could’ve made a better decision by either following into a software role or an aerospace one. I feel consumed by researching “average salaries” for everything i consider and i wonder what the benefit of the “traditional” route would give me. I should also probably note that while i do not know how to code now, id be willing to learn if the compensation of becoming a software engineer is good enough. Also, is there any real world difference between the uni you attend? Is there ANY reason for me to go to Liverpool?
I honestly appreciate any wisdom anybody has for me, even if that’s telling me to get my head out of the clouds. 

TLDR - I’ve got my life ahead of me and the idea of regretting doing one thing or another is consuming me into not doing anything at all. I’ve always been a “science” type of person and i’m just desperate to make the most out of my life.",User_deleted,1,neutral,0

**9 PM - 2 AM |** [**Mz Worthy**](https://fb.me/e/2BKmbl7nS) | Effex, 420 Central Ave | One of the Original Dirtybird artists Mz. Worthy returns to Albuquerque after 3 years to make her Effex Rooftop &amp; We House Fridays debut. Support By: BadCat + Femme.Antics. 21+ with Valid ID. Cover Charge at Door. No one knows how to push the boundaries of House music quite like Mz Worthy. With a deeply intuitive understanding of production, she’s shown reverence to the traditional form of classic House even while tripping off the mark &amp; sinking into euphoric, less-charted territories of booty-clapping bass. Attaching “Mz” to her name, Mz Worthy marks the new era of her career. With a new relationship to DJing, she connects with her music and her audience like never before. Despite over two decades in the scene, she continuously felt disconnected from the world and her fans. After years of repressing feelings of gender dysphoria, Mz Worthy came out as transgender in 2020. Describing the discovery as pieces of a puzzle coming together, Mz Worthy has invited her fans to join her on her journey in finding herself. Mz Worthy is no stranger to the world of electronic music. She released her breakout track “Irst Te” off Dirtybird records back in 2007, followed up by bangers like “Shy Look” (2012), “Tric Trac” with Eats Everything (2011) and “Dip” (2013). Worthy once again proved her notoriety as a producer with her 2014 debut album, Disbehave. The critically acclaimed album defies genres and pushes the boundaries of the traditional House sound. A veteran to some of the largest music festivals out there, Mz Worthy has the insight to play for her audience every time, cultivating intense positive energy and an energetic dance floor camaraderie. She invites her audience to embrace their true selves, just as she is.

**10:30 PM |** [**AMERICAN MOVIE - the 1999 cult indie doc gem in honor of the late great Mike Schank!**](https://fb.me/e/27Z2XHSbd) | The Guild Cinema, 3405 Central Ave NE | Check out the trailer at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFZOu8rDUQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFZOu8rDUQ) Dir. Chris Smith - 1999 - 107 - ALL SEATS $8. The hit of the 1999 Sundance Film Festival, this great doc that's become a cult fave over the years is the hilarious and intense story of one man's obsession to make movies. Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, is a long way from Hollywood, but Mark Borchardt has a dream. Armed with a driving ambition and nothing to lose, the fast-talking Borchardt enlists friends, local thespians and unwilling family members to help him finish his no-budget horror film, COVEN. The camera doesn't flinch as it captures every emotional crisis and financial pitfall in his two-year odyssey. What emerges is a bizarre, yet surprisingly heartfelt, documentary portrait of a true American character. Welcome to the ""Real World.""

**10 AM |** [**Songs &amp; Stories from the Albuquerque Public Schools Native American Performing Arts Program**](https://fb.me/e/2WTlhDWw4) | National Hispanic Cultural Center, 1701 4th St. SW | AMP is pleased to partner with Instituto Cervantes and the National Hispanic Cultural Center to present the second edition of the Oralidad Festival. Oralidad is born with two essential purposes: to promote the oral tradition of storytelling and to establish a collaboration between artists from New Mexico, Spain, Latin America and the rest of the United States to create new works together and contribute to the improvement of storytelling. The oral tradition of storytelling is a powerful language throughout the world, and is deeply rooted in Spanish culture. These oral traditions have permeated Latin American and Hispanic culture, from flamenco palos to the Vaqueiros de Alzada and the tradition of the juglares (minstrelsy), as well as having a broad impact on Latin American literature. New Mexico is an especially important place for storytellers, due to the mix of Hispanic and indigenous cultures, specifically the oral traditions and histories of the Pueblos. This activity will incorporate music, dance and storytelling into a program that will demonstrate Native American pride and culture. It is an intertribal presentation and will be performed by Albuquerque Public School students. The program will feature two Native American songs, two Winter Stories which include acting, and one Native American dance which allows for audience participation. This activity will also allow students to develop communication and life skills. The Native American Studies program at Albuquerque High School is taught by John Williams. John is a member of the Dakota Sioux tribe and has worked in APS for over 25 years. He teaches Navajo Government, Native American Studies and Native American Leadership. His program sponsors annual events such as Winter Stories, Native American Fashion Shows, and Music Appreciation.
