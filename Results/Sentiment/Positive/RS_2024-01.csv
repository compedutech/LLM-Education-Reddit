194ttos,5,2024-01-12,Teachers should utilize/beware of powerful Custom ChatGPTs,u/51893Eric,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/194ttos/teachers_should_utilizebeware_of_powerful_custom/,"The launch of ChatGPT has forever changed the classroom, but I'm afraid its impact is not slowing down. Recently, a **new** accessible tool called custom GPT was launched, and teachers should absolutely be aware of its capabilities compared to the normal model. Custom models are very easy to make, but **very powerful**. Give it some instructions, feed it a couple PDFs, then voila, you have a deadly specialist that can manipulate whatever textbook or novel you fed it with in anyway you want it to. This will allow your students use it for very course specific tasks that can either tremendously help or ruin their learning process. On one hand, it can be used to generate active learning practice questions on specific textbook chapters, or...they can cheat through literary analysis like **never before**.

To see for yourself just how much more capable custom models can be, here is a comparison between the normal ChatGPT and a custom one called ""No Panic Shakespeare"", who has been fed the PDF of Hamlet and instructed to focus on authorial choices and analysis. 

They were both asked the same question, **""Analyze the use of symbolism in Act 1 of Hamlet""**

|Normal ChatGPT 3.5 |Custom ChatGPT 4 ""No Panic Shakespeare""|
|:-|:-|
|Certainly, I can analyze the use of symbolism in Act 1 of Shakespeare's ""Hamlet."" In Act 1 of ""Hamlet,"" there are several instances of symbolism that contribute to the overall themes and mood of the play. Here are a few key examples:The Ghost: The appearance of King Hamlet's ghost is a powerful symbol in Act 1. The ghost represents the unresolved issues and secrets of the past. It symbolizes the corruption and betrayal that have taken place in Denmark, foreshadowing the themes of revenge and deception that will play a significant role in the rest of the play.The Throne: The throne of Denmark represents power and authority. Throughout Act 1, the question of who is the rightful king and who should sit on the throne is a central theme. This symbolizes the political instability and power struggles within the kingdom.The Use of Darkness: The frequent references to darkness and night in Act 1 symbolize the moral and political corruption that plagues the kingdom. It also reflects the uncertainty and chaos that have descended upon the state.The Courtly Attire: The courtly attire worn by the characters, especially Claudius and Gertrude, symbolizes the facade of civility and order that conceals the underlying tensions and conflicts in the royal court.Ophelia's Flowers: When Ophelia distributes flowers to the other characters, each flower has symbolic significance. For example, the rosemary symbolizes remembrance, and the pansies represent thoughts. These flowers reflect the characters' inner thoughts and emotions, often hidden behind polite gestures.These are just a few examples of the symbolism present in Act 1 of ""Hamlet."" Shakespeare uses symbolism throughout the play to add depth to the characters and themes, creating a rich and complex narrative.|**Argument:**In Act 1 of ""Hamlet,"" symbolism is used extensively to enhance the play's themes and to set the tone for the unfolding drama. The most prominent symbols are the Ghost of King Hamlet and the dark, cold setting.**Supporting Quotation:**A key quotation that supports this interpretation is found in Act 1, Scene 1, where Marcellus says to Horatio, ""It is offended."" (Act 1, Scene 1, Line 501). This line is in response to the Ghost of King Hamlet, which appears but does not speak to them.**Dissection of Quotation for Literary Techniques:**The phrase ""It is offended"" is symbolic on multiple levels. Firstly, the use of ""it"" to refer to the Ghost dehumanizes the apparition, reflecting the characters' confusion and fear. The word ""offended"" symbolically represents the unsettled nature of the Danish court, hinting at the underlying treachery that led to the Ghost's appearance.**Extensive Analysis:**The Ghost itself is a powerful symbol. It represents the unresolved issues from King Hamlet's reign and his untimely death. Its silence can be interpreted as a symbol of the hidden truths and the unspoken tension in the kingdom. The appearance of the Ghost in a military outfit symbolizes the ongoing conflict and the warlike state of Denmark, foreshadowing the tragic events to come.The setting of this scene - a dark, cold night - also holds symbolic value. It mirrors the looming sense of doom and the moral decay within the Danish court. The darkness can be seen as a metaphor for the ignorance and uncertainty surrounding King Hamlet's death, and the coldness as an emblem of the emotional detachment and the brewing hostility among the characters.Throughout ""Hamlet,"" these symbols recur, reinforcing themes of betrayal, revenge, and the struggle between truth and deception. The Ghost's appearances act as a catalyst for Hamlet's actions, driving the plot forward. The dark and ominous atmosphere pervades the play, maintaining a sense of unease and foreboding.|
|[https://chat.openai.com/share/1ca8efd3-3815-4356-a862-6d005f8abf81](https://chat.openai.com/share/1ca8efd3-3815-4356-a862-6d005f8abf81) |[https://chat.openai.com/share/136161f1-77d7-4ff5-bff0-f2af50ffbdbe](https://chat.openai.com/share/136161f1-77d7-4ff5-bff0-f2af50ffbdbe) |

If you ever taught or read Hamlet, you would notice that while the normal GPT 3.5 gave good examples of symbolism, they were not elaborated and not all actually in act one. On the other hand, No Panic Shakespeare is capable of accurate deep analysis supported by quotation. If you want to try this model for yourself, here is the link (requires gpt+): [https://chat.openai.com/g/g-e2B1a7n5t-no-panic-shakespeare](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-e2B1a7n5t-no-panic-shakespeare)

199vkna,1,2024-01-18,Exploring ChatGPT's Versatility in Data Analysis and Reporting Across Industries,u/cporter202,ChatGPTautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTautomation/comments/199vkna/exploring_chatgpts_versatility_in_data_analysis/,"As businesses and industries continuously search for efficient ways to analyze data and generate reports, OpenAI's ChatGPT has emerged as a powerful tool that's garnering attention for its flexibility and versatility. In this discussion, I'd like to deep-dive into the various ways ChatGPT can be, and is being, utilized across different sectors for data analysis and reporting tasks.

ChatGPT, an AI model trained on a diverse dataset, can process natural language and generate human-like text. This capability can prove highly beneficial in data analysis, where it can help interpret complex datasets and extract insights by conversing with users in an intuitive manner. For example, in finance, ChatGPT can assist analysts by summarizing stock market trends or by generating portions of financial reports. It can even explain the implications of financial metrics in layman's terms, democratizing access to expert-level analysis.

In the healthcare sector, the AI can sift through vast amounts of patient data to identify patterns or anomalies. It can compile these findings into understandable reports for healthcare professionals, helping in diagnosis or treatment plan development. This is just one of the many potential applications in healthcare, leading to more informed decision-making and better patient outcomes.

The marketing industry similarly stands to benefit from ChatGPT's data analysis capabilities. It can analyze consumer behavior data, campaign performance, and market trends to create comprehensive reports that inform strategy. ChatGPT can take this a step further by suggesting potential actions or generating content for marketing materials based on the data insights.

Education is another field where data reporting is crucial. ChatGPT can aid institutions in aggregating educational data, like student performance metrics or course engagement levels, and then produce reports that can help educators adapt their teaching strategies or materials.

It's important to recognize the potential constraints and ethical considerations of using AI in these contexts, such as data privacy concerns and the importance of human oversight to avoid misinterpretation of the data. But the possibilities ChatGPT opens up for enhancing productivity and making complex data more approachable are very exciting.

I'm keen to hear from others about their experiences or thoughts on the implementation of ChatGPT in various data analysis and reporting tasks. What industries do you think could be transformed by AI like ChatGPT? What challenges might they face in its integration? Let's discuss the future of AI in data and the vast potential it holds across different fields.",active,1

Hopefully not as controversial. 

I want to become a professor. I love school, journalism, and academia (for the most part). If I could learn and teach at the collegiate level I’d be a pretty happy person. I am planning on pursuing my masters while working full time once I graduate (next Spring). Despite this, I read r/Professors and feel this dark cloud. Not to be mean but everyone in the sub comes off as angry and defeated. With that being said, I have a few questions. 

1. Is it worth the schooling?

2. Do you regret pursuing this career path.

3. Are all professors…defeated?

4. Will this be a profitable and stable career path in the next 10-15 years?

5. Would it be okay to pursue my Master’s and PhD online while working full-time?

I thank you for reading and look forward to hearing any responses. I don’t really want to be discouraged but I also would like to know the reality of it from people in the industry.",User_deleted,0

19cwlsu,1,2024-01-22,Navigating the Tides of SUSS: Lessons and Insights from a Year 4 Accountancy perspective 🌊,u/Nightknighty,Suss,https://www.reddit.com/r/Suss/comments/19cwlsu/navigating_the_tides_of_suss_lessons_and_insights/,"# Hello r/Suss👋🏻

My name is NightKnighty, a current Y4 accountancy undergraduate and a proud Govt Scholar. As I approach my final exam in the Jan 2024 semester, I'm filled with a mix of excitement and nostalgia. Reflecting on my journey that started with over 80+ students in the Full-Time Accountancy (FTACC) cohort, I've witnessed it dwindle to about 50+, as some of my peers drop out, while some transitioned to different programs like MKT, SCM, or ECE.

I stumbled upon this Reddit community by chance, but it quickly became my go-to source for not just information, but also a fair share of entertainment. As the July 2024 intake at SUSS is just around the corner, I find myself eager to share my story with you all. It's been a rollercoaster of late nights discussion calls, last minute submissions and information overload, and I'm here to share my story, hoping it lights your path and eases any worries about embarking on your own journey as a ***Work Study Accountancy Student at SUSS.*** 📚

**Why this post?** With the A-Level results just around the corner, I felt this is the perfect opportunity to share my journey with those who are considering a path similar to mine.  As someone who stepped into the world of accountancy at SUSS straight from Junior College, with no prior knowledge in the field, I intimately understand the feelings of uncertainty and apprehension that come with choosing this path. The decision to dive into a completely new area of study was daunting, yet it turned out to be one of the most enriching experiences of my life. 

Think of this as a friendly guide from someone who has already walked the path you're about to embark on. My hope is that by sharing my experiences, I can provide some insights and guidance to potential accountancy undergraduates who are standing where I once was, 4 years ago.

In the next few paragraphs, I'll take you through why I chose SUSS, the ups and downs of each year, some advice on time management, and study tips that I wish someone had shared with me. Whether you're a fresh A Lvl/Poly student who just received your results or a working adult looking to upskill, I hope my journey gives you a glimpse of what's to come and prepares you for the challenging but somewhat exciting times ahead! 🌟

## Choosing SUSS and the Reality of Accountancy

**Why SUSS? A Big Fish in a Small Pond 🐠**

When I chose SUSS for my accountancy degree, my strategy was clear: be a big fish in a small pond. The allure was obvious - standing out in a less competitive environment as compared to the Big 3. (SIT was out as I did not like their trimester curriculum).

However, the journey unfolded differently than I had imagined. The course content in accountancy was just as demanding as what you'd find in the Big 3 universities as we are all following the same financial reporting standards / tax code set out by ACRA / IRAS. The major difference lay not in the complexity of the material, but in the method of delivery. Unlike the seminar and tutorial approach of the Big 3, SUSS “prides” itself on its flipped classroom style with only 6 lessons per module… Why? Idk. [Unique](https://www.suss.edu.sg/about-suss/why-choose-suss/the-suss-difference)? Indeed.

**The Evolving Landscape of Accountancy**

[The Indicative Grade Profile (IGP) for Accountancy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MPEDZpw26TjN7dTsQzsbnXHZa47og0qSrdHrlT7nLKc/pubhtml) has been changing 📉 across universities, a trend that reflects shifts in the sector (Updated as of 4th Jan 2024). Even the govt has recognised these changes, setting up a task force to revitalise the accountancy sector and shed its 'boring' tag, as reported by [The Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/task-force-set-up-to-persuade-more-to-take-up-accountancy-and-change-boring-tag).

Despite these shifts, the fact remains solid: an accountancy degree is a ticket to job stability. This is evident from the [2022 Graduate Employment Survey](https://www.moe.gov.sg/-/media/files/post-secondary/ges-2022/web-publication-suss-ges-2022.ashx) which shows a 94.6% employment rate for SUSS accountancy graduates. This was another major factor in my decision - *the promise of a stable job post-graduation.*

**The Appeal of the Work-Study Program**

The [Work-Study Program](https://www.suss.edu.sg/about-suss/centres/student-success-centre/career-development-office/work-programmes/work-study-degree-programme) at SUSS caught my attention for its promise of practical experience alongside academic learning. The idea of graduating in 4 years with a year's worth of internship experience seemed like a significant advantage over peers who would only complete a minimum of six months as required by the school.

**Reality Check: The Trade-Offs**

However, the reality of the Work-Study Program was a trade-off I hadn't fully anticipated. To stay on track for a four-year graduation, I had to overload the first three semesters, averaging 30-35 credit units (6-8 modules) with 5-6 exams each semester. The pace and pressure were mentally exhausting, especially as I was also aiming for second-upper honours (2UPP). I realised much later that this program isn't made for everyone; it pushes you to your limits, which also explains why some of my peers decided to drop out.

&#x200B;

## Year 1 at SUSS: Adjusting to New Realities

**A Virtual Start Amidst the Pandemic**

My university journey began in July 2020, amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic where I attended the freshman orientation. I didn’t expect much but having only a 3-hour Zoom session was a stark contrast to the typical university experience that I was anticipating. It also helped adjust (lower) my expectations of SUSS despite being really excited about starting university. This online mode of interaction continued, and it wasn't until January 2021 that I met my course mates in person. This situation often left me pondering whether I was attending an online university or a [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) audit track…

**First Impressions**

My first class, ACC213 (Income Tax), was a night class conducted online. Let’s just say the prof gave me the best and worst impression of what university life at SUSS is all about (Iykyk).

For accountancy courses (ACC), I was stunned by the 15% class participation component. Initially, I thought this would be an easy component to score in, but soon learned that active participation (via zoom🙄) was crucial to secure good grades. This realisation pushed me to overcome my shyness and become more vocal in class discussions (aka becoming a Class Part Slut).

**Assignments and Group Dynamics**

For my first night class, finding part-time (PT) senior group mates was a blessing. They were patient and inclusive, helping me navigate through seemingly 'silly' questions like “how to cite web articles in assignments.” They also shared with me some useful tips such as the existence of the “PCQ Quiz Bank,” websites like StuDocu / Course hero and many more helpful tips.

Other non-Acc mods such as SCOs (now renamed NCO) were particularly challenging, and I quickly realised they were not the GPA boosters I had hoped for. Despite our grp’s best efforts, many of us struggled to achieve grades above a B (3.5), a stark contrast to the relative ease with which we handled our core modules. Interestingly, this shared struggle led to what I'd describe as 'trauma bonding' among classmates. The friendships forged during these challenging SCOs turned out to be some of the deepest and most meaningful throughout my journey in SUSS. So, I urge you to choose your NCO group mates wisely, as they may end up being some of the best friends you will ever make.

A unique aspect of SUSS's curriculum is its approach to group formation. PT students don't get the choice to pick their group mates prior to the (night) lessons, leading to a lack of continuity in group chats post-semester. This system, while promoting diversity, sometimes feel impersonal and transient. One advice I can suggest is that I usually do a simple LinkedIn search on my course mates before deciding whether to group with them.

For FT, we are allowed to pick our Tutorial Group (TG) beforehand, which is an advantage IMO as it can lead to a more supportive learning environment and a more consistent group dynamic throughout your SUSS journey.

**Exam Challenges and Personal Growth**

My first two semesters were academically intense, with 5 and then 6 exams, respectively. The lack of study groups and external help, coupled with SUSS's policy of not releasing PYP answers, made it a starkly different experience from my JC days. Despite these hurdles, I managed to survive somehow, which was a small win in my books back in Y1.

**Reflections: Stress & Time Management**

The end of my second semester was a turning point where I learned the importance of stress management and effective time planning. Tools like Google Calendar / MS To-Do / MS Planner became my allies in managing assignments and deadlines. I also realised the importance of breaks to avoid burnout, indulging in computer games or reading manga post-exam periods.

However, these achievements came with sacrifices. My social life took a backseat as I focused exclusively on academics and did not sign up for any CCAs nor made an effort to socialise with my peers outside class. I avoided distractions ruthlessly, going as far as to uninstall social apps (i.e insta/fb) and games. This disciplined approach was challenging but crucial for my success.

**Stepping into Internships and Being the Senior I Wished I Had**

As part of the Work-Study Program, I began looking for internships in my second semester. Despite a decently high GPA (>4), the lack of prior work and CCA experience made the process daunting. I was rejected from MNCs (i.e VISA), Public Sectors like AGD/GIC and local banks (i.e DBS, OCBC). Eventually, I secured an internship with one of the Big 4 audit firms, which to me at that time, was a pivotal moment in my SUSS journey.

Reflecting on the absence of guidance in my early days, I decided to become the senior I wished I had. Thus, I signed up to be an OGL for the 2021/2022 July intake, determined to provide the support and mentorship I initially lacked.

&#x200B;

## Year 2 at SUSS:  Broadening my Horizons

**Adjusting to Higher-Level Courses**

Year 2 started with a significant academic milestone - my first level 3 accountancy module paired with a daunting 3-hour examination. By this time, I had established a study routine that proved successful in my first year, so I stuck with it, believing in its effectiveness.

**The Importance of Networking**

An enlightening aspect of this year was the opportunity to network during the July 2021 orientation as an OGL. I interacted with both seniors and juniors, realising the importance of keeping abreast with trends and insights from both groups. Networking with seniors gave me a glimpse into the future of the field, while juniors offered fresh perspectives and upcoming trends in the job market.

**A Comparison of Non-accountancy modules (i.e Finance/Biz/Anl) and Accountancy Modules**

A revelation I had during Year 2 was the contrast between finance/biz/anl and accountancy courses. From my experience, finance/biz/anl modules were more straightforward than accountancy ones. Despite the effort put into studying for accountancy modules, the outcomes often felt uncertain. In contrast, finance/biz/anl modules were more predictable, with abundant resources available online like YouTube and Investopedia. So, for students who are planning to take an accountancy minor, ⛔**PLEASE RECONSIDER AGAIN ⛔**. Finance or Analytics are relatively much easier.

**Cost-Effective Night Classes**

An interesting discovery that I found out in Y2 was the cost difference between day and night classes. Night classes were approximately $300 cheaper for the same module, a significant saving for FT students looking to cut costs. If you are comfortable not being able to choose your grp mates prior to class as mentioned above, you can request night classes by contacting student support and stating you are ""working"" during the day. How ik it is possible to do this? I have seen invoices showing only night classes despite the student being enrolled as FT.

**Leveraging SharePoint for Collaborative Work**

A tool I found incredibly useful and wish I had discovered in Year 1 is SharePoint. It's an alternative to Google Drive, offering co-authoring on all files while also utilising the features of the Desktop applications on Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. This discovery enhancing my productivity and revolutionised how I approached future group assignments.

**Overseas Experience Requirement**

Y2 was when I did my Overseas Experience (OE) requirement, where I chose a pragmatic route. I participated in a Zoom OE session, which was a quick and cost-effective way to fulfil this requirement. While it wasn't the most exciting option, it was cost-efficient as it saved a significant amount of money compared to traveling abroad (i.e it cost only **$150**).

**Setting the Stage for Internship Experiences**

Although I undertook my first internship in the second semester of Year 2, I'll delve into that experience in Year 3, to provide a more coherent narrative of my internship journey. This is also because normal FTACC students would only start their work attachment in Year 3 as well.

&#x200B;

## Year 3 at SUSS: Navigating Internships and Gaining Real-World Insights

**Internship Experience at Big 4**💼

Year 2/3 marked a significant phase in my journey with two split internships at the same Big 4 audit firm from November to May each year 2022/2023. Despite a hiccup regarding my FT offer – a story for another time – the internships were both meaningful and memorable.

During my internship, despite the demanding and fast-paced environment of the audit team, I was pleasantly surprised by their welcoming and supportive nature. It quickly became evident that they appreciated the extra help, especially when the peak period in January-March started. Their openness made it easier for me to integrate into the team and contribute effectively. This experience not only gave me a practical understanding of audit work but also highlighted the importance of a supportive work culture in a high-pressure work environment.

**Valuable Lessons and Takeaways**

My second stint at the firm allowed me to explore different roles that aren't typically assigned to interns. The trust and responsibility given to me were both gratifying and challenging, and I gave my 120%, despite the disappointment of not being offered the experienced associate position (i.e KPMG: G1, EY: A2, Deloitte: A2).

From these experiences, I learned several key lessons:

* **Expect to Work Overtime:** Especially during peak periods, be prepared for regular overtime.
* **Be Available and Communicate:** Ensure you're reachable even outside working hours and maintain clear communication with your team, particularly as deadlines approach.
* **Observe and Learn:** An internship differs significantly from a full-time job. Watch and learn from seniors and associates, as their roles will soon be yours if you decide to join.
* **Understand the Work Culture:** The culture in big firms like the Big 4 are very team-oriented. This means that your experiences can vary greatly depending on which team and clients you are assigned to. Hence, one person’s bad experience in a particular Big4 does not mean that the entire firm is toxic. It all comes down to whether you are lucky or not.
* **Networking Opportunities:** Make it an effort to attend networking events hosted by the firms. They're invaluable for making connections, even with top-level executives (Partner/Senior Managers).
* **High Turnover Rate:** High turnover is common not just in the Big 4 but across the industry. Therefore, it's not necessarily a red flag but rather a characteristic of the industry.
* **Big 4 vs Mid-Tier:** IMO, the Big 4 is universally + highly recognised and offers better exit opportunities. The notion that mid-tier firms are 'easier' or 'more relaxed' is a misconception as your experience would be valued less than your peers in the big 4 if you subsequently leave the audit field. My advice is to aim for the Big 4 as it will definitely provide a more comprehensive learning experience and better career prospects. After accumulating a few years of audit experience under your belt, you can decide whether audit is for you or it is time for you to explore other opportunities.

**A Memorable Encounter with SUSS Seniors** 🍻

A heartwarming highlight was meeting SUSS seniors who have already started FT employment during my second internship. It was a moment of reflection and camaraderie, discussing the questionable changes in SUSS's new 12w curriculum and sharing our experiences with the same nasty clients. This encounter underscored the value of the SUSS network and the shared journey that all accountancy students will embark on.

**Embarking on the Scholarship Journey**

During my second internship, from February to March 2023, I also started applying for scholarships. With nothing to lose, I applied to various programs including the SUSS , SgIS , IRAS Scholarship, and others listed on [Scholars Choice](https://www.scholarschoice.com.sg/providers/).

**A Surprising Outcome** 🎊

Interestingly, while I was rejected for the SUSS scholarship, I was offered 2 govt scholarship, which led me to ponder the prestige of these awards. It's curious to think if a university scholarship from SUSS is considered more prestigious than one from the govt sector…I'll leave that to your interpretation🤡. Dream, Dare, Do! 😶‍🌫️

**Choosing the Right Scholarship**

A crucial piece of advice for potential scholars: typically, you cannot hold dual scholarships. So, if you find yourself in the fortunate position of having multiple offers, choose which sponsoring organisation do you prefer working with in the future.

**Overcoming Imposter Syndrome** 😔

Receiving the scholarship initially triggered a bout of imposter syndrome in me. I felt as if I didn’t quite deserve this level of achievement. Yet, this milestone proved to be a pivotal moment of self-awareness. It dawned on me that the self-doubt I was experiencing was a byproduct of the low expectations I had unconsciously internalised from my environment at SUSS. Over time, I realised that my achievement was not a stroke of luck but proof of my determination and hard work. This revelation was empowering – it reminded me not to downplay my accomplishments, regardless of the context or setting. SUSS was a crucial part of my journey, but it was my own efforts that defined my success. This realisation helped me see beyond the immediate horizon, recognising that there are broader opportunities and challenges out there, especially when considering the larger landscape encompassing the Big 3 universities.

&#x200B;

## Year 4 at SUSS: Reflecting and Preparing for the Future

**Cruising Through Final Year** 🚢

As a Year 4 student, I find myself in a comfortable position academically due to the strong foundation set in my earlier years. My solid GPA from the first two years has put me in a place where even with C+ grades in my remaining modules, I would still graduate with 2UPP. While FCH may be out of reach, I am content with graduating with a 2UPP.

**Focus on the Future** 🔮

Currently, my focus has shifted from immediate academic achievements to what lies ahead in my career. One of the advantages of being a govt scholarship recipient is the robust support network it offers. I have a dedicated scholarship officer guiding me through my scholarship journey until graduation, which has given me a sense of security about my future.

**Growth and Learning** 🏫

Looking back, I started at SUSS as an accountancy novice, with a blank resume and little relevant work experience. Now, as I near the end of my journey, I have a well-rounded portfolio with multiple Co-curricular activities and experiences, many of which were external as I felt that the SUSS board were not helpful in facilitating student growth among the accountancy cohort.

My advice to my fellow juniors is this: Opportunities will always arise, but it's crucial to pick your battles wisely. Don't feel compelled to seize every opportunity that SUSS promotes. Instead, use SUSS as a stepping stone; explore further beyond, and never look back. This approach has served me well, leading to a rich, fulfilling university experience far beyond the confines of the classroom.

**No Final Year Project (FYP) for Accountancy**

In the Accountancy program, there currently isn't a Final Year Project (FYP). However, students aiming for FCH must still achieve at least an A- grade in BUS 490, the capstone module that all Y4 business students have to enrol in. Nonetheless, you shouldn't worry about this as a Y1-3 student as you have enough problems to deal with in your current semester.

&#x200B;

## Time Management Strategies and Essential Resources

**Effective Study Sessions** 🏫

One of my key strategies for managing time effectively was to dedicate specific blocks of time during the day for studying, usually up to a maximum of four hours per session. During these periods, I ensured there were no distractions – no phone, no notifications – just me and my study materials. This intense focus was particularly crucial for preparing for classes where there was a significant 15% class participation component.

For non-accountancy modules, such intensive and lengthy study sessions may not be necessary. It's about finding the right balance and approach for each subject.

**Study Environment** 🌲

I was fortunate to have a conducive study environment at home. However, for those who might not have this luxury, the [new SUSS library](https://suss.libcal.com/reserve) and other common study areas like the SIM library and enclosed rooms at Block B are good alternatives (Require advance booking).

**Importance of Self-Care** 💅🏻

Self-care is an integral part of my routine, especially post-examinations. I allow myself to relax fully because I know I've given my 100% during exams. This contrasts with peers who often find themselves stressed due to last-minute studying. Remember, self-care is more rewarding when you know you've put in your best and can now relax in peace.

**Must-Read Resources for Accountancy** 📚

For accountancy students, engaging with the right resources is crucial. **The e-textbooks** (not Study Guides) and **FRS standards** / IRAS website **are** **essential reads**. Beyond these, I've found the following resources extremely helpful in understanding various topics:

1. [Open Tuition for Management Accounting](https://opentuition.com/acca/ma/)
2. [Accounting      GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-7RJghLmOO-accounting-gpt) (ChatGPT Premium required)
3. [Edspira on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Edspira)
4. [Accounting Stuff on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@AccountingStuff)
5. [Open Tuition on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@opentuition)
6. [CPDbox on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@CPDbox)
7. [ACC Google Drive Resources](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RyGYZL2bByH_OtD3geV2uiB9G2jeSolx?usp=drive_link) (These are notes made from an ACC senior, **NOT** by SUSS)

&#x200B;

## Key Takeaways and Advice for SUSS Students

**Major Lessons Learned**💫

1. **Focus on the Present:** In my time at SUSS, I've observed a common tendency among some of my juniors, often driven by a 'kiasu' mindset, to anxiously look ahead towards internships, future modules, and even the Final Year Project BUS490. This happens even before they have completed their current semester's courses. While it's great to be forward-thinking, this approach can sometimes lead to unnecessary stress and distraction. My advice to these juniors is simple: focus on your present tasks and challenges. The future will unfold in due time, and it's important not to burden yourself with it prematurely. Direct your energy towards excelling in your current coursework and exams. By doing so, you'll be setting a solid foundation for the future challenges and opportunities. Once your immediate responsibilities are handled, you'll be in a much better position to think about and plan for what lies ahead. Remember, a step-by-step approach is often the most effective way to handle the rigorous academic journey at the university level.
2. **Resilience in the Face of Challenges:** My journey at SUSS taught me the importance of resilience. Whether it was adapting to a demanding study schedule, navigating internship hurdles, or dealing with unexpected curriculum changes, the ability to bounce back and stay focused was key.
3. **Balancing Academics and Personal Life:** Finding a balance between studies, internships, and personal time is crucial. It's not just about academic success but also about maintaining a calm and stress-free state of mind.

**Advice for Incoming SUSS Students**📌

1. **Be Proactive:** Don't wait for opportunities to come to you but instead consider taking matters into your own hands. Be proactive in seeking out internships, joining clubs, or starting study groups instead of relying on SUSS job portal.
2. **Network, Network, Network:** Building a strong network can be as valuable as your academic achievements. Connect with peers, seniors, and professionals in fields that you are interested in pursuing. This is important as most biz mods have Group-Based Assignments as well. By connecting with like-minded individuals, you can form study groups or assignment teams with friends or trusted acquaintances. This strategy is often more beneficial than constantly teaming up with new people each semester as i have mentioned earlier above.

**A Reflection on my University Experience**🎓

This phase of my journey has taught me that while SUSS may not be the top university in Singapore, the quality of one's university experience depends largely on personal mindset and effort. It's easy to blame the university for any setbacks, but I came to understand that the responsibility for change lay with me as well. Complaining is easy, but taking actionable steps towards achieving your goals is what truly makes a difference. It's crucial to remember that our educational journey and achievements are as much about our own attitudes and actions as they are about the institutions we attend.

Embarking on your university journey at SUSS is an exciting, albeit challenging, adventure. Remember, every obstacle is an opportunity to learn and grow. Stay curious, be open to new experiences, and don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone. Your time at SUSS is not just about earning a degree; it's about shaping your future and who you want to become. Embrace it with enthusiasm and determination, and you'll find that the rewards extend far beyond your time at university.
