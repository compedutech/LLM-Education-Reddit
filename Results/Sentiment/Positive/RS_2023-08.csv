It is great at translating, but for students who know some English I want to provide them supports so they can read and engage with materials in English. I ask it to do things like create a word bank and I get this 

“Certainly! Here is a word bank with ten English words that may be challenging for English language learners, along with their Spanish translations:

1. Ambiguous - Ambiguo/a
2. Conscientious - Conscienzudo/a
3. Inevitable - Inevitable
4. Prevalent - Prevalente
5. Resilient - Resistente
6. Synthesize - Sintetizar
7. Versatile - Versátil
8. Tenacious - Tenaz
9. Elaborate - Elaborado/a
10. Peculiar - Peculiar

These words cover a range of vocabulary and can pose challenges due to their nuanced meanings or less common usage. Providing the Spanish translations alongside the English words can help your Spanish-speaking students better understand and connect with the concepts being taught.”

All of those words are cognates, they would all be easy for the Spanish speaking kids!  Then when I ask it for cognates it gets that wrong too, giving some words that do not sound like their translation at all!

“Certainly! Here are ten cognates from the reading, words that have similar spellings and meanings in both English and Spanish:

1. Code - Código
2. Law - Ley
3. Monument - Monumento
4. Carving - Tallado
…”

Why is it so bad at this task?  It would be super useful if I could easily create word banks and flag cognates to students but I feel like it’s not gonna happen 😣",User_deleted,2

15hdmr0,1,2023-08-03,Write ✍️ papers as exams :),u/who-r-e,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/15hdmr0/write_papers_as_exams/,"Heyyyyyyy! A professor wrote an interesting and valid message here not too long ago about AI and essays. 

I thought of alternatives as well and have we considered moving papers to exam settings? Limit papers to 3-5 pages purely as an exam? 

Have students bring specifically sources with a either limited annotations or without annotations and space the exam out for two or even three days? 

Use the testing center or develop laptops for testing which locks the students into the tests to avoid cheating? 

Or should we just scrap papers all together since we’re getting irritated about the mere fact that students are losing the ability to actually WRITE when they cheat but denying the convenience of AI at the same time. 

We are expecting students who lost much of their writing talents to COVID and attending schools where they pass students with 50’s and not zero’s decreasing the importance and urgency of assignments and expecting students to catch on just because they’re in college? 

I wanted to become a college professor, but now I’m like well (THIS IS A JOKE ->) I should start my own AI site so I can charge my students who will cheat but then again ChatGPT does it for free 😭! 

Idk what I said tbh I’m just so irritated by our education system, we went from people who had to go to libraries to get information, to them complaining about the Google age, now we’re complaining about the AI age. :/

Let’s change papers to public speaking 😂🤣🤣🤣 you can’t AI your way out of public speaking cause you barely memorized the speech when your attention span only last for 6 seconds.",User_deleted,2
15hq6h0,1,2023-08-04,"Got back GRE Official Scores - 170 Verbal, 166 Quant, 5.5 Writing. Introspection and Advice for fellow GRE takers.",u/RiptideNF777,GRE,https://www.reddit.com/r/GRE/comments/15hq6h0/got_back_gre_official_scores_170_verbal_166_quant/,"Hello Everyone, People on this sub-reddit have been a very helpful resource to me since I started my GRE Prep so I just wanted to give back to the community any insights I had gained from my experience. Huge shout out to Gregmat btw!

For reference, I am a mid-twenties Canadian who works full-time.

# Test Day

On the test day, I got VQVQV, the first verbal section was actually fairly difficult, so I presume that was the experimental section. Unfortunately this did jar me a little bit as I was on edge afterwards for the first quant section. However, the second verbal section, which I believe was the first real verbal section was very simple, so it helped me recover and complete the remainder of the test with confidence. Ultimately finished with a 170 Verbal, 166 Quant, 5.5 Writing.

# Preparation

I started around 6 months ago with a cold take on a test with a 159 Verbal, 160 Quant. But only started studying 1.5 months ago while working a full time 40 hour a week job. Arguably I should have studied for another month! So if you are **working full time I would say 2.5 months is a good enough time if you are putting 3 hours every day into studying**.

**Material Used**

All I used was Gregmat and the materials he recommended. Now if you are like me and are a serial procrastinator or just an overall lazy person, I highly recommend Gregmat as his plan is very structured and has multiple little things for you to do everyday. Essentially I see it as gamification of the GRE because you get a little dopamine hit each time you finish a lecture, or check of another line item. If you are Gen Z like me and have had your brain friend by tiktok, this is very helpful method in encouraging you to study. Btw, I did the **one-month updated Gregmat plan.**

I bought Prepswift alongside gregmat but actually did not use it too much because I found it more boring, I like the little interactions that Greg has with his students because it simulates a more real-class feeling and kept me more engaged. Additionally, for me Prepswift was too much info too fast sometimes made me feel overwhelmed. However, other people have had much more positive experiences with Prepswift so I would try it out at least for a month (just 2 dollars extra), to see if you benefit from Prepswift or not. Last thing about Prepswift, the quizzes are really good, I didn't have enough time, so I stopped doing them after Day 4 of Week 1 plan, but if you have more time you should definitely do those.

**Verbal**

I have been a voracious reader throughout my life, particularly of financial and historical books (along with fantasy lol), so I must admit I was pretty comfortable with reading comprehension and so didn't have to put much effort into improving that at all. I essentially went from getting one reading comprehension question wrong per verbal section to zero using Greg's reading comprehension lectures. For reading comprehension, I personally do not recommend writing anything down, it is just too slow. Maybe for the one super long passage per section, you should write down the main idea per paragraph, but otherwise I would practice with the intention of never writing anything down, and creating a map in your mind of the way the passage is flowing/structured.

For text completion nailing the math strategy is key, block of 4, example, and previously referenced are key. But I actually listened to the videos where greg rephrases the math strategy as the ""puzzle / pieces"" strategy, and that helped me even more.

For Sentence equivalence pairing strategy is the absolute GOAT (Greatest of all time). Develop the vocab earlier then I did, I was memorizing brand new words of Week 4 - Day 6 and Day 7 till the last day before my exam. Memorize meanings, but also try to know the broad strokes synonyms. I did every single one of Greg's vocab quizzes and also listened to Greg give answers to the quizzes afterwards. Listening to him will build mental connections between the vocab words and their synonyms as he typically goes over many. I actually used to write down the meaning and a few synonyms (2-3) of every word that I got wrong, or found even slightly challenging per quiz.

I just did Greg's 840 words and didn't do anything else, and it worked out for me!

**Quant**

Greg's lectures really helped me learn the content. I actually got 168 on one of the practice tests for Quant, so was slightly disappointed I scored only 166 Quant irl. But practice a lot more then what I did. I essentially only finished Greg's one month curriculum on the day before my exam, practice more then I did so you don't regret it later like I did. Not talking more about Quant, because people with better Quant scores then me often post here and their advice is probably more useful.

**Writing Tips**

Before Greg I was scoring a 4 because coming from a science background I would write in very short sentences, get right to the point, and never offer a concession. I followed his template to the tee and my score on the ChatGPT practice instantly went to a 5. I wrote 6 practice essays total until I could score a 5.5 each and then on the exam I scored a 5.5. I would say I spent around 10 hours on essay practice, including the time it took for me to watch Greg's videos over two days.

Some quick tips, start writing two mins in even if you don't have all the points done. Your hook does not need to be great, even if it is extremely mediocre it works, focus on thesis and body 1 the most. Also type a ton, my 5.5 essays were all 750+ words. I type at 80 wpm for reference, so I don't actually type that fast compared to some other people. Also I do suggest a quick grammer check each paragraph like Greg suggests. This is actually done in my opinion, not just for the grammer, but also to  make you remember what the essay is about and what direction you are taking it.

**Practice Tests**

I wrote the two practice tests that come in GRE Official Pack. If you have time you should do more then me. Greg suggests doing one at end of Week 1. I would also do another one after Week 3. (skip the essay questions in both of these). I would do at least two practice tests with the essays so you are trained for the little bit of mental fatigue that sets in after writing two 750+ word essays in an hour.

**Overall**

One key tip, when studying or watching lectures you have to be doing that only, you can't be browsing reddit or twitter on the side. Particularly for the quant ones.

Thank you everyone who posts challenging questions here. This community has been great overall! 

The GRE is a bit of a slog for sure. For me my mantra was 3 hours a day (take only 1 day off a week at most, do not take a full weekend off, it will make it harder to get back in the groove on Monday, if you are going to take a day off I would actually take Wednesday off). Bit by bit, you can chew away and successfully digest the GRE.

Lastly, Thank you Greg you absolute legend, couldn't have done it without you!

15lbca0,11,2023-08-08,Researchers at UCLA found GPT-3 solved 80% of reasoning problems correctly compared with 60% of humans,u/GoatComfortable7598,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/15lbca0/researchers_at_ucla_found_gpt3_solved_80_of/,"I came across a fascinating study that shows how ChatGPT can solve problems at a level that matches or surpasses an undergraduate student.

Researchers found that the GPT-3 large language model that underpins the chatbot performed about as well as US college undergraduates when asked to solve reasoning problems that appear on intelligence tests or exams such as the American college admission test, the SAT.

Psychologists at the University of California, Los Angeles tested GPT-3’s ability to predict the next image in a complex array of shapes, after converting the images to a text format that the model could process and also ensuring the model would never have encountered the questions before.

The same problems were put to 40 UCLA undergraduates and the researchers found that GPT-3 solved 80% of the problems correctly, well above the average score of just below 60% for the human participants.

&#x200B;

[ The model was asked to solve reasoning problems that appear on intelligence tests or exams like the American college admission test, the SAT. ](https://preview.redd.it/0zzltjacdugb1.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=915b7682b4b94b9e84fdd30cbda2b9d5242f8515)

The researchers also prompted the model to solve some SAT “analogy” questions – selecting pairs of words that are linked in some way – that they believe had not been published on the internet and therefore could not have appeared in the vast amount of data it was trained on. When compared with college applicants’ SAT scores, the UCLA team found that the AI outperformed the average score for humans.

In another test the model did less well. The researchers asked it and the student volunteers to match a passage of prose with a different short story that conveyed the same meaning. In this test GPT-3 did less well than the students, although GPT-4 – the improved successor to GPT-3 – did better than its predecessor, according to the research, which was [published in the Nature Human Behaviour journal](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01659-w).

**Why it matters:**

* The study found that GPT-3 displayed a “surprisingly strong” capacity for spotting patterns and inferring relationships, “matching or even surpassing human capabilities in most settings”.
* People did not learn by ingesting the entire internet to their brains, so the training method from GPT-3 is completely different. In which case, it’s something brand new – a real artificial intelligence – which would be amazing in its own.

I got an undergraduate BS in Information and Decision Sciences (Business Analytics concentration). As a college student, I took one ML class using R and it was challenging but I liked the subject. Now I'm an incoming grad student majoring in Management of Technology (Data Analysis concentration) and I will start the program this fall. Since my major is a combination of data science and business, there aren't many ML-related courses from my program so I'm thinking of taking an online certificate course, ML specialization on Coursera. [https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction)

Do you think this program will help me improve my ML knowledge and is good for a beginner like me? I'm thinking of doing some beginner-intermediate-level projects after finishing the courses. Since I took some Python courses and one ML course, I know basic Python and the concept of ML.

Also, I wonder if companies are expecting their employees or future candidates to build or use ML models without using online sources like Google, ChatGPT, or StackOverflow. When I was doing my research, I used online sources to make some Python codes and I kinda felt guilty because I think I should've used my own knowledge.

And furthermore, these sites can generate and write detailed answers at length. Students (and myself) are using it more and more everyday. Teaching is somewhat at a crossroads, is it not?

ChatPGT and AI isn't necessarily a bad thing for teaching over all. The calculator which has become commonplace in every classroom changed math teaching perhaps just as much as AI is changing things today. But the calculator didn't make math as a subject  (or the human mind for that matter) completely obsolete, it merely changed the questions we could ask and possibilities in what could be taught and studied. Similarly, how will AI change teaching and studying?

How should one adapt to these changes? Learning to write and structure an essay is still an important thing to learn but using AI to get/write the answers is becoming so much more easier these days.

How are you adapting your teaching methods to this new world? Getting rid of essays all together or changing the questions? I for one feel quite lost in what to ask of my students but still feel somewhat exited for the possibilities of learning. ",User_deleted,0

15uiggv,1,2023-08-18,The trend of AI tools in 2023 after chatgpt's launch in the world of AI,u/jamesbrooke1,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/15uiggv/the_trend_of_ai_tools_in_2023_after_chatgpts/,"The year 2023 has witnessed a remarkable surge in the integration of AI tools across various sectors, and at the forefront of this technological leap stands the game-changing launch of ChatGPT. Developed by OpenAI, ChatGPT has not only revolutionized the field of natural language processing but has also set the stage for a new era of AI-powered applications. In this article, we'll delve into the prominent trends that have emerged in the AI landscape following ChatGPT's entrance onto the world stage.

1.  **AI's Penetration into Everyday Life**
    
    With ChatGPT's successful deployment, AI tools have become more prevalent and accessible to the general public. From personalized virtual assistants that schedule appointments and answer queries to AI-driven content generators that assist writers, people are experiencing the convenience of AI integration in their daily routines.
    
2.  **The Rise of Multimodal AI Tools**
    
    ChatGPT's debut has also prompted a shift towards [multimodal AI tools](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/multimodal-ai-multimodal-artificial-intelligence) that can handle not only text but also images, videos, and audio. This trend has led to the creation of AI systems capable of understanding and generating content across various media formats, enabling more immersive and engaging user experiences.
    
3.  **Enhanced Content Creation and Marketing**
    
    Content creation has taken a leap forward with the introduction of AI tools like ChatGPT. Marketers, bloggers, and authors are harnessing the power of AI to generate high-quality content, brainstorm ideas, and even create entire marketing campaigns. This trend has not only accelerated productivity but has also raised questions about authenticity and human creativity.
    
4.  **Collaboration between Humans and AI**
    
    The launch of ChatGPT has fostered a trend of collaborative writing between humans and AI. Writers, students and content creators are incorporating AI writing tools such as [Jasper](https://www.jasper.ai/), [CopyAI](https://copy.ai), [WordAI](https://wordai.com/) and [collegeessay.org's ai writer](https://collegeessay.org/ai-essaywriter) as digital co-writers, receiving suggestions, refining drafts, and enhancing their creative output. This symbiotic relationship between AI and humans is reshaping the creative process.
    
5.  **Ethical and Regulatory Concerns**
    
    The increased adoption of AI tools, including ChatGPT, has brought forth ethical considerations and regulatory discussions. Concerns about bias in AI-generated content, misinformation, and the responsible use of AI are gaining prominence. Researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders are working together to establish guidelines and frameworks to mitigate these risks.
    
6.  **Advancements in Education and Skill Development**
    
    AI tools are becoming valuable assets in the realm of education and skill development. With ChatGPT, individuals have access to personalized learning experiences, language practice, and writing assistance. The integration of AI tools in education is shaping how people acquire new knowledge and refine their abilities.
    
7.  **Innovation in Customer Interaction and Support**
    
    Businesses are embracing AI tools like ChatGPT to transform customer interaction and support. AI-powered chatbots are delivering instant and accurate responses to customer queries, enhancing user satisfaction and streamlining customer service operations.
    

The trends discussed in this article highlight the impact of AI on various facets of our lives, from communication to content creation, education, and beyond. As the AI landscape continues to evolve, it is imperative to navigate these trends with a keen awareness of ethical considerations, regulatory frameworks, and the balance between human ingenuity and AI innovation. The journey has just begun, and the road ahead promises further groundbreaking developments in the world of AI tools.",User_deleted,3
15wulqo,1,2023-08-20,So you want to get into the gaming industry? That's how,u/cant_hug_every_cats,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/15wulqo/so_you_want_to_get_into_the_gaming_industry_thats/,"Hey everyone,  
  
As someone who's been a level designer in the gaming industry for over 8 years, I've had the privilege to work with both triple-A giants like Ubisoft and Eidos, as well as indie gems like Sauropod and Pow Wow. After leading my own 8-member studio for a solid 2 years (despite a few funding hiccups), I'm really proud of what we achieved.  
  
Through the years, I've had the chance to teach game design at various universities across different countries. I've witnessed the same misconceptions, repeated errors, and common pitfalls over and over again. Whether you're a student or a junior hoping for a stable position, I'm here to share my two cent on how to break into the gaming industry.  
  
Now, please keep in mind that what I'm about to share is my personal opinion and approach. It's not a guaranteed formula, but it's what worked for me and many of my students.  
  
Also English isn't a native language for me so there might be some errors :D  
  
**Specialization is Key**  
  
Most of the portfolio have seen, the candidates present themselves as Game designer, Level Designer, Artist, Writer, Musician, etc... This is wrong!  
  
When recruiters are looking for a candidate they are looking for a specific position and saying that you know everything is a red flag and shows that you are not specialized in any.  
  
It's nice that you are curious and know a bit of everything but your focus should be only one of those, if you think you have enough content to do all those positions, then you'll need a separate portfolio and resume for each one of them.  
  
I still not recommend to choose one and go all since your Linkedin profile can show only one.  If you don't know which you should go with, look for the one you have more quality content to show or just go for the more technical one since it's always the most wanted in the industry.  
  
**Crafting Your Portfolio**  
  
Your portfolio is the window to your skills.

  
Content is as important as presentation, the colors, fonts, structure and anything related to it should be polished and attractive, there is thousand and thousand of template and examples online so don't try to reinvent the wheel, based yourself on something simple, minimalistic, so the attention goes towards your content. 

  
Keep it to max 3 polished projects/art/maps and do not in any case showcase Work in progress. If you only have works in progress then choose one and polish it to the max, it's better to have one polished project that 5 unfinished.  
  
Strategic screenshots are your secret weapon; overlay them with design intentions. Keep the text to a minimum. Why? Because those reviewing it are racing against the clock. Make every second count.  
  
**Your Resume**  
  
A single page – that's your resume's sweet spot.  
Even if your experience is slimmer than a pixel, squeeze in all relevant tidbits. Even that summer job at McDonald's holds a lesson in teamwork and discipline.  
  
The details matter: personal projects, game jams, mods – jot them all down. And don't forget to add your expertise with engines and tools like Photoshop or Illustrator.  
  
Typos are your mortal enemy. Keep it neat, and scout out templates that stand out.  
  
**LinkedIn & the Art of Networking**:  
  
This is where 99% of recruiters and companies in game industry operate, it's mandatory to have a complete linkedin profile with a profesional picture, like your resume, add every profesional experience even if it's not in game, add all your personal projects and game jams.   
  
You'll want to add all of your classmate and teachers and everyone you've met so far in your network, it's really important to stay up to date, participate and learn from what you can find there.  
  
All head hunters are there as well and always post about junior positions. This is not facebook, always stay polite and positive.  
  
Stay aware of events in your area, every GDC, Gamescom, MIGS, etc... There are hundreds of events in the world, can be big or small it doesn't matter, try to go, if you can't afford the entry then try to enter as voluntary.   
  
Join game dev online communities and stay active as much as possible to get yourself noticed (in a good way), share your portfolio asking for feedback, improve it a bit everyday.  
  
Do as much Game jam as possible, you'll be able to improve your skills and meet other devs, maybe other rookies looking for a job, but you don't know, tomorrow they might be the one looking for a new teammate at their new company.  
  
**Applying Strategically**  
  
Quality over quantity!!!!  
  
Do not randomly apply to everything, take the time to read every position, understand their needs, the type of company, the game they've made and the profile they're looking for.  
  
It can give other good ideas on stuff you should work to improve your portfolio. And also making sure the cover letter you attach fit 100% their expectation.   
  
Always take the time to look if you already have someone on your network that works there and ask them if they have any extra information about the position, they might offer to refer you directly, if they don't it's better not to ask.  
  
Do not apply for Sr/Lead or Director position if you have a Jr profile. Why? When recruiter post a position, they are looking for a specific profile and skills, applying to those jobs will just fill their inbox and make their job harder, it can end up having a negative impact on your profile.  
  
**In conclusion**  
  
There is probably thousands of more things than can be said but to me those are the most important and the most common mistake I've seen.   
  
Don't be picky about just wanting to work in triple A or indie, just take any position that would let you have your first experience, after that, it gets easier.   
  
If you don't have any answers, do not take personal, at the moment of writing this post it's a rough moment for the industry, lots of project cut, budget cut, people layed off and even for a Senior it's not as easy as it used to be.  
  
Don't stop learning, don't stop doing project with friends, game jams and anything that can push your skills.   
  
If you work hard, take feedback, improve and stay patient you will get a job in the industry, it can take maybe some years for some but you will make it eventually.  
  
  
**That's it!**  
  
And me? Well, While I look for my next Lead/Sr LD challenge.  
I'm dedicating my time to mentoring newcomers on portfolio creation (sorry, it's not free).  
  
If you're interested, drop me a message on Discord: llama\_delrey or connect on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/reyalize/  
  
I hope this post provides some insight into cracking the industry. Feel free to ask questions, feedback or share your thoughts in the comments!",User_deleted,89
15x8myv,1,2023-08-21,Why am I so afraid of quitting my job?,u/loan_delinquency,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/15x8myv/why_am_i_so_afraid_of_quitting_my_job/,"I (20F) am a college student (distance learning, majoring in accounting) currently working as a part-time paid intern at a tech company. I work remotely from 9 to 4 and have been in this job since December. The pay is good, and because my lifestyle is very low-cost, I've been able to save much more money than I thought I could at my age.

I'm not sure I have any concrete reasons to do so, but I don't like this job at all. I initially thought I had a bad boss until a new one arrived, passive-aggressively micromanaging everyone. I haven't enjoyed the job from the beginning, but I stuck with it because quitting would mean a significant loss of income for seemingly no reason. My routine was calm, and I know I tend to be a bit of a drama queen. I was afraid to make a drastic change based solely on my feelings.

Over the past year, I've also been working on an honors research project with a professor from a neighboring college with a great reputation for research. I've enjoyed doing the research and writing my paper, and the results have been promising. I received a small fellowship, and my paper received positive feedback during the mid-year checkpoint. My supervisor has also repeatedly offered to vouch for me during the admissions process for their graduate school if I decide to apply.

Initially, my plan was to save as much money as possible during the internship until the end of this year, then end the contract early (I wanted to leave in early  December 2023, while the contract is supposed to end in December 2024) and dedicate 2024 to intensive prep study for the master's program.

However, this month brought some bittersweet news. Due to a family member's health issue, my life is undergoing changes. I'm now splitting my time between two houses and have taken on a role in the family business where I used to tutor kids. Currently, I'm only tutoring after 4 p.m., but my available time is rapidly diminishing, and I'm finishing as late as 7 p.m. on most days. This leaves me with very limited time to study for my current college classes, let alone take extra courses to prepare for grad school.

The positive aspect of this tutoring job is the additional income. By working 8 hours a week (a little more than a single workday at my internship), I'm already earning a third of what I make there. This covers all my expenses and even allows for some savings. The job offers flexible scheduling and ample study time for college, qualifying exams, GMAT, etc., and I'll probably be able to keep it during graduate school.

However, I'm deeply afraid of quitting, for some reason. My boss was on vacation, and I scheduled a meeting on Friday to discuss my situation when he returned. Yet, over the weekend, I felt emotionally overwhelmed by the house move and the upcoming meeting; it's as if I secretly liked the job. The meeting just finished a few minutes ago, and I ended up making up an excuse that I had scheduled it to update him on the things that happened during his absence.

I occasionally question whether it's irresponsible to leave. I could push myself a bit and handle being overworked (for higher pay) for a few more months.

On the other hand, my tutoring hours are increasing, and I'm concerned about neglecting my college commitments. Work obligations are piling up, and I'm fearful of potentially having to retake a class or two simply because I stayed in a job I dislike, all for a few extra bucks and a fear of making more changes (I get stupidly attached to everything).

What is the stupidest choice between leaving and staying? I've spent the past few months seeking advice from ChatGPT, so the situation is clearly bad.

TL;DR: I'm scared of leaving my higher-paying job in favor of a second job that's still well-paid and offers more free time for studying and preparing for my future career. This fear might be tied to a resistance to change (particularly during a period marked by significant changes due to a family illness). I'm also kind of afraid that rejecting the chance to save more money and gain relevant work experience related to my degree might displease the career gods.",User_deleted,0
1618zx8,1,2023-08-25,ChatGPT Outperforms Students in University Assignments,u/AIsupercharged,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/1618zx8/chatgpt_outperforms_students_in_university/,"A recent study published in Scientific Reports has found that ChatGPT can match or even exceed the performance of students when answering assessment questions across a range of subjects.

If you want to stay on top of the latest trends and insights in tech, [look here first.](https://supercharged-ai.beehiiv.com/subscribe?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=university-assignments&utm_campaign=campaign)

https://preview.redd.it/hyrqlsen7bkb1.jpg?width=810&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=640c2964e82c32175ead21d5f11feb46d5ecb6ea

**Why this matters:**

* **AI is becoming a popular tool for students:** The study found that 74% of students surveyed would use ChatGPT to help with their assignments.
* **Educators view AI use as plagiarism:** Despite its popularity among students, 70% of educators view the use of AI like ChatGPT in schoolwork as plagiarism.
* **AI can outperform students in many courses:** In the study, ChatGPT-generated answers achieved a similar or higher average grade than students in 12 out of 32 courses—with maths and economics being the only two disciplines where students consistently outperformed AI.

**ChatGPT’s performance:**

* **Strong performance on factual knowledge questions:** Unsprisingly, ChatGPT outperformed the students on questions requiring factual knowledge.
* **Struggles with trick questions:** The AI model struggled most where trick questions were included in the assignment.
* **AI-text classifiers struggle to detect AI use:** Current AI-text classifiers cannot reliably detect ChatGPT’s use in schoolwork.

**The main takeaway:**

* **Educational institutions need to adapt:** These findings suggest that evaluating students through homework assignments may no longer serve its purpose in the age of AI.
* **Need for academic integrity policies:** Educational institutions need to craft appropriate academic integrity policies as a means of regulation.

162ze1x,1,2023-08-27,AI Weekly Rundown (August 19 to August 26),u/RohitAkki,ArtificialInteligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/162ze1x/ai_weekly_rundown_august_19_to_august_26/,"This week, OpenCopilot allows you to have your own AI copilot, LLMs are taught to personalize, and Luma introduces Flythroughs, an iPhone app that allows photorealistic, cinematic 3D videos. And much more..  


* **OpenCopilot- AI sidekick for everyone**  
\- OpenCopilot allows you to have your own product's AI copilot. With a few simple steps, it takes less than 5 minutes to build.  
\- It integrates with your underlying APIs and can execute API calls whenever needed. It uses LLMs to determine if the user's request requires calling an API endpoint. Then, it decides which endpoint to call and passes the appropriate payload based on the given API definition.
* **Google teaches LLMs to personalize**  
\- LLMs are already good at synthesizing text, but personalized text generation can unlock even more. New Google research has proposed an approach inspired by the practice of writing education for personalized text generation using LLMs. It has a multistage and multitask framework consisting of multiple stages: retrieval, ranking, summarization, synthesis, and generation.  
\- In addition, they introduce a multitask setting that further helps the model improve its generation ability, which is inspired by the observation that a student's reading proficiency and writing ability are often correlated. When evaluated on three public datasets, each covering a different and representative domain, the results showed significant improvements over various baselines.
* **AI creates lifelike 3D experiences from your phone video**  
\- Luma AI has introduced Flythroughs, an app that allows one-touch generation of photorealistic, cinematic 3D videos that look like professional drone captures. Record like you're showing the place to a friend, and hit Generate– all on your iPhone. No need for drones, lidar, expensive real estate cameras, and a crew.  
\- Flythroughs is built on Luma's breakthrough NeRF and 3D generative AI and a brand new path generation model that automatically creates smooth dramatic camera moves.
* **YouTube and Universal Music Partner to Launch ‘AI Incubator’**  
\- YouTube is partnering with Universal Music to launch an incubator focused on exploring the use of AI in music. The incubator will work with artists and musicians, including Anitta, ABBA's Björn Ulvaeus, and Max Ricther, to gather insights on generative AI experiments and research. YouTube CEO Neal Mohan stated that the incubator will inform the company's approach as it collaborates with innovative artists, songwriters, and producers.  
\- YouTube also plans to invest in AI-powered technology, including enhancing its copyright management tool, Content ID, to protect viewers and creators.
* **Snapchat’s Gen AI ‘Dreams’**  
\- Snapchat is set to introduce a new AI tool, “Dreams.” It aims to gear up its creative AI capabilities; this feature will allow users to take or upload selfies and have the app generate new pictures of them in imaginative backgrounds. Like other AI photo apps, Snapchat will require clear selfies with no obstructions or other people for better results.  
\- The company is also developing a feature called “Dreams with Friends,” where users can permit their friends to generate AI images with both of them included. References to purchasing Dream Packs suggest that this feature may be monetizable. 
* **40% Workers need to reskill, says IBM**  
\- According to a new IBM study, 40% of workers will need to reskill in the next three years due to the implementation of artificial intelligence. The study found that while AI will undoubtedly bring changes to the workforce and businesses, it is not necessarily for the worse.  
\- In fact, 87% of executives surveyed expect AI to augment roles rather than replace them. The study also highlights the importance of reskilling, with tech adopters who successfully adapt to technology-driven job changes experiencing an average 15% revenue growth rate premium. The report emphasizes that AI won't replace people, but people who use AI will replace those who don't.
* **Meta’s SeamlessM4T: The first all-in-one, multilingual multimodal AI**  
\- Meta has introduced SeamlessM4T, the first all-in-one multilingual multimodal AI translation and transcription model. This single model can perform speech-to-text, speech-to-speech, text-to-speech, text-to-text translations, and more for up to 100 languages without relying on multiple separate models.  
\- Compared to cascaded approaches, SeamlessM4T's single system approach reduces errors & delays, increasing translation efficiency & quality, delivering state-of-the-art results.  
Meta is also releasing its training dataset called SeamlessAlign and sharing the model publicly to allow researchers and developers to build on this technology.
* **Hugging Face’s IDEFICS is like a multimodal ChatGPT**  
\- Imagine a model with a ChatGPT-like understanding of natural language; now add best-in-class image capabilities. Hugging Face has released IDEFICS (Image-aware Decoder Enhanced à la Flamingo with Interleaved Cross-attentionS), an open-access visual language model (VLM). It is based on Flamingo, a SoTA VLM initially developed by DeepMind, which has not been released publicly.   
\- Similarly to GPT-4, the model accepts arbitrary sequences of image and text inputs and produces text outputs. IDEFICS is built solely on publicly available data and models (LLaMA v1 and OpenCLIP) and comes in two variants—the base version and the instructed version. Each variant is available at the 9 billion and 80 billion parameter sizes. We found a demo on X (🤭):
* **OpenAI enables fine-tuning for GPT-3.5 Turbo**  
\- OpenAI has launched fine-tuning for GPT-3.5 Turbo. Fine-tuning lets you train the model on your company's data and run it at scale. Early tests have shown a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5 Turbo can match, or even outperform, base GPT-4-level capabilities on certain narrow tasks. Here are the fine-tuning steps:  
\- OpenAI also said that none of fine-tuning data, input or output, will be used to train models outside of the client company. And that fine-tuning support for GPT-4 will arrive sometime later this fall.
* **Stability collabs with NVIDIA to 2x the AI Image gen speed**  
\- Stability AI has partnered with NVIDIA to enhance the speed of their text-to-image generative AI product, Stable Diffusion XL. By integrating NVIDIA TensorRT, a performance optimization framework, they have significantly improved the speed and efficiency of SDXL.  
\- The integration has doubled performance on NVIDIA H100 chips, generating HD images in just 1.47 seconds. The NVIDIA TensorRT model is also faster and better in latency and throughput than the non-optimized model on A10, A100, and H100 GPU accelerators. This collaboration aims to increase both the speed and accessibility of SDXL.
* **Figma launched an AI assistant powered by ChatGPT**  
\- Figma launched Jambot, an AI assistant integrated into its whiteboard software, FigJam. Jambot helps with brainstorming, creating mind maps, providing quick answers, and content rewriting, powered by ChatGPT.  
\- Users can boost productivity by using Jambot to initiate first drafts. Figma has been changing its design suite, including introducing Custom Color Palettes in FigJam and enhancing DevMode. The company plans to incorporate AI features into its platform, with recent acquisitions of Diagram and Clover Notes. 
* **CoDeF ensures smooth AI-powered video edits**  
\- Researchers have recently introduced CoDeF. A new video representation that consists of a canonical content field and a temporal deformation field. These fields are optimized to reconstruct the target video and support lifting image algorithms for video processing.  
\- CoDeF achieves superior cross-frame consistency and can track non-rigid objects. It can lift image-to-image translation to video-to-video translation and keypoint detection to keypoint tracking without training. Overall, CoDeF provides a novel approach to video processing that improves temporal consistency and enables various video editing tasks.
* **Meta’s coding version of Llama-2**  
\- Meta has released Code Llama, a state-of-the-art LLM capable of generating code and natural language about code from both code and natural language prompts. It is free for research and commercial use. It can also be used for code completion and debugging and supports many of the most popular languages today, including Python, C++, Java, PHP, Typescript (Javascript), C#, and Bash.  
Code Llama is built on top of Llama 2 and is available in three models:  
Code Llama, the foundational code model;  
Codel Llama - Python specialized for Python;  
and Code Llama - Instruct, fine-tuned for understanding natural language instructions.  
It is releasing in three sizes with 7B, 13B, and 34B parameters. Meta’s benchmark testing showed that Code Llama performed better than open-source, code-specific LLMs and outperformed Llama 2. However, it seems there was no 70B variant released.
* **Google, Amazon, Nvidia, and others pour $235M into Hugging Face**  
\- The open-source AI model repository got massive investments from Google, Amazon, Nvidia, and Salesforce as demand for AI model access grows. Other investors included AMD, Intel, Qualcomm, and IBM, all of whom also have invested significantly into generative AI foundation models or processors running these models.   
\- This latest financing brings Hugging Face’s valuation to $4.5 billion. The funds will be used to grow the team, currently at 170, and invest in more open-source AI and platform building.
* **Hugging Face’s Safecoder lets businesses own their own Code LLMs**  
\- Hugging Face has launched SafeCoder, a code assistant solution built for the enterprise. It is a complete commercial solution, including service, software, and support.  
\- For enterprises, the ability to tune Code LLMs on the company code base to create proprietary Code LLMs improves the reliability and relevance of completions to create another level of productivity boost. However, relying on closed-source Code LLMs to create internal code assistants exposes companies to compliance and security issues.   
\- With SafeCoder, Hugging Face will help customers build their own Code LLMs, fine-tuned on their proprietary codebase, using state-of-the-art open models and libraries, without sharing their code with Hugging Face or any other third party.

164f8uq,1,2023-08-29,Bootstrapping A $1m+ Ghostwriting Biz from Rural Ohio,u/HamptonFounders,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/164f8uq/bootstrapping_a_1m_ghostwriting_biz_from_rural/,"One of the cool things about my job is that you stumble on a bunch of people who are making $1-$5m or more per year on things you never thought could do that. One example is the [gravel guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/15284g4/this_guy_does_10m_with_6_employees_by_hauling/) I talked about a few weeks ago.

Here's another...

This guy makes over $1 million per year ghost writing books for clients. Not an agency - he actually does the writing himself.

He's got a couple of income streams, all based around roughly the same thing: ghostwriting services (expensive), online courses (like $99-$500 ea.), a cohort-based course, and a brand new paid newsletter that he charges $100/mo for.

But the ghostwriting is currently the bulk of it. And for the last 3 years it's brought in over $1m per year... Oh, and he lives in rural Ohio. So not even based in a major tech town or anything.

Cool example of what's possible.

He recently broke down the biz for me and I wanted to share it here. This is the full interview, and I tried to format it so it reads nice here.

I think my favorite two takeaways were...

1. He's got a Youtube video with just 2.1k views in 5 years, but that video has brought him over $2m in business - good reminder to focus on the metrics that actually matter in content marketing.
2. Rather than lower his prices when clients asked, he made a course that taught their employees how to do exactly what he does, then sold that to them for like $100. They ended up hiring him anyways because the course was so good, they just wanted the guy. That's a cool hack any service biz can and should use.

He gets into some cool stuff like his top growth channels, favorite books, where he sees untapped potential for other people to get into the space, and more. Hope you enjoy!

# Hello! Who are you and what business did you start?

I'm the only Certified Ghostwriter + Certified Hypnotist in the world (California State University Long Beach and the National Guild of Hypnotists, respectively).

Lisec Ghostwriting is a 7-figure ghostwriting business in Columbus, Ohio—one of the only such successful businesses in the industry that is not a ghostwriting agency; I ""do the work"" for clients.

I've done ""celebrity"" memoirs and have written mainstream bestsellers and award-winners, but our preferred aspiring author now is the expert who is not yet a recognized authority; they're in the pursuit of excellence, but they're they best-kept secret. That's my type.

We also ""[ghostpublish](https://lisecghostwriting.com/ghostpublishing/)"" clients' books if they have no interested in pursuit a traditional book deal.

In May, we launched a done-with-you alternative to my premier ghostwriting services called [Author•ity](https://lisecghostwriting.com/authority/) Accelerator (this version of my services is scalable, unlike 1-on-1 work). We exceeded expectations by 250%.

Lisec Ghostwriting published my magnum opus nonfiction work on June 15th 2023, 12 years to the day I got paid to ghostwrite for the first time. So Good They Call You a Fake was an instant #1 international Amazon bestseller and has eclipsed 3,000 copies sold.

In January, I co-founded an AI marketing SaaS called [WordOut](https://wordoutapp.com/). It's both a content repurposer and social media scheduler that uses prompts I've spent the first half of 2023 months writing and fine-tuning. The first product-market/niche fit we're observing is with authors and agencies that market for authors. Authors simply upload their book chapters and within seconds have months of social media content.

What to me is most remarkable about my journey as a ghostwriter is that my very first freelance writing gig paid $1.67/hour, but Lisec Ghostwriting has become a 7-figure business 3 years in a row now. That and I’ve ghostwritten more than 80 books for CEOs, entrepreneurs, and celebrities; that’s fun, too.

My [TEDx Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7fX7sgp-NE) tells the story of the early years.

# What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?

My dream as a child was to write novels for a living. I got a two-book independent publishing deal at age 20. I was homeschooled, so noteworthy professional success before you can legally drink is all but required. The two novels were pitched as “Indiana Jones for millennials” (It worked.)

Then, upon publication of both books, something funny happened. I did the online promotion, the limited-time giveaways, the author panels, the selfies with fans on flip phones (so they came out off-center and blurry)—the whole shebang you'd expect of a first-time author who wants to “make it.” Amid those book promotion efforts, everything changed.

Two readers—both of whom knew me from my low-key freelance writing side gig at the time—asked me the exact same question. (No, they didn’t know each other.)

“Joshua, I enjoyed your novels so much, I’d like you to write my book for me; can you help?”

Both askers were over sixty. Both also confided in me that they’d wanted to write their book longer than I’d been alive. My novels read so well, they said, that they wanted me to write their memoirs “like a novel.” Characters, dialogue, three-act stories, plot twists, and all. 

Not knowing that ghostwriting was even a thing, I said to both aspiring authors, “OK, sure. I’ll help you with your book.""

And I’ve been saying “OK, sure” ever since.

# Take us through the process of building and launching the first version of your product.

It took me 2.5 years to write my first novel; it took me 2.5 months to finish my last book.

As I said, ghostwriting memoirs took me on a detour from my intended life path of fiction series author. But I continuously pivoted in the direction of what professional services that I could sell that my early author clients wanted.

Upon finishing the first draft of a nonfiction book for a prolific inventor-turned-author, I was asked, “OK, Joshua, now what?” The “now what” is the question numerous aspiring authors reach. Now what do they do about publishing?

That one question, I’ve answered with my own new innovation: Ghostpublishing (trademark pending). It’s the union of what works in both self-publishing and traditional publishing, minus the cons of both.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-hH8SHWel0 

The way we pitch Ghostpublishing as part of the Lisec Ghostwriting process is this: Ghostpublishing gives you a business. The other guys gives you a Word document.

Because unless that book is published and published right, it’s not a real book. Traditional publishing requires submitting to cosmopolitan gatekeepers, waiting two to five years, and relinquishing creative control to subcontractors who likely have zero background in your industry.

For the serious professional, traditional publishing is unacceptable. Still, the independent alternative—self-publishing—seems no better. If any ole Joel can upload a file to Amazon and sell it for $0.99, any ole Joel will.

At present, Amazon lists 32.8 million books for sale, a hefty share of which are self-published tripe that sells fewer than one copy.

An industry-disrupting, civilization-altering book deserves better than the online equivalent of the slush pile. And that’s why we give every manuscript we work on the best it deserves; we turn good ideas into tangible literary assets.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpX1Dp69uQo 

Today, launching such books through Ghostpublishing, where authors’ books are published under their own imprint, not some made-up fantasy name, is a turnkey experience for both Lisec Ghostwriting and the authors we service.

One of the latest high-profile Ghostpublishing clients is the Dilbert creator and New York Times bestselling author Scott Adams.

# Since launch, what growth channels have been most effective for you?

From 2011 through 2016, growth was painful. Then I took to YouTube, and we went from Joshua as a 5-figure earner to multiple six-figures-plus every year since.

On YouTube, I targeted “bottom of the funnel” (BoFu) keywords related to book writing, ghostwriting, book publishing, and more. I wrote tight video scripts and offered a call-to-action at the end of each video I recorded in a spare bedroom: “Book a consultation with me if you’re ready.” Those first 100 videos, low professional quality as they may be, were the #1 revenue generator for 4 years, from 2017 through 2021. 

This video has only 2,100 reviews since 2017, but it has generated in excess of $2 million.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HvZJHHAZdU&t= 

That’s when I began taking Twitter seriously, posting up to 20 times per day. Make the algorithm like you, and the algorithm will make others like you, too. About 80% of my posts are marketing/promotional posts for whatever I happen to be focused on selling at a given time, be it my book So Good They Call You a Fake or the Author•ity Accelerator done-with-you program for authors.

# Did you ever have an “oh shit” moment where you thought it wouldn’t work?

It was February 2020.

We all remember what went down and why. What happened to me happened to millions of small business owners around the world. Clients, gone. Businesses, shuttered for months by the government. Some took advantage of this—the perfect excuse to stiff their vendors for services already rendered.

My wife and I had just closed on our future dream home. It was a real fixer-upper, but we ran the numbers; our current book of business would cover the multiple six figures’ worth of repairs, renovations, and moving expenses, making our little domestic paradise a reality. 

We’d already hired the contractors and work was well underway when the lockdowns struck. Week after week I got email after email . . . I’m so sorry, Joshua, but we have to pause working with you because the state literally won’t let us open our doors.

OK. Well. At least we could count on incoming payments from clients for services already rendered.

So we thought.

One client with the largest outstanding invoice (which would have paid our mortgage for almost a year) sent me an “update,” the gist of which was:

Due to global instability amid the novel coronavirus epidemic, we are suspending all pay to all contractors effective immediately.

That, of course, is illegal.

She, of course, didn’t care.

But I was not about to pull the same integrity-free stunt on all the people hired to work on our new home. So I had to come up with an income solution that worked, and fast—or we were so screwed.

For a few months, I scraped by with clients who begged for steep discounts on my writing services. But the most common inquiry during the spring and summer months was for advice, not “write this for me, please.” By advice, I mean, how to do it themselves. One such company, a consulting startup, worried I was too expensive to hire outright. They’d had a problem with hired ghostwriters in the past—they were terrible. The founders had spent more time rewriting drafts than it would have taken to just write the damn things themselves.

These guys asked me if I could record a video course for their team of contractors, maybe give them some sort of checklist to improve their writing and cut down time needed to edit.

And I answered by creating my first persuasive writing course, The Best Way to Say It, subtitled, Write Anything Effectively in 500 Words or Less (later changed that for obvious reasons).

So I sent the consulting guys the course link, and they bought it for $99. Then, a few days later, they hired me outright for $6,000 a month (!) because even though they believed the course could train their team, it was just faster to work with the person who could do it all for them.

An undeniable demonstration of proficiency will do that.

As the Bible says, “What has been will be again,” and the course-customer-to-full-service-writing-client pipeline has stayed open since those consulting guys. Within the last calendar year as of this writing, two different six-figure ghostwriting clients told me, “I bought The Best Way to Say It to watch how you work to make sure you’re not full of s—.”

Yes, they both cussed. Be so good they swear at you!

The true story of The Best Way to Say It is more than the upsells it generates; I expanded and deepened the original subject matter of the course into “sequels,” spinoffs, and masterclasses, from self-editing workshop Write This, Not That to the aforementioned hypnowriting program The Best Way to Copywrite It. The original Best Way was a perennial bestseller on online course platform Gumroad, and more than 2,800 people have purchased a Best Way product to date. Most of them have wanted to be students, not clients, and about half of them bought two or more courses from my e-library.

# Can you break down the keys to this business model for us? What makes it work? And What do outsiders typically not understand about your industry?

What makes Lisec Ghostwriting work is that we are not an agency. We do not pass off books from the founder to an unknown freelancer. That’s a great way to scale a business (or to scale a business right out of business, wink-wink). But the best don’t hire unknowns; the best way to hire the best. So our promise is a 99th percentile book for leaders who are used to that in all areas of their lives and businesses.

This means ghostwriting has, for me, an excellent margin, as the prime cost of goods sold is . . . me, Joshua Lisec the Ghostwriter! However, the fixed costs associated with Ghostpublishing are such that we do not offer it as a standalone service to most authors who already have a completed book. We prefer to work exclusively with authors who need a book and need it published. No Ghostpublishing without Ghostwriting, otherwise it’s not worth my time. And the reason is simple—we don’t publish the gutter. We have had authors come to us with “finished” books and a budget for publishing, and I said not no but hell no and never speak to me again your book is that bad.

OK, that’s a wee extreme, but you get the idea. If you have to argue with me that your book is “good, actually,” it’s not. You know it. I know it. Everybody knows it. Or they will, if you publish it yourself. Which we will not help you do.

As for the business of ghostwriting, many assume it’s interviews, transcripts, followed by a culling of uh’s and um’s. That’s no book. That may be how “scribes” do it, but that the end result is not a masterpiece that will drive results for your business. We turn persuasive books into unstoppable business-builders. So we do interview authors, but I, Joshua the Ghostwriter, shape clients’ ideas from good to better to The Best Way to Say It™.

You might imagine that a business with results so good needs little advertising, and you’re right. Roughly 50% of new business comes from past client referrals. And what’s notable about the referrals is how public they are. It’s rare and even unheard of for authors to “out” that they had a ghostwriter, even rarer to name their ghost and tell the world to hire them, too. And yet is exactly what Lisec Ghostwriting does—our results are so good you have to tell everyone you hired us!

The downside of such a remarkable high-touch services business is the lack of scalability to a point. That’s why we are transitioning from 90% of revenue deriving from services, to closer to a 50/50 balance between products and services, with the premier product being a monthly premium newsletter with live Q&A with me. Each month’s topic is an advanced persuasion technique that is both ungoogleable and unChatGPTable. We already have 82 subscribers but plan to 10X that by Summer 2024.

# What platform/tools are absolutely crucial for your business?

Our favorite project management tool is ClickUp. Our go-to for Team Lisec communication is Slack. For bookkeeping we use QuickBooks Online. All information products are hosted on Gumroad. And our email service provider is ConvertKit. But a little-known essential market research tool for our Lisec Ghostwriting clients is Publisher Rocket.

# What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?

The two books that changed my life for the better forever were Getting Everything You Can out of All You’ve Got by Jay Abraham and The $100 Startup by Chris Guillebeau. The former taught me to think like a marketer in every aspect of my services business, and the latter taught me to keep expenses low as long as possible and thus profits high to make this thing “worth it” to keep at through the ups and the downs.

# Where do you see untapped opportunity in the market? What business do you wish someone else would build that would make your job easier?

At least 75% of our authors have a podcast. That multiplies their reach and ultimately their success. If you have a book, you also need a podcast. And if you hired a ghostwriter for your book, you might consider hiring a “ghostproducer” for your podcast as well.

# What are some strong opinions you have about leadership, and how do you actually put those into practice in your company?

I’ve ghostwritten for more vacuous executives and entrepreneurs than most business people have ever had the displeasure of meeting. That’s why I am pickier about who I let hire me now. It’s also why I focus on zones of competence and incompetence. What I know I know, I “call the shots” with gusto and frequency. But where I recognize I do not know something or suspect I may not know what I don’t know, I vocalize that early and often to my team. 

Daily back-and-forth updates with key staff, weekly calls with the project manager, and quarterly CFO-led meetings all facilitate that.

164p85i,1,2023-08-29,I feel insulted when AI usage guidelines pop up,u/WrittenInDreams,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/164p85i/i_feel_insulted_when_ai_usage_guidelines_pop_up/,"After coming back to university, the one thing I noticed that changed from last year is the sheer amount of acceptance of students using ChatGPT for work and other essay/short answer assignments. My professors accept that it's never going to be detected and incorporated its existence into the class lessons as a means to facilitate thought.

I'm glad my professors are finding ways to circumvent AI and are able to still make students think. There are some awesome ways to force the students to think for themselves and use their brains in a more critical way.

On the other hand, being told that the class can use ChatGPT just...insults and demeans my ability as a human, as though they were *suggesting* I'm not capable of completing a full and complete thought on my own.

This is personal for me because I write loads. I have hundreds of short stories and mini novellas that I never posted online. I even wrote fake history for a fantasy world- *multiple* fictional world settings over the course of the past decade or so. I drew dozens of pictures for my D&D groups and for myself, and I take pride in knowing I accomplished learning anatomy, lighting, and values on my own. I take pride in creating stuff. 

Having that creative thinking be churned out in a few seconds insults the time and effort I put into my work. Pride as a sin be damned, I *will* take pride in my work regardless of whether it's beneficial to society or not. I ***love*** being able to make stuff for people *and* for myself no matter how bad or unoriginal it is. Then, in the past couple years, suddenly everything I like to do can be completed instantly using AI, destroying the merits of my work and the years of effort I took to get to a point where I can say something I created is *good*. Then after that demoralizing idea, people suggesting that I use AI in an academic setting is even *more* insulting.

AI attacks the point where I gather my self esteem and feeling of competence. Writing something good is hard. Drawing something good is *even harder*. Then suddenly it becomes the easiest thing in the world, and all my work suddenly looks like a hop and skip away. I don't mean to say this to be snobby to people just getting into the hobby, but it just feels awful when suddenly the ceiling of effort for proficiency falls and squashes mine. I feel lucky I picked a career that doesn't directly work with the things that can be easily replaced with AI, but my hobbies are a point of pride.

Sure, I can understand using AI to simplify tedious tasks. In this economy, we need all the shortcuts we can get, but using it as a replacement for thought? It's lazy, exploitative, and you call yourself a brainless idiot when using AI as a substitute for your own thinking and efforts. Using it as a means to write out your thoughts also demeans your ability to express and communicate. Thinking and speaking for yourself is so important as an adult. The use of AI in the classroom implies that I, as well as my classmates, can't use our brainholes to do that.

I hate it because now I *have* to prove to my professors that I can think without a robot. If I can't *think*, then I don't deserve to say I *am.*",active,1
