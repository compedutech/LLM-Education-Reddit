I'm a game developer student and a total nerd. I'm super into making games and I'm using my school projects to build up my own game and portfolio. My husband, who used to just play games, got inspired by me and now wants to be a game developer and do 3D printing too. It's kinda cool, but that's not really what I'm here to talk about.

You see, before I went back to school, I had a job that paid well, like $30 an hour, but I really didn't like it. My husband was the one who pushed me to go back to school. He promised to support me until I graduated, giving me two years to start making money again. I was scared to depend on him, worried that he'd hold it against me if I wasn't working. But he assured me it would be fine.

So, three years later, I got brave enough to go back to school. It was the best decision I've ever made! But, after my savings (which lasted about three months) ran out, my husband started nudging me to make money again. He'd bring up the fact that I'm not earning whenever he was upest or if I broke something by accident and would randomly joke about it. It really hurts when he does that.

In school, I'm all about game development. I'm working on game assets, levels, and even drafting a trailer that I'll animate soon. Plus, I'm networking (in person, and online) and getting my portfolio ready. When I show my husband my work, he's either not interested or just says ""nice"" and that's it. Sometimes, he doesn't say anything.

 When he saw me messing around with AI and making a mini diary ebook for fun, he got ideas to make money from it. He's like, ""I need you to use ChatGPT to create an ebook to sell,"" or ""Come up with a business idea,"" or ""Make me a game trailer and music,"" or ""3D print stuff for me."" But he's not clear about what he wants and doesn't help much. I will try to give list of names ideas for a business,  he wouldn't respond or don't like them, I will try to give tips for him to brainstorm like ""what are your favorite words?"" ""What is your passion?"" ect. He will always say I don't know and it's like hitting a brick wall. But he will see a glimpse of me making music for my game then ask me to make music for his trailer and the style he wants i can't do he assume i can because he only sees the software. (He never heard any of my music I would send him my music through chat for him to listen and he will say he can't because his phone can't play mp3. He has a Samsung galaxy,  or i will actually play it on my phone for him to hear and i swear to god he zone out on tiktok or reddit ignoring it, no comment.) 

At first, I tried to do some stuff for him, like 3D printing and designing logos. But then he gets upset when I haven't finished his projects. I'm super busy with my schoolwork. I'm taking 4-6 classes to keep my financial aid, so I've got a lot on my plate. When I tell him I'm doing alot (probably not but it feels like it to me.) He said he was going to school full time and working full time. I mean that's cool and I know what I got isn't alot but to me I can get pretty overwhelmed with my classes. 

When I asked him to learn some of the stuff he's interested in and offer him the courses I bought to teach me even more how to start game development and 3d modeling, he said he's too busy and wants me to do it, but he just play games all day. I never complain because I love games. He even brings up the ebook project that I started but stopped. I've asked him why he can't do it himself since I have homework, but he thinks my school stuff isn't as important. I lowkey just want to work on my projects and now I'm actively looking for a job because I don't like feeling like a burden but he's telling me I don't have to do that which is confusing the hell out of me. Don't get me wrong I would love to work together but his new goals being push on me feels one sided.

I'm just here to rant, 'cause I don't really have anyone else to talk to about this stuff. Thanks for reading.

18cu96t,3,2023-12-07,ChatGPT helps with studying.,u/kedayni_,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/18cu96t/chatgpt_helps_with_studying/,"Hello! I'm a first year college student, and ChatGPT helps me learn with quite a bit. Here is a recent chat I had when I asked it to help me study for finals. [I asked it to create a test](https://chat.openai.com/share/b0a50539-39df-4610-ac59-dff21f460f41), it took about 5 hours given the information I presented. I thought this was extremely interesting. 

There are a few times in the chat where I ask it repeatedly if it is done yet; I know OpenAi doesn't give time stamps but that was over the course of the entire 5 hours. I would assume it finished sometime late a night, but I ended up going to bed and when I woke up first thing this morning it had completed it. 

I'm by no means a professional or even an amateur when it comes to machine learning, but I will be asking Chat multiple questions to try and learn everything about that process that happened.  I wanted to share this with reddit just to either get some extra feedback and/or see if others have tried something similar. 

Thanks!!",active,7

I'm a 3rd grade med student. While I was practicing writing in German for a student exchange program, I've noticed the positive effect of ChatGPT on my journey. (I was asking for a text and translating and getting a subsequent feedback etc..). Even though at the time I was doing this it was GPT3.5 model, it was good. Now with GPT-4 I've seen major improvements especially in evaluation phase.

After that I started to develop a website specifically for language learners who want to practice writing but don't have anyone to take feedback from.

I'm gonna keep it short, this is my website (not launched yet, waitlist is open), what do you think? Any suggestions positive/negative will be highly appreciated. Thanks!

I teach English as a Foreign Language in a high school outside of the US.

**Rubric Building**: It's fantastic for creating and populating rubrics. You can provide it with a few criteria like grammar, fluency, and poise, and it can generate a rubric based on that input. It's simple to tweak the points, weights and definitions. 

**Writing Advice**: I've found that it's most precise when I walk through the process step by step. To provide writing advice, I first had ChatGPT brainstorm 30 different issues that students like mine might encounter. Then, I replaced some of the more serious issues with lighter ones (e.g., from pregnancy to wanting a new iPhone). Afterward, I had ChatGPT compose letters to a friend as if they were facing these specific problems, changing gender and names for each scenario. I also asked it to use more advanced vocabulary and syntax earlier in the letter. As I copied and pasted the letters into my Word document, I numbered them for easy differentiation when assigning them to students. I did it all step by step to ensure quality and make sure we stayed on task, but it allowed me to give individualized problems of differing difficulty to all of my students.  It's really nice when you can give a football player a problem from another football player, and a preening girl a problem of another preening girl who has 4 boys wanting attention.  

**Famous Person Jigsaw**: A jigsaw assignment involves students seeking answers from various sources. For this, I had ChatGPT generate a list of famous people, which I tweaked to include the individuals I wanted. Then, I devised matching data to include in the assignment. For instance,you might have Abraham Lincoln and your friend has Mandela, on the first sheet, I included all the famous people's birthdates, and on the second sheet, details like how they died or any other relevant information. Students had to interact with each other to gather the necessary information to complete their tables. I also had ChatGPT create cloze articles (paragraphs with blanks) about each person, excluding key information, so students could fill in the gaps based on their research.

**Desert Island Lesson**: This is a variation of the classic scenario where you have 20 items on a boat but can only keep 5, and you're stranded on an island. I provided students with a list of 30 different items to choose from, with each group receiving the same list, numbered for reference. Then, I assigned a random disaster, such as an earthquake, flood, or hurricane, and students had to select 7 items they wanted based on their disaster scenario. I set up ChatGPT to play the role of ""Danger Ranger,"" understanding the lesson and providing feedback directly to the students about their choices.  I put ChatGPT up on the big comptuer screen and it would let them know what was good and bad about their selections and estimate how long they might survive. ( ChatGPT does not want to kill students, no matter how much I tried, it  was always wary about telling them they were going to die - maybe that  is good for our future. The students loved hearing that they only had a day to live, but ChatGPT wouldn't say it, so I had to tell them. In fact, ChatGPT edited out all of this and I had to put it back in.) 

It's highly effective for differentiation, simplification, and translation. I can provide it with something I've written and ask it to simplify it to an A2 language level or translate it into the target language, and it is useful in both areas. I use ChatGPT 4, which allows me to create drawings and use the art for lessons regularly.

**Lesson Writing**: I frequently use it to brainstorm various ideas and methodologies for presenting material. Although I'm not always sure about its evaluations because ChatGPT tends to respond positively, even when the ideas might not be all that great.

...In conclusion, ChatGPT has proven to be incredibly encouraging in my  classroom, even though it may have occasional difficulties with timing and numbers. Its versatility and adaptability have significantly enhanced my teaching experience....

18jg5yu,58,2023-12-15,"Looking back past the finish line, my OMSCS review",u/a_bit_of_byte,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/18jg5yu/looking_back_past_the_finish_line_my_omscs_review/,"Well y’all, based on the grade I saw on NLP’s project 5 (before it was disappeared), it’s mathematically certain that I’m graduating this semester. I loved this program, but I’m also really glad to have free time back in my life. I thought I would do a quickish write-up, both for the sweet, sweet catharsis but also to put my review out in the wild for anyone that’s curious what it’s like to cross the finish line, or thinking about starting. First, the quantifiable stuff most folks are curious about:

Me:
- Graduated with a B.S in Computer Science from a state school in 2015
- Married, no kids
- Living overseas
- No CS industry experience

Coursework:
Spring 2022
- CSE 6242: Data Visualization
- CSE 6743: Simulation, Modeling, and Military Wargaming

Summer 2022
- CS 6601: AI

Fall 2022
- CS 6035: Intro to Information Security
- CS 7641: Machine Learning

Spring 2023
- CS 7646: Machine Learning for Trading
- CS 6300: Software Development Process

Summer 2023
- CS 6603: AI, Ethics, and Society

Fall 2023
- CS 6205: Computer Networks
- CS 7650: Natural Language Processing

Thoughts:
My motivations for starting CS were mainly career-motivated (looking to get into the software industry in the next 3-5 years) but also a personal love of academic work. I was also really curious about how ML works, and I felt like OMSCS would be a productive way to go down that rabbit hole. I started in 2022, before ChatGPT was a thing and the AI boom we’re in had taken off. The timing couldn’t have been better for me, personally. 

When I first enrolled in the program, I was concerned that it would be tough for me to get back into the swing of things. I haven’t ever programmed professionally, and it had been quite a while since I was last in school. I found two classes I thought would be easy-ish, (a good call) and dove in. Overall, I found that I was a much better student as an adult in my late 20’s than when I was fresh out of high school, so the stress was misdirected on that one.

I kinda did a mild speed run of the program [23 months, Any%], but that’s due to specific career constraints. My job was paying the bills, so I needed to be done within two years. It’s a pretty difficult pace, and lead to a few sleepless nights and a lot of stress and juggling priorities. I was working full-time while enrolled (8-12 hours a day, usually 5 days a week), and my typical workday schedule was:
4:00am - wake up
4:30am - start studying
7:30am - get ready for work
8:00am through 6:00pm - work
6:00pm - 8:00pm - dinner and get ready for bed

I decided to wake up early to do schoolwork because that’s when I’m at my peak focus. I definitely don’t think that’s required for everyone, but it works for me. 

On the weekends, I just churned away at stuff until it was done. Definitely a few weekends where I didn’t get to do any social stuff, but I was usually able to go out to eat with friends or hang out with my spouse in the evenings. I was also still able to travel for work or family events (weddings and such), and could usually put off school stuff until I got back, so I still got to do a lot of neat stuff while working on the program, but YMMV. Between workdays and weekends, I typically spent about 15-30 hours a week on OMSCS. 

If you’re reading this and wondering if you should give the program a go, my first piece of advice is that you need to get your family’s endorsement. Look at the schedule I discussed and honestly ask yourself “is this a commitment I can support while meeting the needs of those in my life that depend on me?” My wife definitely had to endure (or occasionally relish in) spending less time with me, and I wasn’t exactly going above and beyond on the chores around the house. If you have kids, this probably becomes a *much* more difficult decision. 

My second piece of advice is that, if you’re nervous about being out of school and jumping back in, don’t be. You’re probably a much better organized person now than when you were in your late teens, and can manage deadlines and other commitments. 

My third piece of advice is to consider what else you’re losing. This program is cheap in terms of money (really cheap, actually), but if you have hobbies you really enjoy, you’ll find that you’ll have far less time to pursue them. Personally, I really like video games. 2023 has been an excellent year for them, but I spent most of my time in Jupyter notebooks. Even when traveling, I had to sacrifice time I would have spend wondering around to watch lectures and ensure my assignments were getting submitted. 

Conclusion:
All in all, I accomplished what I set out to do. I satisfied (and fueled) my academic curiosity about Machine Learning. I think I’m a much better programmer as a result, and my mindset has shifted in a lot of ways. I think of myself as someone that can solve hard problems now, the kinds I would have probably shied away from before. It’s been great for my confidence and sense of self-worth, and it’s hard to quantify how valuble that is. 

In a way, I see posts on this sub from others asking about auditing courses to continue learning after graduation. I get it. I kind of don’t want that part of this experience to end. But the sacrifices I’ve made to get here were pretty steep. I’m writing this from an airplane on my way home, and for once I’m not hunched over the try table, trying to take notes and get through lecture material so I can go home and churn away on a new assignment. I’ve got a relived spouse and a new Steam Deck OLED (graduation gift to myself that I’m pretty jazzed about) waiting for me at home, and I think it’s time to get back to regular life for a while. I’m thinking that I might find some open source projects to contribute to, so I can stay fresh and put my new-found skill set to use for the greater good, and I’m really excited for the future.",active,65

I am interested in two topics related to middle school education:  
\- How to lessen the workload for teachers (this study is part of this topic)  
\- How to help students with cognitive challenges by creating a feedback loop between their cognitive abilities and the results they get from a GPT assistant.

The result is impressive, and I hope to see more sophisticated GPTs and assistants that can achieve these goals in a way that reduces the workload for teachers and enhances the students' development.

Picture this challenge: guiding AI systems that outsmart human intelligence. It's like trying to keep up with a super-smart friend—tricky, right?

&#x200B;

[A simple analogy for superalignment: In traditional machine learning \(ML\), humans supervise AI systems weaker than themselves \(Left\). To align superintelligence, humans will instead need to supervise AI systems smarter than them \(center\). Open AI says they cannot directly study this problem today, but they can study a simple analogy: can small models supervise larger models \(right\)?](https://preview.redd.it/p1ic2ii51i6c1.png?width=2041&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a2922fd13876620616b74278d3c6d7a2d8d9339)

P.S. If you are into the AI world just like me then consider checking out [my newsletter](https://businessbloopers.beehiiv.com/). Back to the post. 

So, here's the cool part. The researchers tried something new, kind of like using a smaller buddy to guide a bigger, smarter friend. They used a GPT-2-level AI as the guide for GPT-4, and guess what? It worked! The super-smart model started performing closer to the level of GPT-3.5. It's like giving your friend a few tips, and suddenly they become a pro. 

Open AI says (to clear this up in case some of you got confused), ""We can significantly improve generalization in many settings. We use a simple method that encourages the strong model to be more confident—including confidently disagreeing with the weak supervisor if necessary. **When we supervise GPT-4 with a GPT-2-level model using this method on NLP tasks, the resulting model typically performs somewhere between GPT-3 and GPT-3.5.** We are able to recover much of GPT-4’s capabilities with only much weaker supervision.""

They go on to say that this is just a proof of concept with important limitations; for example, it still doesn't work on ChatGPT preference data. They found signs of life with other approaches, such as optimal early stopping and bootstrapping from small to intermediate to large models.

[Typical weak-to-strong generalization across NLP benchmarks: They use a GPT-2-level model as a weak supervisor to finetune GPT-4.](https://preview.redd.it/qhhu6zl65i6c1.png?width=1186&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cb7c26944bd2d683a50ba7a8887ba16a517c048)

What's really cool is that the researchers aren't keeping this discovery to themselves. They're sharing the secret sauce—the open source code for experiments with this guiding idea. Plus, they're throwing in a whopping $10 million to support graduate students, academics and other researchers to work on superhuman AI alignment broadly.",active,17

However, my last period class can be pretty rowdy. The students don't make any comments that are rude toward me, but at the same time they don't listen. Usually, some students are standing and chatting randomly, playfighting/wrestling with each other, or on the phone while we do a lesson or activity. 

Today, it was particularly rowdy as they started interacting with students in the hallway, wouldn't listen to any instructions, wouldn't sit down, wouldn't keep quiet, etc. I try to stay pretty calm and even joke around with them for them to calm down, but they were still at it.

Near the end of the period, I actually got pretty upset with them and threatened to call their parents/guardians tomorrow if this continues this week. I gave them a mini lecture on behaviour and called them out on many other things I haven't been impressed with (using ChatGPT, not using work periods, gaming on their phone during a lesson, etc.). 

I really don't like doing this because sometimes I think ""what if I'm being too mean"" or ""what if they turn it against me now because I got mad""

18mho71,1,2023-12-19,Best approaches for getting students to read a book for the class?,u/essendoubleop,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/18mho71/best_approaches_for_getting_students_to_read_a/,"I taught a seminar class a few years ago right before the pandemic that involved having in class discussions each week based on different chapters of the book.  They had to bring their discussion points to class, showing they were prepared, then broke into small groups to discuss the material together.  It was really great and I had a lot of fun teaching it.  

It wasn't perfect though, I knew not every student was reading their chapters and some would have bullet points entirely based on the first page of the chapter, but it was still a great way to keep the class engaged throughout the semester.

I'm trying to figure out how to have this translate into an online class though.  Online discussion boards tend to be full of fluff and little genuine engagement.  I think chatgpt would struggle to write effective discussion points based on the chapters I assign, but that possibility for cheating is still there.  It's easier for students to fudge and BS their way through pretending they knew what was in the chapters than being put on the spot to discuss the material together during class.  So building an entire course around having them read a book seems like a risky proposition for an online class.  I thought about incorporating chapter quizzes as well to verify they are reading, but the teaching online classes training we've been receiving is pretty clear on being opposed to multiple choice quizzes now for ""equity"" and ""academic integrity"" reasons.

Any other good ideas?  I would really like to have them read the book as I think they will get a lot out of it and its perfect for the course, but not sure if the old school seminar discussion format is suitable for an online asynchronous class.",active,1

The decision raised quite a few eyebrows amongst my peers, but after a year, I can say I have little regrets.

Yes, the teaching load is heavy (3-3 as opposed to my previous 1-1), but the experience is incomparably rewarding. Grade grubbing is a non-issue. The students are driven and genuinely interested in their studies and so polite. Despite their packed schedules, they’re fully committed during class time, giving their all in every session.

The students are surprisingly open-minded and socially engaged. I've also observed various types of leadership. I've witnessed 20-sometime-year-old women, weighing around 50 kg, masterfully lead group projects alongside their gymbro peers. I've seen crew-cut guys from rural areas write thoughtful essays on sexual assault and harassment in the military. I've seen an entire classroom erupting in cheers when a student with a slight stutter completed an oral presentation. It has shattered my preconceptions. 

We're not immune to the challenges posed by things like ChatGPT, but the small class sizes (think 10 students, not 400) have allowed me to use other grading methods, including one-on-one oral exams.

It’s a different world here, and maybe one worth exploring. Like I told a friend,  I didn't manage to destroy the neoliberal university from the inside, so I decided to see what I could do with military education. ",User_deleted,110

&#x200B;

I don't know if you've noticed your inbox recently, I've certainly received some interesting emails from organizations I've never heard of, but are certainly trying to get a foothold into the next ""AI revolution."" I thought only the deep learning folks got these types of emails, but seems I am not immune from basking in a bit of the limelight from the rest of the community receiving their 15 minutes of fame.

&#x200B;

Rather than sending them to the spam folder like I should, I made the bold decision of answering some of them to see where the conversation would lead. Certainly there are the usual organizations trying to get an inside peek into what I'm working on and how they can leverage it for their own goals. Buried among the other emails like this, are emails from those who ignored the deep learning hype bubble as one should, but are now suddenly interested as machine learning is a technology ready for productionizing for commercial reasons.

&#x200B;

Like I said, it was the best of times, it was the worst of times.

&#x200B;

I hardly noticed when ChatGPT made the front pages of Time magazine and some of the people I knew started cashing out their stakes, monetary or otherwise. There are a few ways one can beat the market, at least from what my finance friends tell me, and timing the peak is one of them.

&#x200B;

When one of the students I know presented their research work leading to a thesis, I tried to see if ChatGPT could muster sufficient intelligence to craft an introduction to a reasonable thesis proposal. No luck. It's just ELIZA with a bigger database of responses and more clever at fooling you into being convinced of its intelligence.

&#x200B;

I feel like one of the old timers now, watching bubbles and hype waves come and go. Still content working on what I enjoy with its consistent and predictable rate of return like a government bond. Sadly, I am a confidant for many depressed individuals both senior and junior lamenting the lack of progress in their careers since the fateful year of 2012.

&#x200B;

Alex, Ilya, and Geoffrey. Their brief sojourn into corporate ended in giving up on machine learning, fired, and giving up on life, respectively. I hope the three of you enjoyed the revolving door.

&#x200B;

Far be it from me to disrespect an engineering discipline, especially one so lucrative as deep learning. To do so would be to insult the history of computing as a discipline, both on the short and the long scale. If anything, I would meekly raise an objection whether the discipline is being misrepresented as something more than what it is. There's no silver bullet in computer science, except maybe a one-page proof of how P is not equal to NP.

&#x200B;

So where was I? Oh yeah, a confidant.

&#x200B;

Surprisingly, every field except the field of machine learning is happy. It seems that every field from database, programming languages, systems, security, and even theory can see deep learning for what it is. I'm just going to say deep learning, as I'm too lazy to say deep learning/reinforcement learning every time. The mechanism of improvement for both is the same.

&#x200B;

Considerable engineering discipline and effort went into the revolution. The revolution was televised. Now it's time to face the music. What's the source of the improvement... is it the algorithms or the hardware? I suppose we will never know, but certainly the CEO of Nvidia and Satya seem very pleased with themselves. Oh Satya, to have such centralization of power. How you are the envy of tyrants and dictators throughout history.

&#x200B;

Now for the tragedy of my colleagues who thought to resist the revolution. I say to you, Nuts! It has been a decade of marginalization as paper after paper is churned out. All non-sycophantic reviewers slowly succumb to the prevailing beliefs, or are otherwise pushed out or silenced as non-believers. The sad truth is, the numbers are against us. It's simply impossible to push against the axiomatic system on which academia is built: citations and publications. They have more than us. As many of my vanguard colleagues defend their right to fight to the last man or woman, I espouse the view that it's not worth it. This too shall pass.

&#x200B;

So as we are all in the holiday spirit and I see the bells toll. The senior leadership of deep learning is going through a phase of, ""don't let the door hit you on the way out."" The Andrew Ngs of the world are pivoting faster than you can say ""iceberg!"" All of my esteemed colleagues are heading for the exits with their stock options and awards in hand. Schmidhuber is licking his lips with a foreboding sense of, ""I'm not locked in here with you, you're locked in here with me!"" What are we to think and do?

&#x200B;

Who are the winners and the losers? What will the road ahead be like? I'm always one for collaborative discussion, but here's where my money is on for the near future:

&#x200B;

Shareholders of MSFT and NVDA

It's a close one between this and the next item on the list. Safe to say, incorporating significant advances in machine learning into a programming and engineering discipline is no small feat. My colleagues who have been holding since 2014 are, well, it's hard to see them behind all the ferraris and mansions. My colleagues who have been holding since 2018, well they'll have to settle for the porsches. The road ahead is still bright, but the discussion has turned into which frameworks, which development paradigms, and which algorithms. I can hardly distinguish those discussions from the C/C++/Java/C#/Win32/Vim/Emacs discussions of old.

&#x200B;

Baidu, Alibaba, Huawei et al.

A deeply incestuous relationship between technology and governance structures. I'd say more, but my colleagues advise me discretion is the better part of valor.

&#x200B;

The customer

The customer may not always be right, but they're often very happy. I don't think anyone cares how the sausage is made. ChatGPT is a great tool, and consumer focused applications are expanding rapidly. Me, personally, after learning how to use the damn thing, I've been able to get insight into open problems that have been bothering me for years. I don't think, even I, as critical as I am, can be unhappy for too long after that.

&#x200B;

The Andrew Ngs of the world

He grows on you. By the time you have him figured out, he's already on the next train having caught the next wave and saying, ""surf's up."" Hang ten, my dude.

&#x200B;

Machine learning graduates between 2010-2016

The start and end dates are approximate. Certainly there's some sort of Gaussian here over the dates on the reward distribution. Certainly there's a long tail. Everyone I know in this group has a bright future in a senior position within a technology company.

&#x200B;

Other communities in computer science and quantitative disciplines

Yeah, deep learning is a great tool. Don't need to understand it to use it. The publishing output and overall satisfaction from my colleagues in this area has been very positive.

&#x200B;

Prompt engineers/researchers

This area still looks very promising. For me, using LLMs as an environment to do your research on will give many dividends in the future.

&#x200B;

Interpretability, ethics, and explainability

I've lumped the three together, since the group that does them tend to overlap. Out with the GDPR anxiety, in with the AI Act anxiety. In the past, I may have had more harsh words for this group, but, well, age tends to mellow everyone out.

&#x200B;

Long term vision researchers, even in machine learning

This one is hard to evaluate. They're still kicking around, hardly noticing anything to do with ChatGPT or whatever the kids are calling the next new thing these days.

&#x200B;

Computational Learning Theory people

I mean, even when it's bad it's not so bad, right? Plenty to do. Many interesting and challenging problems are presenting themselves.

&#x200B;

Theory of Computing people

Yeah, losing a bright student to machine learning sucks. What can you do?

&#x200B;

The ""get off my lawn type""

Yeah, what can you do? Just have to figure out a time to move on and get with the times.

I can do basic math okay and I will probably be able to pass classes like algebra and probability and statistics but discrete math, calculus, physics, etc. would be a lot and even when I took pre-algebra I had to study for months to finally get the concepts down to be able to graduate high school and get some type of diploma).  
  
I am 21 years old and currently a cybersecurity student but I've realized slowly over the time with working, interviewing, and pursuing my degree that I really don't like the constant fast pace metrics customer service environment of IT (I don't mind talking about direct straight-forward issues/topics, but when it comes to complicated issues it's very hard to deal with that day in and day out combined with the constant talking over the phone), but I did take and graduate from the front-end web development ""bootcamp"" from freeCodeCamp awhile back in around 2022 (learned HTML/CSS, and some JavaScript but really only HTML/CSS in-depth).  
  
The only real stuff I've ""coded"" myself is very basic HTML example pages that someone helped me with and told me (in their own words) that my code was looking ""rough"", and a survey I made with HTML and CSS as well, the rest were either copied code or a mixture of copied code and my own code that I have from memory (but more copied code than my own I would say).  
  
I also participated in my schools hackathon online... and it was an experience let's just say (went way in over my head with all of the technology used, hard to get instructions since it's not in person, and I only lasted 10 minutes before tapping out after pure embarrassment because I also had to share my screen/files and one of the titles was super embarrassing... in a huddle teams room of like at least 3-4 other people and the instructor.  
  
The good news is though that I am not horrible when I put time into things, I am pretty good at PowerShell scripting (although I suck at Linux scripting), and basic Python scripting as well as some coding that I've done creating password managers, port scanning, and simple games like rock, paper, scissors (I would link my GitHub and CodePen but that would reveal my personal info which I am not comfortable with sharing).  
  
Anyway with all of that being said I have thought of switching my degree (probably switching online schools as well since the current schools structure isn't for me), to either computer science (nervous about the math), or either a straight up IT degree (with a software development concentration possibly) while learning coding on the side.  
  
I am just worried about my fears and where to start (I imagine I would have to start from the ground-up with learning HTML and CSS all over again, and possibly JavaScript if I have to), besides that I just am not sure what resources to use since freeCodeCamp was okay for me but it got kind of confusing and The Odin Project looks awesome.. but once again it gets confusing with little direction/guidance from outside support, and the only other resources I can think of are w3schools, youtube tutorials, and chatGPT (bootcamps are also too expensive for me and are like 10k and I really can't afford much at all, even books unless they're free downloads online).  
  
Looking forward to hearing everyone's thoughts and words of wisdom, thanks.
