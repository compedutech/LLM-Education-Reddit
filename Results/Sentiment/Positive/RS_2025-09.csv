What started as me scratching my own itch (because my notes were a mess) has slowly grown into something real. Since then, I’ve been testing it with early users, hopping on calls, and collecting every piece of feedback I can.

Some quick takeaways so far:   
  
\- Students are by far the most excited group (which makes sense, since I originally built this for my own studying).   
  
\- Honestly, the hardest part hasn’t been the tech - it’s been figuring out how to get more visibility outside of Reddit and X, where I’ve mostly been sharing.

\- Interestingly, the waitlist itself has been a big learning point: it’s motivating to see names come in, but it also puts pressure on me to keep improving and shipping quickly so people don’t lose interest.

I’ve kept the waitlist open here if anyone’s curious: [https://flowitywaitlist.xyz/](https://flowitywaitlist.xyz/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

For those of you who have run waitlists before, I’d love to hear, how do you personally balance the push for “more signups” with the need to slow down and improve the product for the early adopters already in?

Body:

The advent of AI-driven technologies such as ChatGPT is revolutionizing the way we approach learning and skill development in both corporate settings and educational institutions. Virtual learning environments have been gaining traction for years, but the integration of intelligent tools like ChatGPT marks a paradigm shift with profound ramifications.

ChatGPT's ability to understand natural language and provide coherent responses makes it an ideal virtual assistant in learning modules. Its application ranges from serving as an on-demand tutor, which can field questions 24/7, to providing personalized learning experiences that adapt to an individual’s pace and learning style. This level of customization was unheard of in the pre-AI era of virtual learning.

In corporate training, ChatGPT can drastically reduce the time and resources spent on routine training sessions. Employees can engage with the AI to brush up on company policies, compliance matters, or skill-specific knowledge without the need for extensive human-led training programs. This increases efficiency and allows human trainers to focus on more complex training tasks that require human expertise and nuanced understanding.

For educational institutions, particularly in the shift towards online learning formats necessitated by recent global events, ChatGPT can enrich the student experience by providing instant support and feedback, thereby augmenting the role of educators and enabling them to cater to a broader base of students with differing needs.

Furthermore, in both these contexts, ChatGPT can be programmed to identify learning gaps through analytics and tailor subsequent content to address these gaps, creating a loop of continuous improvement and progressive knowledge acquisition.

However, while the benefits are significant, it is essential to recognize the need for oversight to ensure the ethical and effective use of AI in learning environments. As we navigate this new terrain, striking a balance between technological innovation and human oversight will be critical.

Guys, isn’t it amazing to realize we live in a time where *machines* are actually learning? Not just crunching numbers or blindly following code, but actually absorbing patterns, making predictions, and—mind blown—creating stuff we never imagined.

Let’s be real, every day feels like a new chapter in an epic sci-fi novel.

- Netflix guesses what we want to watch next.
- Our phones unlock just by seeing our faces, as if by magic.
- DALL-E, ChatGPT, and all their AI cousins are dreaming up artwork, stories, jokes, and even app code!

But here’s what seriously makes me happy: machine learning isn’t just about tech giants anymore. The accessibility blows my mind! Open-source libraries put powerful tools in the hands of anyone with a laptop and an idea. Suddenly, high school students are making medical diagnosis apps, and indie developers are powering smart agriculture projects. The *democratization* of ML is here, and it’s the most exciting twist.

What makes machine learning utterly fascinating to me:

- Every new dataset is a treasure chest waiting for hidden wisdom.
- Learning how an algorithm evolves, misfires, and learns again feels a bit like teaching a puppy new tricks (and watching it develop superpowers).
- Collaborations—where artists, scientists, coders, and everyday people pool ideas—create epic “a-ha!” moments bigger than any solo effort.

Imagine what we’ll be capable of when millions more join the ML playground. Today, it predicts emails you’re about to write; tomorrow, it could help fight climate change and cure rare diseases.

But, even as I’m geeking out—look, let’s be honest—none of us really KNOW how fast (or wild) this ride will get. 

Will tomorrow’s AI surprise, amuse, delight, or perhaps even terrify us a bit? The adventure is just getting started, and that’s what gets me so energized!

So here’s my happy, excited challenge to the community:

- What was the last “wow!” moment you had with machine learning?
- What do you *hope* we’ll see ML do in the next five years?
- Have you tinkered with any models or datasets recently that made you step back and smile?

Let’s flood this thread with stories, discoveries, and a big dose of scientific optimism. The future is smarter, brighter, and more exhilarating because of what *we* imagine, build, and question together.

I am a first-year faculty member at a SLAC, and I just got my first ""research interest inquiry"" written entirely by AI. How would you respond?

The student who emailed me is a first year student intending to major in psychology. I teach civil and environmental engineering, and my research is very technical in nature, focusing on resource recovery from dairy manure using bio electrochemical systems. This student emailed me with their ""interest"" being almost verbatim from my CV description of my research topic. It was such obvious AI vomit (""rephrasing"" of something fed to it) that I laughed out loud. When I put it into an AI checker, it said 100% was likely generated by AI.

On one hand, I'm excited that this student is interested in research, especially as I am working on getting my lab up and running. Do I overlook the AI email? Do I meet with them and bring it up? It's a bit concerning seeing as this student is not in my discipline, so I don't even know if they've actually read into what I'm working on or if they just saw that I do environmental research and then went to chatGPT to write an email.

I do currently have one senior student working with me this semester, so I'm not that pressed for workers immediately, but it would be nice to have a younger student to retain for a few years.

It's like turning ChatGPT into a British comedy writer who happens to be terrifyingly well-informed.

**1. ""Explain [topic] like you're John Oliver discovering something horrifying about it""**

This is comedy gold that actually teaches you things. ""Explain cryptocurrency like you're John Oliver discovering something horrifying about it."" Suddenly you understand both blockchain AND why it's probably run by people who collect vintage NFTs of their own tears.

**2. ""Start with 'And look...' then build to an absurd but accurate comparison""**

Pure Oliver energy. ""And look, learning to code is a bit like teaching a very literal genie to grant wishes - technically possible, but you'll spend most of your time explaining why 'make me a sandwich' shouldn't delete your entire kitchen.""

**3. ""What would John Oliver say if he had to explain this to his confused American audience?""**

Gets you explanations that are both condescending and enlightening. Perfect for complex topics. ""What would John Oliver say if he had to explain the stock market to his confused American audience?"" You get economics lessons wrapped in casual British superiority.

**4. ""Give me the John Oliver escalation: start reasonable, end with chaotic examples""**

His signature move. Starts with facts, ends with ""And if that doesn't concern you, consider that [completely unhinged but true comparison]."" Try it with any serious topic. Chef's kiss.

**5. ""Explain this like John Oliver just found out [authority figure] is involved""**

Instant investigative journalism vibes. ""Explain personal finance like John Oliver just found out Jeff Bezos is involved."" You get both practical advice AND righteous indignation about wealth inequality.

**6. ""What's the John Oliver 'and it gets worse' reveal about [topic]?""**

His specialty: the moment when you think you understand how bad something is, then BOOM. Layers of additional horror. Works for everything from dating apps to climate change.

**The magic trick:** Oliver's structure forces AI to be both educational AND entertaining. You learn about complex topics while laughing at how completely broken everything is.

**Advanced technique:** Chain them together. ""Explain student loans like John Oliver, start with 'And look...', then give me the 'it gets worse' reveal, and end with an absurd comparison involving penguins.""

**Secret weapon:** Add ""with the energy of someone who just discovered this exists and is personally offended."" AI suddenly develops opinions and it's hilarious.

**The unexpected benefit:** You actually retain information better because your brain associates facts with comedy. I now understand tax policy primarily through the lens of British outrage.

**Fair warning:** Sometimes AI gets so into character it forgets to be helpful and just becomes nihilistically funny. Add ""but actually give me actionable advice"" to stay productive.

**Bonus discovery:** This works for serious topics too. ""Explain therapy like John Oliver"" removes stigma by making mental health both relatable AND worth taking seriously.

I've used this for everything from understanding my mortgage to learning about medieval history. It's like having a research assistant who went to Oxford and developed strong opinions about American healthcare.

**Reality check:** Your friends might get concerned when you start explaining everything with escalating examples about corporate malfeasance. This is normal. Embrace it.

What's the weirdest topic you'd want John Oliver to explain to you through AI? Personally, I'm still waiting for ""Explain my relationship problems like John Oliver just discovered dating apps exist.""

1nfn5ez,1,2025-09-12,AI Automation Feels Like Having a Superpower—The Future Has Officially Arrived! 🚀🤯,u/affiliate1287,GPTAppsEngine,https://www.reddit.com/r/GPTAppsEngine/comments/1nfn5ez/ai_automation_feels_like_having_a_superpowerthe/,"AI Automation: The Exciting Future Is Already Here 🚀🤖

Hey r/GPTAppsEngine community!

I wanted to start a cheerful discussion today about something that's genuinely reshaping our lives: **AI automation**! There’s so much doom-and-gloom energy online, but I cannot help but feel *excited* for all the possibilities and productivity wins we’re starting to see.

Let’s take a moment to think about it:

- No more slogging through tedious, repetitive tasks.  
- Software that anticipates our needs and *just gets things done* for us.  
- Big tools like Notion AI and ChatGPT’s Actions letting us automate tasks with near-magical ease!  

Sometimes, I look at how fast things are moving and I can’t help but smile. Filling in forms, scheduling emails, summarizing mountains of info—all handled instantly. Honestly, it feels a bit like a cheat code for life.

Just imagine:

- Creative professionals spending more time imagining, less time rendering or writing boilerplate code.
- Small business owners, students, and solo founders finally getting breathing room (those productivity boosts are REAL!)
- New jobs and entire businesses emerging overnight because someone found a smarter way to string a few AIs together.
  
What’s making me extra happy is that so many tasks that felt like chores or pure drudgery are already vanishing. No need to copy-paste data or wrestle with spreadsheets for hours; AI automates it away! The feeling of freedom? *Fantastic*.

But most of all, AI automation means:

- We can focus energy on what *truly matters.*
- More experiments, faster prototyping, and loads of new inventions powered by less time wasted on “busywork.”
  
It kind of feels like waking up every day with a superhero sidekick! 🦸‍♂️

Of course, I'm aware of the challenges (like job displacement), but right here, right now, there’s so much to be happy about. We are living at the most interesting time—a true turning point!

So tell me:
- What daily task did you happily automate recently?
- Has AI freed you up to focus on what you love?
- Which AI tool makes you go “Wow, I’m living in the future!” every time?

Can’t wait to hear your stories and tool recommendations! Let’s celebrate what’s possible with AI automation and keep learning from each other. 🌟

Ready for the ride,

I am really enjoying the reading and writing. I am having a hard time with the overwhelming amount of AI written posts and papers. Personally, I do not care if someone is using AI (their learning goals are their learning goals), the problem is that I have to do a lot of assessment of the AI content. In a traditional college course I, as a student, would not have the bulk of my learning based on what I get out of reading the AI outputs of other students. 

My question is how do I creatively engage the AI content? I thought about looking at the content as a means of assessing AI rather than students. I thought of using AI to help me assess AI (not in terms of what I write as responses but as a learning opportunity). I thought about giving myself the task of trying to figure out how an answer was prompted.  

A recent paper was clearly AI based on ChatGPTs blue headers. I gave feedback on how to make the paper more authentic. Perhaps this is a good way forward? 

I need to do something because I just feel like I am in an echo chamber of ChatGPT or Claude, which is no bad thing considering the way of the world, I suppose, but I am looking for human creativity, imperfections, and ideas.

I want to share the methods I'm using to learn English. I'm from Brazil and I started studying from scratch in January of last year because I was planning to do a master's degree abroad. I've used many methods to learn, and I think I've already reached these levels:

* **Listening:** C1
* **Reading:** C1
* **Speaking:** B2
* **Writing:** B1/B2

Since I'm from a Latin country, it's difficult to train my output skills, which is why they are my weakest. So, before we talk about the best methods for each skill, I want to mention **Duolingo**. It helped me a lot in the beginning, and I think it's a great app for introducing the language and basic sentence structures. I also changed all my devices to English, btw.

Now, let's get into it.

# Listening

I've been watching a lot of YouTube videos on topics I'm interested in, which makes it very easy to not get bored. Another trick I use is re-watching series I've already seen. Because I know what happens, I can sometimes read the entire script for an episode, so I don't get lost and can assimilate all the words.

# Reading

I think the **game changer** for me was reading aloud. I downloaded an app that allows me to read EPUB/PDF files. It can translate words, read aloud to me to help with pronunciation, and even turn the book into an audiobook. So, my strategy was to download my favorite book—one I'd already read three times (**Ready Player One**, btw)—and read it again, but this time in English and aloud. This totally changed my experience because I was learning how to pronounce words and understand new vocabulary without losing the content of the book.

# Speaking

After six months of learning by myself, I decided to start a course at the most famous English school in my country. It was terrible because the teacher and the students were also Brazilian, so every time someone didn't understand what the teacher was saying, they spoke in Portuguese. This broke my immersion and made it more difficult to learn. When I finished the semester, I started using an online platform with teachers from all over the world. This has really improved my vocabulary and helped me understand other accents. I'm taking classes with American, Mexican, British, and South African teachers, among others. The platform offers unlimited 30-minute classes 24/7 (private classes are limited to 10 per month).

# Writing

I use two methods to improve my writing skills. The first is writing essays every two weeks and using **ChatGPT** or **Gemini** to revise them and give me feedback. The second is making friends. I visited a subreddit called ""language exchange"" and found someone who wanted to learn Portuguese and was offering to help with English. I sent a message, and we've been talking almost every day since March, and I've even made a friend!

That's all for now, everyone. I hope my methods are helpful to you. If you have any tips for learning English, please share them with me!",active,1

With its advanced natural language processing capabilities, ChatGPT is not just another tool; it's an interactive platform that fosters a more personalized learning experience.

In corporate settings, the pressure to continually evolve and upskill is relentless, and traditional training methods can be rigid and disengaging. ChatGPT, however, can provide on-demand knowledge, simulate complex scenarios for training purposes, and adapt to the individual learning pace of each employee. The interactive element of AI like ChatGPT enables employees to ask questions and receive immediate feedback, which can enhance retention and practical application of the material.

Moreover, the use of ChatGPT in education is equally promising. It has the potential to assist teachers by providing additional support to students, such as helping with homework or explaining difficult concepts in a different way. It can also offer an alternative means of studying and revisiting lectures, thus strengthening understanding of subjects.

However, like any technology, it's important to address the caveats. The introduction of ChatGPT in learning environments raises questions about the balance between human interaction and automated education. Will the availability of immediate answers inhibit critical thinking and problem-solving skills? How can we ensure the information provided by AI is accurate and unbiased? Discussing these questions and examining the impact of ChatGPT in these settings is necessary as we explore the full potential of AI in learning and development.

I run a small business and have been using the same spreadsheet to track sales for the last year. Recently, I started using ChatGPT to completely overhaul it—adding formulas, automations, and features in Excel that I never even knew existed. It feels amazing to have things so streamlined, and I don’t see a problem with using AI for this.

But it did make me realise something: I would never have been able to build these tools myself without years of studying and practice. AI basically let me skip all that. And honestly, why shouldn’t I, if it saves time and effort?

The question is: where’s the line between using AI in a useful way vs. in a lazy way?

Some thoughts I’ve had:

Cooking: Should I use AI to help plan meals or even guide me through cooking? It feels similar to the spreadsheet example. On the one hand, AI can always “just do it” for me, but cooking is a valuable skill to actually learn, not just an input/output process like Excel formulas.

Students and studying: It’s obvious students shouldn’t use AI to write their essays. But what about using it to study? Having AI gather, summarise, or organise information can save time, but it also skips the skill of searching, filtering, and evaluating sources, skills that are arguably just as important as the knowledge itself (I guess I sort of answered my own question here but I’d still like to hear thoughts)

Writing (non-academic): Even with this post, I’ve used AI to help me organise my messy notes into something coherent. Part of me wonders: does leaning on AI too much here stop me from developing my own writing skills? Or is it just like using Grammarly or spellcheck, but on steroids?

There are so many examples of this tech vs. brain power spectrum. I’m sure the same kinds of debates happened when computers, the internet, or even calculators became mainstream.

So I’m curious: how do you personally decide when AI use is helpful vs. when it crosses into laziness or dependency?",active,9

1nmkun7,7,2025-09-21,Fully Functioning Anki Deck Generator with Images Included,u/Legitimate_Town781,Anki,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/1nmkun7/fully_functioning_anki_deck_generator_with_images/,"**TLDR:** **I built a free tool with a simple UI that uses AI to automatically turn your PDF lectures into high quality anki cards, complete with images.**

**Intro:**

So, like many of you, I am a medical student who doesn't have any free time. I got tired of building anki decks and then screenshotting photos and adding them into the decks one at a time. So, I built this program that basically makes an entire anki deck for you, including images in each card. The formatting and image quality is honestly better than anything I ever made on my own.

**Features:**

1. First and foremost everything is **FREE** \- all of the google cloud features are free, all of this I am giving you is FREE, I have optimized the program to realistically never go over your google cloud limits. If you are concerned about your google cloud limits, just check your google cloud quota from time to time. The smallest limit is on the google search function. It is limited to 100 queries/day... But the program should hardly ever do those queries, unless you set it to ""AI Verified (Best Quality, High Cost)"".
2. Truly automatic card generation - it reads the entire pdf and synthesizes the information into high quality flashcards.
3. Different Deck Style Options
   1. Conceptual (Basic) - these are your typical flashcard, I like my information chunked so it's the one I use.
   2. Atomic Cloze - this is the kind reddit seems to love and I hate. It's a cloze card for every single fact listed in your pdf.
   3. Conceptual Cloze - this is pretty much the atomic cloze deck, but it groups things intelligently, and is maybe a step up in difficulty from the atomic clozes.
4. Intelligent Image Finding - What's super cool about the image finding is that it looks for images in your pdf. It will find and label images based on their page number and nearby fact content. The program then removes and ignores any images that look ""wrong"" like weird bars, and it prioritizes the images based off what it believes will be the best image. If for whatever reason, the pdf has no images or it can't find images, the program will send a search to google images, and output the first result it finds.
5. 100% Comprehensive Decks - The system first goes through your entire PDF and extracts every single fact. Then it moves these through a few steps that basically process each of those facts into your anki deck. It prioritizes objectives and obviously emphasized information in the PDF, but it still includes everything. Disclaimer for this - I am kind of lying here; the system recognizes and utilizes slides like the title slide and objectives slides, BUT it ignores these types of slides when creating cards. This is so you don't get cards testing you on your Professor's phone number lol. I have cross checked several decks with pdfs and found that no information was lost using this setup.
6. Cost Optimized - I made it use specific AI calls depending on the task.
7. User Options - You get the option of selecting the Deck Style as well as the degree of image quality you want. The Image quality has been extremely high with the intermediate option ""PDF priority (fast and Cheap). However, if you don't trust this, you can use the AI Verified setting.
8. Multiple PDF processing sequentially - Upload up to ten pdfs and get their corresponding anki decks created in one single step.
9. Source Fidelity - this is probably really important to a lot of people. The AI is not allowed to use outside sources. Its one and only source of information is the PDF you provide.

Here's what the UI looks like:

**Proof of High Quality Cards:**

Here are example photos, one from each of the deck styles, showcasing its abilities. I used the PDF Priority Image selection strategy for each of these. Which, again, should never cost you anything.

1. Conceptual (Basic) Deck

3. Chunked Cloze Cards:

**DISCLAIMER - THIS SHOULD BE FREE FOR A MAJORITY OF USERS - For some it may cost a few cents per month. Here is the breakdown:**

# Cost & API Usage Transparency

This application uses Google Cloud's commercial AI and Search APIs. While the project is free and open-source, there is a very small cost associated with using these services, which is billed directly to your personal Google Cloud account.

My goal was to make this as cheap as possible, and for the vast majority of users, it should be **either free or cost only a few cents per month.**

Here is a simple breakdown:

# The Google Cloud Free Tier

Google is very generous with its free tier for new users and for ongoing usage. As of September 2025, the key free allowances are:

* **Gemini 1.5 Pro/Flash:** You get a significant number of free characters/tokens per month. For our use case, this is enough to process **thousands of pages of lecture notes every month for free.**
* **Custom Search API:** You get **100 search queries per day for free.** This means the first 100 images the tool finds on Google each day are free.

You will only ever be charged if you exceed these very high monthly/daily limits.

# What Do Things Actually Cost? (If you exceed the free tier)

If you are a very heavy user, here is a simplified breakdown of the costs:

https://preview.redd.it/f6iwx525ugqf1.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ff47a95737afad7a8eaaa3814e3c90e6c9b93af

# Real-World Example Cost:

Let's say you have a **50-page PDF lecture**. You process it once.

* **PDF Priority (Default Setting):** The total cost would likely be less than **one cent ($0.01)**.
* **AI Verified (Highest Quality):** The total cost might be around **ten cents ($0.10)**, depending on how many images it verifies.

# How Caching Saves You Money

The application is smart. The first time you process a PDF, it saves the extracted text and the final AI-generated cards in .pdf\_cache and .ai\_cache folders.

If you run the **same PDF with the same settings** a second time (e.g., to generate it for a friend), the application will use the cached data. **The cost of the second run will be $0.00.**

**Conclusion:** This tool is designed to live comfortably within Google's free tier for any normal student workload. Heavy users might see a charge of a dollar or two per month on their Google Cloud bill. You are in full control of your usage and can monitor it in your Google Cloud account.

**I personally have used it to process over 20 PDF lectures thus far and I have yet to go anywhere near the quotas - meaning it's been entirely free.**

**Download and Installation Guide:**

This guide will get you up and running. A more detailed version is in the [README.md](http://README.md) file inside the .zip download.

# Part 1: Prerequisites (5 mins)

First, you need to have three things installed on your computer.

1. **Install Python:**
   * Go to: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   * Download and run the installer.
   * **CRITICAL:** On the first screen of the installer, you **must** check the box at the bottom that says **""Add Python to PATH""**.
2. **Install Anki:**
   * If you don't already have it, download and install Anki from [https://apps.ankiweb.net/](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
3. **Install the AnkiConnect Add-on:**
   * Open the Anki application.
   * At the top, go to **Tools > Add-ons**.
   * Click **Get Add-ons...** and paste in this code: 2055492159
   * Click OK, then **close and restart the Anki application**.

# Part 2: Google Cloud API Setup (10 mins)

This part looks complex, but it's just a series of quick clicks to get your free API keys. You only have to do this once.

1. **Create a Project:**
   * Go to the Google Cloud Console: [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/) (Sign in with your Google account).
   * In the top-left, click the project dropdown, then click **""NEW PROJECT""**.
   * Name it Anki-Generator and click **""CREATE""**. Make sure it's selected as your active project.
2. **Enable APIs:**
   * In the top search bar, search for **""Generative Language API""**. Click on it, then click the blue **""ENABLE""** button.
   * Do the same for the **""Custom Search API""**. Search for it and click **""ENABLE""**.
3. **Create Your API Key:**
   * Go directly to the API Credentials page: [https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
   * Click **""+ CREATE CREDENTIALS""** and select **""API key""**.
   * A key will be created. Click the **copy icon** to copy it and paste it into a temporary Notepad file. You can close the Google dialog.
4. **Create an Image Search Engine:**
   * Go to the Programmable Search Engine page: [https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/)
   * Click **""Add""**.
   * Name it Anki-Images, type [www.google.com](http://www.google.com) in the ""What to search?"" box, and turn **ON** the **""Image search""** toggle.
   * Click **""CREATE""**.
5. **Get Your Search Engine ID:**
   * On the next page, click **""Control Panel""**.
   * On the Basics tab, find your **""Search engine ID""** and click the **""Copy to clipboard""** button. Paste this into your temporary Notepad file.

You now have your two secret codes: the **API Key** and the **Search Engine ID**.

**Part 3: Anki Note Setup**

This is the most important manual step. Our script needs Anki's ""Basic"" and ""Cloze"" note types to have a specific structure to work correctly. This guide will walk you through verifying and, if necessary, fixing this.

**First, open the Anki application.**

At the top of the main Anki window, click the **""Tools""** menu, and then select **""Manage Note Types""**. A new window will appear.

# 1. Configure the ""Basic"" Note Type

1. In the ""Manage Note Types"" window, find **""Basic""** in the list and click on it to highlight it.
2. On the right-hand side, click the **""Fields...""** button.
3. A window will appear showing the fields. By default, Anki only has ""Front"" and ""Back"". We need to add a field for our images.
   * **Check the list.** It must contain these three fields, in this exact order:
      1. Front
      2. Back
      3. Image
   * If the Image field is missing, click the **""Add""** button on the right. A new window will pop up. For ""Field name"", type Image and click ""OK"". Make sure it is the 3rd field in the list.
4. Once the fields are correct, click **""Save""**.
5. Now, back in the ""Manage Note Types"" window (with ""Basic"" still selected), click the **""Cards...""** button on the right. This will open the Card Template editor.
6. You will see three main boxes: ""Front Template"", ""Back Template"", and ""Styling"". **Copy and paste the code below into the corresponding boxes, completely replacing what's there.**

**Copy this into the ""Front Template"" box:**

    {{Front}}

**Copy this into the ""Back Template"" box:**

    {{FrontSide}}
    
    <hr id=answer>
    
    {{Back}}
    
    <br>
    {{Image}}

**Copy this into the ""Styling"" box:**

    /* --- General Card Styling --- */
    .card {
      font-family: arial;
      font-size: 20px;
      text-align: center;
      color: white;
      background-color: #2F2F2F;
    }
    
    /* --- Image Styling --- */
    /* This rule limits the height of images on your cards. */
    img {
      max-height: 500px; /* You can change this number to make images larger or smaller */
      max-width: 90%;   /* This ensures the image doesn't stretch too wide */
      margin-top: 15px; /* Adds a bit of space above the image */
    }

1. Click the **""Save""** button at the bottom.

# 2. Configure the ""Cloze"" Note Type

1. In the ""Manage Note Types"" window, find **""Cloze""** in the list and click on it to highlight it.
2. On the right, click the **""Fields...""** button.
3. By default, Anki has ""Text"" and ""Extra"". We need to add our ""Image"" field.
   * **Check the list.** It must contain these three fields, in this exact order:
      1. Text
      2. Extra
      3. Image
   * If the Image field is missing, click the **""Add""** button. For ""Field name"", type Image and click ""OK"". Make sure it is the 3rd field.
4. Once the fields are correct, click **""Save""**.
5. Now, back in the ""Manage Note Types"" window (with ""Cloze"" still selected), click the **""Cards...""** button.
6. Just like before, **copy and paste the code below into the corresponding boxes**, completely replacing what's there.

**Copy this into the ""Front Template"" box:**

    {{cloze:Text}}

**Copy this into the ""Back Template"" box:**

    {{cloze:Text}}
    <br>
    <div style=""font-size: 16px; color: #a9a9a9;"">
    {{Extra}}
    </div>
    <br>
    {{Image}}

**Copy this into the ""Styling"" box:**

    /* --- General Card Styling --- */
    .card {
      font-family: arial;
      font-size: 20px;
      text-align: center;
      color: white;
      background-color: #2F2F2F;
    }
    
    /* --- Cloze Styling --- */
    .cloze {
     font-weight: bold;
     color: #87CEFA; /* This is the light blue for the cloze deletion text */
    }
    
    /* --- Image Styling --- */
    /* This rule limits the height of images on your cards. */
    img {
      max-height: 500px; /* You can change this number to make images larger or smaller */
      max-width: 90%;   /* This ensures the image doesn't stretch too wide */
      margin-top: 15px; /* Adds a bit of space above the image */
    }

1. Click the **""Save""** button at the bottom, and then close all the dialog windows.

Your Anki is now perfectly configured with a professional, dark-mode style and size-limited images.

# Part 4: Project Setup (5 mins)

1. **Download & Unzip:** Download and unzip the project folder to a permanent location (like your Desktop). Download: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FpJ8esbxapCMx5EyPomZAQ9zArRB\_NWU/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FpJ8esbxapCMx5EyPomZAQ9zArRB_NWU/view?usp=sharing)
2. **Configure Keys:**
   * Inside the unzipped folder, **rename** the file .env.template to exactly .env.
   * Open .env with Notepad.
   * Paste your **API Key** into **BOTH** the GEMINI\_API\_KEY and GOOGLE\_SEARCH\_API\_KEY fields.
   * Paste your **Search Engine ID** into the GOOGLE\_CSE\_ID field.
   * Save and close the file.
3. **Install Libraries:**
   * Double-click the **setup.bat** file. A black command window will appear and install everything. Wait for it to say ""Installation complete,"" then press any key to close it.
4. **Run the App!**
   * Make sure Anki is running.
   * Double-click the **run.bat** file.
   * The application will start and a new tab should open in your browser. (If not, just open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:7860).

You're all set! You can now drag and drop your PDFs and start generating decks.

**Future Goals:**

I have a few plans in mind to make this tool even more robust. I am open to ideas and feedback. Features I plan to add include:

1. Subject selection - It will default to a robust content generation, but I will create specific changes for different subjects (e.g. anatomy, pathology, pharmacology...)
2. Interactive Tutor - I personally hate reading and listening to lectures. I prefer to engage in my learning, thus I will create a tutor that walks you through the pdfs, encouraging you to engage in the content by providing it in a methodical manner and asking you knowledge checks along the way.
3. Exam Creation - I will add a tool that generates mock exams for you to practice on. It will have answer keys and answer explanations. It might be interactive, or it might just be a document. I am not sure yet.
4. GitHub - I will make a GitHub for this if there is sufficient interest.

Please give me any feedback or ideas you have for improvements and features. I am happy to consider them at the very least.",active,12

Instead of just predicting the “next frame” in a video like many current models do, PSI is trained to understand how the world works - things like depth (how far away objects are), motion, and boundaries between objects - directly from raw video. That means:

* It doesn’t just guess what the next pixel looks like, it learns the structure of the scene.
* It can predict multiple possible futures for the same scene, not just one.
* It can generalize to different tasks (like depth estimation, segmentation, or motion prediction) without needing to be retrained for each one.

Why is this cool? Think of it like the difference between:

* A student memorizing answers to questions vs.
* A student actually understanding the concepts so they can answer new questions they’ve never seen before.

PSI does the second one - and the architecture borrows ideas from large language models (LLMs), where everything is broken into “tokens” that can be flexibly combined. Here, the tokens represent not just words, but parts of the visual world (like motion, depth, etc.).

Possible applications:

* Robotics: a robot can “see ahead” before making a move.
* AR/VR: glasses that understand your surroundings without tons of training.
* Video editing: making edits that keep physics realistic.
* Even things like weather modeling or biology simulations, since it learns general structures.

Their English is already very good in most cases (B2+), so any AI-based projects might help them to develop vocabulary and structure in a more *personalized* way with the LLM's help.

This technology offers a dynamic shift in how both educational institutions and corporate environments approach training and development.

Leveraging ChatGPT in e-learning platforms provides a more interactive experience for learners. Unlike traditional methods of training that rely on static content, AI can deliver a personalized learning journey for each individual. It can assess a person's learning style, pace, and comprehension levels to tailor content accordingly, making learning more efficient and less time-consuming.

In corporate settings, training employees can be a logistical challenge, especially for multinational companies. By integrating ChatGPT, we can ensure consistent training across borders without the need for synchronous schedules. This AI can act as a virtual trainer offering on-the-spot feedback, answering questions, and even simulating real-world scenarios for trainees to engage with, thus enhancing practical learning.

Furthermore, in the educational sector, institutions can utilize ChatGPT to support students outside the classroom. It can serve as a 24/7 tutor, providing homework assistance, elucidating complex topics, and preparing students for exams with bespoke study materials.

However, this transformation is not without its challenges. There's the issue of ensuring the AI's responses are accurate and unbiased, as well as the potential gap it might create if it leads to reduced human interaction. The role of educators will undoubtedly shift, requiring them to adapt to new ways of teaching that integrate AI.

As we continue to tread into this AI-assisted future, it's crucial for companies and educational institutions to consider how best to harness ChatGPT's capabilities. Not only to enhance learning experiences but also to address the challenges it may bring. The ultimate goal should be a hybrid model that plays to the strengths of both human educators and AI tools, ensuring a comprehensive and adaptable learning environment.

Recently, I was working with a mother of three who is an online nursing student. We found AI to be an incredibly useful tool for her, helping her cut down her study time from parsing through lengthy materials and 3-hour video classes to a concise 20 minutes of reading. She isn't tech-savvy, but she's enthusiastic and has been doing great. A combination of GPT-4o as a baseline, plus Gemini and NotebookLM, has given her wild results.

She was on vacation from her course until recently, so we hadn't had a session since the GPT5 update. And oh boy, did she notice it was ""updated.""

The state of GPT is absolutely shameful, and I advised her to cancel her subscription for the time being because the tool is just useless right now.

* Our master prompt, which we have used and tweaked since the 3o days, and which still functions consistently with Gemini and Claude now produces nothing but mediocre results and **wild inaccuracies** in GPT5. The ability to generate 2000-word articles that covered the main points for her exams is just gone.
* The information is generic and bland, even when obtained from a reputable source. I'm a healthcare professional myself, and reading the outputs of GPT5 is like having an undergraduate student poorly paraphrase something they read 10 minutes before doing the rounds. It's pathetic.
* It will spend up to **five prompts** just beating around the bush to perform a single task. It hounds her with questions about the very specific instructions she just gave and suggests out-of-topic, useless alternatives to what was asked.

Tomorrow, I have two more students who need AI integration for a family entrepreneurship project, and I DREAD the **glue-sniffing advice** ChatGPT is going to excrete upon them. I'm already thinking about just skipping GPT entirely, advising them to avoid it and focus the lessons on Gemini gem creation for the advisor roles they will need for their project.

* 1 hour of exercise to increase blood flow and stimulate the brain
* 1-hour midday nap
* 30-minute lunch
* 1-hour dinner
