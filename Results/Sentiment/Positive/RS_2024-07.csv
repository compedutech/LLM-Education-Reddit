1dtkou9,3,2024-07-02,D282 - A 1 WEEK PASS EXPLINATION (Pass date: 7/1/24) ,u/Professional_Ad_8917,WGU,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1dtkou9/d282_a_1_week_pass_explination_pass_date_7124/,"I’d like to give a **BIG** shoutout to the WGU Reddit community as it's been very helpful in my pursuit of my WGU degree. I reference this thread at the start of every class, it's never 100% but I like to read people's opinions and approaches.  

 I wanted to give some advice if you are one of the students struggling with D282.  

First, I want to say that I have gotten my CompTIA A+, Net+ and Sec+ in the past so I had some IT experience about 4-5 years ago. The reason I bring this up is because it did not actually help me with the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam, and I passed it after a week of going over the material. Barely with a 770+ but a pass is a pass, nevertheless.  

I’m not the sharpest tool in the toolbox so if I can do it, you got this. So, this was my approach: 

1. Choose how you want to learn the material. There are a couple of UDEMY instructors that teach the exact same information as the AWS professionals within the WGU course material. This is a must to get that base line understanding and reference point for revisits. Just choose one option that caters to your preference, don’t waste time getting different viewpoints about the same subjects. 

1. Even after going over the instructor-led material, the questions are still difficult because they ask about situations not necessarily discussed in the lectures. Some people may be against this and find it unethical, but I purchased a CLF-C02 app from the Google store that had like 30 mini tests of 30 questions you could do at your own pace. No, there was no replication of questions within the app but gave similar situations as the exam. It cost me $10 but I can say it was worth it because without it, I would not have passed. 

1. Another tool I utilize is [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) which for IT professionals like us it's no Surprise. It helped me digest material that I need to revisit much faster than relooking through the course and I did it with the free version. It helped me learn key features of AWS services and with that baseline from the first pass, you know it's not ‘hallucinating’. It was in fact correct about every service with example use cases. 

1. When you feel like you’re ready, schedule the test at an onsite location. For Pearson VUE certification exams, this is a must Imo because... it eliminates the distractions from the at-home option. It’s refreshing to get out of the house and get your blood flowing to your brain before the test. They will provide you with a white board and markers upon request and all you need to bring is Valid ID and SS card or another form of ID (2 forms). 
2. The score range for a pass is between 700-1000 and the questions are weighted so thinking you can miss a certain amount of questions would not be a good approach.

Sorry for such a winded explanation but I sincerely hope it helps and feel free to DM me with any questions regarding the information I provided. The WGU feed has helped me and continues to help me a lot and I try to pay it forward when I can. This class was worth an explanation.  

*\*Disclaimer\* This is not the best approach if your trying to* '*master' AWS however, competency is achievable.*

Both educational institutions and corporate entities are quickly recognizing the transformative potential of integrating such systems into their training models.

In the educational sphere, ChatGPT has been instrumental in supplying a new dimension to online learning. It brings an interactive element that traditional e-learning modules may lack, allowing for personalized feedback and support 24/7. This means students can have their queries clarified at any time, encouraging continuous learning without the constraints of a human educator's availability.

Moreover, with the ability to understand and generate human-like text, ChatGPT can facilitate language learning, essay writing, and problem-solving activities, providing a rich and responsive educational environment that caters to diverse learning needs. Imagine a history student receiving an immediate detailed explanation of a historical event or a mathematics student receiving a step-by-step guide to solving a complex equation at their convenience.

In the corporate sector, ChatGPT enables efficient and scalable training programs, essential for companies aiming to keep their workforce up to speed with the latest trends and technologies. For instance, ChatGPT can serve as an on-demand mentor for onboarding processes, software training, or company policy dissemination, ensuring that all employees, regardless of location and time zone, have access to consistent and up-to-date information.

However, as with any technological implementation, it's crucial to use ChatGPT wisely, ensuring it complements human trainers and educators rather than replacing them. Blending AI with human expertise could elevate the training experience, creating a synergistic learning platform that maximizes the strengths of both digital and human resources.

As the technology continues to evolve, the potential applications for ChatGPT in various learning environments seem boundless. The key will be to navigate this new terrain thoughtfully, harnessing its capabilities to create more adaptive, inclusive, and engaging forms of education and corporate training.

1dwxf6w,3,2024-07-06,D318 - Cloud+ Passed!,u/BlueFingerHun,WGU,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1dwxf6w/d318_cloud_passed/,"Just finished up Cloud+ exam this morning and passed!!!

As the exam objective declares, it does require knowledge in Net+ and Server+.

I had 3 PBQs and 70 multiple choice questions, and 2 PBQs were Network questions (which I didn't expect at all).

I spent average of 4 hours daily, about 6 days, to study Cloud+ materials. I know most of students hate using CertMaster due to their confusing wordings, but I actually think it was pretty useful for the Cloud+. 

I used CertMaster learning materials + practice exams / assessment + Udemy (Totalseminars practice tests). I used ChatGPT to clarify any vague explanations from the CertMaster learning material. 

For those of you who has not taken Net+ yet, I highly suggest you to complete Net+ first and then Cloud+. I am 100% certain that I would not have passed this exam without Net+ knowledge. 

Time to move on to my next class! 3 more till graduate :) Good luck everyone!",active,11

# Personal Reflections

I enjoy using AI text generator tools that foster students’ creativity and enable them to break through the barrier of writer’s block. But I am apprehensive about the tools that may lead to addiction or limit the development of important thinking and writing competencies. This can mainly be achieved through the use of these tools as supporting, instead of replacement and second options to the core academic materials.

All things considered, although each of these best AI text generators is powerful in its own way and holds back at some point, these three can give us a plethora of resources for different writing needs. It is our role as educators to help students master use of these tools strategically so that they become catalysts instead of mirrors, never replacing the inimitable value of the human mind and creativity.",User_deleted,1

While Mistral is known for its powerful open-source AI models, these new entries are examples of the excellent performance/speed tradeoffs achieved when building models for specific purposes.


⚡ FlashAttention-3 enhances computation power of NVIDIA GPUs

Researchers from Colfax Research, Meta, Nvidia, Georgia Tech, Princeton University, and Together AI have introduced FlashAttention-3, a new technique that significantly speeds up attention computation on Nvidia Hopper GPUs (H100 and H800).

Attention is a core component of the transformer architecture used in LLMs. But as LLMs grow larger and handle longer input sequences, the computational cost of attention becomes a bottleneck. 

FlashAttention-3 takes advantage of new features in Nvidia Hopper GPUs to maximize performance. It achieves up to 75% usage of the H100 GPU’s maximum capabilities.

Why does it matter?

The faster attention computation offered by FlashAttention-3 has several implications for LLM development and applications. It can: 1) significantly reduce the time to train LLMs, enabling experiments with larger models and datasets; 2) extend the context window of LLMs, unlocking new applications, and 3) slash the cost of running models in production.

1eagmpu,38,2024-07-23,Finally done with my TOEFL!!(111/120). Some advice I would like to give and things I learned,u/PsychologicalSnow116,ToeflAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToeflAdvice/comments/1eagmpu/finally_done_with_my_toefl111120_some_advice_i/,"Hi everyone!

I recently gave my TOEFL and got a score of 27 Reading, 28 listening, 27 speaking, 29 writing.

Firstly, I would want to thank gregmat for his extensive TOEFL 2 week study plan, it really helped me structure my preparation and he is a pro at explaining how to solve all the questions. Secondly, I would recommend getting the ets tests volume 2 books as I used it for my practice tests.

I religiously followed the 2 week gregmat plan followed by 2 weeks of tests (I ended up giving around 5) from the volume 2, and between the tests I would figure out where I went wrong and practice that until the next test.

Some section wise advice:

# Reading

This section is pretty straightforward, you don't need to read the entire passage, just understand the main idea of each paragraph and write it down as you anyways end up reading the important passages during the questions. Pay attention to the authors purpose and sentence rephrasing questions as they can sometimes be tricky. Remember, you need to go for the best answer not the perfect answer.

ALWAYS USE EVIDENCE, I cannot emphasize this enough, you may be tempted to choose an answer which may sound correct especially under pressure and with long paragraphs. But I beg you to not give in and really look for evidence, I was victim to this in the initial practice tests but eventually got better at shutting off that urge. For TOEFL, using your outside knowledge over the passage won't be as damaging as GRE, but I would still recommend to consider the essay as the word of god. I personally messed this up on exam day as I was consistently getting 29-30 in practice. I think I started the exam too quickly and did not settle in properly first with the environment and was too stressed out.

# Listening

This section is quite easy to score in if you know what you're doing. You don't need to note down every detail, basically I just followed whatever gregmat said and took abbreviated notes and did not focus on minute details. I would like to add that you should focus more on the flow of the conversation. For example, the mood of the person, their tone, etc. Take notes about general ideas of what the professor is talking about especially in the lectures and try to also focus on the tone and mood in the conversations.

# Speaking

This section was my Achilles heel, Even though I am pretty good at forming ideas and words and fluent in my tone, I tend to mess up grammar while speaking and that is evident in my speaking score. I was pleasantly surprised that I got such a high speaking score and I think they are a little on the linient side with this section especially with international students. I remember I messed up two out of the four questions, as in I did not entirely stop but there was some hiccups and I literally lost my train of thought in the middle of the first question. The key here is moving on and just continuing the next point even if it sounds abrupt as just sitting silently will knock your score down further. It may seem easy to do but trust me it is one of the hardest things you will have to learn in TOEFL. At home and during practice you have to resist the urge of pausing the recording when you practice in case you stall and just keep going even if it is super uncomfortable. Once you get used to hearing your own voice and being uncomfortable, will you be able to face these situations in case they occur on test day.

# WRITING

This section I was naturally proficient at but I still wanted to get a near perfect score so I practiced anyways. CHATGPT is a god gift, It is amazing when grading your essays and academic discussion prompts. It tells you exactly where you went wrong and points out details which no human could've. Obviously you take some of its advice with a grain of salt especially if your content is good and it is being nitpicky. But it sure as hell detects awkward phrasings and grammar issues which are something you should really focus on. Especially in the academic discussion prompt, where this matters more as the content is naturally lesser. My integrated essay was around 300 words and Academic discussion answer was 150 ish for those who care about the length.

# General advice

* If you're giving the toefl at a test center, it gets very chaotic and noisy, try to emulate this scenario, I was already seasoned to this as there was a construction going beside my house when I gave my practice tests.
* To reduce the duration of the above, try to reach the exam center first. That way you can go in first and start the test before everyone so you won't be disturbed during your listening and reading sections.
* If you start panicking midway, just pause for a moment and take a deep breath. Know that this is just another test which won't even matter after you are done with your grad admissions. You will probably even forget about your experience altogether. 
* You'll just lose more points the longer you dwell on difficult questions or wrong answers, so accept a loss and just move on. Solving that one difficult question for five minutes and getting the answer will not give you extra points, in most cases you will lose time to solve the next 5 easy ones losing 5 points.
* Gregmat is the GOAT, I took his advice to heart, especially about cutting losses and trying to be the best, not perfect. Do properly listen to what he says.
* I did introduce my own template for speaking questions 3 and 4 as I was more comfortable with that so you can change up things if they work for you( For question three I just defined the term and gave the examples by joining them with my templated phrases like ""this is illustrated by the professor..."", etc. For question 4, I just kinda winged it as I preferred to dive directly into what was asked than explaining the concept and following greg's template as I did not have enough time.
* I am a fast speaker but I had to slow done A LOT, the reason being being a fast speaker also made me more prone to just blanking out, finishing too early or using filler phrases if I could not form further sentences. Speaking slowly gives you more time to think what you're saying and also helps you check your grammar better.
* Settle into the environment on test day, I messed this up as I started the test as soon as I sat at my PC so that I would not be disturbed by everyone's voices during their speaking section. But this was a huge mistake as I was already stressed. So make sure you settle down, take some deep breaths, get comfy with the headphones, mouse, chair,etc. It's okay as you only need all that focus in reading, you can just turn up the volume to full in listening section to not get distracted. And I doubt anyone would finish their reading and listening both before you finish your reading.

So that was it, all the best for your test and take it easy!

1ebzdao,1,2024-07-25,Study Tips for JHS & SHS Students from a G12 Valedictorian Graduate (unsolicited advice),u/ziasmatcha,studentsph,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentsph/comments/1ebzdao/study_tips_for_jhs_shs_students_from_a_g12/,"Hii, fellow students! Just like you I have spent hours, days and weeks looking for the perfect study methods and note-taking strategies that could work and help me achieve my goals of as simple as getting into the honors list, and as far as getting to graduate valedictorian of my class.   
  
I don't think I have ever mastered the \*perfect\* study methods, but during my Grade 10-SHS years that was the time na sineryoso ko na talaga studies ko because I had goals of my own and a dream of getting into my priority university. Trust me, it pays off a lot. In the previous years, I wasn't a top-notcher student naman. Lagi ako nasa Top 10 pero never ako naging number 1. Kaya I hope this achievement of mine will also ***inspire you*** to study more for you to achieve your own goals. Pag nagsipag ka talaga, that's when you will realize na it (studying smart) really does matter!

**DURING YOUR CLASSES**  
1. ***Review your lessons in advance.*** Nakakatamad man siya gawin kasi minsan pagod na tayo pag-uwi. Pero knowing your lessons before the teacher's discussion helps you understand the topic more and pag nagdidiscuss na para ka nalang nagrereview ng inaral mo.   
2. ***Listen during discussions.*** We tend to get distracted during classes, boring talaga minsan. Trust me, I've been there. With my short attention span I often get sidetracked and di ko na naiintindihan yung lecture ng teacher ko hahaha. Pero I cannot emphasize this enough: **MAKINIG KA HABANG NASA KLASE.** This way, pag magrereview ka for quizzes or tests, gets mo na yung topic and di mo na kailangan aral-aralin ulit in confusion.   
3. ***Take notes, not pictures of powerpoint slides.*** Taking notes really helps retain information in your mind. This may not be true for some people, but if kunwari mabilis talaga magturo teacher nyo and kelangan nyo talaga magpicture ng slides to get notes, **make sure na when you get home you transfer those notes agad sa notebook mo or sa reviewer mo digitally.**  
4. Lastly, **ASK questions!** Not everyone would be willing to do this. Pero asking your teachers questions about lessons you did not understand will save you. It's better to know now than later pag nagrereview ka na for an exam. 

  
**STUDY METHODS**  
When studying, it is best to pair the test types to your study techniques.

For example:   
\* For MATH subjects requiring solving: practice problems  
\* For SCIENCE subjects requiring memorization: flash cards/quizzes

***1. Active Recall / Practice Tests*** - this is by far my favorite and personally **the most effective study method.** Active recall is basically like flashcards but it is a set of questions you can answer over and over again until you master the topics. **It is a practice test in one**. I use Notion to make this, or kaya naman GimKit to make my active recalls for each subject. 

There are also many ways you can do this.. I have even used ChatGPT to make a practice test for me. All I do is I paste my reviewer there and ask gpt to generate me a 20-item quiz that I can answer. Then, I'll ask the AI afterwards for the correct answers. 

***2. Blurting Method -*** You write down everything you remember from the topic you just studied. You can check your reviewer to see if you missed any information and if you master the topics na. I personally use this for memorization. I'll keep repeating and writing the information until I complete it and until I'm sure na memorize ko na talaga.

***3. Feynman Technique*** - This is very useful when it comes to heavy concepts/heavy topics na need ng understanding/logic. This is basically talking to yourself as if you're teaching someone else about the lesson you are reviewing. 

Nung SHS, andami kong na-encounter na memorization type of tests. The secret to that is just repetition! Repeat and repeat until you memorize AND understand it. You may also make use of **mnemonics, or acronyms** and make words out of information para mamemorize mo sya. This is what helped me memorize. 

Example, I need to memorize this set of words:  
Banana  
Apple  
Tamarind  
Eggplant

In my head, I simply understand it as ""**BATE**"" and I associate this category to: Fruits.

These are just some of the tips and method that I used to help me study and achieve my honor goals as a student :)) I hope this somehow helps, lalo na't back to school season na. Goodluck students!! ",User_deleted,1
