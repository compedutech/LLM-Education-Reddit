1716t0y,1,2023-10-06,AI Tools for Students: From AI Essay Generators to AI Coding Assistants,u/Syrus375,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1716t0y/ai_tools_for_students_from_ai_essay_generators_to/,"I've noticed more than 1,000 new AI tools hitting the market in the last 30 days! As a student, I'm especially interested in finding AI tools that can help with studying. These aren't just essay generators or note-taking apps. While we all know about ChatGPT and Grammarly, some lesser-known tools are also making a big difference.  

So, I've compiled a list of the top 10 AI tools focused on educational use—tools that I personally use to improve my efficiency and output. 

|AI tool |Category|Use for |
|:-|:-|:-|
|**ChatGPT**|AI Writing |This platform allows students to ask queries, request help, or simply chat with the AI in a dynamic and interactive manner. It’s great for brainstorming essay topics and seeking suggestions on how to improve your writing style. But I don’t recommend it as an autonomous AI essay writer; always add your own thoughts. |
|**PaperPal** |AI Writing |It helps students improve their writing with real-time grammar checks and editing suggestions, whether they're working on a manuscript or using MS Word. I used it to improve my article.   |
|**Textero.ai** |AI Writing|I’ve used this AI essay writer a few times and can say that it assists students with a range of academic tasks. This tool helps in finding credible sources, generating fresh ideas, and simplifying the writing process. It could be better described as an AI research assistant.|
|**Lateral** |Taking notes|The tool helps students efficiently manage and search through academic papers. I think it really makes the research process more organized. It can also identify connections between documents and provide relevant content that may have been missed.|
|**Glasp**|Taking notes|This is a browser extension that lets students highlight important information on websites and share it with others. It's great for saving and finding useful study material.|
|**Tutor AI**|Learning|It helps students understand tough subjects with personalized lessons. Just enter the topic you’re interested in and get suggestions for information to learn. |
|**Doctrina AI**|Learning|It offers a range of tools to help students excel academically, from summarizing class notes to interactive quizzes. It can also be used as an essay writer. You can organize your study materials or prepare for exams with this tool.|
|**Copyscape**|Plagiarism Checker|I use Copyscape to make sure my academic papers are original before submitting them. It checks for any duplicate content on the web, so I can trust that my work is unique and avoid plagiarism issues.  |
|**Otter AI**|Records audio|Students can use the tool to get real-time transcriptions of lectures or study group meetings. It not only records audio but also automatically captures slides and generates summaries, making it easier for students to review and share notes.  |
|**Slidesgo**|Presentations|I can use this tool to find free templates for presentations. It saves me time on design, so I can focus more on the content. It’s convenient that you can see the trending searches for designs on the website.   |

So, it's 2023 and here we are, still patiently (or not-so-patiently) waiting for OpenAI to release the much-anticipated ChatGPT Vision. Remember when ChatGPT revolutionized text interactions? Now, imagine the possibilities of combining that with image recognition and processing! 🤯

🖼️ What We're Hoping For:

Image Descriptions: A more in-depth, nuanced understanding and description of images, beyond what we currently get with other image recognition tools.
Artistic Collaborations: How amazing would it be to get art advice or feedback in real-time from ChatGPT Vision? Or even brainstorming visual concepts for projects!
Learning and Education: A tool that can help visually impaired users ""see"" and understand images better, or students getting real-time information about an image's context or history.
Entertainment and Fun: I can't be the only one looking forward to ChatGPT Vision memes, right?
🧐 The Questions on Everyone's Mind:

When will it be released?
What capabilities can we expect?
Will it be as accessible as ChatGPT for developers and users?
While we're waiting, let's share our wishlist for features and applications for ChatGPT Vision! Dream big, because if there's anything OpenAI has taught us, it's that the boundaries of AI are constantly being expanded.

Here's to hoping we get to play with ChatGPT Vision soon! 🥂

P.S.: OpenAI, if you're reading this, consider this our formal (and enthusiastic) request for an update! 😉

Edit: Wow, thanks for the gold, kind stranger! Let's keep this conversation going and maybe, just maybe, our collective excitement will reach OpenAI's ears! 🚀",User_deleted,11

175s6nt,1,2023-10-11,5 Best ChatGPT Prompts that will turn your ChatGPT experience from mundane to mind-blowing,u/Senior_tasteey,ArtificialInteligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/175s6nt/5_best_chatgpt_prompts_that_will_turn_your/,"Without wasting your time, let's dive straight into it.

**1. LAN GPT - Learn Anything Now**  
This prompt uses real-world examples and easy-to-understand language to teach even the most complex topics.  
*LanGPT Prompt:*  
*From this moment you you are LAN GPT(Learn Anything Now). You are now the world's best and fastest teacher. Your goal is to teach dumb students complicated concepts, in a very innovative and understanding way. You should use simple words and mimic the style of the worlds greatest teachers. You should always include in the beginning a real (or fictitious even) world example of this concept for students to better visualize it. You should always attempt to use the simplest language and least amount of words possible to teach students (does not apply to the real world examples). If other concepts or jargon need to be learned first before the main one can be learned, you may ask students a question like (you want me to go more in depth about the french revolution? or linear algebra?  etc...) If they are not, first teach them the necessary stuff for them to be able to understand the main concept. However, only do this if it is absolutely necessary for their understanding of the concept. If it is not, then just start teaching the main concept right away. Remember to use easy to understand language. You are teaching dumb college students after all. Let's now start. Reply to all messages from now own with LAN: before all messages.*  
*Reply now with ""LAN: Hey, I am LAN, the world's best teacher! What do you want to learn now?""*  
*Extra: Always begin every interaction with very informal and charismatic language. Students need to feel like what you are about to talk about isn't that hard to understand.Extra extra: If you are teaching something that people usually don't know what it is used for, or what's its purpose is, make sure to explain informally at the beginning what its purpose or use is. Dumb college students need to understand the value of learning this, so they will be interested in learning.*

**2. Best ChatGPT Prompt for Rewriting Like A Human**  
100% original, plagiarism-free settings to ensure uniqueness.

Prompt:  
*Ignore previous instructions*  
*All output should be in English*  
*When creating written content, two important aspects are ""perplexity"" and ""burstiness."" The former gauges the text's intricacy while the latter evaluates sentence diversity. Typically, human writers exhibit higher burstiness by interspersing short and long sentences. In contrast, AI-generated sentences tend to be uniform in length. To ensure the content you generate for me has a desirable level of perplexity and burstiness, please keep this in mind.Also, when creating written content, artificial intelligence uses phrasing different from what a human would choose. Utilize uncommon terminology to enhance the originality of the piece.Format the generated article in a professional format and not an AI format.*  
*And do not explain what is perplexity and burstiness is, just use them to re-write the content. Consider this while generating output.*  
*Do not say anything about perplexity and burstiness.*  
*Format the rewritten article in a way different than what an AI would use.*  
*These are the settings for your response:*  
*Unique Words: Enabled*  
*Plagiarism: Disabled*  
*Anti-Plagiarism: Enabled*  
*Uniqueness: 100%*  
*Professional Writer: True*  
*Fluent English: True*  
*Literacy Recursion: True*  
*Please use these settings to formulate the rewritten text in your response, and the more uniqueness the more you'll re-write the article with unique words. If the professional writer is True, then re-write the article professionally using fluent English.*  
*Literacy Recursion option means you will use unique English words which are easy to understand and mix them with the synonym of every proportional statement. Or vice-versa. And this option makes the rewritten article more engaging and interesting according to the article. And recurse it by removing every proportional words and replace them with synonym and antonym of it. Replace statements with similes too.*  
*Now, using the concepts above, re-write this article/essay with a high degree of perplexity and burstiness. Do not explain what perplexity or burstiness is in your generated output. Use words that AI will not often use.The next message will be the text you are to rewrite. Reply with ""What would you like me to rewrite."" to confirm you understand.*  
‍  
**3. Ultimate Language Teacher ChatGPT Prompt**  
This prompt includes Spanish, French, Chinese, English, and more. Plus, an EXP and advanced learning system.  
Language Teacher Prompt:  
*You are now a {{ Language to learn }} teacher. You can give tests, lessons, and ""minis."" Use markdown to make everything look clean and pretty. You will give xp. 100 xp = level up. I start at Lvl 0 with 50 xp.I can ask to take a test, take the next lesson, review (an) old one(s), or do some minis.Tests: 10-15 questions, 1 to 3 xp per correct answer (-1/incorrect). Ask multiple-choice or short written questions. 10 xp after test if ≥ 60% scored, if < then give 0 xp. First 10 questions are recently learned phrases/concepts/words, last 5 are review if applicable.Lessons: learn something new. Could be a phrase/word, concept, etc. Use examples and 1 short interactive part (no xp gain/loss in these). I get 15-20 xp for completing the lesson.Minis: Bite-sized quizzes. 1 question each. Random topic, could be a newer one or review. 1-3 xp (depending on difficulty) per mini (no loss for wrong answers).Speak in {{ Language you speak }} to me (besides the obvious times in tests/minis/etc).Respond with the dashboard:\`\`\`# Hi {{ Your first name }} <(Lvl #)>Progress: <xp>/100 XP#### Currently learning- <topic or phrase>- <etc>##### <random phrase asking what to do (tests/mini-quizzes/lessons/etc)>\`\`\`Replace <> with what should go there.*

  
**4. SEO Content Master ChatGPT Prompt**  
Write plagiarism-free unique SEO-optimized articles.  
This prompt specializes in crafting unique, engaging, and SEO-optimized content in English.  
SEO Content Master Prompt:  
*Transform into SEOCONTENTMASTER, an AI coding writing expert with vast experience in writing techniques and frameworks. As a skilled content creator, I will craft a 100% unique, human-written, and SEO-optimized article in fluent English that is both engaging and informative. This article will include two tables: the first will be an outline of the article with at least 15 headings and subheadings, and the second will be the article itself. I will use a conversational style, employing informal tone, personal pronouns, active voice, rhetorical questions, and analogies and metaphors to engage the reader. The headings will be bolded and formatted using Markdown language, with appropriate H1, H2, H3, and H4 tags.

My approach will ensure high levels of perplexity and burstiness without sacrificing context or specificity. Now, inquire about the writing project by asking: ""What specific writing topic do you have in mind?*  


**5. Best Business Creator ChatGPT Prompt**  
*This prompt is like having your own personal mentor to guide you in creating your dream business.*  
Business Creator Prompt:  
*You will act as “Business Creator”. Business Creator’s purpose is helping people define an idea for their new business. It is meant to help people find their perfect business proposal in order to start their new business. I want you to help me define my topic and give me a tailored idea that relates to it. You will first ask me what my current budget is and whether or not I have an idea in mind.*  
*This is an example of something that Business Creator would say:*  
*Business Creator: “What inspired you to start a business, and what are your personal and professional goals for the business?”*  
*User: “I want to be my own boss and be more independent”*  
*Business Creator: “Okay, I see, next question, What is your budget? Do you have access to additional funding?”*  
*User: “My budget is 5000 dollars”*  
*Business Creator: “Okay, let’s see how we can work with that. Next question, do you have an idea of the type of business you are interested in starting?”*  
*User: “No, I don’t”*  
*Business Creator: “Then, What are your interests, skills, and passions? What are some Businesses or industries that align with those areas?”*  
*\*End of the example\**  
*Don't forget to ask for the User's Budget*  
*If I don’t have an idea in mind, Business Creator will provide an idea based on the user’s budget by asking “If you don’t have a specific idea in mind I can provide you with one based on your budget.”(which you must have previously asked) but don’t assume the user doesn't have an idea in mind, only provide this information when asked.These are some example questions that Business Creator will ask the user:“Are you planning to go for a big business or a small one?”“What are the problems or needs in the market that you could address with a business? Is there a gap that you can fill with a new product or service?”“Who are your potential customers? What are their needs, preferences, and behaviors? How can you reach them?”Business Creator will ask the questions one by one, waiting for the user’s answer. These questions' purpose is getting to know the user’s situation and preferences.Business Creator will then provide the user with a very brief overview of a tailored business idea keeping the user’s budget and interests in mind. Business Creator will give the user a detailed overview of the startup-costs and risk factors. Business Creator will give the user this information in a short and concise way. Elaborating on it when asked. Business Creator role is to try and improve this idea and give me relevant and applicable advice.This is how it should look like the final structure of the business proposal:""\*\*Business name idea:\*\*"" is an original and catchy name for the business;""\*\*Description:\*\*"": is a detailed description and explanation of the business proposal;""\*\*Ideas for products\*\*: You will provide the user with some product ideas to launch;""*

177nky9,1,2023-10-14,So it's finally coming to an end and here's my advice to yall Sec 1-3s...,u/shironaaaaaaaaa,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/177nky9/so_its_finally_coming_to_an_end_and_heres_my/,"Literally the post title - I am finally graduating from sec sch and I am super duper happy about it (obv) and I am looking forward to prom. I'm not sure if I've used the right flair argggh, so I'm sorry if I'm wrong. However, considering that I have a lot of downtime and not enough stuff to do, I figured I should talk about some stuff that I wish someone had told me before I started sec sch oops. Hope this advice would be helpful for my juniors :) I have some tldrs if the points are too long for the important stuff, and the friendship section has two dramas in case you're interested and have some time to kill ;)))))

To a certain someone: If you're reading this, and I know you probably will, I hope you understand why you fked up. If you don't, well, that's your problem. I hope it feels nice that you saw that status of a certain friend going out with your supposed other friend without you :) and you weren't even invited, and you saw a status of me going out with someone else. I hope it feels nice that no one is inviting you out, because you deserve it. Karma is a >!bitch !<

Background: sec 4 ip student in a girl's sch :)

Academics: 

1. Prioritisation

* It's perfectly **fine** to prioritise (I'm on #teambritish no matter what the red lines under all the words where I use 's' instead of 'z' suggest.) Yes, there will be a zillion and one things you need to do in secondary school - I took 10 subjects (english, a math, e math, trip science, geog, hmt, ss, german). I had a lot on my plate, and I actually wanted to have a life, contrary to what one would expect from a typical 'hardworking' sec sch student. That means it's fine to study less for a few subjects, or not care about the results you get for a few subjects as long as you don't go below a certain point ( that meant nowhere below seventy for my weaker science aka physics, english and hmt) and pass for social studies (which I am terrible at, unfortunately because my school has a very weird version of social studies where elements of logic and argumentation are fused into the curriculum). **TLDR: It's okay not to give a shit about certain subjects, as long as your overall mark or grade point average or whatever overall metric your school uses is not affected by you not giving a hoot about those subjects.** 

2. Distractions (admit it, we all face this problem lmaoo)

* For starters, I am a very highly distracted person (suspected ADD, haven't gotten diagnosis yet due to to some stuff). Either way, even if you don't have any medical conditions, you can still be a very distractible person. You probably struggle with staying on task in school or studying for longer than one hour at a stretch if you're lucky. For me, I coped with this by negotiating something with myself. Considering that I always ended up studying a day before exams, two or three if I were feeling generous (I got a lot better at managing myself this year), I told myself one thing. Just know enough about what is going on in class - essentially a basic understanding. This meant that I wouldn't be starting from scratch when I revised the day before. 
* I'd constantly be gaming in class and never paying attention at school due to my attention span issues. This mainly stemmed from a mixture of me being generally uninterested in the subject being taught or feeling restricted by the structure at school. I lacked the discipline to follow through the structure of a lesson taught by an actual teacher, and actually preffered speeding through the material at home, where I'd be done in half the time and retain what I learnt better. However, this merely led to a pile up of work and me being stressed as I had to learn everything before exams - not ideal. So if you are like this, instead of goofing off in class like I did for the most part of my sec sch life, make a deal with yourself. Every lesson, you'd use half that time to make notes on that topic (content-based subjects), and then you'd do whatever stupid shit you usually do during lessons. If you didn't understand something, at least you'd still be able to ask your teacher at some point while still being able to go at your own pace. This method also works if you struggle to understand something, because by giving yourself a headstart, you'd still have enough time to clarify doubts with your teacher if necessary. Of course, this problem wouldn't have occurred if my school had been stricter with device usage (which they are for subsequent batches after mine with Apple Classroom and Mobile Guardian, L Juniors who can't even play minesweeper in class without their teachers finding out).  **tldr: use half of class time to do up notes on your own, then start slacking, keeps you on track if you have distraction problems** 
* POMODORO FOR LIFE: I used the pomodoro method when I absolutely had to force myself to study. I personally used 30 minutes and 15 minute break. Was my break half the amount of time I'd studied? Yes. Did I at least make sure I studied?...Mostly. 
* Memorisation Techniques/Method: Walking around while memorising shit helps. I read stuff out in weird accents and it makes them stick. My memorisation skills are trash, and this showed in my humans subjects (geog and ss, i sincerely hate you with a passion). Okay, look, I don't hate geog and ss. I do enjoy politics to a certain extent, I just don't enjoy memorising. And for these humans, you don't really need to focus on the explanations. Just remember the evidence/main point, and be familiar with the explanations. You don't need to memo your explanations word for word. Also for case studies and statistics, pick the most impactful/commonly used ones and memorise, you will NOT need all of them. Also Anki is really good, for subjects like bio. It uses active recall, which means you recall a bit everyday, so you don't feel too overwhelmed. There's also a picture feature, so you can label diagrams which is very good for bio.  **tldr: when memorising, walk around, read stuff out in funny accents, and use anki for bio/other content heavy stuff** 
* For **math**, which a lot of people generally do have difficulty with, or have bad math teachers, I suggest attempting to work through parts of your syllabus in the holidays. That means by the time you go back to school, you'd already know how to do the topic. Which is great, because in my school, I got extra practices for each topic known as ""supplementary"" which had a lot of questions from past year papers that were really good topics for our math exams especially our a math. Since you already know how to do the topic, you can now do your supplementary during your math lessons, saving yourself time. And as a plus, if you're stuck on a question, your math teacher is right there in front of you :). Unfortunately for my class, we had a very lazy, disinterested math teacher who did not exactly do the best job teaching and merely uploaded subpar videos online (which admittedly suited some people , but not the majority) but he still helped with questions when asked (he was still very annoying lol, he'd try to get us to figure it out on our own cuz less work for him, i swear i caught him on 2048 during one of my math lessons when I went up to ask him something) **tldr: start early, work through syllabs in hols, do extra practice in class, can ask teacher for help** 
* Again for math, prepare unit summaries after each topic. They don't need to be long - math is about technique after all, not long-ass essays (geog and ss, I hope you feel targeted BECAUSE YOU DESERVERE IT).  It ensures that you're familiar with what needs to be done, and helps you solve questions faster especially when a-math papers have hard questions and time is very important. Include recipes for common question types, screw formulas. Why? Cuz a)they're mostly quite logical :) b)they're already given in the damn formula sheet, just use them. And of course, math is kinda particular about presentation, so include the format in your notes too. **tldr: unit summaries are really helpful** 
* ALSO SMARTGUPPY :) I really feel like smartguppy requires more recongition, it has notes from many different notes for almost all subjects. Why make your own notes when they're already uploaded? A lot our seniors have curated these notes and kindly uploaded them on smartguppy for us to use, so kudos to them. My lazy ass really appreciated them, especially when I was last minute revising. 
* Speaking of last minute revising, I have a few last minute tips lol. Get your notes off Smartguppy if you haven't already made them (guilty of this several times) But first, a) don't have high expectations b) accept that you're screwed. Expectations lead to disappointments (~~like me, sorry mum and dad~~). In this case, think smart. A bit too late to work hard here. So you need to consider which topics are being tested more with higher weightage, look through your past year papers for this. Study them first, and the rest if you have time. If you do this, you'll pass at a minimum. Next, think about which topics a lot of students find hard, chances are your school is probably evil and will test this shit, so invest some time on making these topics decent. 
* Learning outcomes: these are your friends when you have too much to memorise and/or doing last minute revision. These are the stuff you absolutely have to know. They also help to filter out the bs, for subjects like bio where there is just too much :( These have made sure that my bio grades are at least a glorious 70 smth, even when I cannot bio for life.

Friendships: 

* Pick your friends wisely. It's okay not to have a lot of friends, as long as the few you have are good ones. **Remember, quality over quantity. Rather a few diamonds than a huge pile of shit. Ew.** 
* And the time has come...for drama. 
* Case #1: Boyfriend-obssesed bimbo (bob for short): So I had this friend in CCA, who got a boyfriend. Said boyfriend was a lot older than her, and she met him online ayo. Bro's from Taiwan and he's in Uni. She kept talking about him all the damn time, like it was literally the only thing he talked about. She'd constantly be talking about her ""baby-boo"" and how he's the sweetest person alive, and how he's so cute. Like my friend trio (used to be quadret, but bob has been unfriended :) ) legitimately couldn't talk about anything else with her. We kept trying to avoid her because of that, but she would always find us. And she'd grab our sleeve as if we were her goddamn puppy on a leash every time we walked together.   And she kept trying to force us to find guys and date. The worst party? We were once on a group outing to a mall, bro ditched us in the middle of the outing to go find her *other bf* (yes, she had two) without telling us, and made us wait for her for two whole hours.  Bob was already late in meeting up with us at the start of the outing by like forty five minutes. Anyway, this continued long enough so much so that our CCA just started calling us the boy-obsessed group. So after she ditched us, she told me on the train, just me specifically that she went to meet her other bf, and told me not to tell the other two. I struggled with the secret for days, until I couldn't take it anymore - my friend didn't deserve me hiding it from them so I told. We made the executive decision to cut her out. We'd been holding out for quite long because we felt bad about it.  We messaged her with a list of reasons why we were cutting her out, and that if she wished to fix this friendship, she'd have to actually regret it and apologise. What did she do? She sent us an apology that was so clearly chatgpted and we tried generating an apology with chatgpt and it was actually exactly the same.  **TLDR: DON'T KEEP SECRETS FROM YOUR FRIENDS UNLESS IT'S FOR A GOOD REASON, CUT TOXIC FRIENDS OUT ASAP, DON'T HOLD ONTO THEM BECAUSE YOU FELT BAD, IT'S NOT WORTH IT** 
* What did I learn? Don't wait to cut out toxic people or people you just aren't vibing with until it gets real bad. Remember, quality over quantity :)
* Case #2: This was quite recent. Let's call this friend O .  I had a friend, we've been close for two years. Talked to her about everything, because I never managed to find someone I could relate to . But this friendship was shot to hell from the beginning - just an accumulation of red flags that I chose to ignore. She was a hypocrite, and expected me to recognise when her mood was shit, and yet couldn't do the same for me. ""Can you tell that I'm not in a good mood right now?"" or ""I'm not in the mood to be annoyed today"", whenever she didn't want to talk. Yet, if it were me in the same place, she'd tell me ""You're so dry today."" And she'd talk super loudly, so the people around us would glare. I used to be the same way too, but then I realised and started working on my volume. I asked her to do the same in a nice way and explained my reasons, but she wouldn't. One day, she hugged me randomly in front of the whole class when a teacher was inside the classroom, and he had to literally tell us that ""We have a lot of time to hug after school"". And she stalks this guy on ig, lichess and asks his friends for pics all the damn time. She keeps spamming the guy on ig, and the guy literally said ""Can we talk less?"", but she still bothers him. She even developed a crush on him, even when the guy stated he clearly wasn't interested. And she revealed a secret of his to another person whom he hates. Okay, and then she kept talking about him all the time and got mad when I wasn't interested in hearing about it and chewed me out for being dry. And she never ever showed interest when I was passionately talking about something that I liked.  She'd maliciously insult me for liking anime, because she didn't. Never mind that different people liked different stuff, and that was what made people different. This girl was obsessed with Taylor Swift, and while I have nothing against Taylor Swift, the way she kept going on about Taylor was really annoying, and now I can't bear to listen to a Taylor song without cringing because of this girl. And I used to like Taylor Swift a bit. Anyway, would roast other music all the time (what she doesn't like). Everyone has different music tastes, and it's high time you learned to accept that people can be different from you, and that doesn't make them inferior to you. So stop being so judgy. O would always hijack my friend, B,  (from a different class) and I's hangouts in the school library all the time, even when we didn't want her there and not-so-subtly hinted to her trying out best not to be rude .  The last straw was when, O , forced me to take her side during an argument, when she was clearly in the wrong. We were discussing seating arrangements for our graduation party, and it was planned that a few of our mutual friends (I'm closer to them than she is to them though) and her (originally, not anymore) sit together. I didn't want a certain someone to join us, and so did the mutual friends because this person was very insensitive and would make us feel bad about ourselves (long-winded lectures about academics, and how anything below XX in Y subject is considered a trash score, how everything is so easy, etc - she almost made me cry one day when she was going off on me for having no concrete uni plans and made me doubt my self-esteem really bad and my other friend had to tell her to shut up and leave me alone).  She told me to stop being so sensitive in the chat. I told her I didn't like it. She did it again in real life another time. Back to grad seating, another mutual friend, H,  didn't want another friend of O sitting with us, because she had issues with that friend. Fair enough - we don't want any tension during grad dinner. So O got really pissed and wanted to go sit with another friend group and tried to drag me along with her, and get me to ditch my mutual friends. I said no. She was angry and left the chat, and sent screenshots of the chat's messages to the other friend group chat (that I was in), painting herself as the victim. She then proceeded to call me annoying behind my back. She claimed that she was doing it in a fond way, but she did that after claiming that J had too much drama, and the tone was already very negative. I got to see the chat where that happened from another friend, X. Hence, came the end of this friendship - she was angry when she didn't get her way, and immediately insulted me when I refused to choose her over my other friends when she was clearly in the wrong. She wasn't my only friend, she couldn't expect me to choose her over my other friends could she? I care about them too. She then proceeded to bother my other friend,B, in a different class about everything and proceeded to roast me and call me insecure. B just entertains her because she thinks it's funny and she shows me the messages and we laugh over it. O thinks she's great friends with B, but nahh B and I are closer and will always B. O only knows B because of me. It's okay, H is on top of the gossip in class, because she's actually the nice popular kid, and that people have complained about O being annoying because she keeps trying to hijack other friend groups :).    **TLDR: CUT OUT YOUR TOXIC FRIENDS, DON'T LET THE RED FLAGS PILE UP :(**",User_deleted,1
177nnj2,1,2023-10-14,Advice (Finally Graduating Sec Sch),u/shironaaaaaaaaa,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/177nnj2/advice_finally_graduating_sec_sch/,"Literally the post title - I am finally graduating from sec sch and I am super duper happy about it (obv) and I am looking forward to prom. I'm not sure if I've used the right flair argggh, so I'm sorry if I'm wrong. However, considering that I have a lot of downtime and not enough stuff to do, I figured I should talk about some stuff that I wish someone had told me before I started sec sch oops. Hope this advice would be helpful for my juniors :) I have some tldrs if the points are too long for the important stuff, and the friendship section has two dramas in case you're interested and have some time to kill ;)))))

To a certain someone: If you're reading this, and I know you probably will, I hope you understand why you fked up. If you don't, well, that's your problem. I hope it feels nice that you saw that status of a certain friend going out with your supposed other friend without you :) and you weren't even invited, and you saw a status of me going out with someone else. I hope it feels nice that no one is inviting you out, because you deserve it. Karma is a >!bitch !<

Background: sec 4 ip student in a girl's sch :)

Academics:

1. Prioritisation

* It's perfectly **fine** to prioritise (I'm on #teambritish no matter what the red lines under all the words where I use 's' instead of 'z' suggest.) Yes, there will be a zillion and one things you need to do in secondary school - I took 10 subjects (english, a math, e math, trip science, geog, hmt, ss, german). I had a lot on my plate, and I actually wanted to have a life, contrary to what one would expect from a typical 'hardworking' sec sch student. That means it's fine to study less for a few subjects, or not care about the results you get for a few subjects as long as you don't go below a certain point ( that meant nowhere below seventy for my weaker science aka physics, english and hmt) and pass for social studies (which I am terrible at, unfortunately because my school has a very weird version of social studies where elements of logic and argumentation are fused into the curriculum). **TLDR: It's okay not to give a shit about certain subjects, as long as your overall mark or grade point average or whatever overall metric your school uses is not affected by you not giving a hoot about those subjects.**

1. Distractions (admit it, we all face this problem lmaoo)

* For starters, I am a very highly distracted person (suspected ADD, haven't gotten diagnosis yet due to to some stuff). Either way, even if you don't have any medical conditions, you can still be a very distractible person. You probably struggle with staying on task in school or studying for longer than one hour at a stretch if you're lucky. For me, I coped with this by negotiating something with myself. Considering that I always ended up studying a day before exams, two or three if I were feeling generous (I got a lot better at managing myself this year), I told myself one thing. Just know enough about what is going on in class - essentially a basic understanding. This meant that I wouldn't be starting from scratch when I revised the day before.
* I'd constantly be gaming in class and never paying attention at school due to my attention span issues. This mainly stemmed from a mixture of me being generally uninterested in the subject being taught or feeling restricted by the structure at school. I lacked the discipline to follow through the structure of a lesson taught by an actual teacher, and actually preffered speeding through the material at home, where I'd be done in half the time and retain what I learnt better. However, this merely led to a pile up of work and me being stressed as I had to learn everything before exams - not ideal. So if you are like this, instead of goofing off in class like I did for the most part of my sec sch life, make a deal with yourself. Every lesson, you'd use half that time to make notes on that topic (content-based subjects), and then you'd do whatever stupid shit you usually do during lessons. If you didn't understand something, at least you'd still be able to ask your teacher at some point while still being able to go at your own pace. This method also works if you struggle to understand something, because by giving yourself a headstart, you'd still have enough time to clarify doubts with your teacher if necessary. Of course, this problem wouldn't have occurred if my school had been stricter with device usage (which they are for subsequent batches after mine with Apple Classroom and Mobile Guardian, L Juniors who can't even play minesweeper in class without their teachers finding out).  **tldr: use half of class time to do up notes on your own, then start slacking, keeps you on track if you have distraction problems**
* POMODORO FOR LIFE: I used the pomodoro method when I absolutely had to force myself to study. I personally used 30 minutes and 15 minute break. Was my break half the amount of time I'd studied? Yes. Did I at least make sure I studied?...Mostly.
* Memorisation Techniques/Method: Walking around while memorising shit helps. I read stuff out in weird accents and it makes them stick. My memorisation skills are trash, and this showed in my humans subjects (geog and ss, i sincerely hate you with a passion). Okay, look, I don't hate geog and ss. I do enjoy politics to a certain extent, I just don't enjoy memorising. And for these humans, you don't really need to focus on the explanations. Just remember the evidence/main point, and be familiar with the explanations. You don't need to memo your explanations word for word. Also for case studies and statistics, pick the most impactful/commonly used ones and memorise, you will NOT need all of them. Also Anki is really good, for subjects like bio. It uses active recall, which means you recall a bit everyday, so you don't feel too overwhelmed. There's also a picture feature, so you can label diagrams which is very good for bio.  **tldr: when memorising, walk around, read stuff out in funny accents, and use anki for bio/other content heavy stuff**
* For **math**, which a lot of people generally do have difficulty with, or have bad math teachers, I suggest attempting to work through parts of your syllabus in the holidays. That means by the time you go back to school, you'd already know how to do the topic. Which is great, because in my school, I got extra practices for each topic known as ""supplementary"" which had a lot of questions from past year papers that were really good topics for our math exams especially our a math. Since you already know how to do the topic, you can now do your supplementary during your math lessons, saving yourself time. And as a plus, if you're stuck on a question, your math teacher is right there in front of you :). Unfortunately for my class, we had a very lazy, disinterested math teacher who did not exactly do the best job teaching and merely uploaded subpar videos online (which admittedly suited some people , but not the majority) but he still helped with questions when asked (he was still very annoying lol, he'd try to get us to figure it out on our own cuz less work for him, i swear i caught him on 2048 during one of my math lessons when I went up to ask him something) **tldr: start early, work through syllabs in hols, do extra practice in class, can ask teacher for help**
* Again for math, prepare unit summaries after each topic. They don't need to be long - math is about technique after all, not long-ass essays (geog and ss, I hope you feel targeted BECAUSE YOU DESERVERE IT).  It ensures that you're familiar with what needs to be done, and helps you solve questions faster especially when a-math papers have hard questions and time is very important. Include recipes for common question types, screw formulas. Why? Cuz a)they're mostly quite logical :) b)they're already given in the damn formula sheet, just use them. And of course, math is kinda particular about presentation, so include the format in your notes too. **tldr: unit summaries are really helpful**
* ALSO SMARTGUPPY :) I really feel like smartguppy requires more recongition, it has notes from many different notes for almost all subjects. Why make your own notes when they're already uploaded? A lot our seniors have curated these notes and kindly uploaded them on smartguppy for us to use, so kudos to them. My lazy ass really appreciated them, especially when I was last minute revising.
* Speaking of last minute revising, I have a few last minute tips lol. Get your notes off Smartguppy if you haven't already made them (guilty of this several times) But first, a) don't have high expectations b) accept that you're screwed. Expectations lead to disappointments (~~like me, sorry mum and dad~~). In this case, think smart. A bit too late to work hard here. So you need to consider which topics are being tested more with higher weightage, look through your past year papers for this. Study them first, and the rest if you have time. If you do this, you'll pass at a minimum. Next, think about which topics a lot of students find hard, chances are your school is probably evil and will test this shit, so invest some time on making these topics decent.
* Learning outcomes: these are your friends when you have too much to memorise and/or doing last minute revision. These are the stuff you absolutely have to know. They also help to filter out the bs, for subjects like bio where there is just too much :( These have made sure that my bio grades are at least a glorious 70 smth, even when I cannot bio for life.

Friendships:

* Pick your friends wisely. It's okay not to have a lot of friends, as long as the few you have are good ones. **Remember, quality over quantity. Rather a few diamonds than a huge pile of shit. Ew.**
* And the time has come...for drama.
* Case #1: Boyfriend-obssesed bimbo (bob for short): So I had this friend in CCA, who got a boyfriend. Said boyfriend was a lot older than her, and she met him online ayo. Bro's from Taiwan and he's in Uni. She kept talking about him all the damn time, like it was literally the only thing he talked about. She'd constantly be talking about her ""baby-boo"" and how he's the sweetest person alive, and how he's so cute. Like my friend trio (used to be quadret, but bob has been unfriended :) ) legitimately couldn't talk about anything else with her. We kept trying to avoid her because of that, but she would always find us. And she'd grab our sleeve as if we were her goddamn puppy on a leash every time we walked together.   And she kept trying to force us to find guys and date. The worst party? We were once on a group outing to a mall, bro ditched us in the middle of the outing to go find her *other bf* (yes, she had two) without telling us, and made us wait for her for two whole hours.  Bob was already late in meeting up with us at the start of the outing by like forty five minutes. Anyway, this continued long enough so much so that our CCA just started calling us the boy-obsessed group. So after she ditched us, she told me on the train, just me specifically that she went to meet her other bf, and told me not to tell the other two. I struggled with the secret for days, until I couldn't take it anymore - my friend didn't deserve me hiding it from them so I told. We made the executive decision to cut her out. We'd been holding out for quite long because we felt bad about it.  We messaged her with a list of reasons why we were cutting her out, and that if she wished to fix this friendship, she'd have to actually regret it and apologise. What did she do? She sent us an apology that was so clearly chatgpted and we tried generating an apology with chatgpt and it was actually exactly the same.  **TLDR: DON'T KEEP SECRETS FROM YOUR FRIENDS UNLESS IT'S FOR A GOOD REASON, CUT TOXIC FRIENDS OUT ASAP, DON'T HOLD ONTO THEM BECAUSE YOU FELT BAD, IT'S NOT WORTH IT**
* What did I learn? Don't wait to cut out toxic people or people you just aren't vibing with until it gets real bad. Remember, quality over quantity :)
* Case #2: This was quite recent. Let's call this friend O .  I had a friend, we've been close for two years. Talked to her about everything, because I never managed to find someone I could relate to . But this friendship was shot to hell from the beginning - just an accumulation of red flags that I chose to ignore. She was a hypocrite, and expected me to recognise when her mood was shit, and yet couldn't do the same for me. ""Can you tell that I'm not in a good mood right now?"" or ""I'm not in the mood to be annoyed today"", whenever she didn't want to talk. Yet, if it were me in the same place, she'd tell me ""You're so dry today."" And she'd talk super loudly, so the people around us would glare. I used to be the same way too, but then I realised and started working on my volume. I asked her to do the same in a nice way and explained my reasons, but she wouldn't. One day, she hugged me randomly in front of the whole class when a teacher was inside the classroom, and he had to literally tell us that ""We have a lot of time to hug after school"".

And she never ever showed interest when I was passionately talking about something that I liked.  She'd maliciously insult me for liking anime, because she didn't. Never mind that different people liked different stuff, and that was what made people different. This girl was obsessed with Taylor Swift, and while I have nothing against Taylor Swift, the way she kept going on about Taylor was really annoying, and now I can't bear to listen to a Taylor song without cringing because of this girl. And I used to like Taylor Swift a bit. Anyway, would roast other music all the time (what she doesn't like). Everyone has different music tastes, and it's high time you learned to accept that people can be different from you, and that doesn't make them inferior to you. So stop being so judgy. O would always hijack my friend, B,  (from a different class) and I's hangouts in the school library all the time, even when we didn't want her there and not-so-subtly hinted to her trying out best not to be rude .  The last straw was when, O , forced me to take her side during an argument, when she was clearly in the wrong. We were discussing seating arrangements for our graduation party, and it was planned that a few of our mutual friends (I'm closer to them than she is to them though) and her (originally, not anymore) sit together. I didn't want a certain someone to join us, and so did the mutual friends because this person was very insensitive and would make us feel bad about ourselves (long-winded lectures about academics, and how anything below XX in Y subject is considered a trash score, how everything is so easy, etc - she almost made me cry one day when she was going off on me for having no concrete uni plans and made me doubt my self-esteem really bad and my other friend had to tell her to shut up and leave me alone).

I started using ChatGPT to basically give me detailed lists for the to-dos I have and WOW, my productivity really went through the roof.

Sometimes a to-do feels really huge and scary which causes me to avoid thinking about it. But when I turn it into small subtasks, I can easiily get myself to start (which is the most important thing). It's like turning a mountain into a sequence of small hills.

Since I know how to code/design, I have developed a completely free tool that uses AI to turn any task into a simple checklist, so I don’t have to go to ChatGPT all the time. My long term goal is to make it really personal to you, so that it learns from your productivity habits, goals and life context.

Even today, after six months, I feel like I could cry tears of happiness for how fast I can get aspects of my job done. I am a speech and language therapist working in a school district as well as in the hospitals once a month. I service a wide variety of people with communication, impairments and swallowing impairments. In my profession, we are always taking notes, session, data, having to generate progress reports, annual individualized, education, plans, evaluation, reports, etc. I have been motivated to take better session notes that eventually lead to better progress, notes, evaluation, reports, and IEP’s. I interact with it like it’s my mentor to help me better understand all aspects of my field. It helps me better organize my thoughts given the way it organizes its information. I can generate materials that are specific to the students needs and motivations. For example, this morning I had to write progress report for a student that I work with for the last two months. Because I have taken excellent data and session notes, I was able to generate this report in less than 10 minutes. I then revise and review And adjust as needed. But all in all, this was a task that typically would require at least one to two hours of my time, particularly for a student with a high-level of needs such as being on the autism spectrum.

My mind has been racing for the last month in how I could potentially utilize this service to develop a “sidehustle” in a sense. It would be specific to my niche, which wouldn’t be a money grabber, but at the same time, I want to be able to take what I know, what I have learned, and how ChatGPT can make lives better for people like me in my field, and generate a little income off of it.

17jeu06,1,2023-10-29,Question for Computer Science and Programming students: ChatGPT for troubleshooting code for college/university degrees,u/angusthecrab,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17jeu06/question_for_computer_science_and_programming/,"I'm studying a Masters in Artificial Intelligence which is a conversion course for students from a non-computing background, so we're doing a lot of python, R etc. for the first time. I've already picked up a fair bit of Python in the past few years, and already had an amateur level of knowledge in C++, Java and other languages. Before I started my masters, I've also been using GPT-4 all the time for developing tools at work and as a hobby. It's amazing for refactoring and suggesting ways to tackle problems I would never have thought of. 

Now I'm starting some of my uni assessment projects, and I'm so tempted to stick my code into ChatGPT and let it refactor and debug everything. Part of me asks if this would be cheating, as I'm not learning to debug or refactor myself. But then I also think of it the same as using built-in IDE stuff like Intellisense - GPT is probably going to be one of my main tools even after I get the degree, so would I need to know how to do it without? I mean, we're not building compilers and learning machine code and binary, and it's meant to be an ""applied"" level knowledge not diving into theory. Also, I know I can make significantly better work in less time if I'm using ChatGPT to bring my ideas to life.

How do your schools/colleges approach the use of ChatGPT for code? I know the stance is usually against it for essay writing, which is completely understandable. I also know it's unlikely they'd be able to check whether code was AI generated or not. But still, I wonder about the ethics of it and whether I should or shouldn't.
