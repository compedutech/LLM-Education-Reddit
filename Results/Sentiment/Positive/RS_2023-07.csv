14tivjt,1,2023-07-07,How to index a textbook with chatGPT,u/ericInglert,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/14tivjt/how_to_index_a_textbook_with_chatgpt/,"**tl;dr** Hack professor used chatGPT and some Terminal wizardry to ingest textbook manuscript and prepare an index for the back of his book. Incidentally resulted in reduction of alcohol consumption.

**Introduction:**  
Hello all. I wanted to show a workflow that I found to be extremely useful and an excellent example of an iterative yet nuanced bit of leverage for a LLM. I would consider myself a computer hack. My education was focused on becoming a professional architect, the built-environment kind. I am confident that a more clever person could streamline this process. 

Here is the ""**design brief**"" for my method: *Create an index of no more than 250 keywords for seven chapters of a textbook on architectural illustration for undergraduate students*. The traditional method for doing this would entail rereading all the text with a highlighter in one hand and a glass of bourbon in the other...and iterating over many hours/bottles. Still a valid option depending on your needs!

**Materials**:

* Word docx of manuscripts for seven chapters.
* < [https://chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com) \>
* Terminal emulator (zsh)
* vim text editor

**Workflow steps**:

1. Convert docx files to markdown: `pandoc -c basic.css -f docx inglertChapterOne_211001.docx -so ch1.md`
2. Since chatGPT recommended file chunks of less than 200 lines, then:
   1. Create file from first 200 lines of ch1.md: `head -n 200 ch1.md > 1-1.txt`
   2. Trim 200 lines from top of file ch1.md: `sed -i '' -e '1,200d' ch1.md`
   3. Iterate until ch1.md is equal to 0 bytes. (e.g., 1-1.txt, 1-2.txt, etc.)
3. Create prompt text. I had chatGPT help me to craft this. The prompt read as follows: *Using the following criteria for selection, provide an index of the following chunk of text and limit the length of the index to 25 terms:*
   1. *Relevance to architectural illustration*
   2. *Keywords include design, drawing, architecture and engineering*
   3. *Word is used frequently*
   4. *Term is specific and precise*
   5. *Suggest related terms for cross-referencing*
   6. *Accommodate undergraduate student reader comprehension*
   7. *Consistent, organized and comprehensive results*
4. So as to ease the typing, I wrote this prompt to a file < prompt.md >
5. Open chatGPT and in the prompt do the following:
   1. Switch to Terminal emulator and `cat prompt.md | pbcopy`
   2. Paste into chatGPT ""Send a message"" box
   3. Back to Terminal and `cat 1-1.txt | pbcopy`
   4. Paste into chatGPT
6. With varying results the yield from chatGPT gave something useful. Highlight and copy the text response.
7. In Terminal open vim and insert contents of clipboard.
   1. Ignore duplicates and ""close cousins"" for now and continue to build file.
   2. To keep track I built the index chapter by chapter and then combined: `cat ch1.txt ch2.txt ch3.txt ch4.txt ch5.txt ch6.txt ch7.txt >> indexVolOne.md`
   3. Within vim, open ""indexVolOne.md"" and sort and remove duplicates: `:%sort ui`
   4. Save out the file to a new name: `:w sorted_indexVolOne.md`
8. Fetch a bourbon and then open file `vim sorted_indexVolOne.md`
   1. Proceed line by line to reduce the ""close cousins"" and fine-tune with that human touch.
   2. If `wc -l sorted_VolOne.md` is less than 250, then pour another bourbon and pat self on back.
9. Convert file back to docx for editor: `pandoc -c basic.css -f sorted_VolOne.md -so indexVolOne.docx`

Total time on task for this noob was about five hours, including multiple queries to chatGPT for help with terminal commands, design limitations, etc. When I start to index volume two, I anticipate that I can refer to this posting archived on reddit, and cut this task in half.

Yea, undeniably it's responsive, knowledgeable, and helpful in numerous aspects. I study with it, do my writing with it, code with it and so on.

It gives me an illusion that I am good at many things. However, now when I tried to recall  and apply what I really learnt from my brain only, I found that I barely can😐. I didn't really ""learn"" those things. Instead, I was just looking up the answer from ChatGPT.

I wonder if anyone else also experienced the same thing. Is this something to be worried about? How should I use it more properly?

Highest marks in every subject. Praise from all the teachers. Always participated (and won) in reading and spelling contests. Everyone told me I was very smart, and I actually believed it. But I'm starting to get depressed the more I realize that was never true.  
  
A few months ago I met my boyfriend. He is super caring, smart, adorable, funny, and I love him in every way. And my boyfriend is SUPER smart. He gets amazing grades as well (lower than mine, but we live in Europe, and in high school you can choose your own course with classes dedicated to a specific area; I'm a Humanities student as he's a Economics student, his course is harder than mine), he can solve logic games in a breeze, amazing at Wordle, beats me in checkers and chess, amazing at thinking quickly, good in social situations, you name it. He's smart. And it's making me feel like I was never actually smart at all. The only good thing about my brain is I'm good at memorizing the contents of a subject to vomit them all in a later test, and then I don't even remember things anymore. I feel like I have zero logic capacity. I'm not good at thinking quickly. I'm not disciplined, I'm super lazy at everything. I don't even have the energy or patience to wash myself or brush my teeth sometimes. And my closest friends tell me that I'm really not that smart outside of school. My boyfriend never really made me feel like I wasn't smart, on the contrary: he tells me that everytime I get a good grade, he praises me when I make a good decision, he always reassures me when I say these things. But I just can't believe him anymore. I'm not smart.  
  
Not just that, but I'm not good at anything I do or try. I have no hobbies outside of gaming and watching YouTube videos or Netflix. Some of my teachers say I'm good at writing, but I've been mainly copying or getting ideas from ChatGPT for my past few projects because I just can't be bothered to write anymore. Despite getting amazing grades at Maths, I make super obvious mistakes that could be avoided if I just payed more attention. I can't create anything, I'm not good at drawing, even though I've tried since I was a kid - but it just doesn't seem to work out. I'm really starting to get scared by this, because I'm worried that when I get to College and adult life hits me in the face, I'll just miserably fail because it's super hard. I feel like everything I did until now, all my academic progress, is worthless, because I'm a complete failure at everything. Currently I'm writing this and crying my eyes out because I just don't want to feel like this anymore. I'm lazy and stupid and horrible, and that's everything I have to say about myself, and I can't believe otherwise. And I'm making a big deal out of this because ""smart"" is the quality everyone gave me over the years, and it's the only thing my parents always wanted me to be, and if I'm not smart then my whole life is just a lie and I don't know what to do with myself anymore.

157ak06,1,2023-07-23,AI Weekly Rundown (July 15 to July 21),u/RohitAkki,ArtificialInteligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/157ak06/ai_weekly_rundown_july_15_to_july_21/,"Meta makes huge AI strides. Apple working on its own ChatGPT. Wix builds websites with AI. The AI revolution isn’t slowing down any soon.  


* **Meta merges ChatGPT & Midjourney into one**  
\- Meta has launched CM3leon (pronounced chameleon), a single foundation model that does both text-to-image and image-to-text generation. So what’s the big deal about it?  
\- LLMs largely use Transformer architecture, while image generation models rely on  diffusion models. CM3leon is a multimodal language model based on Transformer architecture, not Diffusion. Thus, it is the first multimodal model trained with a recipe adapted from text-only language models.  
\- CM3leon achieves state-of-the-art performance despite being trained with 5x less compute than previous transformer-based methods. It performs a variety of tasks– all with a single model:
   * Text-guided image generation and editing
   * Text-to-image
   * Text-guided image editing
   * Text tasks
   * Structure-guided image editing
   * Segmentation-to-image
   * Object-to-image
* **NaViT: AI generates images in any resolution, any aspect ratio**  
\- NaViT (Native Resolution ViT) by Google Deepmind is a Vision Transformer (ViT) model that allows processing images of any resolution and aspect ratio. Unlike traditional models that resize images to a fixed resolution, NaViT uses sequence packing during training to handle inputs of varying sizes.  
\- This approach improves training efficiency and leads to better results on tasks like image and video classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. NaViT offers flexibility at inference time, allowing for a smooth trade-off between cost and performance.
* **Air AI: AI to replace sales & CSM teams**  
\- Introducing Air AI, a conversational AI that can perform full 5-40 minute long sales and customer service calls over the phone that sound like a human. And it can perform actions autonomously across 5,000 unique applications.  
\- According to one of its co-founders, Air is currently on live calls talking to real people, profitably producing for real businesses. And it’s not limited to any one use case. You can create an AI SDR, 24/7 CS agent, Closer, Account Executive, etc., or prompt it for your specific use case and get creative (therapy, talk to Aristotle, etc.)
* **Wix’s new AI tool creates entire websites**  
\- Website-building platform Wix is introducing a new feature that allows users to create an entire website using only AI prompts. While Wix already offers AI generation options for site creation, this new feature relies solely on algorithms instead of templates to build a custom site. Users will be prompted to answer a series of questions about their preferences and needs, and the AI will generate a website based on their responses.  
\- By combining OpenAI's ChatGPT for text creation and Wix's proprietary AI models for other aspects, the platform delivers a unique website-building experience. Upcoming features like the AI Assistant Tool, AI Page, Section Creator, and Object Eraser will further enhance the platform's capabilities. Wix's CEO, Avishai Abrahami, reaffirmed the company's dedication to AI's potential to revolutionize website creation and foster business growth.
* **MedPerf makes AI better for Healthcare**  
\- MLCommons, an open global engineering consortium, has announced the launch of MedPerf, an open benchmarking platform for evaluating the performance of medical AI models on diverse real-world datasets. The platform aims to improve medical AI's generalizability and clinical impact by making data easily and safely accessible to researchers while prioritizing patient privacy and mitigating legal and regulatory risks.   
\- MedPerf utilizes federated evaluation, allowing AI models to be assessed without accessing patient data, and offers orchestration capabilities to streamline research. The platform has already been successfully used in pilot studies and challenges involving brain tumor segmentation, pancreas segmentation, and surgical workflow phase recognition.
* **LLMs benefiting robotics and beyond**  
\- This study shows that LLMs can complete complex sequences of tokens, even when the sequences are randomly generated or expressed using random tokens, and suggests that LLMs can serve as general sequence modelers without any additional training. The researchers explore how this capability can be applied to robotics, such as extrapolating sequences of numbers to complete motions or prompting reward-conditioned trajectories. Although there are limitations to deploying LLMs in real systems, this approach offers a promising way to transfer patterns from words to actions.
* **Meta unveils Llama 2, a worthy rival to ChatGPT**  
Meta has introduced Llama 2, the next generation of its open-source large language model. Here’s all you need to know:  
\- It is free for research and commercial use. You can download the model here.  
\- Microsoft is the preferred partner for Llama 2. It is also available through AWS, Hugging Face, and other providers.  
\- Llama 2 models outperform open-source chat models on most benchmarks tested, and based on human evaluations for helpfulness and safety, they may be a suitable substitute for closed-source models.  
\- Meta is opening access to Llama 2 with the support of a broad set of companies and people across tech, academia, and policy who also believe in an open innovation approach for AI.
* **Microsoft furthers its AI ambitions with major updates**  
\- At Microsoft Inspire, Meta and Microsoft announced support for the Llama 2 family of LLMs on Azure and Windows. In other news, Microsoft announced major updates for AI-powered Bing, Copilot, and more.  
\- It announced Bing Chat Enterprise, which gives organizations AI-powered chat for work with commercial data protection.  
\- Microsoft 365 Copilot will now be available for commercial customers for $30 per user per month. - Copilot is also coming to Teams phone and chat.  
\- It launched Vector Search in preview through Azure Cognitive search, which will capture the meaning and context of unstructured data to make search faster.  
\- It is rolling out multimodal capabilities via Visual Search in Chat. Leveraging OpenAI’s GPT-4 model, the feature lets anyone upload images and search the web for related content.
* **How is ChatGPT's behavior changing over time?**  
\- GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are the two most widely used LLM services, but how updates in each affect their behavior is unclear. A new study evaluated the behavior of the March 2023 and June 2023 versions of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on four tasks. And here are the findings:  
1. Solving math problems- GPT-4 got much worse, while GPT-3.5 greatly improved.  
2. Answering sensitive/dangerous questions- GPT-4 became less willing to respond directly, while GPT-3.5 was slightly more willing.  
3. Code generation- Both systems made more mistakes that stopped the code from running in June compared to March.  
4. Visual reasoning- Both systems improved slightly from March to June.  
\- It shows that the behavior of the same LLM service can change substantially in a relatively short period (and for the worse in some tasks), highlighting the need for continuous monitoring of LLM quality.
* **Apple Trials a ChatGPT-like AI Chatbot**  
\- Apple is developing AI tools, including its own large language model called ""Ajax"" and an AI chatbot named ""Apple GPT."" They are gearing up for a major AI announcement next year as it tries to catch up with competitors like OpenAI and Google.   
\- The company has multiple teams developing AI technology and addressing privacy concerns. While Apple has been integrating AI into its products for years, there is currently no clear strategy for releasing AI technology directly to consumers. However, executives are considering integrating AI tools into Siri to improve its functionality and keep up with advancements in AI.
* **Google AI’s SimPer unlocks potential of periodic learning**  
\- Google research team’s this paper introduces SimPer, a self-supervised learning method that focuses on capturing periodic or quasi-periodic changes in data. SimPer leverages the inherent periodicity in data by incorporating customized augmentations, feature similarity measures, and a generalized contrastive loss.   
\- SimPer exhibits superior data efficiency, robustness against spurious correlations, and generalization to distribution shifts, making it a promising approach for capturing and utilizing periodic information in diverse applications.
* **OpenAI doubles GPT-4 message cap to 50**  
\- OpenAI has doubled the number of messages ChatGPT Plus subscribers can send to GPT-4. Users can now send up to 50 messages in 3 hours, compared to the previous limit of 25 messages in 2 hours. And they are rolling out this update next week.
* **Google presents brain-to-music AI**  
\- New research called Brain2Music by Google and institutions from Japan has introduced a method for reconstructing music from brain activity captured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The generated music resembles the musical stimuli that human subjects experience with respect to semantic properties like genre, instrumentation, and mood.  
\- The paper explores the relationship between the Google MusicLM (text-to-music model) and the observed human brain activity when human subjects listen to music.
* **ChatGPT will now remember who you are & what you want**  
\- OpenAI is rolling out custom instructions to give you more control over how ChatGPT responds. It allows you to add preferences or requirements that you’d like ChatGPT to consider when generating its responses.  
\- ChatGPT will remember and consider the instructions every time it responds in the future, so you won’t have to repeat your preferences or information. Currently available in beta in the Plus plan, the feature will expand to all users in the coming weeks.
* **Meta-Transformer lets AI models process 12 modalities**  
\- New research has proposed Meta-Transformer, a novel unified framework for multimodal learning. It is the first framework to perform unified learning across 12 modalities, and it leverages a frozen encoder to perform multimodal perception without any paired multimodal training data.  
\- Experimentally, Meta-Transformer achieves outstanding performance on various datasets regarding 12 modalities, which validates the further potential of Meta-Transformer for unified multimodal learning.

158ain1,1,2023-07-24,OpenAI in Slack -- Supercharged Collaboration,u/Scubagerber,OpenAI,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/158ain1/openai_in_slack_supercharged_collaboration/,"Alternative Title: Catalyst AI or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bot

Hey r/OpenAI community!

Generative AI has taken the world by storm. When I first heard the news at the beginning of this year, I did not think much of it. After about a month, I started hearing stories of people trying to use the tool to start their own companies, which was when I started to dig in and think deeply about the implications, which then finally triggered my FOMO response.

Long story short, I decided to push this tool to see what its limits were. I have yet to find those limits. At this point, I've created an entire AI-as-a-Service platform, where a Slack workspace owner can come to my site, install generative AI into their Slack with a 1-click install, and immediately begin empowering their teams with this tool right inside their current workflows, right inside their business chat. My vision is to enable Human Intelligence with Artificial Intelligence, my vision is a rising tide lifts all ships, my vision is that when one teammate learns how to improve their process, the entire team sees and learns in real-time, as the interaction with generative AI is all stored in Slack and not hidden away in some obscure ChatGPT window.

The long version, for those who may want to try to follow suit, in February was when I started to engage with this tool myself, ask it questions, see how it works, and just not be afraid to engage with it. Playing is learning.

Then one day there was an issue at work. Once the server issues got resolved, roughly 100 users would still have to clear their local cache in order to log in to the tool (called Slipstream) that I developed and manage for our internal staff. I needed to send this email quickly as this was still early in the morning, but I also needed it to not suck as there would be more than 100 recipients, including managers. So, in a paragraph, I explained my predicament to ChatGPT, and I asked it to write an email, but I asked it to make the email a bit quippy:

>Good morning, Slipstreamers!  
>  
>If you're receiving this email, it's either because you're currently rocking the Slipstream training program or you're one of the rebels who haven't yet completed the quizzes. We won't judge, but we will remind you to get it done!  
>  
>Our Slipstream server has been upgraded to the latest version 6.10. However, with great upgrades come great glitches, and we've discovered one that affects all of you.  
>  
>The link you use to access your Slipstream training program has taken a hit in the upgrade and won't function unless you take one of the following steps:  
>  
>1. Clear your browser's cache and re-login to everything (Ugh, we know!).   
2. Embrace your inner Edge user and try an alternative browser to access Slipstream when you need to record your progress.  
>  
>Stay sharp, Slipstreamers!

I was floored. This was hilarious, to call my users Slipstreamers? We won't judge... Embrace your inner Edge user? Oh man, that was a bit of a lightbulb moment for me. My colleague emailed me a few minutes later and asked what was that all about that it was the funniest thing she'd read and was not expecting that from me. Being the person I am, I quickly explained to her how I was able to do it. This was March.

In April, I realized the teaching potential of this tool. I have a background in education, so I was imagining a classroom where each student interacted with a tablet with Generative AI. The AI could determine which students were excelling, but more importantly, which students were struggling and with which topics. At this point, a teacher could be alerted and could go to provide direct instruction on specific topics. So, after watching [Matt Wolfe design a computer game from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyKKhxYJ4U4), I decided to try his process, but instead of making a game, to make a GPT Tutor that could help learn any topic.

&#x200B;

[GPTutor, the first coding project I built with GPT](https://i.redd.it/h3acv9lbywdb1.gif)

At every step of the project, GPT was engaged as an advisor. GPT suggested the IDE (Android Studio), the programming language (Javascript). In 6 hours of copying & pasting errors and code, I had what I wanted. This was something I never imagined I could do by myself. This was what lit the fire inside, I then decided to push the limits, to see what the limit was of this new tool.

My main goal was to enable the company I work for. That's what I do, I'm in Internal Enablement. What is more enabling than getting GPT into our corporate business chat? Nothing, that's what. So the next weekend, I took the same approach but instead, this time, my goal was to make a Slack <> GPT integration. No idea how I would do it, but I made my proposal to GPT. GPT then said sure, you're going to need this handful of tools that I had never used, but I could do it.

So I started. I created a new folder, created a new text file, renamed the text file, opened it with Notepad++, and got to work copying and pasting. 8 hours later, it was built. I had it working.

Done, right? Everyone is going to love what I've created? Haha! Nope! My work had just begun.

I had this little dinky bot. I made this flat static website. GPT helped me actually start my own company, Catalyst AI, LLC... My initial plan was to somehow get meetings with customers where I could explain the bot, they would want to use it.

Then, I saw another Slack bot project that made use of the Managed Distribution feature, or 1-click install for the Slack bot. I had no idea that was a thing, but sure enough, some cursory research made me understand that this allows a Slack Workspace Owner to install your bot with a single click. This is when I got the idea to make an entirely automated solution, from start to finish, where a user could go to my site, install the bot, and if they like it, purchase it.

Same story. I took my proposal to GPT, and it said sure, you could do it, and explained how I could do it. I literally thought it was 100% hallucinating, but I said I was going to see how far I could push it, so one weekend I started. There were a few moments where I thought there was no way this was going to work, that I was in far too deep in the changes and modifications, and I was just never going to get it. Then, finally, it worked. I had the same bot connected to two Workspaces, each separately running bots but on the same server!

My bot could now scale. Done right? Ha! Hahahahahaha... Nope!

Then came the absolute nightmare that is front-end development. I needed a payment plan. I needed user accounts and authentication...

Around the same time, a user on Reddit posted their front-end project open source on Github, something like ""Find Your Co-Founder"" for startups, a sort of networking site, but I liked the look of it, so I started with that. I attempted to search it back down to the link here but at this point in time I couldn't track it back down.

Then, to handle the users and payments system, I followed just the bits from Sonny Sangha's (Zero to Fullstack Hero) [Netflix 2.0 build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW5roUF2RLg) which handles user accounts and subscriptions. Coincidentally, at the end of that, I had a cloud DB setup, which was connected to my front-end (Cloud Functions were an entire 2 12-hour days to get setup) but when a user made a purchase, somehow that had to be communicated to my bot.

So using what I had just learned, I did the same thing that I learned when I watched the Matt Wolfe video, describe what I wanted to do now to GPT, provided the relevant code, and got to work. I struggled for days on this, until finally, GPT suggested that I set up a real-time connection between my bot and the cloud database. I did not know that was a thing, I did not know if it was a hallucination, but I said let's go for it. And it was real, and it worked. And it actually worked better than I thought it would, solved many problems I was thinking through.

If I could compare the work on the bot and the work on the front end, the front end was roughly 4x the work. I definitely did not expect to learn that. I also never expected in my life that I would be a full-stack developer, but here we are.

So this brings us to mid-June. I haven't mentioned the PDF knowledgebase but of course, the Slack bot can handle PDF uploads so each channel can have its own knowledgebase. The final piece of the puzzle at this time was handling the billing. I was afraid to get started because I was foreseeing another 2x work to build an entire invoicing, metrics, API token counting system that I could then somehow get to work with Stripe... Very complicated, learning what I could, and not willing to get started until I could conceptually understand all that I needed to do.

Then, the company asks me to help develop training content and go deliver training to Strategic Partners at one of our HQs. On a Wednesday they say I am to build 4 labs by Tuesday. From Friday to Sunday, I had to put an additional 40 hours of work in, and my Slack project was paused, but by Sunday afternoon I had, with the help of GPT, created a 240-page guide, consisting of 4 labs. Unfathomable to think about, 6 days and 240 pages of technical lab guides with step-by-step screenshots, but here we are.

Then I had the crazy idea to suggest using my Slack bot in the training! The main issue was my company was not interested in the Slack bot internally, I kept getting no from IT and InfoSec. But for the partner training, we were using our own external Slack environment, and my bot was running on external equipment, and I was ingesting only publically available information for my knowledgebase, and \*\*so no one could say no to this\*\*.

I finally, successfully delivered an AI project in my company. I used it as a case study and placed it on my website.

The manager putting the training together was amazed. I asked him how much would he have paid to have this bot in this training for one week, this particular use case. He said easily, $1,000. And this is just one use case. My bot has unlimited use cases as it is completely customizable for each channel.

And so this brings me to today. I've not mentioned the AI Challenge in the company that multiple people, including VPs, have said they've recognized my name from my submission video that they have watched multiple times, so I think I have a good shot at winning that competition, which comes with a nice cash prize.

I've also currently got an open third party vendor assessment with my company, since the team that does the partner training wants to start using the bot in all of their trainings.

I'm also ready to start sharing the project. So that's what brings me here. I believe that in the near future, many people will be able to create what I've been able to create. I also do not think that what I've built, in a year or two, will be all that game-changing. It will just be another app, like the iPhone app store in the beginning. The difference here, is what this tool enables a person to do. Combine that with the ramp-up period, and then you have one hell of a motivation to not just wait around for Slack to put their own bot in, but rather to just get this in the hands of your employees as fast as possible, so they can become full-stack developers in their own way.

But also, it was back in May that Slack announced this super strategic partnership with Salesforce to create their EinsteinGPT, the Slack bot that is capable of answering all of your companies questions on your company data. I was afraid to try to compete with them, how could I compete with Slack proper? Well, I just thought of my own circumstance. I work for a company that uses both Slack and Salesforce, but my job description does not require me to need access to anything in the Salesforce database, and so I do not have a Salesforce account or license. Would I get access to EinsteinGPT? What about companies that use Slack but not Salesforce, do they have to purchase Salesforce to access EinsteinGPT? I realized that there was still a market for me, and so I did not let this deter me.

I skipped much, including how I resolved my billing issue, but this post is long enough. The final piece of the puzzle was what if a very large company wanted to use my product, how could I handle that? I just took a play from the Facebook playbook, for Llama 2 they made it so that companies of a certain size can't use Llama 2, so a big fat no to their competition. All I need to do is update my terms of service accordingly, and I can launch! So here we are, I offer this to any small-medium sized business, that does not have the capability or the patience to develop their own GPT-Slack bot. My promise to you is to constantly develop the bot and improve its functionality. I will bring open-source functionality to my bot faster than any large organization could.

I'm still fighting the good fight internally to use the tool. I'm making too much sense and I'm getting closer and closer with each conversation. One day, the right person will say yes. And everyone at my company will be better for it.

158rval,1,2023-07-24,Advice on Written Assignments & APA Formatting,u/Frankietron,UoPeople,https://www.reddit.com/r/UoPeople/comments/158rval/advice_on_written_assignments_apa_formatting/,"Going into UoPeople you should expect a lot of written assignments and should know how to properly write an essay. I took the English class on Sophia which goes over essay writing, and I found it to be very helpful in preparing me for the written assignments at UoPeople. Note-taking and reading strategies you learn in UNIV 1001 are also very helpful.   


I recommend going over the reading material with the questions you'll be answering in the written assignments in front of you and taking notes of important details in the reading that relate to them. When taking notes, make sure you include the source you used for reference for the facts that you want to include in your writing so you can use in-text citations and list it on your References page. I like to make mind maps for my notes using an app called SimpleMind Pro. They have it on PC and in app form on Android and iPhone.  


You can even use ChatGPT to help make your notes. You can do this by having ChatGPT list the main points and details from each reading assignment, sometimes doing it in parts depending on how long the readings are. Don't use this as a replacement for actually reading the material because you may note some details you want to include to support your answers to the written assignment questions that ChatGPT didn't list in its outline while reading through the material yourself. Do not have ChatGPT write your essay for you because it doesn't know how to properly cite sources and sounds very unnatural. Instead, use it as a tool to help you consolidate the information and then choose which details you want to include to support the argument of your paper, paraphrasing them in your own words and including in-text citations with the sources where the paraphrased information was retrieved.   


I've noticed a lot of people include their sources on the References page but then don't actually use any in-text citations, or only use 1 or 2 even though they're using information they learned from the reading and paraphrasing it throughout their paper. A lot of people also don't include a Title page even though the rubric says to include a Title page. Google how to create a Title page in APA formatting. There are also word document templates that can be found online that are properly formatted for APA standards and they include a title page template. There are also youtube videos on how to make an APA format title page. A title page should be centered and formatted like this:  


# Paper Title

&#x200B;

  
Anonymous / Name Redacted / (or just don't put a name)

University of The People

Course Name

Instructor Name

Due Date  


Keep in mind that the structure of an essay consists of several paragraphs, the first line of each is indented. You start with an introductory paragraph with a thesis statement about what the paper is trying to prove and sentences that outline topics you'll be covering in your paper. Google example thesis statements if you are struggling with how to write one. Follow up the intro paragraph with body paragraphs that provide evidence and supporting details, citing information you got from the reading. Then include a conclusion paragraph, usually restating your thesis statement or tying back to it in some way and wrapping up your paper. I try to include a body paragraph for each question, sometimes multiple if it's a very detailed question.  


Include your references on a separate page. List your references in alphabetical order. If you need help with citing sources in APA format you can use sites like [citationmachine.net](https://citationmachine.net) to help. Sources are usually listed in our learning guide in APA format except they sometimes use bold hyperlinks in the title of the source instead of adding the URL at the end and italicizing the title. If that's the case you can right click and copy the url from the hyperlink, add it to the end of the reference, and right click and remove the hyperlink from the title and also remove the bold formatting of the title and italicize it. If a source takes up multiple lines, it should use a Hanging Indent. A hanging indent is when you don't indent the first line but indent every line after it. Google how to do a hanging indent on Word, it's actually really easy.   


Make sure your papers are in Times New Roman font and 12 pt font size. They should also be double-spaced with 1 inch margins. I recommend running your paper through grammarly to check for grammar issues, even if you can only do the free version it can still be helpful. I also recommend running papers through a couple plagiarism checkers like duplichecker and [plagiarismdetector.net](https://plagiarismdetector.net) and if anything gets flagged as plagiarism, reword it.  


We're almost done with week 6 and one of my instructors is having to inform students that they should know how to write an essay so hopefully this is helpful. I've noticed that many of the written assignments were just copy/pasting the question and then putting bullet points instead of writing an essay and the instructor pointed that out too and said they were going to stop being lenient when grading these. Some of these papers, when you highlight the portion that actually answers the question and not the copy/pasted portion, it only adds up to like 220 words and doesn't even completely fill one page. The Rubric for written assignments usually says you need to do 3 pages, not inclusive of the title and reference pages for a 10/10. When double-spaced it usually takes about 250 words for 1 page so written assignments should probably be at least 750 words.",active,12
159yod1,1,2023-07-26,GPT is my English teacher,u/Astraea_65,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/159yod1/gpt_is_my_english_teacher/,"I know this may sound a bit awkward, but I just want to thank all the developers behind ChatGPT because GPT is helping me to learn English. I have been learning English with GPT for a few months now, and I feel like I have learnt a lot during these few months than the last couple of years.
       I learn English by myself because it's really expensive to have a good English teacher where I live, especially if you want to get some lessons by a native English speaking teacher you gotta sell one of your kidneys. So, I have been solely relying on YouTube, Twitter and Reddit. If I'm being honest, I've learnt a lot from them particularly, the way native speakers pronounce words, the way they use words, phrases, structures and all that. However, the void of not having a mentor was always there because there was nobody to get advice or correct my mistakes until I found out about GPT.
        GPT is not perfect by any means. There were some places that I struggled to get the answers I wanted. Perhaps, it's because of my fault for not conveying things I want effectively. I've seen some people speculate that teachers can be replaced by AI within a few years, but I do not think a good teacher can ever be replaced by an AI what so ever. Whereas, I believe, this would give more freedom both for the teacher and the student because a teacher cannot be presented all the time. On top of everything, I believe this service may help a lot of students that cannot spent lots of money to learn a language or any other thing that they are looking for. 
        And hey! I always wanted to talk with a native speaker, but I know it's never going to happen... maybe someday, who knows. This thing is really great so far though. It doesn't sound like a real human being; however, end of the day I think it can be a good study buddy. 
        I know my rant sounds like a break though ad on Spotify. I still don't have a good sense of English, maybe that's why the way it sounds like that, and I'm sorry if I have made any grammar mistake or say something bad. And thank you if you read it this far and thanks for the developers for making GPT.",active,2
