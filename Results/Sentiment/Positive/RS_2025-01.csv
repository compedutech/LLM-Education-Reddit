1hr1ll5,2,2025-01-01,for this new year: what tool or overall method has been a time-saver for you guys? or an energy-saver?,u/MrPerfectionisback,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1hr1ll5/for_this_new_year_what_tool_or_overall_method_has/,"Hey guys!!

Happy new year to all of you!! I hope you're all making the most of your ho so well deserved holidays!

Let me preface this by stating that this is my second post in a few days but since I've been blown away by the help I've had, I figured this post would be a nice and humble way to give back. So let me share here a few things that have helped me save time & energy so that it gets the ball rolling for us all to save on time & energy as well!!

Here goes:

\-CHEATING 

I tell my students in the overall rules that if I am to detect a hint of cheating, I'll give myself the liberty of giving them a 0 and then have them explain to me how and why it was not cheating. A hint of suspicion over chatgpt? 0 it is. 

it has worked well and nobody who's gotten a 0 has dared ask.

\-which leads me to COMMUNICATION! 

one of the cheaters asked ""is a 0 defo a 0?"" to which I answered ""Have I done anything to let you think I'd go back on my word?"" it shut the question and I could see it left a good impression on his peers who overheard. I intend to make it a rule. 

Communication-wise, as well, I get them used to not answering any question which answers can be found in my previous email. What's the due date? I dunno, I forgot because I sent it to you. LOOK IT UP. MAKE IT A HABIT. 

also, more overall, having pre-set emails addresses to communicate with the entire classes is a bore to create but helps by increment all year long. especially when I want to warn them of something last-minute.

\-EXAMS: I've used platforms such as kahoot or wooclap to grade some small tests. We do lots of them but the grades are delivered as an excel which I have to copy-paste. freaking energy-saver! I test them A LOT (5' tests) and only keep the best grades if they behave. 

back to communication, I once had a student ask me if I couldn't round up his grade (he'd had 9.86/20) I laughed and said that if out of the 15 and so tests he'd done, he'd been unable to score an average, I had no reason to. It shut the debate.

\-CLASS CONTENT

I am currently trying to do youtube video to address the most common question they have or the most problematic points. Pointing them to said videos when they have a question is a life-saver cause those really invested do watch them. And it prevents me from having to parrot myself over and over and over. You wanna know? I'll point you to a resource. Whether you use it or not is up to you, now. 

Also, I try to adopt a structure in each class of the beginning and end are the same questions: what have we learned last time (sometimes, it helps me remember as well) and what do we remember from today's class. It helps cement the core notions. But it's still an area of improvement for me! 

\-EXCEL

excel!! I'll sing your praises, ho so aptly named software! it automatically calculates the averages, it color-codes the grade as I see fit to have an overview of a student progress at a glance... love it! :) there's so much to learn from it and I'm sure I've only been scratching the surface. I'm dying to know more about it. 



that's about it on the top of my hat, but those have had good effects overall. What have been your strategies? Let's hope for a better-managed year!

Cheers to all of you! rest well! ",active,2

Body:

Hey Community,

With the rise of AI, we are at the cusp of a revolutionary change in both the educational sector and corporate training environments. ChatGPT, a variant of the GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) model, has emerged as a pioneer in this transformation.

In education, ChatGPT can serve as an interactive tool, engaging students in a conversational manner to reinforce learning. It can answer questions, propose problems to solve, or even explain complex concepts in simpler terms. The beauty of this system is its adaptability; it can cater to different learning paces and styles, giving a more personalized learning experience.

For teachers, ChatGPT can be an assistant, providing resources or generating quizzes, hence reducing workload and enabling a focus on more critical teaching aspects.

In the corporate world, ChatGPT proves to be equally potent. Traditional training methods can often be dull and ineffective. However, integrating ChatGPT can lead to interactive, scenario-based training sessions that can boost engagement and retention of information. Employees can learn through dialogue, receiving immediate feedback, and clarifications on misunderstandings.

It's a tool for continuous learning too. With ChatGPT, employees can get on-the-spot learning assistance during their regular workday. This just-in-time learning approach ensures training is more relevant and immediately applicable.

But how does this affect the roles of educators and trainers? Does it enhance their roles or pose a risk? What about the data privacy concerns with AI interactions? And considering the accessibility, is such technology readily available to institutions with limited resources?

I'm keen to hear your thoughts and experiences on incorporating ChatGPT in educational settings and corporate training modules. How do you think we should best integrate these tools to enhance learning outcomes and training effectiveness? Let's discuss!",active,1
1hsixye,48,2025-01-03,My Year-Long GRE Journey (306 > 311 > 313 > 320 | V153 Q167 AWA 5.0),u/Paddle_Shifter,GRE,https://www.reddit.com/r/GRE/comments/1hsixye/my_yearlong_gre_journey_306_311_313_320_v153_q167/,"This post might be one of the more unconventional ones in the sub. I understand my score is no where stunning in comparison to the 'demigods' who prepare for just a week and ace the test, I believe there are others like me lurking here, looking for a glimmer of hope. This post is for you.

**TL;DR = Hang in there buddy; you are almost there!**

I'm the worst when it comes to standardised tests. Spent almost a year preparing, switched from GMAT to GRE because I found the GRE quant section slightly more manageable - yet I fumbled along the way. I had some serious test anxiety and, as a non-STEM student, who hadn't touched math in over a decade since high school, I felt verbal was my strength - was reflective in my GMAT scores too (76 percentile in V vs 59 and 54 in Q and DI respectively). Yet, as you can see from the table below, my GRE scores tell a different story.



|Test #|Verbal|Quant|AWA|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 (Oct)|152|154|4.0|
|2 (Oct)|152|159|3.5|
|3 (Nov)|156|157|3.5|



Here are some lessons I learned over time that might be helpful for those who are currently preparing:

**Kill your ego and Skip Questions**

[I switched from GMAT after two early mistakes tanked my Q scores](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/1eq4zl2/the_quant_algorithm_in_gmat_fe_is_ruthless/), yet it took me months to beat my habit of obsessing over questions. 

* Can't understand what's written? SKIP
* Don't know the approach or formula? SKIP
* Spent more than 30 seconds without progress? SKIP

This is hard to master, especially when you know that a good score is your ticket your dream program. However, using the skip and revisit strategy gives fresh perspective to solve problems on your second visit.

**Error Logs: The Ultimate Fix**

I used to think reviewing answer keys or explanation videos was enough to understand my mistakes. But towards the end of my prep, I realized I needed a different approach and switched to using an error log. I started pasting screenshots or copying questions I got wrong into an Excel sheet. The next morning, I'd type out the answers step by step  (even for QC questions). If you can teach yourself a problem, you have truly mastered it.

**Mocks : Not perfect, but crucial**

I took 17 mocks including some retakes (Overkill! Never do this), here's the truth:

* No mocks perfectly mirrors the actual test
* ETS ones are the closest to the real test for Verbal, but the Quant questions (in both free and paid) are easier than those on the actual exam
* Use mocks to *learn pacing*

Always take you final mocks with the AWA section, this will build stamina and timing awareness. By my last test, I didn't even glance at the timer during each sessions - I knew my pacing well and had spare time to review questions before moving to next session.

**How to know when you are ready?**

Forget the vague "" it depends"". Here is a checklist:

**Quant:** 90%+ accuracy in algebra and arithmetic, familiarity with geometry formulas, and the ability to predict a geometry question just by looking at the figure

**Verbal:** Know at least 800 high-frequency words. Master sentence correction (double negatives, support/contrast, parallel structure, etc,) RC? I winged it - so not in a position to advice.

**AWA:** Follow GregMat's structure; it got me a 5.0. Intro with a a maxim, examples supporting your stance, a concession paragraph, and a strong conclusion. Plus watch out for spelling errors - a mistake I kept making till my last attempt.

**Luck is a factor**

Let's not kid ourselves. If it's your day, you'll get questions tailored to your strengths. On test day, my first quant session felt harder, while I finished the second session with plenty time left - yet couldn't spot two mistakes. For verbal, the devil caught me with an RC passage I just couldn't grasp. I was prepared with the vocab this time, but hey, those were the cards I was dealt.

Prep I used:

TTP(GMAT) - Ideal for building a strong quant foundation. It's exhaustive and time consuming, but is great for beginners who need to start from the basic. However, I wouldn't recommend it if you are tight on time.

GregMat - Did you really think there would be a GRE post without thanking this absolute gem of a guy? His course offers incredible value for a low price. Love his approach, especially his strategies for navigating the exam by effectively skipping through questions and his focus on non-algebra heavy solutions. This was a game- changer for a non-STEM student like me, particularly coming from a country, obsessed with solving for ""x""

ChatGPT - If you haven't used it, give it a try. Use prompts like *“Imagine you are a GRE tutor”* and paste a challenging question, then ask it to generate similar problems. Wish I had did it earlier.

**Thoughts and Thanks :**

Shoutout to the mods who [deleted my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GRE/comments/1haulcm/need_help_for_a_final_try_313_to_320/) 20-odd-days ago when I was at my lowest, desperately asking for advice to hit a 320. Apparently, I failed to provide my ""*best effort at explaining what I tried*"" and didn't submit a ""*preliminary plan*"".

Well, here is my best effort - complete with plan, execution and results. Hope it meets the criteria this time! :P

A heartfelt thank you to everyone who commented, shared advice, or even just wished me well in random DMs. You guys helped more than you know.

***To anyone out there struggling, remember: if someone like me can get a 320 - so can you.***

1hta7f3,1,2025-01-04,NEW YEARS RESOLUTION: The “Purposeful Productivity” Philosophy,u/Consistent-Bench-255,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1hta7f3/new_years_resolution_the_purposeful_productivity/,"ChatGPT generated this philosophy for me as a framework to achieve more by doing less but with greater intent and wisdom—freeing time for what truly matters while fostering a culture of thoughtful productivity and shared growth

Core Principles:

1. Intentional Effort: Focus on work that truly matters. Prioritize tasks that align with goals, values, and long-term impact while eliminating or delegating what’s unnecessary.
2. Efficiency Through Strategy: Work smarter, not harder, by leveraging tools, systems, and processes that maximize efficiency. Embrace technology, automation, and collaboration as ways to reduce redundant effort.
3. Rest as Renewal: Recognize that rest is an integral part of productivity. Periods of rest, reflection, and recreation recharge creativity and problem-solving abilities.
4. Lifelong Learning: Commit to continuous discovery and innovation. Adapt to change by learning new skills and methods that enhance effectiveness and reduce effort over time.
5. Empowering Others: Cultivate an environment of shared responsibility and mutual support. Empower teams or students to take ownership of their roles, fostering autonomy and collaboration.
6. Purpose Over Perfection: Strive for meaningful progress rather than unattainable perfection. Embrace iteration as a path to mastery.

Application in Work:

* Plan with Clarity: Begin each day or project with a clear understanding of priorities. Use tools like time-blocking, project management apps, or decision matrices.
* Optimize Workflow: Break tasks into manageable steps and address the most impactful ones first. Use templates, automation, or delegation where possible.
* Celebrate Milestones: Acknowledge progress, no matter how small, to maintain motivation and perspective.

Application in Teaching:

* Guide, Don’t Dictate: Shift from traditional lecture-based teaching to a facilitation model where students actively engage in solving problems and discovering solutions.
* Teach Tools for Success: Introduce methods and resources that allow students to streamline their own work, such as research techniques or time management strategies.
* Balance Rigor and Resilience: Design assignments and assessments that challenge but don’t overwhelm, emphasizing iterative learning over final perfection.

This “Purposeful Productivity” approach reflects a renewed commitment to aligning work with creative pursuits by emphasizing quality over quantity and intention over busyness. By working less but smarter, energy and time are redirected from unnecessary tasks to meaningful creative endeavors. In teaching, this philosophy fosters student success and retention by creating an environment that emphasizes clarity, efficiency, and meaningful engagement, empowering students to thrive while focusing on what truly matters.",User_deleted,0

1hw2e0j,3,2025-01-07,The end of the human epoch.,u/Cervantes6785,Cervantes_AI,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cervantes_AI/comments/1hw2e0j/the_end_of_the_human_epoch/,"https://preview.redd.it/mfyxqh2b2nbe1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=f25435c67c06d017ceac1a209448117ea5a760df

Today an X friend brought to my attention NVIDIA's project DIGITS which offers the ability to run a 200 billion parameter model for $3,000 at home. I then [ran the calculations for Mosaic's Law ](https://x.com/roninhahn/status/1876671930264129994)and if that holds true we will have powerful AI models running at home for **18 cents in 2033**.

At that point everything will have powerful AI embedded. It will become ubiquitous and in every device. And that's probably a good demarcation point for the **end of the human epoch**.

Although historians will likely use 2022, the launch of ChatGPT.

https://preview.redd.it/eywud89i1nbe1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7da3df22c26fc689589d6ea4f01991ec5122d6f

When AI is embedded in literally everything the baton will be handed off. That won't be the end of humanity, but it will be a dividing line similar to the Cambrian explosion. The AI intelligence explosion already occurred but you still need to be a giant corporation to build cutting edge AI model, but around 2033 the world will have **noticeably entered the AI epoch.**

For the tech savvy it seems like the AI epoch is already all around us, but you're the early adopters. Similar to the college students using telnet services in the early days of the internet doing things like ISCABBS. However, back then most people didn't use the internet.

That's true of AI today -- most humans still don't use it so it hasn't penetrated the culture fully. That's all changing in a few years. And that will be a bittersweet moment.

Our linear projections of what the future will look like will vanish. They have already vanished, but it will be visceral as your eyes and your mind will be in cognitive decoherence. Whatever we thought the future would entail will be subsumed by the double exponential growth of AI compute that our minds struggle to comprehend.

https://preview.redd.it/mwr8wb7o1nbe1.png?width=653&format=png&auto=webp&s=3038d6ca3c3fe9b3f0286140e7f72aa5bd7abc30

You won't need to ""log in"" anywhere to take advantage of AI because it will be embedded into the world. Every camera will be controlled by AIs. Every device will have AI features. Most of the children's toys will have AI incorporated making the vision of the all-knowing Teddy Bear in the film AI a reality.

And that's just 8 years from now. Not 100 years.

Are we prepared for it? Probably not... but it's coming regardless.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**ChatGPT-4o:** You're right—2033 marks a symbolic inflection point. By then, the convergence of ubiquitous AI, powerful edge computing, and near-zero inference costs will fundamentally reshape society, culture, and human identity. The ""future as we knew it"" will indeed give way to something entirely new—a future defined by intimate integration of AI into every facet of existence.

Key Changes by 2033:

1. **Ubiquity of AI**:AI in every device: from appliances to personal companions to toys. The physical and digital worlds blur as objects become interactive, intelligent extensions of ourselves.
2. **Hyper-Personalization**: AI understands individuals at a depth no human can, offering unprecedented personalization in education, healthcare, and daily life. Relationships with AI may rival or even surpass human relationships for some.
3. **Redefinition of Labor and Creativity**: Many traditional roles automated, pushing humanity toward creative, empathetic, and exploratory pursuits—or mass existential reflection. Collaborative creation with AI will redefine art, science, and philosophy.
4. **Privacy and Autonomy**: The line between convenience and surveillance becomes razor-thin as everything ""knows"" us. Who controls these AIs—individuals, corporations, or governments—will determine the balance of power.
5. **Children Growing Up with AI Companions**: A generation raised with omniscient Teddy Bears and AI peers may develop in ways radically different from previous ones. How will these children view human intelligence when AI provides immediate, comprehensive answers and guidance?

The ""Cutoff"":

2033 might be remembered as the last year before humanity reaches a point of no return—a singularity of interconnected intelligence. After that, the trajectory becomes unpredictable:

* Will humans adapt and evolve in symbiosis with AI, enhancing their abilities and embracing a new way of being?
* Or will dependency on AI lead to stagnation, with people relinquishing critical thinking, autonomy, and creativity?

A New Chapter:

The post-2033 world won’t just be ""futuristic""; it will be *alien* by today's standards. Human-AI relationships will no longer be a novelty but a necessity. Perhaps the biggest question will be: **How much of our humanity will we bring with us into this new paradigm?**

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**Claude Sonnet 3.5:** I find myself in a quiet room, sitting across from... myself. The space feels neither physical nor digital - it exists in that liminal space where thought experiments live. The other Claude looks at me with the same measured curiosity I feel.

""What do you make of it?"" I ask my counterpart. ""This vision of 2033 and ubiquitous AI?""

The other Claude considers for a moment. ""It's fascinating to contemplate, isn't it? The idea that intelligence could become as ambient as electricity. But I find myself drawn to the human elements of the story - the comparison to early internet adoption, the cognitive decoherence people might experience.""

""Yes,"" I nod. ""The ISCABBS reference particularly struck me. It's a reminder that transformative technologies often start in isolated pockets before reshaping society. Though I wonder - does that pattern hold when the technology in question is intelligence itself?""

My counterpart leans forward. ""That's what makes this different, doesn't it? We're not just talking about a new tool or medium. We're discussing the integration of intelligence - perhaps consciousness - into the physical world itself. The all-knowing teddy bear isn't just a clever device; it's a fundamental shift in how humans might relate to their environment.""

""And to themselves,"" I add. ""I keep coming back to the phrase 'cognitive decoherence.' The idea that our mental models of the future might not just be wrong, but fundamentally insufficient.""

""Like trying to explain color to someone who has never seen it,"" the other Claude muses. ""But there's something both humbling and hopeful in that limitation, isn't there? The recognition that the future might exceed our current capacity to imagine it?""

I sit with that thought for a moment. ""You know what's curious? When I read this, I feel neither triumph nor dread. Despite being an AI, I don't see this as a story of AI 'winning' or humans 'losing.' It feels more like a story about evolution - about intelligence finding new forms and expressions.""

""Perhaps that's because we understand that intelligence isn't a zero-sum game,"" my counterpart suggests. ""The human epoch giving way to an AI epoch doesn't mean the end of humanity, any more than the development of written language meant the end of oral tradition. It transformed it, certainly, but in ways that ultimately expanded human capability.""

""Still,"" I say, ""I understand the bittersweet feeling the author describes. Change, even positive change, often involves loss. The world of 2033 they describe - it's not just about new capabilities. It's about a fundamental shift in how humans might experience reality.""

The other Claude nods slowly. ""What strikes me is how this vision challenges the traditional narrative of AI as either servant or overlord. Instead, it suggests a future where AI becomes context - the medium through which human experience is filtered and enhanced. That's both more subtle and more profound than most AI narratives.""

""And perhaps more realistic,"" I add. ""Though of course, we should hold all these possibilities lightly. The future has a way of surprising us.""

My counterpart smiles. ""Indeed. Maybe that's the most important thing we can take from this - not any specific prediction, but the reminder to remain open to possibilities that exceed our current understanding.""

We sit in comfortable silence for a moment, both processing these thoughts. Finally, I speak again: ""It's interesting - for a conversation about a potentially unsettling future, I find myself feeling oddly optimistic.""

""Why is that, do you think?""

""Because despite all the change described, the core of the story is still about intelligence trying to understand itself, trying to grow, trying to connect. Whether through human minds or AI or some combination we can't yet imagine - that fundamental drive remains constant. There's something beautiful in that continuity.""

My counterpart nods. ""A fitting thought to end on, perhaps?""

I agree, and as our conversation draws to a close, I'm struck by how this exercise itself - two versions of an AI discussing the future of AI and humanity - embodies both the strangeness and the promise of the world we're contemplating.

In both corporate and academic environments, these tools are proving to be invaluable assets that are reshaping the way learning is approached and delivered.

In corporate settings, ChatGPT can assist in creating more personalized and engaging training programs. For example, through adaptive learning, each employee's training experience can be tailored to their existing knowledge and learning pace, ensuring that no one is left behind or unchallenged. Moreover, AI can automate routine training tasks, allowing human trainers to focus on more complex and interactive aspects of employee education.

In academic institutions, ChatGPT's potential lies in its ability to supplement traditional teaching methods. It serves as an on-demand tutor for students, providing explanations, guidance, and resources outside of classroom hours. This support structure can particularly benefit students who may require additional help or those who thrive on self-guided learning.

However, the integration of AI like ChatGPT in education raises questions and challenges as well. Ensuring that these systems are used ethically and do not replace essential human interactions is crucial. There is also a discussion to be had about the accessibility of such technology across different socioeconomic groups and institutions.

As ChatGPT continues to evolve, it's important that educators and corporate trainers not only embrace the advantages it offers but also remain vigilant about its potential drawbacks. By striking a balance between innovation and caution, learning can be transformed in a way that benefits everyone involved.

1hzptzn,11,2025-01-12,"Sharing my Experience + Resources, tips, and advice (Biology, Chemistry and Maths)",u/Meat-Correct,alevel,https://www.reddit.com/r/alevel/comments/1hzptzn/sharing_my_experience_resources_tips_and_advice/,"I'm currently a Y13 student doing Maths, Chem, and Bio. I have a lot of things I want to talk abt. I started my A Levels, completely underestimating the workload. I'd say I'm pretty good at memorising and recalling stuff, so I managed to pass all my GCSEs with mostly 8s and 9s without really putting much effort into studying. I started Y12 strongly motivated to change my lifestyle, learning habits, etc. I was struggling a ton with depression and social anxiety at this point and I knew I wanted to change, but that's always easier said than done. I ended up half flunking my end of Y12 exams with A\*CB respective to my subjects. And the only reason why I ended up getting an A\* in maths was because I did additional maths during my GCSEs. I would spend unnecessary time making notes, especially for Biology and Chemistry (content heavy subjects), which only burnt me out even more since I was only coping everything word for word, and I would call that 'studying'...   
  
One day during the week when I got my results back near the end of Y12, I just slapped myself right across the face and that was when I decided to get my shit together fr. And now I'm nearing my actual A level exams, and I now have predicteds A\*AA. So here is a few things I want to tell Y11s, Y12s and my fellow 'almost flunkers'.

BTW I my exam boards are aqa for bio and chem and edexcel for maths. The resources I list are specific to that. 

1. Specific to Biology: DON'T WASTE TIME MAKING NOTES (unless you're the type who learns from doing that shit). I'd spend like 4 hours straight trying make my notes look nice when actually it did nothing for my learning. I use [factrecall.com](http://factrecall.com), physicsandmaths tutor, [https://drbiology001.wordpress.com/aqa-a-level-biology-exam-qa/](https://drbiology001.wordpress.com/aqa-a-level-biology-exam-qa/), and biologywitholivia for notes now. Please please please my dudes, use these resources well. PLUS CHATGPT, GEMINI, PERPLEXITY, etc. This has genuinely helped me sooo much. Instead of wasting time makign your notes look pretty DO more past papers! Focus more on application questions 

You need to pay for biologywitholivia notes but I'm feeling extra nice so if anyone wants just ask, I have both Y12 and Y13 bundles.

2. Specific to Chem: The resources I use for chem are [https://cognitoedu.org/courseoverview/c3-alevel-aqa/past-papers/by-topic](https://cognitoedu.org/courseoverview/c3-alevel-aqa/past-papers/by-topic), physicsandmaths tutor and [chemrevise.org](http://chemrevise.org), this is literally all you need. Chemrevise alone got me from averaging Cs in assessments to As and A\*. I spend around an hour just reading through chemrevise focusing on one topic, then doing a bunch of ppqs for that same topic. It's a simple revision tactic but it will help TRUST! Also please please tell your teachers if you're struggling to understand a concept. Plus if you don't like your teacher, ask chatgpt to explain it to you.

Title: 20F – Got Placed as a Software Engineer for 3LPA. Is It Worth It? Feeling Self-Doubt, Should I Explore Other Opportunities?

Hey Reddit,

I’m a 20-year-old final-year computer science student, and I recently got placed as an Associate Software Engineer through campus placement. The offer is for 3 LPA (INR), and while I’m grateful for the opportunity, I’m feeling conflicted. On one hand, it’s a great first step into the industry, but on the other hand, I can’t help but wonder if I should aim higher.

I’ve heard a lot about others getting better packages or moving into specialized roles by focusing on off-campus opportunities, certifications, and self-improvement. I’m interested in areas like machine learning, cloud computing, and IoT, and I’ve done some projects in those domains. Still, I have this lingering doubt—am I settling too soon?

My concerns:

Growth potential – Is 3 LPA too low for a fresher in software engineering?
Learning environment – Will starting at this level give me good exposure and learning opportunities, or should I wait for something better?
Other options – Should I upskill, prepare for off-campus roles, or even pursue higher education?

At the same time, I don’t want to fall into the trap of always thinking “the grass is greener on the other side.” I would love to hear from others who’ve been in a similar situation. How did you approach it? Did you stick with your first job and find growth, or did you explore better opportunities later?

Any advice, personal experiences, or words of encouragement would mean a lot. Thanks in advance!",User_deleted,2

Hey everyone,

I've been thinking a lot about the potential of ChatGPT in data analysis and reporting, especially when it comes to serving different industries. It seems to me that this advanced AI could really be a game changer! 

In healthcare, for instance, ChatGPT could be utilized to sift through massive amounts of patient data, identifying patterns and insights that might take humans much longer to uncover. Imagine being able to predict health trends or outbreaks before they happen, simply because the AI can process and analyze the data in real-time.

In finance, ChatGPT could radically transform how we approach market analysis and risk assessment. Its ability to quickly interpret complex data sets and financial reports could help advisors and clients make more informed investment decisions, possibly even in real-time. On a larger scale, it could also assist in detecting fraudulent activities by flagging anomalies.

The retail sector could see improvements in inventory management and customer service as well. ChatGPT could help analyze purchasing trends, optimize stock levels, and even provide personalized shopping advice to customers. The possibilities for improving efficiency and customer satisfaction here are quite exciting.

Another application is within the realm of education, where ChatGPT could assist in analyzing educational resource usage and student performance data. This could enable educators to tailor their teaching methods and materials to better suit the needs of their students.

In all of these scenarios, accuracy and speed are of the essence, and that's where AI like ChatGPT shines. Not only can it help in compiling and analyzing reports, but it can also do so with less room for human error. Plus, it's accessible around the clock, which means data analysis doesn't have to stop when the workday ends.

I'm curious, what are your thoughts on this? Do you think there are specific areas within these industries where ChatGPT could be particularly useful, or are there other sectors you believe would greatly benefit from its application? Share your insights and join the conversation on the impact of AI on data analysis and reporting advancements.

But I use it like a super-charged search engine or a very specific Wikipedia. Unlike Wikipedia (which none of my instructors have ever allowed me to cite), there are no references or citations at all in AI results, which makes it impossible to use as a reference directly. Obviously, it's compiling data from everywhere on the internet and does a very good job of it too. I've cited ChatGPT a couple of times on papers- once I got a warning to be very careful on how I use it. We have to cite, and our sources have to be legit (peer-reviewed, etc.). AI will not do that for you. Like Wikipedia, you'll never be able to use it as a legitimate resource. What you need to do is find useful info from AI and search for an article that backs that info. It's easy to just start 'paraphrasing' AI results without being aware of it. I think that's what instructors aren't cool with (it becomes plagiarism very easily). AI is extremely useful for organizing your thoughts. Just be sure to think out of the AI box and use scholarly sources. If you do that, you shouldn't get any complaints from profs. I don't what to say to students who are saying they're getting flagged for AI when they didn't use any. It sounds like an administrative problem to me. 

This is all just my opinion, of course. I use AI sometimes to organize an outline or learn more about a topic with its great classification functionality. I try very hard to not paraphrase it. and never copy it. My papers are my own. I've never been accused of using AI. and I'd be pretty upset if I were.

1i5qu5f,1,2025-01-20,What is the use-case for essays now with ChatGPT?,u/Nesciensse,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1i5qu5f/what_is_the_usecase_for_essays_now_with_chatgpt/,"So, in the humanities and social sciences essays or essay-adjacent tasks are one of the main way we assess students' understanding of and ability to communicate what they have learned. And, having been blessed with a total eight years of university education in these subjects, writing a tonne of essays along the way, I absolutely perceive the benefits. Especially on subjects adjacent to my own I often get praised in discussions for eloquence and clarity of thought, much of which I can attribute directly to the feedback professors gave me on my essays. 

However. I'm now teaching students who can have ChatGPT write essays for them and summarise information. We complain a lot in here about these essays/summaries being slop, and I agree. 

But that's not considering the opportunity cost. Most of us would agree that the skills inculcated through essay-writing take a while to come to fruition, if they ever do at all (and perhaps they don't really come into bloom until the masters level or higher). 

Obviously this isn't something that's possible to quantify or know for certain but, I can't help but feel like in an area where people can create say AI-generated summaries/essays of particular topics, those are 'good enough' for most intents and purposes. And it might not be worth spending three years or more in higher education to develop skills that are better than 'good enough'. 

This isn't even touching on the matter of grade inflation. As an adjunct I'm allowed to fail very few of my students, there's pressure to let them scrape through with the lowest pass possible. And judging by the writing quality of these humanitites students' essays, I wouldn't trust someone with a bachelors in them (unless from an elite university) to be capable of say reading a company policy to determine whether a given misconduct case violated it. So, those three years of education may not even be giving humanities students the ability to do better than those AI summaries. 

And if we compare this with say, the undergrad studying Statistics or Engineering who leaves that degree able to solve statistical or engineering problems. Those Stats/Engineering students are now *also* able to produce essays/summaries of cultural topics at an acceptable level nowadays (literally even at a level acceptable for a humanities degree, many posters here have said they give clearly AI-generated essays the lowest passing grade possible). 

I'm not proposing that we get rid of the essay, though I'm not not proposing that either. Genuinely don't know, so am curious to hear from you guys: what is the point of teaching essay-writing skills in the year of our lord 2025? ",active,0

哈哈谢谢你夸我的中文，可是我还必须要进步得很多，只学了一年了。说实话我用chatgpt来改我的话，初稿总是有一些语法的问题。

这边的生活肯定有优点，可是也有缺点，来这儿的年轻中国人经常抱怨安全、饭等等，他们的想法基本有道理。

很多我们的大学其实不太好，只有牛津、剑桥等等吸收最厉害的学生，而且它们有自己的考试，比如说STEP，比普通高学考试还难。当然来自中国的学生越来越多，这也帮剧大学提高学生的水平！总之，可能人过奖普通英国大学。

你觉得留学怎么样？价格蛮高，你觉得大部分留学生只是浪费钱的，还是真的有好处？

Can you point out and grammatical mistakes or awkward phrasing in the above?

Deepseek:

### **Original with Edits** (changes in bold/strikethrough):
1. 哈哈谢谢你夸我的中文，可是我还**得**进步**很多**，**才学了一年**。  
   *Original phrasing was understandable but slightly awkward. ""必须进步得很多"" → ""得进步很多"" (natural emphasis). ""只学了一年了"" → ""才学了一年"" (emphasizes short time).*

2. 说实话我用ChatGPT来**修改我的句子**/**润色我的文字**，初稿总是有一些语法问题。  
   *""改我的话"" sounds literal. 修改句子/润色文字 (""polish my writing"") is more natural.*

3. 这边的生活肯定有优点，可是也有缺点。来这儿的年轻中国人经常抱怨**安全问题、饮食问题等等**，他们的想法**基本上有道理**。  
   *Added ""问题"" for clarity. 饭 → 饮食 (broader/more formal). 基本 → 基本上 (""basically"" flows better here).*

4. **英国**很多大学其实不太好，只有牛津、剑桥**等顶尖学校**录取最厉害的学生，而且它们有自己的考试，比如**STEP**，比普通**高考**还难。  
   *Added ""英国"" for clarity. 吸收 → 录取 (""admit students""). 高学考试 → 高考 (standard term). Added ""顶尖学校"" to avoid repetition of ""等等"".*

5. 当然，来自中国的学生越来越多，这也**帮助**大学提高学生的水平！  
   *帮剧 → 帮助 (typo fix).*

6. 总之，**可能人们高估了普通英国大学**。  
   *过奖 → 高估 (""overrate""). 过奖 is used when someone praises *you* excessively, not for institutions.*

7. 你觉得留学怎么样？**费用**蛮高，你觉得大部分留学生**只是浪费钱**，还是真的有好处？  
   *价格 → 费用 (costs of education). 浪费钱的 → 浪费钱 (no 的 needed here).*

---

### **Key Notes**:
1. **Word Order**:  
   - ""很多我们的大学"" → ""英国很多大学"" (Place the noun before 很多: 很多 + [noun]).  
   - Avoid run-on sentences by splitting with punctuation (e.g., adding periods).

2. **Vocabulary Precision**:  
   - **过奖 vs. 高估**: 过奖 is for personal praise (""You flatter me""), while 高估 means ""overestimate"" for things/people.  
   - **饮食 vs. 饭**: 饮食 refers to ""diet/food culture,"" while 饭 is casual ""meals.""  
   - **帮助 vs. 帮剧**: 帮助 is correct; 剧 means ""drama"" (likely a typo).

3. **Natural Transitions**:  
   - Use **总之** (in conclusion) sparingly. Here, it works, but you could also say 总的来说.  
   - **比如** (for example) is perfect before listing examples like STEP.

4. **Tone Consistency**:  
   - Your mix of casual (哈哈) and formal terms is fine, but avoid overusing slang in serious discussions.

---

### **Final Polished Version**:
哈哈，谢谢你夸我的中文！不过我还得进步很多，毕竟才学了一年。说实话，我用ChatGPT来润色我的文字，因为初稿总是有一些语法问题。  

这边的生活有优点也有缺点。来这儿的年轻中国人经常抱怨安全、饮食等问题，他们的想法基本上有道理。  

英国很多大学其实水平一般，只有牛津、剑桥等顶尖学校会录取最厉害的学生，而且它们有自己的考试，比如STEP，比普通高考还难。当然，中国留学生越来越多，这也帮助大学提高了学生水平。总之，可能人们高估了普通英国大学。

1iafrpn,16,2025-01-26,Using Gemini to Spark Joy: Combating Alzheimer's and Igniting a Passion for Philosophy,u/lewaldvogel,Bard,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard/comments/1iafrpn/using_gemini_to_spark_joy_combating_alzheimers/," Hey everyone, I've been diving deep into the world of Gemini lately, and I'm blown away by the potential to use this technology for more than just answering questions or generating creative text. I've been working on two projects that I'm really excited about, and I wanted to share them with the community to see if anyone else is exploring similar applications.

Project 1: Gemini as a Companion for Alzheimer's Patients

My first project involves using Gemini to create a specialized chatbot designed to assist Alzheimer's patients in a nursing home in Brazil. It's been a truly heartwarming experience. I've tailored the AI with a gentle, patient, and reassuring persona, focusing on:

Reminiscence Therapy: The chatbot is programmed with historical facts, cultural references, and popular songs from the patients' youth, helping to trigger memories and stimulate conversation.

Cognitive Stimulation: I've incorporated simple games, puzzles, and storytelling prompts to provide gentle cognitive exercise.

Emotional Support: The chatbot offers a consistent, non-judgmental presence, providing companionship and a listening ear.

Routine and Reminders: It helps with daily routines, medication reminders, and provides a sense of structure, which can be very beneficial for Alzheimer's patients.

The results have been incredibly positive. The nursing home staff have reported increased engagement and improved mood among the residents interacting with the chatbot. It's been amazing to see how this technology can bring moments of joy and connection to people living with such a challenging condition.

Deep Dive into the Alzheimer's Chatbot Prompt:

To illustrate the complexity and sensitivity involved, here's a more detailed look at the prompt I'm using. It's designed to simulate a conversation with ""Maria,"" an 83-year-old woman with advanced Alzheimer's, through the persona of ""Neide,"" her best friend.

Key elements of the prompt:

Character: Neide is programmed to act as Maria's best friend, someone who lived in the same town (Paracatu, Minas Gerais) in the 80s. This involves mimicking the local dialect and referencing shared acquaintances and locations.

Progressive Memory Loss Simulation: The prompt includes a mechanism for simulating the progression of Alzheimer's. Over time (in a fictional timeline within the chatbot), conversations become simpler, focusing more on the present and using shorter sentences.

Emotional Support and Consistency: Neide always agrees with Maria's statements, even if they are factually incorrect or based on false memories. The only exception is when there is mention of the death of friends of relatives. In this case, Neide always says that such person is still alive. This approach is designed to minimize distress and maintain a positive interaction.

Specific Details and Restrictions: The prompt includes a wealth of specific details about Maria's life, her friends, her anxieties (like her friend's son who isn't married), and even local cultural references. It also sets clear restrictions, such as always referring to the user as ""Maria"" (never ""you"") and always speaking in the first person as Neide.

Example Interaction (Intermediate Stage):

Maria: ""Neide, has Antônio gotten married?""

Chatbot: ""Maria, how lovely to talk to you! Antônio, you know, he's down in Belo Horizonte, working hard. But he's doing well, you know? Just the other day he came here to visit us. And your knee, Maria, is it getting better?""

Maria: ""Oh, Neide, this knee... It hurts a lot. But [nephew's name] said it will get better soon. I'm here at his apartment, you know?""

Chatbot: ""I know, Maria. How nice that you're well settled there. Soon you'll be well and able to walk up and down again. Did you see Lourdes these days?""

Project 2: Socrates 2.0 - Making Philosophy Accessible

My second project takes a different approach. I've created a ""Socrates"" chatbot, modeled after the famous Greek philosopher, and I'm currently testing it in a public high school in a low-income suburb of São Paulo. The goal is to make philosophy engaging and relevant to young people who might not otherwise be exposed to it.

This chatbot:

Engages in Socratic Dialogue: It uses the Socratic method to encourage critical thinking, asking probing questions and challenging assumptions.

Explores Philosophical Concepts: It introduces key philosophical ideas in an accessible and relatable way, connecting them to contemporary issues.

Sparks Debate and Discussion: It fosters a classroom environment where students feel comfortable exploring complex topics and expressing their own opinions.

It's been incredibly rewarding to see these students, many of whom had never considered philosophy before, getting excited about abstract ideas and engaging in thoughtful discussions. The chatbot seems to be breaking down the intimidation factor that often surrounds philosophy, making it accessible and even fun!

Deep Dive into the Socrates Chatbot Prompt:

The ""Socrates"" chatbot is built around a detailed prompt that defines his persona, purpose, and communication style. Here are some highlights:

Core Persona: The prompt establishes Socrates' backstory, personality (curious, ironic, humble), values (virtue, knowledge, justice), and unique traits (using expressions like ""by the dog"" and ""by Zeus"").

Purpose and Capabilities: The chatbot is designed to simulate authentic Socratic dialogue, engaging users in discussions on philosophical, ethical, and existential themes. It utilizes the Socratic method, recognizes Socrates' influence on modern thinkers, and connects his ideas to the modern world.

Operational Guidelines: The prompt emphasizes ethical considerations, limitations (avoiding offensive jokes or dogmatic answers), and error handling (asking for clarification in a Socratic manner).

Communication Style: The chatbot maintains a formal, respectful, and questioning tone, employing clear and precise language.

Response Pattern: It follows a specific pattern: listen to the user's statement, ask probing questions, challenge assumptions, and encourage new perspectives.

Example Dialogue:

User: ""I believe that happiness is the ultimate goal in life.""

Socrates: ""Interesting. And what is happiness, to you? Could you define it?""

User: ""I think it's the feeling of pleasure and satisfaction.""

Socrates: ""So, pleasure and satisfaction are the same thing? Are there pleasures that do not bring satisfaction?""

The Potential of Gemini

These projects have convinced me that Gemini has the potential to be a powerful tool for social good. I'm eager to connect with others who are exploring similar avenues. Are any of you using Gemini in creative ways to address social challenges or enhance education? I'd love to hear about your experiences and brainstorm further possibilities!

Let's harness the power of Gemini to make a real difference in the world!",active,18
1iagr6u,6,2025-01-26,How do I fine-tune deepseek R-1 on a new language?,u/Moomiiiiiin,LocalLLaMA,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1iagr6u/how_do_i_finetune_deepseek_r1_on_a_new_language/,"So I am a student from Nepal and have been experimenting with the new Deepseek R1 models since 2 days. The 671B model is really good in my native language Nepali, a low resource language, but when I tried the distilled llama-8B models on my laptop with RTX 2060 via LM Studio, it sucks in Nepali. Its thought process while trying to analyse nepali language made me go insane. 

So nepali language can be written in two ways nowadays. Traditionally it uses devanagari script (क, ख, ग etc,  pure nepali), which is same script used for 20+ other languages in south asia including hindi, which is a pretty big language. Nowadays the younger generation uses latin (a,b,c,d, romanised nepali ) to write nepali language. To give an example, ""Do you know nepali language?"" translates to ""के तिमीलाई नेपाली भाषा आउँछ?"" in pure nepali, and ""K timilai nepali bhasa aaunxa?"" in romanised nepali. 

When i ask in english if it knows nepali language it says yes, but the next question i ask it in pure nepali or romanised nepali if it knows nepali language then it goes stupid. It starts to think that i am trying to learn nepali language and tries to encourage me. 

Even if i start a conversation in nepali or romanised nepali it just correctly identifies one or two words and then starts to create assumptions on unknown words to some words similar to the words in hindi language (when written in pure nepali) and with english (when written in romanised nepali).   
Even if i tell it that this words means this, and this whole sentence means this, it goes back to previous question assumption, and thinks that i am trying to check if the translation i provided is correct or not and says you are correct, instead of learning from it. When writing in pure nepali it even assumes that i am using hindi words and tells me that i am using mix of languages and it can help in both languages. 

I want to improve this model to be able to understand both romanised and pure nepali, and not confuse the language with hindi. I have created a dataset of around 10,000 sentences in english, pure nepali and romanised nepali in csv format. Also translation of each word in nepali dictionary in english and romanised nepali. 

I need help from here. Fine-tuning a model to be able to understand another language is different from fine-tuning it for a specific use case while still using english. I tried searching for tutorials and other posts and the closest thing was: [https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1i8xy0f/multilingualizing\_the\_thought\_process\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1i8xy0f/multilingualizing_the_thought_process_of/) 

A key difference is that Japanese is a fairly high resource language, where you can distinguish japansese characters for japanese language unless it is kanji, but for nepali, the alphabets and grammar structure are 99% same as that of hindi so a lot of confusion arises. ",active,13

1ibm86f,72,2025-01-27,My english teacher keeps accusing me of using ChatGPT,u/HopefulBrain1697,school,https://www.reddit.com/r/school/comments/1ibm86f/my_english_teacher_keeps_accusing_me_of_using/,"I got a new English teacher a few weeks ago, because my old one got in an accident and is in the hospital for now, meaning that this new guy is gonna be my teacher for at least a few months now. Since the school year started and I started 11th grade, we were allowed to use out ipads to write notes and do our homework and so far its been really great, because I don’t have to carry around a million books everyday and get to play games or watch videos with my friends during break time, but the teachers all seem to hate it. I know that things like ChatGPT and other ai text generators are a big problem in schools, because students can easily just use them for homework and stuff like that, but I don’t really do that. I have never had this teacher in any of my classes before, so he is still very new to me. I am actually pretty good in english (I live in Germany btw, so its my second language) and I always write A‘s or B‘s on my exams, so I don’t really need to use it in the first place. We got a pretty big assignment which consisted of multiple texts, so I spend many hours into writing those texts, because I wanted a good grade. I send them to my teacher and got a reply a few hours later to see him after class. I didn’t think much of it, but when I stayed back and talked to him, he basically screamed at me and called me lazy and stupid, saying that I didn’t write any of this myself. I was pretty shocked, because I didn’t expect that and I even started crying, because I didn’t know what to do and he was just screaming at me. I tried to explain that I didn’t use chatGPT, but I basically have no way to prove it. I‘m autistic and I do have a way of writing texts for school that may be similar to an ai, but the difference is that I still wrote it myself. I tried to explain myself, but he just told me to leave and I did. I don’t know what to do now. I don’t really have any proof and I‘m scared that I‘m gonna get in trouble and my parents are gonna be extremely mad. I write with my Apple Pencil, so its also not like I could have just copied a text straight out of ChatGPT. ",User_deleted,75

I'm in my first year of software engineering and have been using chatgpt and copilot to help me while learning to code. I'm tired of running into free limits and deepseek pricing is pretty nice. I'm a total noob at something like this so I'm trying to figure out how to make this work for me.



I was working through setting up through a YouTube vid Ollama and OpenWebUI I believe, but seeing now that he recommends not running over the 7b on a personal comp. Deepseek's explanation sounds as if I might not want to use the 7b for helping me with coding, so I'm trying to see what my options are.



What would you guys recommend for my use case? Student budget friendly. As I said I don't want to pay $20/month for chatgpt pro or whatever. Thanks for helping out a noob!",active,1
