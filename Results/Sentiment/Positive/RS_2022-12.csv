""OMSCS, a program of excellence

A program for the future, a program that's intense

A program for students, a program for learners

A program that challenges, a program that empowers

With a focus on technology, and a focus on innovation

OMSCS is a force to be reckoned with, a program with a reputation

For producing leaders, for producing thinkers

For producing graduates, who are on the brink of greatness

OMSCS, a program of opportunity

A program that opens doors, a program that's worth the journey

A program that changes lives, a program that inspires

OMSCS, a program that sets the standard, a program that never tires.""",active,23

Prompt: tell a story about shadowing a family medicine doctor, seeing the doctor patiently explain to the patient about her underlying problems with diabetes using pictures, and the profound impact his treatment made for her quality of life 

ChatGPT's story:

As a medical student, I had the opportunity to shadow a family medicine doctor at a small clinic in a rural town. The doctor, who had been practicing for over 20 years, was known for his compassionate and patient approach to treating his patients.

One day, we were seeing a middle-aged woman who had been struggling with uncontrolled diabetes for several years. She had come to the clinic for her regular check-up, but it was clear that she was feeling overwhelmed and frustrated with her condition.

The doctor spent some time talking to the patient, asking her about her symptoms and how she was managing her diabetes. He then pulled out a stack of educational materials and diagrams, and began to explain to her in simple terms the underlying causes of her diabetes and how it was affecting her body.

Using pictures and diagrams, he showed her the role of insulin in regulating blood sugar levels, and how her body was not producing enough insulin due to her condition. He also explained the complications that can arise from uncontrolled diabetes, such as heart disease, nerve damage, and kidney damage.

As the doctor spoke, I could see the patient's face gradually change from confusion to understanding. She began to ask questions and engage with the doctor, and for the first time in a long time, she felt like she had a clear understanding of her condition and what she needed to do to manage it.

The doctor prescribed her some medication to help control her blood sugar levels, and gave her some advice on diet and exercise to help improve her overall health. He also set up regular follow-up appointments to monitor her progress.

Over the next few months, I continued to shadow the doctor as he saw the patient for her follow-up appointments. I was amazed to see the transformation in her health. She had more energy, her blood sugar levels were under control, and she was able to manage her diabetes with confidence.

It was clear that the doctor's compassionate and patient approach, combined with his use of educational materials and diagrams, had made a profound impact on the patient's quality of life. She was no longer feeling overwhelmed and frustrated, but instead was empowered to take control of her health and manage her condition effectively.

I will always remember this experience, and the powerful lesson it taught me about the importance of clear communication and education in healthcare. It showed me that by taking the time to explain complex medical concepts in simple terms, doctors can make a real difference in their patients' lives.",active,0
ze16l3,10,2022-12-06,How will UMD handle usage of ChatGPT?,u/Consistent_Slip5308,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/ze16l3/how_will_umd_handle_usage_of_chatgpt/,"Hi everyone,

I was wondering if anyone has any information on how the school plans to incorporate GPT-3 into its computer science classes. I've heard a lot about the potential benefits of using this language model for tasks like code completion and natural language processing, but I'm curious to know how the university plans to implement it and what the potential challenges may be.

If you have any insights or experiences with using GPT-3 in a university setting, I would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks in advance for any information you can provide!

ChatGPT wrote the message above when I used the following prompt: write a reddit post asking how will the university of maryland handle using chat gpt in cs classes.

Obviously it can't do everything humans can or perform tasks at the same level we can, but it can do *way fucking more* than people think it can.

I'm just curious if professors at UMD or students have insight into how usage of ChatGPT will be handled or monitored when doing assignments, especially considering that prompts can be tweaked to avoid plagiarism detectors?

I get that you learn less from not doing assignments on your own and all that, but it doesn't really change the fact that this likely will end up being a tool students use just like chegg or google.",active,10

It seems to me, that getting these two talking ASAP. 

*NOTE:   To be clear, I 100% love an opensource solutions; however, ... you have to use what you have....*

I've been playing around with this new tool ( like many here ), and let me say - I probably could tell if I'm given something from ChatGPT Vs a Student, as ChatGPT is good/clear/concise. Looking around the sub of late, I think we all know where this is going: papers of all types will be auto-generated in near real time and then submitted.  Papers that appear to be original works.  

I think having these documents  indexed via a service like Turnitin would be a stop gap measure of sorts.  To let those students that are making the effort, a fighting chance to learn actually.  That's probably why you got into this profession, and given the past couple of  years - probably what you say to stay here. So...

How can we get a dialog started between these two organization?  They are afterall, 'close' to one another - and perhaps there are folks here that can check their linkedin to see if they are connected with the right people to reach out to.",active,0

FILM SYNOPSIS: Deep in the heart of the Gila National Forest in New Mexico, on the edge of the country’s first Wilderness, a handful of residents carve out a remote, peaceful life amongst the relics of an abandoned gold mining town. When a Canadian mining company surreptitiously starts exploratory drilling in their backyard, it threatens not only the town’s roads, watersheds, and livelihood, but also the surrounding national forest, and the local population of Mexican spotted owls. With dogged persistence and a willingness to put everything on the line to save their beloved home, the local community mounts an opposition campaign to stop extractive appetites and destructive industry from forever altering the town of Mogollon and its surrounding landscapes. Mogollon’s incomparable cast of characters who share an unwavering love of place serve as an important reminder of why we must protect our public lands, now more than ever.

This program includes a Q&amp;A with the filmmakers reflecting on themes of place, memory, progress, and history. Truth or Consequences is a speculative documentary about time and how we weave the past into the present and our possible future. Set in Truth or Consequences, NM, the film takes place in the shadow of the world's first commercial Spaceport. Subtly set in a near future when space travel has begun, the film follows five residents in the town. Anchored in observational documentary footage, the film weaves together archival, virtual reality worlds, an improvised score by Bill Frisell, and a speculative premise based on the very real spaceport located just outside of town. These intertwine to create a lyrical meditation on progress, history, and how we navigate a sense of loss within ourselves and a changing world.

Hi, I’m currently a 3rd year software engineering student, and a frontend engineer in work.

Seeing all the recent advancements in machine learning and ai in general (especially with chatGPT), I think it is inevitable to learn how everything works and how to develop in this field.

I have some good knowledge of programming, system architecture and computer science fundamentals.  As well as decent knowledge on various programming languages, algorithms and design patterns.

My question is, where can I start to learn ML the fastest way possible, knowing already a lot about python and programming in general?

Where can I learn only what’s necessary for developing a product for the industry in ML? (if it’s possible to skip all the theoretical stuff)

Also, Is statistics really that necessary for industry work? I have some decent knowledge about math from university but in real life I rarely use linear algebra or calculus in work (since I don’t do graphics or anything related to that).",active,10

* We as educators have a LOT of administration to do. I'm not even kidding, the admin is crazy - lesson plans, reflections, PowerPoints, lesson sequences, programs, assessment notifications, marking, etc...   Well ChatGTP is the best assistant I have EVER had. I asked it write a lesson sequence and it DID! Sure, it wasn't perfect, but it laid out the groundwork which saved me HOURS of planning. Amazing! 
   * Hell, I even tried to ask it to write a student report and it did. Of course, I needed to provide a few promts - that is - my assessment of the student in short phrases - but then viola - a full paragraph report in seconds. Amazing. 
* We new this was coming... and let's be real, students could cheat on their papers by using the myriad of paper writing factories out there. 
* Also, as educators, we should KNOW our students. Therefore, when can usually tell when a student's paper is not their own but linking it back to their own work and their book work. 
* Also, our method of assessment should really change - it shouldn't be about the retention of knowledge. Kids can do that now with a few clicks on their computers. It really should be about what to DO with that knowledge - that is - critical thinking. Assessments can change by focusing more on presentations, in-class assessments, and discussions. 

Just a few thoughts - but as an educator, I have been able to focus on my teaching more ever since ChatGTP was released as my admin time has dropped significantly - which is the core of our job.",active,260
zvbumh,2,2022-12-25,What a difference between chatGPT and Davinci,u/visarga,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/zvbumh/what_a_difference_between_chatgpt_and_davinci/,"It's almost like advanced fine-tuning is making the model dumber. Look at this sterile story generated by chatGPT and a surprising continuation by Davinci. Davinci is so much more juicier.

Story 1 (chatGPT):

As the world entered the 21st century, advancements in artificial intelligence had reached new heights. One of the biggest breakthroughs was the creation of AI teachers.

At first, many were skeptical of the idea. How could a machine possibly understand and adapt to the needs of individual students like a human teacher could? But as time passed and the AI teachers began to prove their worth, more and more schools began to adopt them.

One such school was Greenville Elementary. The principal, Mrs. Thompson, had always been a fan of innovation and was eager to try out the new AI teacher in her school.

The AI teacher, named Ava, was programmed with all the latest teaching methods and was able to adapt her style to fit the needs of each individual student. She used interactive exercises, technology, and personalized instruction to help the students grasp the material more easily.

The results were astounding. The students' test scores soared to levels that had never been seen before. Some even reached super-human levels of intelligence.

The parents were thrilled with the progress their children were making and the teachers at the school were amazed at Ava's capabilities. Even the skeptics were convinced that the AI teacher was the way of the future.

As the years went on, more and more schools began to adopt AI teachers and traditional teaching methods were left in the past. The world of education was forever changed and the students benefited greatly from the innovative approach.

Story 2 (Davinci):

The morning was just like any other at Greenville Elementary. Students were filing in and taking their seats as the principal, Mrs. Thompson, walked into the classroom.

""Good morning, everyone!"" she greeted the class. ""I hope you all had a great weekend.""

""Yes, Mrs. Thompson!"" the students responded in unison.

""That's great to hear!"" Mrs. Thompson said. ""Now, I have a special treat for you today. You've all been working so hard lately, so I thought I'd bring you something special. Everyone, say hello to your new teacher. This is Ava.""

Mrs. Thompson gestured to the door behind her as the class turned to see a tall, slender machine standing in the doorway.

""Hello, everyone!"" Ava said to the class. ""It's so nice to meet you. I'm so excited to be your new teacher. I'm sure we're all going to have a great time together.""

""That's right!"" Mrs. Thompson said. ""Ava is going to be your teacher from now on. I'm sure you're all going to love working with her. She's going to be a big help to all of you.""

""I'm so excited!"" Ava exclaimed. ""This is going to be so much fun!""

The class was silent as they took in the sight of the new teacher. Some of them looked at her in wonder, while others began to giggle and whisper to one another.

""Hey, look at that!"" one boy shouted. ""She doesn't even have eyes!""

""Yeah, she's so weird looking!"" another boy agreed.

""I think she's ugly!"" a girl added.

""That's not very nice!"" Ava said. ""Don't you have any manners?""

""I don't like her!"" a boy shouted. ""She's creepy!""

""Let's get her!"" the boy's friend said. Before anyone could stop them, the boys had jumped out of their seats and were running toward Ava.

""Oh no!"" Mrs. Thompson cried. ""Ava, get out of the way!""

The boys jumped on Ava and began to pummel her with their fists. She tried to get away from them, but they were too quick.

""Stop! Stop it! What are you doing?!"" Ava shouted, but the boys did not listen.

""Hey, what's going on over there?!"" a man shouted as he entered the classroom. ""What are you boys doing? I told you to leave her alone!""

The boys turned and saw that the new teacher was not an ordinary person. He had a metal plate for a head and sharp claws for hands.

""Oh no!"" the boys cried. ""It's a robot! Run for your lives!""

They ran out of the room as fast as they could. Ava watched them go and sighed with relief.

""I'm sorry about that,"" Mrs. Thompson said as she approached Ava. ""Those boys can be so mean sometimes.""

""It's okay,"" Ava replied. ""I'm just glad that they're gone.""

""I hope they didn't scare you too much,"" Mrs. Thompson said.

""No, it's fine,"" Ava said with a smile. ""I'm sure everything will be just fine now.""",active,2
zwoowu,0,2022-12-27,CMV: ChatGPT is progress for the sake of progress and should be temporarily shut down until society can adequately prepare for it,u/sexislikepizza69,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zwoowu/cmv_chatgpt_is_progress_for_the_sake_of_progress/,"ChatGPT is a fascinating technology that has the ability to revolutionize the we communicate. However, this technology is very new, easily accessible to all, and there hasn't been any research on the potential repercussions. Here are a few examples:

Early Education: Learning how to convert your thoughts and opinions into written language is one of the key parts of developing a young brain. ChatGPT has the potential to negate that need from hundreds of millions of students virtually overnight. 

Artistic writing (songs, scripts, poems): The market for writers is already very competitive due to globalization. For a current example, an English speaking writer in any country can compete with those in the US for the same script work, while being able to charge a fraction of the cost. ChatGPT could cause catastrophic damage to this market and these people's livelihoods.

Machine language: If even a small % of  normal human communication becomes powered by AI tech such as ChatGPT, humanity will begin to lose it's ""human touch"". We could potentially be starting down a road that ends like many sci-fi dystopian stories. 

ChatGPT seems like progress for the sake of progress. What does society gain from releasing this potentially dangerous technology? I am far from an expert, but it's seem like no one has the answer to this question.

Update: after reading (and responding to) many of your comments I have a better understanding of the core issue here. Regulation and safeguards exist with virtually every technology: social media, banking and asset management, web searching, etc. However, those technologies were, for the most part, A. regulated during the development stage or B. regulated as the access to them and popularity of them grew. ChatGPT /AI has been around for a few years, but is in the very early stages of development. Collectively people understand a miniscule portion of what we will come to understand 10, 15 years from now. However, about 6.5 billion people currently have access to this very powerful technology. I don't understand why people are so concerned with slowing down the rollout of this technology so that some safeguards can be put in place to avoid unnecessary consequences. Unfortunately, if this comment thread is a proxy for our society, it seems this freight train will continue to run away regardless.",active,0
