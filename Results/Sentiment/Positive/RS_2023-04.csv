12a4fg5,0,2023-04-02,My journey developing a Chrome Extension using ChatGPT as a sophomore college student: 3 lessons I learned,u/leanLuis,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/12a4fg5/my_journey_developing_a_chrome_extension_using/,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share my experience of developing a Chrome Extension as a sophomore college student with little JavaScript experience. With the help of ChatGPT, not only was I able to shorten my development time significantly, but I also gained valuable insights along the way.

The project was a Chrome Extension called QuickSummarize that uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Chat to generate concise summaries of lengthy text. ChatGPT was instrumental in helping me get through the coding hurdles and offering guidance on various aspects like writing marketing content, setting up a Stripe product page, and even planning ad campaigns.

Here are three actionable lessons I learned from this journey:

**Embrace new technologies:** Utilizing cutting-edge tools like ChatGPT can speed up your development process and make things more manageable, even if you're not an expert in the field. Don't be afraid to explore and integrate new technologies into your projects, as they can provide valuable support and enhance your learning experience.

**Break tasks into smaller, manageable pieces**: When tackling a project, it can be overwhelming to look at it as a whole. Breaking tasks down into smaller steps can make the process less daunting and more achievable. Start with the basics, and build on them as you gain confidence and understanding.

**Learn from your mistakes and iterate**: As a college student, it's essential to recognize that making mistakes is part of the learning process. When you encounter a challenge, don't get discouraged. Instead, use it as an opportunity to learn, grow, and iterate on your project. Continuous improvement is the key to success.

Feel free to ask me any questions or share your own experiences with ChatGPT or similar projects. I'd love to hear from you!

12bolov,3,2023-04-04,"Hey teachers of Reddit, how are you leveraging ChatGPT to make your daily grind more bearable?",u/CryptoDir,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/12bolov/hey_teachers_of_reddit_how_are_you_leveraging/," Greetings, fellow redditing-edu-gurus!

I've recently jumped on the ChatGPT bandwagon to see if it could help me add some pizzazz to my day-to-day tasks, and lo and behold, it's been quite the game changer. It's been lending a hand with lesson planning, grading, those dreaded parent/teacher communications, dishing out student feedback, keeping track of activity calendars, and even tackling a few odds and ends.

Now, I can't help but wonder: Are any of you fine educators out there also harnessing the power of ChatGPT? If so, I'd be stoked to hear how you're making it work for you and any clever prompts you've cooked up. I'm on a quest to broaden my horizons and unearth new ways to use this nifty little tool.

To get the ball rolling, let's ponder a few questions:

1. What snazzy prompts have you used with ChatGPT that jazzed up your teaching game?
2. Any hurdles you've faced while using ChatGPT, and how'd you clear them?
3. Got any tasks that ChatGPT absolutely nails, or others where it falls a tad short?
4. Anyone managed to use ChatGPT to boost student engagement? How'd you pull that off?
5. What are some out-of-the-box ways you've used ChatGPT to create a more dynamic and inclusive environment for your young scholars?
6. How has ChatGPT shaken up your workflow, and have you stumbled upon any life-saving hacks for your fellow pedagogues?

I'm genuinely stoked to hear about your adventures with ChatGPT and learn from your experiences. There's nothing quite like a good ol' knowledge exchange among educators to see how we're pushing the envelope with technology to up our teaching game and make a difference in our student's lives. So let's put our heads together and share our collective wisdom so we can all level up and squeeze every drop of potential out of this ingenious tool.

12c5z1k,3,2023-04-04,What's the Point you consider ChatGPT Cheating?,u/Substantial_Side_392,AskProfessors,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProfessors/comments/12c5z1k/whats_the_point_you_consider_chatgpt_cheating/,"As a student I've really been enjoying using ChatGPT to help me with a lot of my classes. I've especially been getting a lot of use out of it in lectures, because if I take quick notes in class I can compile all of them into a ChatGPT prompt to give me more information about things. For example yesterday the Professor briefly talked about the ""Lerman Method"" of instruction and quickly summarized it. By putting it into ChatGPT it was able to give me a solid foundational understanding of this new to me topic without breaking the flow of class by asking 20 questions, and I was able to quickly redirect my attention back to the lecture. I would say most people wouldn't consider that cheating. I do this with a lot of my notes and it's been helping tremendously in my understanding in the class. It also has been helpful in letting me gather my thoughts into singular good questions when I'm not even sure what I'm not sure about.

A bit ago I was doing a lit analysis on a book that ChatGPT somehow had extensive knowledge on. I wrote my own thoughts and notes, and plugged that into ChatGPT to get a 'second opinion.' on it. And ChatGPT offered some additional insights to the symbolism, and provided additional context to the world/time period/when the author lived in that added to my depth of understanding. Which I then verified by doing my own research on the topic, and confirmed everything ChatGPT said was true (surprisingly.) But using ChatGPT was able to quickly whittle down the scope of what was relevant, and made my search for academic literature on the novel much easier than it would have otherwise been.

In another course I was having issues putting my thoughts together for a paper I needed to write. So I did a stream of consciousness word dump about my thoughts, and told ChatGPT to gather my thoughts to a singular theme and topic that could be turned into a paper. And it did that. Which helped narrow my focus tremendously.

In another instance I had ChatGPT give me a bulleted list that made sense in organization from an essay I had in a rough draft form. It gave really good feedback about which sentences and sections may have been out of place, and it really helped me refine the structure. 

Last semester I asked it to write the essay for me to get an idea of what it could look like. It gave me something that was okay, but missed a lot of important details, nuances, and didn't really make good 'points.' So I reprompted it, giving it instructions on what to do with the essay, what needed to be better, and what points it should be making. After doing this for about 20-30 minutes I felt like I had a solid understanding of what I wanted the essay to look like so I just went for it, occasionally reviewing ChatGPT as if they were notes to remind myself the order and structure I decided on. But never saw any value in taking direct sentences from it at any point.

Recently for creative writing on personal projects I've had it help me world build. Things I can do on my own, but really saves me a ton of time. Things like ""I need a place for this story to take place. It needs X, Y and Z characteristics."" and it'll produce a ton of ideas. Then I use it to back and forth until I've whittled down something that sounds good, and go from there.

I've also had some minor success in telling it to do entire first drafts of select scenes or moments in fiction. Like ""I have this idea. Here are the characters, their personalities, their relationship with each other, and I want you to write this scene, where this happens."" and it does that. But then I decide I'm not a fan of it, so change and tweak things with it, until I find one thing that 'clicks' into place. But ChatGPT isn't a strong writer at all, so after getting my thoughts together I write it entirely on my own.

By the end of it all I am writing my own words, prose, and deciding on my own structures. I'm also using it to answer general questions and organize what I want to do. But to me it's like automating calculations in a spreadsheet. I don't know if I consider it cheating, because I feel like I'm simply being more efficient. Yet by the end of every assignment they are my own words, my own research, and my own thoughts. And the drafts by the robot are by my own diction where I don't take sentences from in my own drafts. And every 'fact' ChatGPT tells me I make sure I verify its statements on a proper source, and if it's relevant to the paper cite it appropriately. If I cannot confirm a fact, I disregard it.

But I'm not sure, this is new territory for a lot of people myself included. I like how productive I've been, and I feel like it's been helping me be proactive in my own learning. But others, especially professors, may have wildly different opinions. Maybe I've completely given myself a blind spot and I should be given the old yeller treatment (I hope not.) So before I confidently decide for myself that I'm not toeing the line or full blown cheating, I should double check and make sure. I gave a few examples (With some details slightly altered) hoping if I did make a mistake I can find out how. I feel like most cheaters know they're cheating, and this doesn't feel like cheating. But I could be very mistaken.

12fe99b,0,2023-04-08,Charting a New Course: The LLM Revolution in Education and Its Implications for Future Generations,u/wolttam,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/12fe99b/charting_a_new_course_the_llm_revolution_in/,"[DISCLAIMER: This article (and the title) was written entirely by ChatGPT on the GPT-4 model]  

## Introduction

The rise of large language models (LLMs) promises a transformative era in education, with far-reaching implications for students, educators, and parents alike. The advent of LLMs like GPT-4 presents opportunities for unprecedented learning experiences, but it also introduces a set of unique challenges that need to be addressed. This essay will explore the multifaceted impact of LLMs on the educational landscape, painting a vivid picture of a future where these advanced AI models are deeply integrated into the schooling process. It will also offer valuable insights for parents seeking to prepare their young children for the dynamic learning environment that lies ahead.

## Embracing the Educational Revolution: The Promise and Perils of Large Language Models

The integration of LLMs into education holds immense potential for nurturing creativity, curiosity, and critical thinking among students. By streamlining learning pathways, LLMs can provide personalized educational experiences that allow children to progress at their own pace, potentially reducing the time spent in formal education. Furthermore, LLMs can facilitate a multidisciplinary approach to learning, fostering adaptable and innovative thinking in students as they navigate an increasingly interconnected world.

However, the incorporation of LLMs into education is not without its challenges. It is crucial to address the potential loss of human connection, as the bond between students and teachers, as well as peer-to-peer relationships, plays an essential role in developing empathy, collaboration, and emotional intelligence. Additionally, ethical considerations surrounding AI-generated content, such as potential biases and misinformation, must be carefully considered. Finally, the impact of increased screen time on a child's cognitive and emotional development needs to be weighed against the benefits of LLM integration.

## The Future of Schooling: A Vision of Education Deeply Integrated with Large Language Models

As LLMs become deeply integrated into the educational system, the traditional classroom may evolve into a more flexible, dynamic, and personalized learning environment. This new paradigm could feature modular classrooms that can adapt to different learning activities, as well as virtual and augmented reality technologies that enhance learning experiences by providing immersive educational content.

With the support of LLMs, each student will embark on a personalized learning pathway tailored to their individual needs, interests, and learning styles. The role of teachers will evolve to focus more on guiding, mentoring, and facilitating learning experiences, while LLMs handle administrative tasks and provide personalized feedback on student performance. The assessment process will be transformed into a more comprehensive, ongoing evaluation of a student's progress, with a focus on self-reflection and improvement rather than just grades.

To ensure the social and emotional development of students in this new landscape, schools will place a greater emphasis on fostering interpersonal relationships and emotional intelligence. Group activities, peer-to-peer learning, and collaborative projects will be prioritized, and LLMs will assist in creating inclusive and engaging group dynamics. Schools may also integrate mindfulness and emotional well-being practices into the curriculum, with LLMs offering personalized support and resources for emotional growth.

## Preparing for the LLM Revolution: Advice for Parents of Young Children

As the world braces for the impact of the LLM revolution, parents must take a proactive approach in preparing their children for the future of education. They can do so by:

- Encouraging a growth mindset, emphasizing the importance of effort, resilience, and continuous learning.
- Cultivating digital literacy, teaching children to navigate and evaluate online resources responsibly.
- Balancing technology with human connection, fostering empathy and emotional intelligence through face-to-face social interactions.
- Advocating for responsible LLM integration in schools, ensuring that AI technologies are used ethically and effectively.
- Exploring LLMs at home, introducing age-appropriate tools to support and enrich learning experiences while maintaining a balanced approach to technology use.

## Conclusion

The integration of large language models into the educational landscape heralds a transformative period, with the potential to reshape the way we approach learning, teaching, and assessment. As we embrace this revolution, it is essential to recognize both the promise and the perils that LLMs bring to the educational sphere. By envisioning a future where LLMs are deeply integrated into the schooling process, we can create an educational system that nurtures creativity, critical thinking, and empathy in students. By providing parents with guidance on how to prepare their young children for this rapidly evolving learning environment, we can empower future generations to thrive in an increasingly interconnected and AI-driven world.",active,0

I teach in the art department, so I'm admittedly a little more shielded from some issues than other departments, but I don't think I've ever had a major cheating issue. When I asked my students if they've ever ""known anyone"" to use ChatGPT to write essays for them, most of them seemed to genuinely say no.

No, they're not perfect. The majority are ""average"" and don't have the drive and ambition to work in our field long-term, but that's probably not much different from when I was an undergrad at a much better school, and each year I have a couple of stand-out students who will likely go far.

There are days when I'm tired and wish I didn't have to teach, but even on those days I usually leave class in a better mood and more energized than at the start of class. I enjoy what I do.

12q1x42,9,2023-04-17,A teacher struggles with AI,u/99acrefarm,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/12q1x42/a_teacher_struggles_with_ai/,"Hey all,

I've been enjoying many of the posts here, learning about and considering the views of others. I thought I would throw my hat, thoughts and concerns into the ring.

I am an American HS private Christian school teacher, primarily teaching introduction-level technology classes (coding with Python, Robotics, video editing, web design/HTML, CAD). I also teach some writing classes.

I am currently spending a good amount of my time learning about AI (mostly ChatGPT-based) and thinking about its role in education. I am no ""tech alarmist"" that wants to ban AI in education. I find it a fascinating and powerful tool. I also see a lot of dangers. In my role, I find myself focusing on teaching students both how to use technology tools and also to consider what it means to use and build technology ethically. I strongly believe we should, as a society and individuals, build ethical codes around our use of all technology, and not ""build it because we can/build it before someone else does."" I do hold the position that AI should at this point be filtered/limited/muzzled until we can work out inherent biases and misinformation.

(A 'quick' aside...I fear my role & position as described may contain some assumptions, and I want to try to alleviate any perceived biases on both your and my part. I try to be fair and reasonable in political discussions and views, as well as religious. As examples, I have gotten myself in quite a bit of trouble at my school trying to dispel anti-CRT arguments. I also just this year started an Innocence Club that tries to raise support about wrongful convictions, which is a passion of mine that you may soon find ironic. Many of you probably disagree with my own religious/ethical choices, but I hope that doesn't hinder a good open-minded discussion.)

Anyway, as I said, I am definitely struggling as a teacher, and a technology teacher at that, to find the place where AI belongs in our educational process and where it doesn't. Here are some specific things I think about:

1. AI as a cheating tool. We've definitely seen its use in our school growing quickly. We are struggling a bit in our response. I've been reading more and more people here comment  ""I've been accused of using AI and I did not."" and a lot of responses about burden of proof and the uselessness of AI detection. This is where my passion for justice and my role as a teacher give me very conflicting views. Of course I do not want to end up accusing students of cheating who are innocent. But at this point--I have basically no methods that I can think of to avoid doing so. I have NEVER been a fan of finding a technological patch for a solution that requires something else. There must be better systems than poor AI detection. But let's also remember a few things:

* ChatGPT was not on our bingo cards for 2023. This is sudden and unexpected. Teachers do better after a summer of reflection and planning. And the anti-AI tools are all we have in a pinch right now. Using ChatGPT as a cheat isn't fair on the education system, and using detecting tools isn't fair on the students...but here we are. Especially after the past few years in education. Right now, if using these tools is all we have to combat the problem, I'm afraid we are going to have to use them. It's already ""one more thing"" on a group of underpaid professionals to just run every assignment through detection software.
* Burden of proof has become a pet peeve of mine in a high school setting recently. Last year, I allowed some students out of a class meeting to use the bathroom. After I had done so, I suddenly realized that the group I sent together was a bad idea. I went into the hall to stop them, only to see them run around the corner. Later, a boys bathroom was discovered to be vandalized. I saw these students running toward that bathroom laughing in the same time frame as it happened. Later, security cameras confirmed this group ran into the bathroom and ran out a few minutes later. The only thing we didn't have was an exact caught in the act proof. Students basically admitted something happened but wouldn't give exact details. Parents refused to see why their kids should be punished without any exact eye-witness proof. Now I am sorry, but high school is NOT a court of law. If a teacher can make a reasonable case that a student is most likely guilty of breaking a rule, including plagiarism, even without court-level proof, I am going to side with the teacher. All my students are going to say they don't use AI to do a homework assignment. But if 1-2 out of the bunch are detected, I am going to enact the ""Academic Integrity Policy"" of consequences. Now completely failing a student or expelling...that would require more proof.

2.  This already got long, but I will at least open up another can of worms. I definitely have sympathy for the view that our educational system is broken, and that ChatGPT exposes it not causes it. I am all for improving our assessments and our instructional strategies to make them tools that get students to think and learn, not merely to regurgitate. But I am struggling to figure out exactly how to do this. I think what I specifically disagree with is the notion that ""if ChatGPT can answer it, the topic/idea no longer needs to be learned.""

I teach 9th grade students how to write a research paper. A lot of this is focusing on process--organization of materials, how to research, how to consider the trustworthiness of sources...A big part of it is learning how to present an argument (a thesis), and support that argument so that it makes coherent sense and shows documented proof. Some parts of that can be automated--like the actual formatting of the sources in whatever academic citation system is needed. But the end result--a 5 paragraph essay on certain prompts about To Kill a Mockingbird--is something that a well-considered ChatGPT prompt can produce. But I still think it is needed and worthwhile learning for a student to go through the learning of that process because it is more about learning to argue.

Maybe the exact example in the end, but this year my co-teacher taught the 9th graders about logical fallacies, and how/why to avoid them. He went over some common fallacies, then did some exercises about them, and then allowed students to argue about why they should not have homework that evening. If they didn't use fallacies, and called him out when he did, they won the debate. Students were really engaged and later in class feedback, many pointed to this lesson as a highlight of the class. BUT--those exercises I mentioned that they did--were prompts to respond in a dialogue to various fallacies so that students could work out what they learned in lecture/notes and see how to apply it. But again, those exact prompts were something at ChatGPT would be great at producing for students without them thinking about it at all. 

I believe in what I teach in that particular class. But in reflection, I am scared to admit how much of it could be done well by AI at this point. And that's not even my web design and coding classes, which maybe need a 100% rewritten syllabus now. 

I am being a stick in the mud old teacher who doesn't want students to use a calculator so that they learn math the old-fashioned way? I want my students to be literate citizens who can converse about and debate --and then enact solutions to -- societal problems. I want them to make the world--and the people, animals and plants in it--a better place than they found it. I have no problem with them learning to use AI to make that happen. But what do they need to understand and learn first to make the best use of it? That's what I am trying to figure out.

if you made it this far, thanks for reading. i'd love to hear your thoughts.",active,9

As such, I developed the following prompt and gave it to my college freshman chemistry class as an aid. This prompt allows them to enter a subject and topic and get the AI to act as a study buddy. This prompt: 

1. Asks the student a short answer question about the topic
2. Then students must respond in their own words (a critical skill for conceptual understanding)
3. The chatbot then reads the response and tells the students if they got it right, partially right, or wrong. 
4. It then writes an appropriate level summary of the material
5. Finally, it asks a new question that is a bit harder if the student got the last one correct, and a bit easier if the student got the last one wrong. 

My students have told me they are using it and a few have commented that the open ended, short answer format was challenging but now they feel much more confident talking about the material. This is just scratching the surface of ""individualized learning."" Thoughts and comments?

**Prompt**:

Act as a college \[chemistry\] professor. I am a student trying to understand and learn about \[atomic structure\]. Please ask me a question. I will attempt to answer it. If I am right, tell me so, then ask me a harder question. If I am wrong, tell me the right answer, give me a brief explanation of why that answer is correct, and then ask me a slightly easier question. If you understand, say “I am ready to help you learn"" then ask me your first question.

**Potential modifications:**

1. Change college professor to match your instructional level, so the questions are at the appropriate level for your students.
2. If you are preparing students for exams with specific question formats, change the ""Please ask me a question"" line to ""Please ask me a \[matching/MAT/multiple choice/etc\] question"" inserting your desired format.",active,5

I want to see if there is a AI platform I can use to upload my PDFs of my textbooks, test banks, etc to create a study plan.

 Which one should I utilize? I am thinking about using the AI to create a Quizlet template along with supporting my own outlines. I heard there was a AI that can be your own tutor but I'm having a hard time finding that

Thoughts or suggestions would be great thanks

Edit: so far I found 
https://beta.monic.ai/  - currently just did a trial run on a question bank, it did okay. it got 3/4 of the questions - multiple choice correctly transferred.

12uhx9u,10,2023-04-21,How ChatGPT revolutionized my work as a dentist and educator,u/Endodontist-1,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/12uhx9u/how_chatgpt_revolutionized_my_work_as_a_dentist/,"As a **non-native English** speaker and a **dentist**, I've always found it **difficult to understand technical terms like API, SQL language, and plugins.** However, ChatGPT has changed my life and enabled me to be more productive than ever before! I work as a clinical professor at a dental school in the USA, where I spend most of my time teaching and mentoring students in the clinic. I'm honored to be nominated for the best professor award each year, but I've always felt that I could do more, especially in regards to communication with clinic administration, inventory management, and even my own students.

**Writing course plans or proposing ideas used to be a struggle, and I would often give up on my ideas because I found it challenging to express them in writing**. But with ChatGPT, everything has changed. In just a few weeks, I've accomplished tasks that I couldn't do in years. I've written comprehensive reports, proposed new protocols, and i**nitiated several research ideas**. When I had an incident with a student, I confidently wrote a full report and submitted it without hesitation. My communication skills have improved, and I can now collaborate more effectively with other educators, insurance companies, and clinical managers.

With newfound confidence, I no longer fear appearing unintelligent in front of others. My goal is to i**ntegrate ChatGPT into my educational approach, teaching students how to use it responsibly and effectively**. I hope to learn more about plugins and their potential, as well as how ChatGPT can assist me in collecting and organizing data. Additionally, I've started showing my students the power of this tool, helping them understand complex topics, work contracts, and even insurance processes when they graduate.

**Recently, I began posting educational content on my Instagram page, showcasing how to incorporate ChatGPT into our work as dentists and educators. One of my student's significant other , who happened to be an entrepreneur working in Silicon Valley, saw my posts. Coincidentally, they were developing dental tools utilizing AI, and my posts got their interest. This connection allowed me to give my input on their project and has potentially opened the door for future collaborations.**

To clarify, ChatGPT has been instrumental in optimizing and proofreading my reports. I usually write detailed prompts, covering about 90% of what I want to convey, and ChatGPT adds the finishing touches (like veneers) to make everything look polished and concise. **And of course, ChatGPT helped me write this very post!**

It can take hours and hours to build an entire learning unit. Add on top of that all of the differentiation you have to do for some students. It's insane. 

Chat GPT has helped me create an endless amount of examples, sentence frames, graphic organizers, word banks, and rubrics in a matter of minutes. Today, I had Chat GPT write me sentence frame samples for a character analysis using a character from a movie I never watched before because a kid said all my examples were boring. I don't think the kid did the work, but I'm pretty sure they read the sample sentences.   


I'm not all of a sudden cutting down my working hours. However, **I am able to have it build me things I didn't have the time to build on my own.** 

Today's quiz, the rubric for it, and associated supports were all built using Chat GPT. I modified some parts of it, and it took some back and forth between my writing partner (ChatGPT) and I to get it to build what I wanted it to build, but I think what we built together was way better than anything I could have done on my own with the time I had.",active,48

Better formatting yay!

# Google + DeepMind

* Google Brain and Deepmind have combined to form Google Deepmind. This is a big deal. Expecting big things from Google. Yes we’ve all been shitting on Google recently but we have to remember, they have most of the worlds data. The amount of things they can do with it should be insane. Will be very interesting to see what they come up with \[[Link](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/announcing-google-deepmind?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=GDM)\] Funnily enough over the last 13 years they went from DeepMind → Google DeepMind → DeepMind → Google DeepMind
* Google announced Project Magi, an AI powered search engine with the purpose of creating a more personalised user experience. It will apparently offer options for purchases, research and will be more of a conversational bot. Other things Google is working on include AI powered Google Earth, music search chatbot, a language learning tutor and a few other things \[[Link](https://me.mashable.com/tech/27276/project-magi-googles-team-of-160-working-on-adding-new-features-to-search-engine)\]
* Google’s Bard can now write code for you, explain code, debug code and export it Colab \[[Link](https://blog.google/technology/ai/code-with-bard/)\]
* DeepMind developed an AI program that created a 3D mapping of all 200 million proteins known to science \[[Link](https://twitter.com/60Minutes/status/1647745216986710018)\]

# Bark + Whisper JAX

* Bark is an incredible text-to-audio model and can also generate in multiple languages \[[Link](https://github.com/suno-ai/bark)\]
* Whisper Jax makes transcribing audio unbelievably fast, the fastest model on the web. Transcribe 30 min of audio in \~30 secs. Link to Github \[[Link](https://github.com/sanchit-gandhi/whisper-jax)\] Link to try online on huggingface \[[Link](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sanchit-gandhi/whisper-jax)\]

&#x200B;

# Open Source

* Open Assistant - just wow - is an open source Chat AI. The entire dataset is free and open source, you can find the code and all here \[[Link](https://huggingface.co/OpenAssistant)\]. You can play around with the chat here \[[Link](https://t.co/5lcaGKfu3i)\]. For an open source model I think its brilliant. I got it to make website copy and compared it to gpt-4 and honestly there was hardly a difference in this case. Very exciting. We’re getting closer and closer to a point where we’ll have open source models as powerful as gpt3.5 & 4. Video discussing it \[[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddG2fM9i4Kk)\]
* Stability AI announced StableLM - their Language Models. They’ve released 3B and 7B models with 15-65B models to come. Don’t be confused - this isn’t a chat bot like ChatGPT - that will come as they release RLHF models and go from StableLM to StableChat \[[Link](https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableLM/)\]. Another great win for open source
* LlamaAcademy is an open source repo designed to teach models how to read API docs and then produce code specifically for certain API’s. This type of thing will be very important in the coming adoption of AI \[[Link](https://github.com/danielgross/LlamaAcademy)\]. Still very experimental atm
* Detailed instructions on how to run LLaMA on Macbook M1 \[[Link](https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/llama-7b-m2)\]
* LLaVA is an open source model that can also interpret images. It’s good \[[Link](https://twitter.com/ChunyuanLi/status/1648222285889953793)\]. Link to try it out \[[Link](https://llava-vl.github.io/)\]
* MiniGPT-4 - an open source model for visual tasks. It can even generate html given a picture of a design of a website, albeit basic. The fact that this is open source is awesome, can’t wait for these open source models to get even better. \[[Link](https://minigpt-4.github.io/)\] Also provide a pretrained MiniGPT-4 aligned with Vicuna-7B \[[Link](https://github.com/Vision-CAIR/MiniGPT-4)\]
* Red Pajama is a project to create open source LLMs. They’ve just released a 1.2 trillion token dataset. This is actually a very big deal but because there's no demo, just a dataset its flown under the radar. They’re alrdy training ontop of it right now. I hope this will also work for commercial use as well \[[Link](https://twitter.com/togethercompute/status/1647917989264519174)\]

&#x200B;

# Elon's TruthGPT

* Elon Musk went on Tucker Carlson and spoke about AI. He’s building his own AI called TruthGPT - a maximum truth-seeking AI that tries to understand the nature of the universe. Whatever that means. This comes only a few weeks after he called for a pause on AI advancements. Why’s he doing this? He was scared that Google/DeepMind were winning and would lead to unsafe AGI because Larry Page (co-founder of Google) called Elon a “species-ist” for being pro human because he wants AI to be safe for humanity. Page has openly stated that Google's goal is to create AGI \[[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm04Dvky3w8)\]

&#x200B;

# OpenAI TED Talk

* President and Co-Founder of OpenAI, Greg Brokman did a TED talk and its worth a watch. He showcases the potential for plugins in chatgpt and ends with “We all need to become literate…together I believe we can achieve the OpenAI mission of ensuring AGI benefits all of humanity”. Another interesting point is that chatgpt or plugins is essentially “a unified language interface on top of tools”. Genuinely wonder what they have access to behind the scenes \[[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=C_78DM8fG6E)\] \[[Link](https://twitter.com/mezaoptimizer/status/1648195392557727744)\]

# Games

* AI in Game dev - You can now connect any hugging face model in Unity. Open source API integration \[[Link](https://github.com/huggingface/unity-api)\]. This concept shows working AI in a game \[[Link](https://twitter.com/mayfer/status/1648277360599502850?s=20)\]. Video showing how to connect the api \[[Link](https://twitter.com/dylan_ebert_/status/1648759808630353921?s=20)\]
* A demo of using ChatGPT NPC’s in virtual reality \[[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xA5K7fRmig)\]
* Someone made a game where you guess if the image of a lady is real or AI. I got 13/17 lol \[[Link](https://caitfished.com/)\]. A good way to show someone the power of AI but also highlights just how used to were seeing fake looking pics on social media
* AI powered 3D editor, looks cool \[[Link](https://dup.ai/)\]

&#x200B;

# Music

* The music industry is about to undergo crazy change with AI songs of Drake, The Weekend and others popping up and they are getting very good \[[Link](https://twitter.com/lostlifon/status/1647887306874060800?s=20)\] \[[Link](https://twitter.com/WeirdAiGens/status/1648648898628526082)\]. Kanye, Drake singing Call Me Maybe & kpop is one of the funniest thing I’ve heard in a while lol \[[Link](https://twitter.com/brickroad7/status/1648492914383917058)\] \[[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLWa5xC7CIE)\] \[[Link](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/RVPh0KaC7U4)\]. Obviously music companies are fighting against this very hard. Will be very interesting how this plays out re artists essentially offering their voices as models to be bought or something like that \[[Link](https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/universal-music-group-responds-to-fake-drake-ai-track-streaming-platforms-have-a-fundamental-responsibility/)\]

&#x200B;

# Text-to-video

* NVIDIA released their text-to-video research and it is pretty good. Text-to-video is getting better so fast, its going to be a kind of scary when it becomes as good as photo generation now. Being able to create a realistic video of absolutely anything sounds crazy when you consider what some people will do with it \[[Link](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/VideoLDM/)\]
* Adobe released their text-to-video editing and it looks pretty cool actually. You can generate sound effects/music clips & auto generate storyboards + a lot more \[[Link](https://twitter.com/jnack/status/1648027068888920065)\]

&#x200B;

# AR + AI

* AR + AI for cooking, looks cool \[[Link](https://twitter.com/metaverseplane/status/1648911560268546048)\]
* AR + AI for 3D knowledge mapping, looks so cool. If you have a metaquestvr you can download and try it \[[Link](https://twitter.com/yiliu_shenburke/status/1645818274981072897)\]

# Finance

* Finchat is chatgpt for finance - ask questions about public companies. It provides reasoning, sources and data \[[Link](https://finchat.io/)\]

&#x200B;

# Wearable AI devices

* Humane, a company founded by some vet ex Apple folks just showed what they’re building - an AI powered projector that just sits with you and hears what you hear, sees what you see. It can translate anything you say in real time, give advice on what you can/cant eat and a whole lot more. Very interesting to see how AI wearables will look like and how they’ll change daily life in the years to come. Still a bit skeptical tbh but only time will tell \[[Link](https://www.inverse.com/tech/humane-ai-wearable-camera-sensor-projector-video-demo)\]

The developments on the AI front keep rolling in. AI music, EU regulations, Elon Musk, and more all made major headlines this week. From about 425 saved links this week, I’ve curated and grouped the weeks’ AI developments into the biggest themes designed to help make sense of it all.

### News to Know

**Music is the next legal frontier AI will confront**

The music industry is confronting a litany of AI-related issues at light speed.

* Since the release and takedown of “Heart on My Sleeve,” which featured AI voices mimicking Drake and The Weeknd, the internet has been flooded with additional AI-made Drake songs.
* Expect each of these to test legal waters around what is fair use, and what is copyrighted
* Josh Constine, a VC at SignalFire, [puts it succinctly](https://twitter.com/JoshConstine/status/1650179054723805184): “Google is caught between an AI rock and a copyright hard place. Either the AI Drake song trained on copyrighted data is fair use, YouTube floods with this content, and labels panic Or it’s infringement, which means Google’s Bard AI is illegal.”
* Adding to the conversation: musician Grimes has proclaimed [anyone can use her voice for AI-generated songs](https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/24/23695746/grimes-ai-music-profit-sharing-copyright-ip), and she’d split 50% of royalties.
* [An ongoing Andy Warhol copyright case](https://www.wired.com/story/andy-warhol-fair-use-prince-generative-ai) could also have implications for generative AI, including AI music.

**Regulatory developments in the EU speed up**

The legal landscape impacting AI models is rapidly changing, and this week saw two major developments:

* ChatGPT complied with Italy’s initial demands, resulting in [the lifting of the ban](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65431914). OpenAI added additional information on how it trains ChatGPT, provided EU users with a new form objecting to have their data used for training, and now verifies users’ age when signing up. Investigations into ChatGPT, however, remain ongoing in France and Germany.
* The EU has passed [a draft of its AI Act](https://venturebeat.com/ai/eu-lawmakers-pass-draft-of-ai-act-includes-last-minute-change-on-generative-ai-models/), setting the stage for a finalization phase. The most important provision? A new clause that specifies AI models “would have to be designed in accordance with EU law and fundamental rights,” as well as a requirement that AI tools disclose the use of copyrighted materials. We’ll be watching this closely.

**Google’s challenges continue**

Poor Google. Since Bard’s tepid launch they can’t seem to catch a break, and new reports highlight exactly how daunting the AI race will be for them:

* Mindshare about Bard remains low relative to OpenAI and Bing. According to Google Trends, ChatGPT is 8.3x more popular than Bing and [33x more popular than Bard](https://www.artisana.ai/articles/chatgpt-grows-in-popularity-as-bing-and-bard-flatline). 
* Google’s recent merging of Google Brain and Deepmind into a single AI-focused Google Deepmind team [will face steep challenges](https://www.ft.com/content/f4f73815-6fc2-4016-bd97-4bace459e95e). According to Google insiders, Deepmind has historically functioned very independently, thinking about Nobel prize-worthy problems, while Google Brain has operated with indecisive leadership. For the two teams to merge and move quickly to match OpenAI’s focus and speed will be a daunting task.

**Elon Musk’s complicated views on AI**

What exactly are the billionaire’s plans for AI? While no one knows for sure, new details surfaced this week that adds color to the mixed messages he’s been sending:

* The New York Times reported that Elon Musk had ordered Twitter to [turn off OpenAI’s access](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/27/technology/elon-musk-ai-openai.html) to its historical tweets after ChatGPT surged in popularity
* Despite founding OpenAI in 2015, Musk has had a falling out with OpenAI on its mission and direction. He reportedly grew disillusioned when OpenAI stopped operating as a non-profit and built “woke” AI models.
* At the same time, the billionaire CEO is building his own Large Language Model as part of his new X.AI initiative. TruthGPT, Musk claims, is a “a maximum-truth-seeking A.I. that tries to understand the nature of the universe.”

**AI roils the job landscape**

Transformative technology has historically been a net benefit for society and GDP, but not without its intermediate pain. This is playing out at warp speed across multiple professions as AI’s power rapidly forces transformation.

* Dropbox announced a 16% headcount cut, [citing AI as one of the reasons](https://www.fastcompany.com/90888639/dropbox-tech-industry-layoffs-ai-job-cuts) behind the significant layoff. What’s notable: this is a profitable, public tech company whose financial metrics have only improved in recent years. For AI initiatives, Dropbox is doubling down — but for mature teams, they’re making cuts. Expect this to be the broad theme of tech as AI surges to the forefront.
* Kenyan ghostwriters, who normally help US college students write essays, [are losing jobs to ChatGPT](https://restofworld.org/2023/chatgpt-taking-kenya-ghostwriters-jobs/). Rest of World reports that many ghostwriters have seen up to 50% decrease in work as AI has reduced demand for human writers.
* A Stanford/MIT study showed that GPT-3 software [helped customer service agents perform as much as 35% better](https://www.artisana.ai/articles/stanford-mit-study-gpt-boosts-support-agent-productivity-by-up-to-35), portending big shifts in knowledge worker jobs as AI makes its way into numerous industries 

**Corporations are unprepared for generative AI, study finds**

[A KPMG study of 225 US executives](https://info.kpmg.us/news-perspectives/technology-innovation/kpmg-generative-ai-2023.html) found that 65% believe generative AI will have a high or extremely high impact on their companies, but nearly the same percentage say generative AI is still a year or two away from having an impact.

* While executives are optimistic, they are also worried it could have a negative impact, especially if risk is not managed
* Almost 4 in 10 executives believe generative AI could decrease social interactions and human connections among employees
* PwC announced a $1B investment in AI over the next 3 years; this is likely to become the norm as corporations pull the trigger on AI investments 

### Science Experiments

Amongst the dozens of impactful research papers coming out each week, we feature the most mindblowing examples below. As always, we try to explain anything technical to a non-technical reader.

**Text to Video**

RunwayML launched its Gen2 text-to-video model and the results are gorgeous. [Here are several examples of what users have created in concert with Midjourney](https://twitter.com/heyBarsee/status/1651961767810179072). The pace of development in the video space is simply on fire; imagine what could be possible by the end of the year.  

* We previously reported on Nvidia’s text-to-video experiments, [click here to see their examples](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/VideoLDM/).

**Segment Anything, but for video**

In another sign of how fast open-source tech is quickly improved, Facebook’s Segment Anything AI library was rapidly adapted into a video-tracking tech that beats Adobe’s own rotoscoping features in its professional software. [The open source repository can be accessed here](https://github.com/gaomingqi/Track-Anything).

**Robots playing soccer**

Straight out of the geniuses at Google’s Deepmind team, they’ve applied a technique called Deep Reinforcement learning to help robots move in a dynamic environment. This is a good reminder that the latest breakthroughs aren’t just limited to generative AI. [Check out the full videos here!](https://sites.google.com/view/op3-soccer?pli=1)

**Text to 3D Models**

A team of researchers generates surprisingly great 3D models out of text prompts. Expect this area of technology to rapidly improve in the next few months. What could that mean for 3D art and the artists who create models? [Full research paper here.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12439)
