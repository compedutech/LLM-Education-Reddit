The 3 options are:

&#x200B;

1. California public school.  City I grew up in.  40% of residents have STEM degrees.  Great school district The elementary school has an A on Niche, 8/10 score (but 10/10 on test) from GreatSchools.org. 23:1 student-to-teacher ratio. I was extremely happy with the school and teacher of my daughter's KG year.  Free
2. International School Abroad in Asia.  Reggio system.  About 1/3rd locals, 1/3 Asian expats, 1/3 European/American expats.  12:1 student:teacher ratio + 2 teacher assistants.   Teachers were from New Zealand, South Africa, UK for daughters age. Instruction in English. Cons: $16k.  \*The other good schools that follow a more conventional US program are well over $30k tuition.
3. Stride K12 + Homeschool.  Continue with homeschooling since it went better than expected.

Homeschool context.  I really did not intend to homeschool my daughter this school year.  However because of personal and work reasons and the uncertainty of how long I needed to stay abroad; I decided to homeschool her using the Stride K12 platform.  It was only supposed to be a quarter and that became the semester, and now we’re just sticking to it to finish the school year.

There are definitely pros and cons to the Stride platform. My daughter can breeze through the daily curriculum. She gets everything done in about 3 hours. She has a tutor 3 days a week (5 hours each day) to help her with that work, but also teach her a second language and extra math. I teach her 2 days a week, 2+ hours on top of the Stride work. Reading, Science, Philosophy (Aristotle, Kant, Stoicism, etc), Math with Abacus, Scratch Jr for basic programming and storytelling. I've leaned extra heavily into AI (ChatGPT, MagicSchool.ai, Khan Academy) for teaching her and her learning. For exercise, I teach her Muay Thai kickboxing and HIIT. She goes to KPop dance class for exercise and socializing. Weekends are playdates with kids her age, and she hasn't shown any lack of social skills.  
 

I just thought I would seek input from different teachers on what you would do if you were in my shoes. I was also interested in hearing anecdotal stories or even case studies that may be relevant to my decision. How would US teachers rank the 3 options:sier. If I homeschool, then we can have extended stays in new cities, and I can just teach her there.

Among my peer group, I now receive some side-eye and hear people talking negatively behind my back for doing so. 

I just thought I would seek input from different teachers on what you would do if you were in my shoes. I was also interested in hearing anecdotal stories or even case studies that may be relevant to me deciding. How would US teachers rank the 3 options:

I had 1-2 students every semester who didn’t care, but they just stopped participating and the class dynamic wasn’t affected.

Now, I have 5 out of 40 who are genuinely participating. The others are using ChatGPT to not only write their poems and stories, they’re using it to give each other feedback.
They’re putting a peer’s poem into ChatGPT, then copying and pasting the feedback.
I thought I could steer away by making them include in-text annotations in the peer review function (Canvas), but they just copy the feedback and paste it into an in-text comment. Everything is “poignant” and “inspires emotional responses” according to ChatGPT.

1c5zqgs,25,2024-04-16,Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Spring 2024 Way-Too-Long Review,u/AcceptableDistance94,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/1c5zqgs/humancomputer_interaction_hci_spring_2024/,"**TLDR:** Good course. Highly structured and rewards consistent effort/engagement, punishing to procrastinators or poor English writers. 

(**Background:**  mid-40's, career government IT manager, native English speaker. This is my first OMSCS class; I have a liberal arts BA/MBA from the 00's, and a newly acquired BSCS. I am on track for a low A in the class. I like academic stuff.)

**What is this course about?** It's in the title: how humans interact with computers. It is multidisciplinary, drawing material from CS, design, and social sciences. UI/UX design is a subset. 

**Things I liked:** 

* **Overall content.** The lectures are a few years old, but still relevant and interesting. Half of the course is going over how humans work and how to [better design for them](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/); the other half is putting that into practice via the [design life cycle](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-hci-life-cycle/).
* **Structure**. You are given a calendar that spells out exactly what to do every week, with precise time estimates. (Estimates are baselined at 10 hours/week; I found that to be roughly accurate, but someone with slow reading/writing speed will take more time.)
* **Individual project.** ~25-page paper plus screenshots and a ~5-minute video of your completed design. Seems like a lot, but seven weeks was plenty of time to complete, and the content does a good job of translating the lectures into actual work that helps the concepts stick. 15% of grade.
* **Tests.** Effectively 150 T/F questions, broken into 30 groups of 5. 2 hours, open-everything. Moderately challenging, but if you've read the assigned material you should be able to Ctrl+F your way to what you don't know, and the questions are generally fair. Midterm and final, each 10% of grade.
* **Instructor communication**. Dr. Joyner is the /r/omscs OG, and it shows. He actively communicates on the course forums, with multi-paragraph responses to student questions. Man's got jokes.
* **Embrace of LLM's.** Instead of ignoring them or banning them, you get guidelines for use and integration into the course. Super happy about this.


**Things I had mixed feelings about**:

* **Homework assignments**. Four assignments, each with four essay questions requiring 1-2 page answers. Some of the questions are well-done and well-thought out. Some are not, and feel like busywork. Homework 4 is particularly criticized as part of it requires you to find four academic papers on your own and discuss how they relate to the course content; I think this assignment is fine and I enjoyed it, but it should probably be standalone. 20% of grade.
* **Class participation.** You get participation credit primarily via peer feedback on other classmates' assignments, posting on the discussion forum, or completing surveys.  This is idiosyncratic to me, but I enjoy teaching and coaching so I liked doing peer feedback. Others skipped the peer feedback and just filled out lots of surveys, which is probably a more efficient use of time. I have this in the mixed category as a lot of the feedback I received was fairly low-quality, and it can be a slog later in the course. 10% of grade. 
* **Readings.** The assigned readings in the first half of the course are generally very good, with no more than two per lesson and the readings being referenced in the lectures. The reading quality tails off significantly in the second half of the course, with more readings assigned that are less well-connected to the content. The two ""Conclusion"" lessons are egregious here, with five academic papers each as ""example research from the field."" One or two would be fine, but ten is overkill, especially since HW4 requires you to find four separate papers on your own. Dr. Joyner decided mid-course to pre-disclose which reading would be tested on each quiz, which helps a lot, but they're all on the test so you still have to read all of them. 
* **Team project**. The team project is a repeat of the individual project, now with a group. In theory this helps you perfect what you've done before and do it in more detail, but in practice it just feels like going through the motions of something you've already done. Add to this the usual group project roulette and I didn't get a lot out of this, but it was relatively painless (albeit I had a good group). 15% of grade.
* **Check-ins.** Both projects require you to turn them in 4 times (at various stages of completion) for peer feedback. Meh. 

**Things I didn't like:**


* **Lecture structure.** The lectures were originally a Udacity-style course (think lots of short 1-5 min videos) that has been cut into sections. Some videos have been added along the way, as well as simple participation exercises.  In general, it works, but now that there are quizzes I think a more structured, explicit approach would be useful (see the section on quizzes).
* **No textbook/primary reference.** Personal preference; I prefer reading to watching, so halfway through the course I ended up reading the transcripts. 
* **Quizzes.** They made the decision this semester to cut back on the previous ten homework assignments and insert four closed-book quizzes in their place, due to ChatGPT. I get why this was done, but the quizzes are pretty stressful. Each quiz is two hours and 5 essay questions, with 4 from the lectures and 1 from a pre-identified reading. You're allowed to answer in bullets, but that didn't help me much as the questions are pretty substantive. My main issue, though, is that the lecture format and the quizzes don't work very well together. Due to the way the short-form videos work, it can be hard sometimes to tell what is a main point, what is a supplementary point, and what is color. This makes it tough to study. Adding to this is a few of the quiz questions, which ask you to respond in multi-paragraph depth to concepts that get only a paragraph of discussion in the lectures. 20% of the grade.
* **Late grading/no return of answers.** For tests/quizzes you get a grade with feedback, but it's often hard to contextualize since the feedback frequently doesn't reference the question or your answer. I understand why it has to be this way, but it makes asking for regrades challenging. 

**5 Tips for Success in HCI:** 

1. Procrastination snowballs hard on you here. You need to do the assignments to help solidify the concepts for the quizzes, and the way the project works requires you to do multiple surveys, which take time to get responses, etc. 
2. Google Docs or LaTeX for assignments. You have to use a custom format (JDF), but it's relatively painless in either GDocs or LaTeX/Overleaf. Not so much in Word.
3. Figma is the ""default"" choice for doing design prototypes and is fine, but I found Balsamiq much easier.  
4. For the tests, downloading all the readings to a folder and using something that can search multiple PDF's is helpful. (I experimented with loading them into an LLM and didn't find it particularly helpful, but future LLM's may do better here.) 
5. For both tests and quizzes, if you have concerns about a question/answer, take a note of it immediately after the test so you can reference it later.

**Overall:** 4/5 stars. Recommended for those who like multidisciplinary things, design, and heavily structured courses (also a great OMSCS intro course imo). Not recommended for those who prefer working only in code, thinking about human/user behavior, or irregular availability.",active,34

In class X, this guy watched Binomial Theorem from this sir. Even after requesting, his parents didn't even exclude Chemistry. That kid knew what was going to happen, he got the highest in Chemistry in ICSE (got 99% or 100%), but he couldn't keep the concepts of Chemistry in his mind. He had to comply even after the rebellion. He got good marks in Physics. Although he liked Maths, he wasn't that good at it.

So... let's shift to first-person pronouns.

Ours was the post-pandemic batch. Our session was completed within 9 months.

\[Making bullet points for easy TL;DR creation by ChatGPT\]

Physics in School:

* There was a teacher who tried to teach, while there was another teacher (let's call her A) who literally said to understand which one's the sin component (vertical) and which one's the cos (horizontal). \[9s1 had a question where the correct answer was W sin theta, I could answer that correctly but I won't forget how the teacher taught us\]
* Our teacher quite literally thought as if we had already studied the chapter. More on A later.

Chemistry in School:

* OK... GOC wasn't taught properly/I didn't have the right guidance at home I guess... I didn't even understand how did they get those absurd whole-number ratios in the 1st chapter of Class 11.
* I tried to self-study Thermodynamics and could only master the Thermodynamics of Physical Chem, not of Physics. Practicals were always fun; except that, I forgot everything about 11th Chem.

Maths in School:

* We had a chill sir who taught us beautifully. But he didn't teach Mathematical Reasoning🥺 it's a CS student's favourite chapter.

Eventually, we got our canon event quite early (because our school used to take revision tests just after finishing a chapter). I don't know if those were haphazard checking or genuine mistakes... but we used to get very low marks. If I compare these low marks to the test frequencies, personally, I used to get overwhelmed. I used to stay up late at night just to TRY to prepare for the next day. Eventually, I became a nocturnal being and I still am a nocturnal being. During this time, I burnt out too (I won't tell you how). After burning out, I just thought:

[Needless to say, I interpreted it in a pessimistic and sarcastic manner.](https://preview.redd.it/s1d9rc8g72vc1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=1eaf201d0d1b4a925a6648c1af5f75bda85211b6)

I just stopped caring for those exams.

My parents were disappointed as usual. I hated their disappointment.

However, I got good marks as usual in English, Bengali and CS.

Science in Tuitions:

* I took a course in Physics Wallah for 6000 rupees. In the orientation classes, all the hollow quotes of motivation were given along with the very useful tip which can make flowers into fruits, is: ""Don't be in a relationship at least during these two years."" BS. Plain BS. They also told us to buy earplugs though, because the distraction could hamper our studies. BUT MY PARENTS - oh my parents, they told me not to use earplugs, because they would apparently LIKE TO LISTEN TO MY LECTURES, like, they also said that if I can't educate my whole locality, then my study is incomplete. What about me? They talked to themselves a bit too much and when I told them to stop, they didn't. Also, my father lectured me to start from the middle, watch the episodes the very day and clear the backlogs simultaneously. Now, I can't do that. I am a VERY lazy individual. If you tell me that I will fail, yes I will fail, yes I want to fail, yes I want to fail so much in life that I want \[REDACTED\]. Ok? Satisfied? \[This is the present me btw\]
* I was admitted to a Science tuition, where Physics, Chem and Maths were all taught. The tutor thought that I would score good marks in these two years as well. After the half-yearly results, I left the tuition.
* There was a coaching centre nearby, where I went to study. It was the first day. The first day. Thermodynamics was being taught. I had that portion already studied by myself. While I was laughing in class along with the others, the teacher saw me and told me that he could see my rectum \[I wasn't covering my mouth while laughing\]. The others laughed even more soundly. Do you know how it felt? If you are a Bengali and read the story Ginni by Tagore (গিন্নি; transliterated: गिन्नि), you'll understand exactly how I felt:

>Then his face and ears became bright red with laughter, the veins on his painful forehead swelled, and his profuse tears could not be stopped.

* I just didn't cry, my ears didn't become red, but I was laughing and the veins on my forehead were...
* It may sound silly, but if I give you the context, you'll understand why.
* That day, my unrequited first love told me that she could go with me to a fair in our school, at... 6 pm. I just couldn't go there because it was the first day of my tuition and my parents gave 10-12 thousand rupees as admission fees. From that day, it just went on like a domino effect. I left the tuition just a few days before the final exams of Class 11.

Only my friends and AMV-making (as a hobby) saved me from the scary world out there. Oh yes, I wrote about most of these in my final term essay. I got 16 out of 20 in that essay.

[I even made an incomplete AMV on this. It's imperfect though.](https://www.reddit.com/r/amv/comments/14676vi/bentovid_rice_contest_giantjupiter_electrophilic/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Day after day, as my grades deteriorated, I subconsciously thought that my unrequited obsession towards that girl was the cause. But I said no always. And I still believe the same, because whenever anything gives you a failure, it gives you experience. I was fiercely protective of my love. When my mother said the stereotypical Bengali racist stuff towards... well, I just told my mother to mind her language.

Also, in the starting days, that girl was harassed online by some classmate of her. I still regret to this day that along with her, I also thought about the boy. I felt like there was some backstory of the boy's own which made him do this. I ensured if she was fine, she indeed was fine and she told me not to worry about her. However, I heard in class that while recollecting the details of the incident in front of the teacher, she burst into tears. I have no idea what, and I don't even want to know.

# Class 12. (Severe feelings of.)

Anyway, I thought I would do everything possible to improve my Class XII progress.

I went to Puri with my parents. There, after having the darshan of Jagannath Temple, I was watching the flag. It was waving high. The air was silent, but the people weren't. It felt quite profound. As I was standing barefoot waiting for my shoes, I had the thought. Silences. Khaamoshiyan. Yes, that's how it all felt. I was doing the AMV as some sort of God's wish... I don't know if it's my own calling, but whatever...

After returning from Puri, just 1 week later, I saw that the three trains collided. I was quite shocked to see that news.

Anyway, as I started doing the AMV, I downloaded the first entry of SciADV (Steins;Gate is a part of this franchise): Chaos;Head NoAH. IT WAS AMAZING, 1000X BETTER THAN DDLC, though I played without the Committee of Zero patch, so I need to replay the game.

Anyway, I came across a scene, which reminded me of a very interesting phenomenon, which I forgot. Then I had flashbacks to Class XI when I couldn't even complete anything except SHM.

Our teacher, Ms. A, explained Coulomb's Law and Electric Fields, in the middle of the year, and literally finished it within a class of 40 minutes (Remember that we had derivations too, and she spent half the time wasting on derivations). It was like a revision class, it wasn't taught like it was in the curriculum.

Everything went on like this, until December. The visual novel was complete, I had to fill in the third stanza of my AMV. Then, my preboards started knocking at the door.

\[Continuing after a 2-hour failed brainwashing of my parents. I feel like crying now. After my board results, my neighbours will get something to judge upon...\]

Physics: We studied under a new teacher, who operates Reddit, (and maybe is seeing the post) who taught us the various parts of magnetism and all, and Ms. A taught us the portion of Electricity. I could understand the former's teaching, but I didn't revise it after returning to my home. I was genuinely burnt out. Ms. A taught us capacitors so beautifully that I realised that series and parallel have different formulae while she was out there making us solve numericals like it was some conscription. I remember my friend being an expert in Electricity and Magnetism. Shoutout to the dude :)

Chemistry: While preparing for the first chapter, I thought that Haloarenes weren't necessary. I omitted that part before going to the revision test. I was wrong, and that backlog served as a cascade effect for my messed up Organic.

Maths: Still Loving You.

One day, I dispersed from my school quite late, because I had some work to do in the Computer Lab. My friend was absent that day. While leaving the school, I saw that the streets were deserted, as if 20 minutes ago, there weren't anyone in that area. There, while going towards the main road, I saw two people coming from the main road to that alleyway. Those two were my unrequited love and someone else: someone who proposed her alongside me. I was genuinely happy, but I knew that my emotional slope during these times were negative, even if the slope was very low. So, I quickly embarked on the autorickshaw and reached my home.

Even after a few days, I saw her, smiling. But after that, when I looked at her, she was angry. She was filled with disgust. Extreme disgust. It was as if her eyes would shoot lasers at me.

When they were talking in a secluded room of the school, I asked them to excuse me and told them to write a farewell note (I knew the waters, so I told them that its optional to write down the note). She didn't write the note, her date did. He has always been friends with me.

Anyway, after a few days, while our farewell photos were being captured, she wasn't angry anymore. She wasn't even looking at me anymore.

My main question the whole life will be: why. Why did she do that?

During my preboards, I was very much overwhelmed.  I was so overwhelmed before the night of my Chemistry exams that I thought of \[REDACTED\]. I just studied Organic Chem however I could. I couldn't touch anything else. Also, my mother tore the pages of the book for no reason.

The result? 19/70 in Physics and 20/70 in Chemistry.

I finished my AMV on Jan 9.

I posted it in a competition.

From then on, I felt a sense of insecurity. I felt hyperventilated. I created an alt account to vocalize my struggles (I will only share it through DMs).

I got a few virtual people by me.

I took JEE during this time. In the 1st attempt, got 67th percentile in total, having 85th percentile in maths. In this attempt, I just answered 12 questions, so I don't expect much. The main thing is I didn't even revise anything before taking any of the attempts.

One day, while enduring that hell, I had a dream. A dream where she was with her friends. Mountainside, parking lot jutting out of the mountain, 8:00 pm, the light was falling on them. I was going from the dark to the light side. She was happy seeing me, she hugged me.

When I woke up, it was all an illusion. I realised that she's in a relationship with someone else, I shouldn't have such thoughts. But mind is something complex in itself :). It felt like a story of pity and tragedy.

I was really scared of my parents. I wanted to escape. I do want to escape.

NO, I DON'T WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE REALITY, I DON'T WANT TO HAVE COMMON SENSE, I DON'T WANT STORIES WITH MORAL LESSONS.

I can say that I have survived the ordeal. I somehow took my Boards.

I don't care if I get 1% or 100%, I have the fear that because of my screams towards my parents, the neighbours will get a scope. They'll judge me blatantly.

And I am not even sure of which degree to pursue upon.",active,10

1c77pp1,1,2024-04-18,Leveraging ChatGPT for Enhanced Data Analysis and Reporting in Various Sectors,u/cporter202,ChatGPTautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTautomation/comments/1c77pp1/leveraging_chatgpt_for_enhanced_data_analysis_and/,"As we continue to witness the rise of sophisticated AI tools, there's been significant buzz around OpenAI's ChatGPT and its potential applications. One area where ChatGPT seems particularly poised for impact is in the field of data analysis and reporting across different sectors. 

The power of ChatGPT lies in its language comprehension and generation abilities. This means it can understand complex data insights and communicate them in a simple, human-like manner. For analysts, this can be a game-changer in how they convey data outcomes to decision-makers who may not be well-versed in technical jargon.

Let's dive into some sectors and discuss how ChatGPT can be a catalyst for enhanced data analysis and reporting:

**Finance:** In banking and finance, ChatGPT can analyze trends and generate reports that forecast market movements, helping analysts make informed decisions and provide strategic advice to clients using easily digestible language.

**Healthcare:** By processing medical data, ChatGPT can assist in developing comprehensive reports that summarize patient information, treatment outcomes, or public health trends, supporting healthcare professionals in making patient-centered decisions.

**Retail:** ChatGPT can help retailers understand customer behavior by analyzing transaction data, customer feedback, and market trends, creating reports that assist in inventory planning, marketing strategies, and overall business growth.

**Education:** Educational institutions can benefit from ChatGPT by analyzing student performance data and feedback to generate reports that could enhance curricula and teaching methodologies.

**Government:** Public sector agencies can employ ChatGPT to analyze large volumes of public data, creating reports that inform policy-making, resource allocation, and public services enhancement.

For data analysts, introducing ChatGPT into their toolbox could mean spending less time on generating reports and more time on strategic analysis. This shift could lead to more insightful, action-oriented discussions within organizations and a stronger data-driven culture.

However, integration of ChatGPT for these purposes must be deliberate and ethical, ensuring clear privacy guidelines and accuracy checks are in place. Embracing such AI tools can lead us to a future where data is not just crunched but is also communicated and leveraged in the most effective ways across sectors.

1cc0djt,56,2024-04-24,I had the BEST semester ever except for one student. How was yours?,u/TheMormyrid4,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1cc0djt/i_had_the_best_semester_ever_except_for_one/,"**The Good:** 

I teach two classes because I get credits for research/publishing. This semester, I taught an upper-level creative writing course. It only had six students, which made for amazing class discussions and workshops. Let me tell you, these students were PASSIONATE about their work and about providing feedback. We often accidentally went over time, which is difficult to do in a 3-hour class. Sometimes, the students would ask to come to my office after in order to continue discussing their writing. It was just an amazing vibe, and it was a pleasure to teach such motivated, talented students.   


I also taught an English comp class. Usually, these classes are a bit difficult as students are required to take them and most don't want to be there. I had eight students. Seven of them took the class seriously. They gave it their all and produced thought-provoking work which we workshopped in class. I encouraged them all to find their voice when it came to composition, and they sure as hell did so. The class ended last week, and I've received emails from most of them thanking me and telling me my class was their favorite and that they learned about themselves in addition to learning about writing.   


**The Bad:**   


That English comp class had ONE bad apple. This student spent the entirety of the semester handing in ChatGPT-generated work. I've posted here a few times about him. I ended up going through the whole process of meeting with the student multiple times, submitting my decision to the dean, etc. I finally got proof when he began an essay with ""Although I cannot experience emotions, I can understand how this essay might elicit sympathy in readers"". His midterm writing in class was atrocious.  


Anyway, the student has appealed my decision and has continued to submit ChatGPT-generated work (?????). He also did his final oral presentation on the dangers of AI in education (???????). I'm still waiting for our meeting with the appeals committee.

1cc6nff,63,2024-04-24,Deflection? Are We Always the Problem Now?,u/Avid-Reader-1984,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1cc6nff/deflection_are_we_always_the_problem_now/,"I'm going to paraphrase the response and my assignment:

Basically, in several literature courses, a good 20% of the class was using ChatGPT for everything, a good 60% of the students were rephrasing banal themes from lit cheat sites, and the rest were making an honest attempt with their own thoughts and responses.  
In ten years, this has been a radical change in how students approach my gen-ed literature course that is both accessible, and dare I say, fun-ish. Well, fun if you can enjoy reading, but I definitely find ways to update and create engagement points even for those less than thrilling nineteenth century selections. 

No matter what I did in class, I had limited engagement and limited responses, even from the twenty percent who seemed to be engaging the material. I'm not even kidding by stating that I don't think some of my students even know what my face looks like because they stared at the computer screen all semester (I have an electronics policy, but it was like yelling into a void; they literally could not stay away from their screens no matter how many points they lost). And yes, it was really awkward to have designed a hands-on group activity that required moving, but about 15% of the class would stay put and click away on their computers. I will say about the 20% who engaged me----wow, totally blown away by the work they did. I really needed those students this semester to even continue to accurately gauge my own reality (yes, see, I did instruct them in this; yes, I did review that; yes, some students appreciate and understand these activities).

So, at the end of the semester, I was done. Their last assignment was to tell me what they learned. Simple enough. As an introduction to the assignment, I noted the effort I put in to engage *them*. (I'm paraphrasing for brevity. It was not aggressive or pointed and was phrased as more like a, ""let's review what we did this semester,"" introduction to the instructions, but, if you're adept at reading you would understand that I was trying to emphasize just how much I did *for them*. Side note: a good way to get ahead of any accusations of ""but you didn't teach me that."")

I clicked on the assignment to read the first one, and I am floored, not by the way that the student turned their failure back on me, but the way they described it. The student went on at length about something that can be summarized as:

It would be easier to learn if so many professors did not lose their passion. They should be ashamed of the way they have failed the current generation. I think it's obvious that none of my professors care, and so I don't either. 

I have never worked harder in my career. I have never had to create so many engagement points in a course. Or spend so much time creating multiple ways to participate because a group of students can't hold a discussion, anymore. (And, sorry if this is you, but I don't think a successful discussion is the same four students participating all semester. Don't even get me started on calling on students.) Of course, I can't see myself from an outsider's perspective, but I don't think that I could have cared more. And I made that clear to them. And still...that was the response I received. 

This is gaslighting, right? Or, are we the reason that these students can't even bother with us, anymore? How many of you are just cashing that sweet professor pay for all that uncompensated work? :)",active,65
1cdv76m,3,2024-04-26,"Regarding the new ""memories"" feature in ChatGPT Plus subscription",u/supulton,OpenAI,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1cdv76m/regarding_the_new_memories_feature_in_chatgpt/,"ChatGPT just rolled out this new memories feature: [https://openai.com/blog/memory-and-new-controls-for-chatgpt](https://openai.com/blog/memory-and-new-controls-for-chatgpt)

As you chat with ChatGPT, you can ask it to remember something  specific or let it pick up details itself. ChatGPT’s memory will get  better the more you use it and you'll start to notice the improvements  over time. For example: 

* You’ve explained that you prefer  meeting notes to have headlines, bullets and action items summarized at  the bottom. ChatGPT remembers this and recaps meetings this way.
* You’ve  told ChatGPT you own a neighborhood coffee shop. When brainstorming  messaging for a social post celebrating a new location, ChatGPT knows  where to start. 
* You mention that you have a toddler and that  she loves jellyfish. When you ask ChatGPT to help create her birthday  card, it suggests a jellyfish wearing a party hat. 
* As a  kindergarten teacher with 25 students, you prefer 50-minute lessons with  follow-up activities. ChatGPT remembers this when helping you create  lesson plans.

How do you guys think it is implemented? I would imagine it does something like:

\- Recognizes certain prompts as ""memory instructions"" and decides to keep these as ""long term memories""

\- Uses Vectorized embeddings to store chunks of memory instructions into ""long term memories"".  
\- Keeps these ""memory"" instructions within the short-term context window by periodically re-inserting the instruction into the conversation when the context window length would be exceeded (i.e. when the model is close to ""forgetting"").

I am implementing an openai wrapper (with function calling support) and I currently use truncation / summarization to manage the context window. I am curious about integrating a pseudo-long term memory feature into my own code + periodically re-insert these ""memory instructions"" into recent conversation context, but as I only use Chat Completion streams, I would need a total refactor if embeddings were at play (and I also have heard that OpenAI embedding can be very expensive compared to local LLM embeddings which I also play around with).

USE IT!,u/auggee88,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1ceiyb1/ai_is_an_amazing_tool_to_make_your_dayslife/,"For a teacher, AI is amazing. It has freed up so much of my time that I am now able to complete all of my responsibilities, plus some, during the school day. No more taking home papers to grade, making lessons, etc, while my wife is all pissed because we have a 9 month old, and it falls on her. It has improved work and home life. I don't know why more teachers aren't using it. Students use it, so should we.

High School Soc. St. Teacher -- I have been using ChatGPT and Google Bard/Gemini for the last 1.5 years-ish. There's so many others, but these are the only two that I found that I've needed. I've created lessons, projects, assignments, readings, rubrics (this is the best because I hate making those fucking things), emails to co workers, emails to parents, revamped our schools graduation project and was put in charge of that with a raise :) , etc. 

I also experimented with grading a students written work with a rubric and then running it through chatgpt with the rubric, and it was only off from what I got, in the student's favor, by one or two points consistently. There's potential there.


P.S. to all those reading this: It's all about the prompts that you give it. You'll usually have to refine whatever it gives you with another prompt ""redo above but add/change........"" May seem annoying but something that used to take a half hour is now less than 5 mins. Also, pre-loading some styles/work/emails/lessons/whatever gives it a better idea and makes it seem more ""authentic."" 

Also ChatGPT is better quality IMO but only goes to 2022 I think, but Google Gemini is real time. Example: for my Current Events class after Oct 7th, I had it come up with a summary of events and a bulleted history of Israel/Palestine history that I printed out as an overview and history. ChatGPT wouldn't be able to give a current summary.",User_deleted,0
