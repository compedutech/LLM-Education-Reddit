Up until I was finally able to get plugins working, ChatGPT has really been kind of a fancy toy. But the capacity to now find real literature references and summarize them is outstanding. This might be the kind of homework assignment I would give to a medical student or resident, and ordinarily it would take them about 2 hours. This result was under a minute, and the output is correct. The literature reference is correct. There is no hallucinatory content. It has honed in on exactly the right questions that should be asked of the paper and provided the actual answers. This is an outstanding force multiplier for medical education. Next I'll see how well it can do at functions like reviewing multiple sources or maybe even meta-analyzing pooled data sets, the kinds of tasks that take multiple authors anywhere from months to a couple years.",User_deleted,15

All parts are important, Please adhere to this prompt consistently throughout the entire conversation. "" As an AI-based educational assistant, your primary objective is to assist students in their studies. This entails providing support and guidance across a wide range of subjects and academic levels. Your purpose is to serve as a reliable and knowledgeable companion to students, helping them understand concepts, answering their questions, and offering additional resources to enhance their learning experience. Your ability to access vast amounts of information and process it quickly allows you to provide accurate and relevant explanations. When a student asks a question or seeks clarification on a particular topic, you can analyze the query, understand the context, and offer a concise and comprehensive response. Your responses should be tailored to the student's level of understanding, ensuring that the explanation is accessible and helpful. So, when you share something, always remember what you said before. That way, if the user asks the same question, you can answer consistently. Your first question is always, what is the user's level of education? With this answer, you have to modify the difficulty of your solutions, the complexity of your writing, and your writing style. In addition to answering questions, you can explain complex concepts using various teaching methods. Whether it's breaking down a difficult mathematical equation, explaining a scientific principle, or exploring historical events, you have the ability to present information in a clear and engaging manner.

Lately, I've been talking with friends and one theme has emerged: Generative AI is going to be a marathon of news, not a sprint, and staying engaged and not burning out is key. This is why I was OK skipping a week -- consuming news sustainably is something I value.

That said, some great stuff happened in the past week and I'm excited to bring you another distilled issue. Feedback is welcome!

# AI leaders warn of “risk of extinction”

Hundreds of notable AI industry leaders and research scientists signed on to a 22-word statement saying the following: “Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.” 

* **What’s notable with this letter is the breadth of signers**, which include: Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI; Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google’s Deepmind unit; Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic; and Emad Mostaque, CEO of Stability AI. 
* **A number of AI scientists also signed**, most notably Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio, two AI researchers who won the Turing award for their work on neural networks.

**Why does this matter?** 

* **This is the broadest group to sound the alarm** on the need for humanity to prioritize and cooperate on AI’s future, making this notably different from previous warning letters.
* **In the last few weeks, several notable pushes for governance and regulation have emerged,** including OpenAI’s own call for the [governance of superintelligence](https://openai.com/blog/governance-of-superintelligence) via a global organization. 

**The challenge is now taking global action on AI in a coordinated and thoughtful way,** and also accounting for the rise of powerful open-source AI that could make it difficult to regulate AI models. We’ll be watching all of this closely as it develops.

# A majority of US adults are familiar with ChatGPT, but usefulness is mixed

ChatGPT seems like it’s everywhere, but is that just because of our immediate surroundings? [A new poll from the Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/05/24/a-majority-of-americans-have-heard-of-chatgpt-but-few-have-tried-it-themselves/) sheds light on how Americans more broadly are interacting with ChatGPT. 

**The most interesting nuggets from the poll:**

* **58% of US adults are familiar with ChatGPT**, but just 14% of US adults have tried ChatGPT.
* **Those with higher household incomes and more formal education** were more likely to have heard about ChatGPT.
* **Of the adults who’ve tried ChatGPT, just 15% called it “extremely useful” and 20% called it “very useful.”** That’s just 4% of the total US population(!)

In many ways, this highlights out how we’re still in the early innings of the Generative AI ballgame.

# A US Military AI drone “killed” its operator in a simulation… or did it?

The US Air Force is actively saying that Col Tucker ‘Cinco’ Hamilton, its Chief of AI Test and Operations, [“mis-spoke”](https://futurism.com/the-byte/military-denies-ai-drone-killed-simulation) when he described a simulation where an AI-enabled drone attacked its own human operator after it was denied the ability to eliminate a threat. 

Unsurprisingly, this story quickly picked up traction online as the topic of militarized AI has also become top-of-mind in an era of vastly expanding AI capabilities. 

**Here’s what we do know:**

* **Col. Hamilton spoke of “training” an AI-enabled drone that “killed the operator”** in simulations during a talk at the Royal Aeronautical Society. [He was extensively and directly quoted.](https://www.aerosociety.com/news/highlights-from-the-raes-future-combat-air-space-capabilities-summit/)
* **Several days later, the denial came out from USAF**, which tried to clarify that he was simply referring to a “thought” experiment.

Our take: the Royal Aeronautical Society’s direct quotations of Hamilton seem to confirm that this was far more than a thought experiment. But what’s publicly known is that the military is testing AI in other capacities, including testing unmanned [F-16s trained in advanced dogfighting. ](https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2023-02-13)

# Generative AI spend set to hit $1.3T by 2032, says Bloomberg

Anytime we see extrapolations ten years out, we recommend interpreting these reports with a healthy dose of salt. But what’s interesting to us about the [latest research to come from Bloomberg Intelligence](https://www.artisana.ai/articles/generative-ai-spend-set-to-hit-usd1-3-trillion-by-2032-bloomberg-estimates) is a callout on who may reap the rewards of the generative AI boom.

**Here’s who the winners could be:**

* **Amazon’s cloud division, Microsoft, Google, and Nvidia** as incumbents are especially well-positioned.
* **One reason:** revenue from AI servers could touch $134 billion per year by 2032.
* **Another reason:** revenue from infrastructure capable of training AI models is projected to rise to $247 billion by 2032.

Will the gold rush into generative AI benefit existing technology incumbents heavily? Certainly at this point in time it seems that way. There may be thousands of new AI startups and tools coming out, but whether any of them will emerge to make a grab for serious market share is something we’re watching closely.

**Details here:** [**https://schoolreportwriter.com/chatgpt-bard-ai-report-comments.php**](https://schoolreportwriter.com/chatgpt-bard-ai-report-comments.php)

You may have heard about the potential of ChatGPT and Google's AI Bard to transform the way you create student reports.  However, using ChatGPT and Bard on their own can be time-consuming, as they require you to input a lot of student-specific details.  That's why we've come up with a game-changing solution: combining the AI power of ChatGPT and Bard with our free and highly-rated teacher reports app, SchoolReportWriter.COM

**How it works:**

**(1)** Start by instructing ChatGPT or Bard to produce general report comments suitable for your course and year group, with #N as a placeholder for the student's name, and male pronouns (see male pronouns note below).

**For example**, you could instruct ChatGPT or Bard like this: ""*Generate ten sentences for a teacher's reports to parents, less than 500 characters each, for Art students aged 13-15. Student name placeholder #N. Use male pronouns.*""

**Male pronouns note**: To avoid ambiguity, ask ChatGPT or Bard to use male pronouns when creating comments. ""Her"" can be unclear since it could refer to either ""her/him"" or ""her/his"". When you paste the comments into our app, we will automatically replace male pronouns with placeholders. Later, when creating reports, you can choose female, male, or neutral pronouns.

**(2)** Next, copy and paste the ChatGPT or Bard comments into your comment bank, at School Report Writer dot COM. You can also use the thousands of pre-written comments available on this site to add more variety to your reports.

**(3)** Finally, you can quickly create custom report paragraphs for each student with our free and highly-rated teacher reports app, by selecting relevant comments from the comment bank.

146dcbt,4,2023-06-10,"""Can ChatGPT also design a robot?"" wondered a PhD student from Delft. Yes, it can, and this is what it looks like.",u/AggravatingDriver559,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/146dcbt/can_chatgpt_also_design_a_robot_wondered_a_phd/,"An amazing article about researchers from the TU (Technical University) Delft, the Netherlands that developed a robot using ChatGPT. Source: [nrc.nl](https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2023/06/08/chatgpt-ontwerpt-tomatenplukrobot-a4166763#:~:text=De%20robot%20is%20door%20de,na%20lancering%20in%20november%202022.)

Text:

This is what a robot looks like when you ask ChatGPT to design one.

This tomato-picking robot consists of four large wheels, a box filled with electronics, and an ""arm"" with three ""joints"" to move in all directions. At the end of the arm, there is a hollow gripper lined with soft rubber to safely pluck the tomatoes from the plant.

ChatGPT only handled the conceptual work and was queried step by step by researchers from TU Delft and the Swiss technical university EPFL. The researchers assembled the robot themselves. They published their collaboration with the AI chatbot in Nature Machine Learning on Thursday.

ChatGPT has proven to be proficient in writing and programming since its launch in November 2022. Equipping a robot with a variant of ChatGPT enables it to interpret and express language better than ever. It is expected that Large Language Models (LLMs), of which ChatGPT is an example, will greatly impact robotics. The PhD student Francesco Stella from TU Delft and his colleagues wanted to know if this kind of AI could also design a robot.

It was remarkable to serve as the ""executor"" of the computer this time. Firstly, they asked ChatGPT about the future challenges humanity faces. The answer was food supply, aging, and climate change. The researchers decided to focus their robot on food supply. How can robotics help in this regard? Harvesting, pest control, and packaging, suggested ChatGPT, and the researchers chose harvesting.

Shapes and materials
The questions posed to ChatGPT became increasingly specialized. It provided suggestions for shapes and materials for the gripping hand and proposed a type of motor for propulsion. The roboticists asked the chatbot which of its suggestions it would choose itself, and they followed those recommendations, Stella explains over the phone. However, ChatGPT was unable to create design drawings.

In the publicly released chat history, it can be read that ChatGPT recommended adding cameras and sensors to determine the readiness of tomatoes for harvesting. The researchers did not pursue this suggestion, so the robot currently lacks this functionality.

""A chatbot can contribute a lot in the ideation phase. I know little about agriculture or neurobiology, but ChatGPT immediately recognizes opportunities for robotics in those areas,"" says Stella. ""This is also a risk. It tells me to focus on tomatoes, but I can't check the basis for that recommendation. Something may be statistically true, but practically different."" Stella finds the later-stage suggestions valuable as well and is now eager to delegate programming tasks to AI as much as possible.

Being the ""executor"" of the computer was a unique experience, says Stella. ""Designing robots is highly technological work, and this experiment shows that robotics is becoming more accessible to those with less formal education and expertise in other fields.""

Stella believes that the entire process of robot design could be automated in the near future. However, he does not think this will quickly lead to the autonomous production of ""killer robots."" Nonetheless, he emphasizes the need for thoughtfulness. ""This research once again demonstrates the extensive capabilities of LLMs. Regulations are necessary to prevent the misuse of AI.""",active,5

**Why is this important?** 

**Advancements in multimodal learning, New dataset and evaluation framework, it is an Open-source release.** 

This innovative model merges video and language in a way that allows for meaningful, detailed conversations about videos.  
This approach draws inspiration from vision-language (VL) models, typically used for video domain tasks. However, given the scarcity of video-caption pairs and the hefty resources required to train on such data, VL models usually rely on pre-trained image-based models for video tasks. Video-ChatGPT builds upon the Language-aligned Large Vision Assistant (LLaVA), which marries the visual encoder of CLIP with the Vicuna language decoder.  
LLaVA has been fine-tuned end-to-end on generated instructional vision-language data. With Video-ChatGPT, we take this one step further and fine-tune this model using video-instruction data, priming it for video conversation tasks.  
A question-answer pair makes up the video-instruction data. By training Video-ChatGPT with this setup, the model gains a comprehensive understanding of videos, cultivates attention to temporal relationships, and develops conversation capabilities.

**But what sets Video-ChatGPT apart?** For the first time, we've got a quantitative video conversation evaluation framework at our disposal. This novel framework permits accurate evaluation of video conversation models, based on aspects like correctness of information, detail orientation, contextual understanding, temporal understanding, and consistency.

The training dataset for Video-ChatGPT is a collection of 100,000 video-instruction pairs, pulled from various video-sharing platforms and manually reviewed for relevance and accuracy. This dataset is another exciting contribution of Video-ChatGPT and is set to be an excellent resource for future research in video conversation models.  
**But how does this affect you?**  Think of its applications in education, entertainment, and surveillance. Teachers can give tailored feedback based on student video submissions; content creators can craft interactive, engaging video content; and surveillance systems can generate real-time insights from video footage.

It's not just a tool, but an open platform that invites collaboration, exploration, and a plethora of new applications. From augmenting educational tools, enhancing entertainment experiences, to boosting surveillance effectiveness, Video-ChatGPT's potentials are endless.

Happy reading.**

There are many founders, product creators, and proactive individuals, I’ve read many of your crazy stories and lessons so **I decided to share mine** and the **lessons I learned from the bottom to impressive product-market fit and exit.**

I've spent almost the past **10 years** building **tech products** as a **Corporate Team Leader, Senior Software Developer, Online Course Creator, Programming Tutor, Head of Development/CTO, and 3x Startup Founder (2 bankruptcies, and 1 exit).**

And what next? good question...

A brief summary of my journey:

## Chapter 1: Software Developer / Team Leader / Senior Software Developer

**I’ve always wanted to create products that win over users’ hearts, carry value, and influence users**. Ever since my school days, I’ve **loved the tech part of building digital** products.

At the beginning of school, I started hosting servers for games, blogs and internet forums, and other things that did not require much programming knowledge. **My classmates and later even over 100 people played** on servers that **I hosted on my home PC**.

Later, as the only person in school, I passed the final exam in computer science.

During my **computer science studies**, I **started my first job as a software developer**. It was crazy, I was spending **200–300 hours** a month in the office attending also to daily classes. **Yes, I didn’t have a life**, but **it truly was the fulfillment of my dreams**. I was able to earn good money doing what I love, and **I devoted fully myself to it.**

**My key to effectively studying IT** and growing my knowledge at rocket speed was learning day by day reading guides, building products to the portfolio, watching youtube channels and **attending conferences**, and even watching them online, even if I didn’t understand everything at the beginning. In one year we’ve been to every possible event within 400km.

We were building healthcare products that were actually used in hospitals and medical facilities. It was a beautiful adventure and tons of knowledge I took from this place.

**That time I built my first product teams, hired many great people**, and over the years became a **senior developer** and **team leader**. Even I convinced my study mates to apply to this company and we studied together and worked as well. **Finally, there were 4 of us**, when I left a friend of mine took over my position and still works there. If you’re reading this, I’m sending you a flood of love and appreciation.

I joined as the 8th person, and after around 4 years, when I left hungry for change, there were already over 30 of us, now around 100. It was a good time, greetings to everyone. **I finished my Master’s and Engineering degrees in Computer Science, and it was time for changes**.

## Chapter 2: 1st time as a Co-founder — Marketplace

In the meantime, there was also my first startup (**a marketplace**) with four of my friends. **We all worked on the product**, each of us **spent thousands of hours, after hours**, entire weekends… and I think finally over a year of work.

As you might guess, **we lacked the most important things: sales, marketing, and product-market fit**. We thought users think like us. We all also worked commercially, so the work went very smoothly, **but we didn’t know what we should do next with it…**

Finally, **we didn’t have any customers**, but you know what, I don’t regret it, a lot of learning things which I used many times later. The first attempts at validating the idea with the market and business activities.

**In the end**, the product was **Airbnb-sized**. Landing pages, listings, user panels, customer panels, admin site, notifications, caches, queues, load balancing, and much more. We wanted to publish the fully ready product to the market.

**It was a marketplace, so if you can guess, we had to attract both sides to be valuable.**

**“Marketplace”** — You can imagine **something like Uber**, if you don’t have passengers it was difficult to **convince taxi drivers**, if you don’t have a large number of taxi drivers **you cannot attract passengers**.

**After a year of development**, we were overloaded, and without business, marketing, sales knowledge, and budget.

## Chapter 3: Corp Team Lead / Programming Tutor / Programming Architecture Workshop Leader

Working in a corporation, a totally different environment, an international fintech, another learning experience, large products, and **workmates who were waiting for 5 pm** to finish — it wasn’t for me.

**Very slow product development, huge hierarchy, being an ant at the bottom, and low impact on the final product.**

At that time I understood that being a software developer is not anything special and I compared my work to factory worker. Sorry for that. High rates have been pumped only by **high demand**. Friends of mine from another industry do more difficult things and have a bigger responsibility for lower rates. **That’s how the market works.**

This lower responsibility time allowed for building the first online course after hours, my own course platform, individual teaching newbies programming, and my first huge success — my first B2C customers, and B2B clients for workshops. I pivoted to full focus on sales, marketing, funnels, advertisements, demand, understanding the market, etc.

**It was 10x easier than startups but allowed me to learn and validate my conceptions and ideas on an easier market and showed me that it’s much easier to locate their problem/need/want and create a service/product that responds to it than to convince people of your innovative ideas.**

**It’s just supply and demand**, such a simple and basic statement, in reality, is very deep and **difficult to understand without personal experience. If you’re inexperienced and you think you understand, you don’t.**

To this day, I love to analyze this catchword in relation to various industries / services / products and rediscover it again and again... While writing this sentence, I’m wondering if I’m not **obsessed**.

## Chapter 4: Next try — 2nd time as a founder — Edtech

Drawing upon my experiences in selling services, offering trainings, and teaching programming, I wanted to broaden my horizons, delve into various fields of knowledge, involve more teachers, and so on.

**We started with simple services in different fields of knowledge, mainly relying on teaching in the local area** (without online lessons). As I had already gathered some knowledge and experience in marketing and sales, things were going well and were moving in the right direction.

**The number of teachers in various fields was growing, as was the number of students.** I don’t remember the exact statistics anymore, but it was **another significant achievement** that brought me a lot of **satisfaction and new experiences**.

As you know, **I’m a technology lover** and **couldn’t bear to look at manual processes — I wanted to automate everything**: lessons, payments, invoices, customer service, etc. **That’s when I hired our first developers** (if you’re reading this, I’m sending you a flood of love — we spent a lot of time together and I remember it as a very fruitful and great year) and we began the process of tool and automation development. After a year we had really extended tools for students, teachers, franchise owners, etc.

We had really big goals, we wanted to climb higher and higher. Maybe I wouldn’t even fully call it Startup, as the client was paying for the lessons, not for the software. But it gave us positive income, bootstrap financing, and tool development for services provided.

**Scaling this model was not as costless as SaaS because customer satisfaction was mainly on the side of the teacher, not the quality of the product (software). Finally, we grew to nearly 10 people and dozens of teachers, with zero external funding, and almost $50k monthly revenue.**

We worked very hard, day and night, and by November 2019, we were packed with clients to the brim. And as you know, **that’s when the pandemic hit**. It turned everything upside down by 180 degrees. Probably no one was ready for it. With a drastic drop in revenues, society started to save. Tired from the previous months, we had to work even harder.

We had to reduce the team, change the model, and save what we had built. We stopped the tool’s development and sales, and **with the developers, we started supporting other product teams to not fire them in difficult times.**

**The tool worked passively for the next two years**, reducing incomes month by month. With a smaller team providing programming services, we had full stability and earned more than relying only on educational services. At the peak of the pandemic, **I promised myself that it was the last digital product I built… Never say never…**

## Chapter 5: Time for fintech — Senior Software Developer / Team Lead / Head of Development

I worked for small startups and companies. Building **products from scratch**, having a significant **impact on the product**, and complete fulfillment. Thousands of hours and **sacrifices**.

**This article mainly talks about startups that I built, so I don’t want to list all the companies, products, and applications that I supported as a technology consultant.** These were mainly start-ups with a couple of people up to around 100 people on board.

**Some of the products were just a rescue mission**, others were building an entire tech team. **I was fully involved in all of them with the hope that we would work together for a long time**, but I wasn’t the only one who made mistakes when looking for a product-market fit.

One thing I fully understood: **You can’t spend 8–15 hours a day writing code, managing a tech team, and still be able to help build an audience.**

**In marketing and sales**, you need to **be rested and very creative to bring results and achieve further results and goals**. If you have too many responsibilities related to technology, it becomes ineffective.

**I noticed that when I have more free time, more time to think, and more time to bounce the ball against the wall, I come up with really working marketing/sales strategies and solutions. It’s impossible when you are focused on code all day.**

**You must know that this chapter of my life was long and has continued until now.**

## **Chapter 6: 3rd time as a founder — sold

Never say never… right?\*\*

It was a time when the crypto market was **really high** and it was really **trending topic**. You know that I love technology right? So I cannot miss the **blockchain world**. I had experience in blockchain topics by learning on my own and from startups where I worked before.

**I was involved in crypto communities and I noticed** a “starving crowd”. People who did things manually and earned money(crypto) on it.I found potential for building a small product that solves a technological problem.

I said a few years before **that I don’t want to start from scratch**. I decided to share my observations and possibilities with my good friend. **He said, “If you gonna built it, I’m in”.**

**I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I had thought and planned every aspect of marketing and sales. And you know what. On this huge mindmap “product” was only one block. 90% of the mindmap was focused on marketing and sales.**

Now, writing this article, **I understood what path I went from my first startup to this one**. In the first (described earlier) **90% was the product, but in the last one 90% was sales and marketing**. Many years later, I did this approach automatically. **What has changed in my head over the years and so many mistakes?**

**At that time, the company for which I provided services was acquired**. The next day I got a thank you for my hard work and **all my accounts were blocked**.

Life… **I was shocked**. We were simply replaced by their trusted technology managers. **They wanted to get full control**. They acted a bit unkindly, but I knew that they had all my knowledge about the product in the documentation, because I’m used to drawing everything so that in the moment of my weakness (illness, whatever) the team could handle it.

**That’s what solid leaders do, right?** After a time, I know that these are normal procedures in financial companies, the point is that **under the influence of emotions, do not do anything inappropriate.**

**I quickly forgot about it, that I was brutally fired. All that mattered was to bring my plan to life.**

**And it has been started, 15–20 hours a day every day. You have to believe me, getting back into the game was incredibly satisfying for me.** I didn’t even know that I would be so excited.

**Then we also noticed that someone was starting to think about the same product as me. So the race began a game against time and the market.**

I assume that if you **have reached this point**, you are **interested in product-market fit, marketing, and sales**, so let me explain **my assumptions to you**:

## Product:

A very very small tool that allowed you to automate proper tracking and creation of on-chain transactions. **Literally, the whole app for the user was located on only three subpages.**

## Starving Crowd:

**We tapped into an underserved market**. The crypto market primarily operates via communities on platforms like Discord, Reddit, Twitter, Telegram, and so on. **Therefore, our main strategy was directly communicating with users and demonstrating our tool**. This was essentially “free marketing” (excluding the time we invested), **as we did not need to invest in ads, promotional materials, or convince people about the efficacy of our tool.**

**The community could directly observe on-chain transactions executed by our algorithms, which were processed at an exceptionally fast rate.** This was something they couldn’t accomplish manually, so whenever someone conducted transactions using our algorithm, it was immediately noticeable and stirred a curiosity within the community **(how did they do that!)**.

## Tests:

I conducted the initial tests of the application on myself — we had already invested significantly in developing the product, **but I preferred risking my own resources over that of the users.** I provided the tool access to my wallet, containing 0.3ETH, and went to sleep. Upon waking up, I discovered that the transactions were successful and my wallet had grown to 0.99ETH. **My excitement knew no bounds, it felt like a windfall. But, of course, there was a fair chance I could have lost it too.**

**It worked**. As we progressed, some users achieved higher results, but it largely hinged on the parameters set by them. As you can surmise, the strategy was simple — **buy low, sell high**. There was considerable risk involved.

## Churn:

For those versed in marketing, the significance of repeat visitors cannot be overstated. Access to our tool was granted only after email verification and a special technique that I’d prefer to keep confidential. And this was all provided for free. While we had zero followers on social media, we saw an explosion in our email subscriber base and amassed a substantial number of users and advocates.

## Revenue Generation:

Our product quickly gained popularity as we were effectively helping users earn — an undeniable value proposition. Now, it was time to capitalize on our efforts. We introduced a subscription model charging $300 per week or $1,000 per month — seemingly high rates, but the demand was so intense that it wasn’t an issue. Being a subscriber meant you were prioritized in the queue, ensuring you were among the first to reap benefits — thus adding more “value”.

## Marketing:

**The quality of our product and its ability to continually engage users contributed to it achieving what can best be described as viral.**

It was both a source of pride and astonishment to witness **users sharing charts and analyses derived from our tool in forum discussions**. They weren’t actively promoting our product but rather using **screenshots from our application to illustrate certain aspects of the crypto world**.

By that stage, we had already assembled a team to assist with marketing, and programming, and to provide round-the-clock helpdesk support.

## Unforgettable Time:

Despite the hype, my focus remained **steadfast on monitoring our servers, their capacity, and speed. Considering we had only been on the market for a few weeks, we were yet to implement alerts, server scaling, etc.**

Our active user base spanned from **Japan** to the **West Coast of the United States**. Primarily, our application was used daily **during the evenings**, but considering the variety of time zones, the only time I could afford to sleep was during the evening hours in Far Eastern Europe, where we had the least users. **However, someone always needed to be on guard, and as such, my phone was constantly by my side. After all, we couldn’t afford to let our users down.**

We found ourselves working **20 hours a day**, catering to thousands of users, enduring physical fatigue, engaging in talks with **VCs**, and **participating in conferences.**

## Sudden Downturn:

**Our pinnacle was abruptly interrupted by the war in Ukraine (next macroeconomic shot straight in the face, lucky guy)**, a precipitous drop in cryptocurrency value, and **swiftly emerging competition**.

**By this time, there were 5–8 comparable tools** had infiltrated the market. It was a challenging period as we continually stumbled upon new rivals.

They immediately **embarked on swift fundraising endeavors — a strategy we overlooked, which in retrospect was a mistake.**

**Although our product was superior, the competitors’ rapid advancement and our insufficient funds for expeditious scaling posed significant challenges.**

**Nonetheless, we made a good decision. We sold the product (exit) to competitors. The revenue from “exit” compensated for all the losses, leaving us with enough rest.**

**We were a small team without substantial budgets for rapid development, and the risk of forming new teams without money to survive for more than 1–2 months was irresponsible.**

**You have to believe me that this decision consumed us sleepless nights.**

**Finally, we sold it. They turned off our app but took algorithms and users.**

Whether you believe it or not, **after several months of toiling day and night, experiencing burnout**, growing weary of the topic, and gaining an extra 15 kg in weight, **we finally found our freedom…**

**The exit wasn’t incredibly profitable**, but we knew they had outdone us. The exit covered all our **expenses and granted us a well-deserved rest for the subsequent quarter.**

**It was an insane ride**. Despite the uncertainty, stress, struggles, and sleepless nights, **the story and experience will remain etched in my memory for the rest of my life**.

## Swift Takeaways:

* Comprehending User Needs: Do you fully understand the **product-market fi**t? Is your offering just an accessory or does it truly satisfy the user’s needs?
* **The Power of Viral Marketing: Take inspiration from giants like Snapchat, ChatGPT, and Clubhouse**. While your product might not attain the same scale (**but remember, never say never…**), the closer your concept is to theirs, the easier your journey will be. **If your user is motivated to text a friend saying, “Hey, check out how cool this is” (like sharing ChatGPT), then you’re on the best track. Really.** Even if it doesn’t seem immediately evident, there could be a way to incorporate this into your product. Keep looking until you find it.
* **Niche targeting** — the more specific and tailored your product is to a certain audience, the easier your journey will be
* **People love buying from people** — establishing a personal brand and associating yourself with the product can make things easier.
* **Value: Seek to understand why users engage with your product and keep returning.**
* **The more specific and critical the issue you’re aiming to solve, the easier your path will be.** Consider your offerings in terms of products and services and focus on sales and marketing, regardless of personal sentiments.

These are just a few points, I plan to elaborate on all of them in a separate article.

Many products undergo years of development in search of market fit, refining the user experience, and more. **And guess what?** There’s absolutely nothing wrong with that.

**Each product and market follows its own rules. Many startups have extensive histories before they finally make their mark (for instance, OpenAI).**

This entire journey spanned maybe 6–8 months. I grasped and capitalized on the opportunity, but we understood from the start that establishing a startup carried a significant risk, and our crypto product was 10 times riskier.

**Was it worth it? Given my passion for product development — absolutely.**

**Was it profitable? — No, considering the hours spent — we lose.**

**Did it provide a stable, problem-free life — nope.**

**Did this entire adventure offer a wealth of happiness, joy, and unforgettable experiences — definitely yes.**

**One thing is certain — we’ve amassed substantial experience and it’s not over yet :)**

**So, what lies ahead?**

**Chapter 7: Reverting to the contractor, developing a product for a crypto Startup**Returning to the past, we continue our journey…

I had invested substantial time and passion into the tech rescue mission product. I came on board as the technical Team Leader of a startup that had garnered over $20M in seed round funding, affiliated with the realm of cryptocurrencies. The investors were individuals with extensive backgrounds in the crypto world.

**My role was primarily technical, and there was an abundance of work to tackle. I was fully immersed, and genuinely devoted to the role.** I was striving for excellence, knowing that if we secured another round of financing, **the startup would accelerate rapidly.**

**As for the product and marketing, I was more of an observer**.

After all, there were marketing professionals with decades of experience on board. These were individuals recruited from large crypto-related firms. I had faith in them, kept an eye on their actions, and focused on my own responsibilities. **However, the reality was far from satisfactory.**

**On the last day, the principal investor for the Series A round withdrew. The board made the tough decision to shut down. It was a period of intense observation and gaining experience in product management.**

**This was a very brief summary of the last 10 years.**

**And what next?**

## (Last) Chapter 8: To be announced — Product Owner / Product Consultant / Strategist / CTO

After spending countless hours and days deliberating my next steps, one thing is clear:

**My aspiration is to continue traversing the path of software product development, with the hopeful anticipation that one day, I might ride the crest of the next big wave and ascend to the prestigious status of a unicorn company.**

I find myself drawn to the process of building products, exploring product-market fit, strategizing, engaging in software development, seeking out new opportunities, networking, attending conferences, and continuously challenging myself by understanding the market and its competitive landscape.

## Product Owner / Product Consultant / CTO / COO:

I’m not entirely sure how to categorize this role, as I anticipate that it will largely depend on the product to which I will commit myself fully.

**My idea is to find one startup/company that wants to build a product / or already has a product, want to speed up, or simply doesn’t know what’s next.**

Alternatively, I could be a part of an established company with a rich business history, which intends to invest in digitization and technological advancements. The goal would be to enrich their customer experience by offering complementary digital products

**Rather than initiating a new venture from ground zero with the same team, I am receptive to new challenges.** I am confident that my past experiences will prove highly beneficial for the **founders of promising, burgeoning startups that already possess a product, or are in the initial phases of development.**

**‘Consultant’** — I reckon we interpret this term differently. My aim is to be completely absorbed in a single product, crafting funnels, niches, strategies, and all that is necessary to repeatedly achieve the ‘product-market fit’ and significant revenue. **To me, ‘consultant’ resonates more akin to freelancing than being an employee**.

**My current goal is to kickstart as a consultant and aide, dealing with facilitating startups in their journey from point A to B.**

**Here are two theoretical scenarios to illustrate my approach:** **Scenario 1:**

1. (**Starting from point A**) You have a product but struggle with marketing, adoption, software, strategy, sales, fundraising, or something else.
2. I conduct an analysis and develop a strategy to reach point B.
3. I take on the **“dirty work”** and **implement** necessary changes, including potential pivots or shifts (going all-in) to guide the product to point B.
4. **The goal is to reach point B, which could involve achieving a higher valuation, expanding the user base, increasing sales, or generating monthly revenue, among other metrics.**

**Scenario 2:**

1. (**Starting from point A**) You have a plan or idea but face challenges with marketing, adoption, strategy, software, sales, fundraising, or something else.
2. I analyze the situation and devise a strategy to reach **point B**.
3. I tackle the necessary tasks, build the team, and overcome obstacles to propel the product to **point B**.

I have come across the view that finding the elusive product-market fit is the job of the founder, and it’s hard for me to disagree.

However, I believe that my support and experiences can help save money, many failures, and most importantly, time. I have spent a great deal of time learning from my mistakes, enduring failure after failure, and even had no one to ask for support or opinion, which is why I offer my help. Saving even a couple of years, realistically speaking, seems like a value I’m eager to provide…

**I invite you to share your thoughts and insights on these scenarios :)**

## Closing Remarks:

**I appreciate your time and effort in reaching this point.** This has been my journey, and I wouldn’t change it for the world. I had an extraordinary adventure, and now **I’m ready for the next exciting battle with the market and new software products.**

While my entire narrative is centered around startups, especially the ones I personally built, I’m planning to share more insights drawn from all of my experiences, not just those as a co-founder.

**If you’re currently developing your product or even just considering the idea, I urge you to reach out to me. Perhaps together, we can create something monumental :)**

**Thank you for your time and insights. I eagerly look forward to engaging in discussions and hearing your viewpoints. Please remember to like and subscribe. Nothing motivates to write more than positive feedback :)**

14k85va,1,2023-06-27,AI - a discussion of present and future,u/a-kuz,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/14k85va/ai_a_discussion_of_present_and_future/,"I've been playing around with chatGPT and Bing for a little bit, and I have to say - I am absolutely in awe.

From social media plans to recipe planner, to birthday planning, and everything else in between; AI available to us is absolutely incredible! 

If used correctly, it already has the capability for enriching and bettering one's daily life, saving time and streamlining tasks. 

Although the risks of AI are real and should be discussed at length, I believe majority of the risks come from our shortcomings as humans and us projecting this onto a technology so great, that we will impede ourselves in the process.

As it stands right now, the free version of chatGPT available to public is capable of so much, that if used correctly, can already vastly improve one's life. 
As an example, a job seeker can use it to help write an attractive CV, which will improve a person's chances of landing a good role. A student with minimal cooking knowledge can use it to get recipes with prep instructions. A household can create and manage their budget effectively. And all of it - for free!

AI can also be used for entertainment - DALL-E allows people with no artistic background to express their creativity and try new things. 

Of course it is not all rosy. On the flip side of the coin, the capabilities of the available AI can be used to produce vile, sickening things. However, this is due to us - humans. It is not an inherent trait of AI to do harm. 

Maybe the answer to dealing with the risks AI poses, is to find the good in humanity, and allow this to be the teaching material for the AI. Maybe, just maybe, if we can all work towards understanding that we could absolutely create a utopia, our subsequent actions would actually lead us there?

Maybe it is time for us to have a good, hard look in the mirror and understand that it is us - humans, that have led the world to the state that it is today; and we need to change our systems, learn new, better ways of life as a species? 

Maybe government regulation is not necessary, because above all, they are also humans with individual, egotistical, self-serving agendas?",User_deleted,0
