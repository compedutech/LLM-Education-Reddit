ChatGPT, a language processing tool, has made inroads into multiple industries due to its versatility and advanced capabilities.

One of the most notable impacts of ChatGPT is on customer service. The AI can engage with customers 24/7, providing quick and accurate responses to inquiries and freeing up human customer service agents to handle more complex cases. This not just enhances customer satisfaction but also dramatically increases the efficiency of the support teams.

In education, ChatGPT is facilitating personalized learning. It can assist in creating customized learning materials and provide instant assistance to students, making education more accessible and tailored to individual needs. By reducing the time educators spend on routine queries, they can focus on more critical tasks, such as curriculum development and one-on-one tutoring.

The legal and healthcare sectors are not far behind. Law firms are adopting ChatGPT to automate document review and research, speeding up processes that were once time-consuming. In healthcare, AI-driven chatbots are providing patients with initial consultation based on symptoms before being redirected to specialists. This streamlines the allocation of medical resources and prioritizes critical care.

Furthermore, ChatGPT has augmented productivity in content creation fields by helping writers overcome creative block and generate ideas or even creating entire articles. In marketing, it assists in generating product descriptions, advertisements, and email campaigns.

However, it’s important to consider the implications of such technology. While it increases productivity, it also raises questions about job replacement and the shifting of skill-set demands. The answer may lie in the synergy between human creativity and AI efficiency.

Let's discuss how ChatGPT has transformed your industry. What are the productivity gains you've noticed, and what concerns do you foresee in its broader implementation?",active,1

I study languages at university and because it's my final year, I need to write my bachelor thesis. Since I started doing Dreaming Spanish and learning Spanish in my free time, I've gotten really passionate about comprehensible input and I have been telling my teachers about it. I also started taking a course about teaching Dutch as a Second Language and it talks about comprehensible input and Stephen Krashen! It's super funny to have class about topics that have been fascinating me for a while now! 

I was thinking about what to write my thesis about, but I already knew I wanted it to be related to second language acquistion. Suddenly a topic arose. For a while I used ChatGPT to generate texts that were comprehensible for my level and used that as input. I've also been doing Crosstalk with ChatGPT. I told my professor about this and she apparently has been telling other students and teachers that I have been using this method to help my language acquisition (and she's seen it worked on me). When me and my classmates were thinking about our thesis subjects, my teacher mentioned to me the idea of writing a thesis about how to use AI in Second Language Acquisition. This idea had already crossed me mind, and since I'm passionate about it, I agreed. 

Later she connected me with the professor that chairs the department teaching Dutch as a Second Language. He wants to help me with my thesis and above that, he also offered me an internship! I will be looking through the different study materials used in the Dutch courses at my university and seeing how we can implement AI in the lessons! Even though the courses at uni aren't fully based around comprehensible input, I hope these AI implementations can help the students get more input in Dutch. If you guys have any ideas about how I can implement AI in the uni courses, I would love to hear them! You might indirectly help some people learn Dutch ;)

It's definitely interesting to see all these new developments in language teaching from the inside. I wish there was more CI used in university, but for now the methods are still largely based in explicit teaching. I'm curious to see whether this will change! But for now, I'm willing to help improve the education system as it is, and I'm super thankful that Dreaming Spanish lead me down this path in my life. Who knows where this will lead!",active,90

working on doc2exam proved to be really fun, I've learned svelte5, deepened my django skills, and rag/llm skills.

I've found [llamaindex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index) is much easier to use than langchain, and the reddit dwarfs and yc hackers are right, at least in my case: langchain is over-engineered for most people

but llamaindex also tries too hard in some places to replace manual prompt engineering, and I had to dodge many of its incomplete (and sometimes inconsistent or unintuitive) apis

\# What My Project Does

it turns any material into a fully-fledged live exam that you can send to your students who can take it online., and receive a perma-url certificate like on Coursera (which you can attach to your linkedin or whatever).  
the idea is to have the examination part of a course completely automated, while the teaching itself is still driven by a human (as per the neoducation manifesto - google it).

  
\# Target Audience

Schools, Professors or students prepping for exams

  
\# Comparison

[https://jungleai.com/](https://jungleai.com/) \-- more of a flashcard generator, and it focuses on student prepping while doc2exam is primarily targeted towards professors (but students can use it just as easily for prep)

1h7emim,1,2024-12-05,Leveraging ChatGPT for Enhanced Data Analysis and Reporting Across Various Industries,u/cporter202,ChatGPTautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTautomation/comments/1h7emim/leveraging_chatgpt_for_enhanced_data_analysis_and/,"Title: Leveraging ChatGPT for Enhanced Data Analysis and Reporting Across Various Industries

Hey everyone!

In recent years, we've seen artificial intelligence transform the ways we collect, analyze, and report data. ChatGPT, a variant of the powerful GPT model by OpenAI, has been at the forefront of this shift, offering analysts and businesses a robust tool to enhance their data handling capabilities. I'm here to dive into how ChatGPT can revolutionize data analysis and reporting across diverse sectors.

For starters, ChatGPT's language processing abilities enable it to understand and manipulate data like never before. In market research, analysts can harness this technology to ramp through vast amounts of customer feedback, social media conversations, and survey responses, distilling these into actionable insights and coherent reports.

Finance and banking stand to gain considerably through real-time analysis of market trends and automated report generation that ChatGPT can facilitate. These accurate and nuanced reports can guide investment decisions, risk assessment, and customer service improvements.

Healthcare could also benefit from ChatGPT's prowess, particularly in managing and making sense of patient data, research papers, and clinical trials. The AI's ability to work with complex medical terminologies and data patterns means that it can assist in the creation of detailed reports, which doctors and researchers can utilize in diagnosing conditions or developing new treatments.

In the realm of education, ChatGPT can analyze educational content and student data to customize learning experiences. The subsequent reports can help educators modify their teaching strategies, ensuring better student outcomes and more targeted learning interventions.

Furthermore, in the public sector, ChatGPT can play a vital role in policy analysis and public sentiment tracking. It can synthesize information from various sources to aid in creating detailed reports, which can shape policy-making and community initiatives.

The potential integrations and applications are indeed vast. But as with all technology, there are caveats and considerations - issues such as data privacy, the quality of input data, and the need for human oversight shouldn't be overlooked.

I'm intrigued to know how you think ChatGPT could transform industries not mentioned here or specific instances where AI-driven data analysis could provide unique benefits. Let's discuss the current and potential impact of ChatGPT on data analysis and reporting and how we can ensure these tools are used responsibly and effectively.",active,1
1h7v1p1,1,2024-12-06,My excellent Conversation with Stephen Kotkin,u/Significant-Notice-,marginal,https://www.reddit.com/r/marginal/comments/1h7v1p1/my_excellent_conversation_with_stephen_kotkin/,"It was so much fun we ran over and did about ninety minutes instead of the usual hour.  Here is [the audio, video, and transcript](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/stephen-kotkin/).  Here is part of the episode summary:

Tyler sat down with Stephen to discuss the state of Russian Buddhism today, how shamanism persists in modern Siberia, whether Siberia might ever break away from Russia, what happened to the science city Akademgorodok, why Soviet obsession with cybernetics wasn’t just a mistake, what life was really like in 1980s Magnitogorsk, how modernist urban planning failed there, why Prokofiev returned to the USSR in 1936, what Stalin actually understood about artistic genius, how Stalin’s Georgian background influenced him (or not), what Michel Foucault taught him about power, why he risked his tenure case to study Japanese, how his wife’s work as a curator opened his eyes to Korean folk art, how he’s progressing on the next Stalin volume, and much more.

And here is one excerpt:

**COWEN: **What did you learn from [Michel Foucault](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/foucault/) about power, or indeed anything else?

**KOTKIN: **I was very lucky. I went to Berkeley for a PhD program in 1981. I finished in 1988, and then my first job was at Princeton University in 1989. In the middle of it, I went for French history, and I switched into Habsburg history, and then finally, I switched into Russian Soviet history. I started learning the Russian alphabet my third year of the PhD program when I was supposed to take my PhD exams, so it was a radical shift.

Foucault — I met him because he came to Berkeley in the ’80s, just like [Derrida](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://philosophynest.com/details-6560000-the-philosophy-of-perception---berkeley-to-derrida.html) came, just like [Habermas](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/habermas/) came, [Claude Lévi-Strauss](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.britannica.com/biography/Claude-Levi-Strauss), the anthropologist, came through. It was California. They were Europeans, and there was a wow factor for them. Foucault was also openly gay, and San Francisco’s gay culture was extraordinarily attractive to him. It was, unfortunately, the epoch of the AIDS epidemic.

One time, I was at lunch with him, and he said to me, “Wouldn’t it be amazing if somebody applied my theories to Stalinism?” I’m sitting there, okay, I’m 23 years old. Imagine if you had traveled to Switzerland in the late 19th century, and you went up in those Engadin mountains, and you were at some café in the mountain air, and there’s this guy with a huge forehead and hair up in the air sitting there, and you went and introduced yourself. You said, “Hello, I’m Tyler,” and he said, “Hello, I’m Friedrich Nietzsche.” You would say, “Well, geez, this is interesting. I should have more conversations with you.”

So, that’s the experience I had. I had read Foucault in seminar because it was very fashionable to do so, obviously, especially at Berkeley, especially in a culture that tilts one way politically, and I think you’ll guess which way that might be. But I didn’t understand what he said, so I went up to him as a naïf with this book, [_Madness and Civilization_](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://sociologiac.net/2024/03/20/madness-and-civilization-michel-foucault/)_,_ which we had been forced to read, and I started asking him questions. “What does this mean? What does this mean? What is this passage? This is indecipherable.”

He patiently explained to the moron that I was what he was trying to say. It sounded much more interesting coming from him verbally, sitting just a few feet away, than it had on the page. I was lucky to become the class coordinator for his course at Berkeley. He gave these [lectures about the problem of the truth-teller in Ancient Greece](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://foucault.info/parrhesia/).

It was very far removed from . . . I had no classical training. Yes, I had Latin in high school because I went to Catholic school, and it was a required subject. I started as an altar boy with the Latin Mass, which quickly changed because of what happened at Vatican II. But no Greek, so it was completely Greek to me. Forgive me, that wasn’t planned that I was going to say that. It just happened spontaneously.

Anyway, I just kept asking him more questions and invited him to go to things, and so we would have lunches and dinners. I introduced him to this place, Little Joe’s in Little Italy, part of San Francisco, which unfortunately is no longer there. It was quite a landmark back then, and then he would repair after dinner to the bathhouses in San Francisco by himself. I was not part of that. I’m neither openly nor closeted gay, so that was a different part of Foucault that I didn’t partake in, but others did.

Anyway, I would ask him these things, and he would just explain stuff to me. I would say, “What’s happening in Poland?” This is the 1980s, and he would say things to me like, “The idea of civil society is the opiate of the intellectual class.” Everybody was completely enamored of the concept of civil society in the ’80s, especially via the Polish case, and so I would ask him to elucidate more. “What does that mean, and how does that work?”

He told me once that class in France came from disease in Paris — that it wasn’t because of who was a factory worker, who wasn’t a factory worker, but it was your neighborhoods in Paris and who died from cholera and who didn’t die from cholera. A colleague of ours who was another fellow graduate in Berkeley ended up writing a dissertation using that aside, that throwaway line.

I was able to ask him these questions about everything and anything. What he showed me — this is your question — what he showed me was how power works, not in terms of bureaucracy, not in terms of the large mechanisms of governance like a secret police, but how all of that is enforced and acted through daily life. In other words, the micro versions of power. It’s connected to the big structures, but it’s little people doing this. That’s why I said totalitarianism is using your agency to destroy your own agency.

That means denouncing your neighbors, being encouraged to denounce your neighbors for heresies, and participating in that culture of denunciation, which loosens all social trust and social bonds and puts you in a situation of dependency on the state. You’re a gung-ho activist using your agency, and the next thing you know, you have no power whatsoever. So, those are the kinds of things that I could talk to him about.

After he passed away from AIDS in the summer of 1984 — it was the AIDS epidemic, horrific. He passed away, and we had a memorial for him. I was still a PhD student, remember. I didn’t finish until ’88. There was this guy, [Michel de Certeau](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://booksandideas.net/Michel-de-Certeau), who wrote a tribute to Foucault in French that he was going to deliver at the event. It was called “The Laughter of Foucault.” I had these conversations with de Certeau about his analysis of Foucault and the pleasure of analytic work, which had been a hallmark of Foucault.

De Certeau taught me a phrase called “the little tactics of the habitat,” which became one of the core ideas of my dissertation and then book, [_Magnetic Mountain_](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://history.princeton.edu/about/publications/magnetic-mountain-stalinism-civilization), about this micropower stuff. Even though Foucault was gone, I was able to extend the beginning of the conversations with Foucault through de Certeau.

I learned how power works in everyday life, and how the language that you use, and the practices like denunciation that you enact or partake in, help form those totalitarian structures, because the secret police are not there every minute of every day, so what’s in your head? How are you motivated? What type of behavior are you motivated for?

We say, “Okay, what would Stalin do in this situation?” Many people approach their lives — they’ve never met Stalin; they’ll never meet Stalin — but they imagine what Stalin might do. That gets implanted in their way of thinking; it becomes second nature. I learned to discuss and analyze that through Foucault.

I have to say, I didn’t share his analysis that Western society was imprisoning, that the daily life practices of free societies were a form of imprisonment in its own way. I never shared that view, so it wasn’t for me his analysis of the West that I liked. It was the analytical toolkit that I adapted from him to apply to actual totalitarianism in the Soviet case.

Excellent throughout.

1h8krrr,1,2024-12-06,Variable switch mode power supply project,u/Affectionate_Ad286,ElectricalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/1h8krrr/variable_switch_mode_power_supply_project/,"Hi y'all, I'm a first year EE student and I'm really excited and passionate about it especially because I just found a big lot of EE equipment for free on facebook marketplace that I've been learning all about. I've learned most of the circuit analysis stuff from practical electronics for inventors, all about circuits, khan academy, etc. but the issue is that I've been trying to learn EE on my own from textbooks and forums/datasheets online but asking questions to chatGPT once I'm confused only gets me so far, as I'm starting to get into stuff that's a little niche and tough to understand when it comes to designing and working on this project I have. I've been learning and doing some notes for a few weeks not but I'm not in any EE classes yet nor do I know any students learning or professors teaching EE at my college so I feel like I may be easily misunderstanding basic concepts that other people already know about.

I've been trying to make a variable voltage switch mode power supply from (kinda) scratch with a 19.5v 10.26a laptop DC power supply using a switching buck converter and some rotary encoders as knobs for current limit and voltage from 0-15V and 0-3A without using any dedicated gate driver, buck converter, or other specialized ICs (because I don't have them) but I've been having trouble finalizing the design as I might be going in a different direction than what I should be doing to learn. 

*I'm not sure whether learning theory and application analytically by taking notes on each configuration and usage of op amps, transistors, etc. for things like error amplifiers and filters by going through textbooks page by page is worth it (as I was doing for a while, but has the downside of me not learning everything about how real vs. non-ideal electronic components work) or if I should be going trial and error as I see problems in my circuit design, then learning through the rabbit holes those take me (which I have been doing and has been seeing progress but takes a* ***lot*** *of time and patience for a small amount of progression) or if there's some other way to learn that I haven't considered yet*. 

  
The reason I wanna do this project in particular is because I don't have a power supply to test components yet, and once I have one I could attach a circuit to it to make a waveform generator, but as of now I've had to just go from my multimeter and datasheets to try and discern specs and limitations. I also like the challenge of it and I don't wanna cheat with a gate driver IC or anything because I think it would be valuable for me to learn conceptually what every part of the power supply does and what things to consider in real circuit design. 

My main questions are:

1. Is this project even plausible? I see a lot of power supply projects online that only use linear regulators but I feel like that's not applicable in my case because of the large amount of power dissipated by the regulator so I want to make a switch-mode buck converter for it.

2. I've been considering whether a synchronous buck would be worth the extra effort with the extra MOSFET for CCM and better power transfer vs. an asynchronous buck, because driving just one P-channel MOSFET at 100kHZ with 13v level-shifted gate voltage from a 3.3v PWM output has brought up a whole load of challenges like trying to learn how a bootstrap circuit works and how I can use it without an optocoupler, so how I would synchronize the dead time correctly with the low-side MOSFET might be a pain compared to just using a Schottky Diode.

3. Trying to figure out how to implement a variable current limiter circuit and/or overcurrent protection in with the variable voltage has been a pain, thus I wonder exactly how a commercial variable voltage variable current bench power supply works to vary both of those and I haven't got many good results online for schematics or anything. 

4. I've neglected simulating my circuit designs because my components are a little older and I can't find most of them on the LTspice libraries, so it doesn't seem worth it to sacrifice accuracy at the risk of extra wasted time messing around with things, but is there some other way? A lot of people on forums online use simulations and I wonder if it would be worth it and if I can upload obsolete components onto the library somehow.

5. I'm sure this is simply a theory ignorance question, but I'm completely lost on how engineers online come up with filter capacitor values and types for input, output, and between components and signals, it just seems like they choose an arbitrary capacitance. Similarly to this when a voltage divider is chosen, the resistor ratio is always the same but resistances can change quite a bit, so choosing between say 1ohm and 5ohm vs 1kohm and 5kohm I feel like should be a more difficult choice than it seems to be, because I never see any resistances for voltage dividers other than between around 1k and 10k ohms and I wonder if this has to do with it being a sweet spot of current diversion, or some reason that I'm neglecting.

  
Thanks :D

1h8q6p0,2,2024-12-07,AITAH for asking for a portion of subletting money?,u/PHANTOM________,AITAH,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h8q6p0/aitah_for_asking_for_a_portion_of_subletting_money/,"Less than a month ago, I saw an ad on craigslist for a girl looking for a roommate. I already have an apartment that I rent but I've been searching for some sort of reasonable sized/priced space to make into my art studio where I can paint in my own dedicated creative space. I reached out to her and detailed my situation and she immediately responded- I actually moved my art stuff in the very next day. The way I see it, I'm a great roommate, half roommate even, because I'm not there even half the time and very considerate. I don't need the kitchen to cook. I don't need to access her room which is where the shower is (there's a half bath out in the shared living room area which is of course, just fine for me) whereas a normal roommate would need to go through her room on a regular basis to shower. I'm not going to be bringing home random furniture or use up any space basically outside of my designated small area. I was not given a mail key which was again, fine with me because it just wasn't necessary. In my opinion, any renter would be delighted to have me as a roommate. Any honestly she was. The situation was beneficial to the both of us and it was enjoyable. I told her I don't want to be on the lease because she already has the lease under her name and I simply don't want to be beholden if something went wrong. I thought it was a good trade off given the benefits. She agreed to it.  
  
My portion of the rent is 1050 and the total rent is 2500, so 1050/1450 respectively, not including utilities, but I agreed to pay a portion of that too after discussion and the first month went by. My ""room"" is actually a den with a folding curtain wall in the living room, barely large enough for a queen bed and the window wall is diagonally shaped so there's not a lot of room in it at all. It also wasn't soundproof to any acceptable degree. For a normal roommate expecting an actual room, it would be kinda shitty ngl, but for me it's great. I liked the ability to open the curtain wall and spill out into the living room.  
  
Overall we've had a good relationship and I'm pretty laid back about anything she communicates. I would close my ""door"" a couple times but she always opened it back up to let in more sunlight and possibly to show off my art to her friends. She has friends over on a regular basis to drink and they're always drinking right next to my area which is basically an extension of the living room. I'm cool with it and I hung out with them a couple times. She has a boyfriend and he's really nice too and we all got along great. They're nice people. 

Pretty much the sole issue was that she kept bringing up subletting to strangers while she's away on a trip to Korea (for a month). To be clear I think the idea of subletting is very weird and not something I'm comfortable with, let alone with strangers off Craigslist (yes I know we met on Craigslist too but I still just don't want to be subjected to my roommate subletting). I did communicate that this is weird to me from the very beginning.   
  
At first she wanted to sublet to an old Korean couple for 1 week - to which I agreed to and said I would just stay out of the apartment for a week and close up my room, with the compensation of 1 week worth of rent deducted from me. Unfortunately this didn't fall through and she started looking for more people.   
  
Next candidate was one of her students (she is a grad student and also teaches) and I said you know what okay fine, you know this person personally, and even though I'm still not jazzed about the idea, just make sure they're not weird and I'll agree to this. That didn't fall through either.  
  
Next proposal was a couple off Craigslist who was visiting to take care of some stuff because they lived here before. To this I was starting to tire and gave her a long message to drive the point home that this is just not something I'm comfortable with and I definitely do not want to share my paid space with a completely random couple off Craigslist. 

She was honestly very receptive of my concerns and feelings and said okay she's not going to let random people in. The issue was dropped for a while and my assumption was that she was just not going to sublet anymore. Unfortunately I was wrong about this and she finally brought up the last candidate which is an older man who is a ""friend of her dad"".

This is the moment where being kinda fed up with the proposal to sublet, after consulting ChatGPT (lol) I countered that she pay me a portion of the proceeds. I mainly wanted her to just drop it altogether, but if she REALLY wanted to sublet she could give me some of the money, and to be completely honestly this was entirely a principle thing for me. I don't need the extra money. I asked for 40% of her proceeds to make a point of argument, but I would've been fine with a good chunk less.

Anyway I'll share all the relevant texts on IMGUR, my longest response which ended up being too long for SMS, and the ChatGPT advice link I mentioned earlier.

""Perfectly understandable to me that you’re not trying to run a business. I don’t see it that way, but you are subletting your apartment to someone at the expense of my discomfort. Yes I’m not on the lease and communicated that I don’t want to be from the beginning but I don’t think I’ve ever made the impression that I’m a shady guy trying to profit off of any of this arrangement we have. I gave you 2 months worth of money upfront no hesitation, and only ever been considerate to you thus far. I was never okay with this sort of subletting arrangement to begin with, and I communicated that I think it’s just a weird thing to do period and I’ve asked many others what they think and unanimously they agree that it’s uncomfortable and presumptuous to drop on me. It’s just not something I appreciate lol but for your sake I entertain it. I’m making concessions to try and be reasonable with you because when it comes down to it you are benefitting from subletting because you don’t have to worry about rent while I am subjected to sharing a space that I pay for with a random person. I assert that I am reasonable so I said hey we can discuss what’s fair and talk about this more. What isn’t fair in my eyes is having to work with this situation and getting nothing out of it except discomfort. It’s not about the money for me but the principle of being considerate. I see that you feel strongly about this and if it’s something that you won’t budge on then I understand, but it’s not something I want to be subjected to at all so me even discussing it with you is me showing respect to you. If you don’t see it that way I get it, but I probably won’t be staying past my first month. If that’s the route you’d like to take I’ll be sure to be out by the 16th and your dad’s friend can confirm it for you. I’ll return the key to your dad’s friend after I get back half of my deposit I gave you. I haven’t even been here a month so I’m absolutely positive I’ve done zero damage to your apartment but I’ll let you keep half as a gesture of good will.  
Thanks"" - my response after she said she is not willing to give me any of the subletting rent.

The impact of ChatGPT and similar technologies can be seen in their ability to provide personalized learning experiences, instant feedback, and scalable training solutions.

In educational settings, ChatGPT has the potential to augment the learning process by offering students on-demand tutoring and assistance with homework. It can also serve as a learning companion, helping learners to grasp complex concepts and explore subjects at their own pace. Moreover, in environments where resources are limited, ChatGPT can help bridge the gap, ensuring that all students, regardless of their circumstances, have access to quality education and support.

There is a similar transformation in the corporate world. The use of ChatGPT allows businesses to tailor their employee training programs to individual needs, enhancing the effectiveness of professional development. It can simulate real-world scenarios, enabling employees to practice skills in a virtual setting before applying them in their work. This not only reduces the costs associated with training but also allows for a more flexible approach to employee development, which is crucial in today's fast-paced business environment.

The advent of ChatGPT, a variant of the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language models, has sparked intriguing discussions on its capabilities and applications. One sector where its impact could be significantly profound is in data analysis and reporting across various industries. ChatGPT's ability to understand, interpret, and generate human-like text opens new avenues for automating complex tasks that traditionally required significant human intervention.

In healthcare, for instance, ChatGPT could revolutionize how patient data is analyzed, leading to improved personalized care plans and potentially quicker diagnostics by sifting through vast amounts of medical records to identify patterns and anomalies.

Financial services could similarly benefit, using ChatGPT to enhance real-time market analysis, risk assessment, and client reporting. By integrating ChatGPT, financial analysts can more swiftly respond to market changes, automate repetitive reporting tasks, and provide more nuanced insights into economic trends.

Additionally, in the realm of marketing and customer service, ChatGPT's natural language capabilities make it an ideal tool for sentiment analysis and customer feedback interpretation. As businesses seek to understand their audience better, ChatGPT could be tasked with compiling reports on customer attitudes and trends, feeding this information back into strategy development.

A perpetual challenge in data analysis and reporting is that of data volume and complexity. However, with ChatGPT's assistance, organizations can more efficiently process and interpret this data to produce actionable insights. It shines in synthesizing information and creating reports that are both comprehensive and accessible to stakeholders with varying degrees of technical expertise.

In educational settings, ChatGPT's role could also burgeon. It has the potential to support educational research and institutional reporting by sifting through academic data, providing summaries, and uncovering insights into student performance and learning outcomes.

As we explore ChatGPT's implications, it is paramount to discuss the ethical considerations and ensure rigorous standards for accuracy and privacy are upheld. The AI's impact on the workforce is also a focal point; the balance between automation and employment must be sensitively managed.

Imagine something that:
	•	Turns your lectures and books into flashcards automatically.
	•	Creates high-yield questions for any topic you need – tailored and accurate.
	•	Summarizes your notes instantly and saves you HOURS.

I used this during Step 2 prep, and I’m using it now for Step 3. I’ve tried – ChatGPT, UWorld – and while they’re good, they’re not this specific. This tool can:

✅ Generate your OWN questions and flashcards – fast and reliable.
✅ Let you focus on what matters, cutting your study time in half.
✅ Free up time to do things you love – spend time with family, play sports, or just breathe.

But let me give you a real example:
I was prepping for Step 2 and needed high-yield questions on renal tubular acidosis – not just the basics, but specific nuances for my weak areas. ChatGPT gave me vague, scattered answers, and UWorld didn’t have enough on the exact angle I needed. This tool?
	•	It took my notes on RTA and generated tailored flashcards and accurate questions specific to what I uploaded.

- It saved me hours I would’ve wasted combing through random sources.

It’s the ultimate study buddy, and I don’t want anyone to go through the struggles I faced. If you’re a med student, don’t wait. This isn’t some generic tool that gives you half-answers or leaves you guessing. It’s precise, reliable, and saves hours of your time.

I used this for Step 2 and am using it again for Step 3. Instead of burning out, I’m finally able to focus on understanding the material, not just memorizing it. I’ve cut my study time nearly in half – and I’m still learning more.

If you’re struggling to keep up, if you’re tired of wasting time on tools that don’t deliver, you owe it to yourself to try this. I’m here because I don’t want anyone to feel as lost as I did.

Here’s the link to the best AI study buddy for medicine: https://www.neuralconsult.com/?utm_source=Group&utm_medium=AllenPalama


Try it. Upload your lecture or any med school materials and see how much time you save. 

Feel free to text me for questions!

Now let’s talk about cost. Some of us hesitate to invest in tools like this, but think about it:
You’ll easily spend $5 a day on coffee, snacks, or something you don’t need. That’s $150 a month. Would you trade that for a tool that helps you destroy your in-house exams, Step 1, and Step 2?

Education is the investment that pays back more than anything. I wish I’d known about this earlier – I would’ve saved myself time, stress, and countless nights of burnout. Plus there is a free trial! I doubt you’ll just get that. Tool is too good. 

If you’re tired of struggling, this tool is worth every cent. Don’t wait. ",User_deleted,0

2. I took an NBME as a diagnostic test, which isnt really recommended here but I just wanted to know how screwed I was. I got a **45% on NBME 26**. I thought it wasn't bad as a starting point but I realised (through reddit) that I had a foundational knowledge gap. 

3. I decided I would use ChatGPT and FA for my foundations (going line by line, and then using ChatGPT/Wikipedia to get context/explanations). I did this for Biochem, Micro, and Heme/Onc. I realised it was working (I was u nerstanding, but I was a bit slow.

I usually just watched the video and tried to write down things I thought was important on scratch paper (just because writing helps me learn, I didnt take notes for review). 

5. 2 months after my first NBME, I had only used ChatGPT/Wiki/FA/Bootcamp, and took **NBME 27 and got a 62%**. To be honest I was surprised, so I booked my exam for 2 months from this date. 

6. I decided I would ONLY use UWorld and not bother with any more foundational knowledge. What I did (that I thought worked really well):   
\- Set up a 3 minute timer that rings a bell, and restarts automatically, indefinitely (I used python)   
\- Set up UW in tutor mode   
\- Then aimed to do 2-4 blocks a day (1 block is 40 questions \* 3 min = 2h)   
\- When doing the block, I would use the 3 minutes to first answer the question and use the remaning time to quickly review the answer (use wiki/chatgpt/or just read the explanation), before I heard the bell and continued to the next question.   
\- My goal was 160 questions (8h) a day, but obviously this was difficult so some days I only did 80 or 120 questions (STILL i made sure I kept the 3min/question pace.)   
\- I completed 48% of the questions (1757 questions) with a 55% average   


7. I had university exams and then took a break from studying, so I think I took a month off

8. My exam date was approaching (T-2 weeks) so I was a mix of pessimistic/unmotivated and thought about postponing since I've taken such a long break from step, but I decided to do an NBME anyways. I took **NBME 28 and got a 69.5%**. So I decided I would risk forgetting if I postponed and decided to take the exam in two weeks.   
  
9. I took the next two weeks reviewing my NBME, mainly referring back to FA charts/tables, and taking more NBMEs: **(NBME 29 - 68.5)**, then T-2 days I took **NBME 30 - 69%, and Free120 on the same day 62%**, and then took the day before the exam off. I wasn't sure if my score dropped on the Free120 because I was exhausted since I took it on the same day as an NBME, but I thought Free120 is more about structure similarity to the real deal than to content.   


Essentially this was my lazy way to study, I think the biggest things that helped me was always asking questions, and followup questions in my head and finding the answer to them on ChatGPT or Wiki or Google. I would also use ChatGPT for pharmacology (""Test me on the most common adrenergic drugs, including agonist/antagonist, MCQ 20questions answer key at end"") etc. 

Also all my NBME scores are raw not EPC.

Its potential to revolutionize virtual learning interfaces, especially within corporate environments and educational institutions, can’t be overstated.

Corporate training has always grappled with the challenge of engagement and effectiveness. Traditional e-learning courses can sometimes be stale and poorly tailored to individual needs. ChatGPT’s ability to deliver personalized training experiences could truly transform this sphere. Imagine interactive sessions where the AI adapts to each trainee’s pace and learning style, providing immediate feedback and support—this could lead to drastically improved outcomes in employee skill development.

In the educational sector, ChatGPT could serve as a supplementary tool, assisting students with complex subjects through interactive discussions. It could also aid teachers by automating certain aspects of instruction and providing students with additional guided learning opportunities. This could be particularly advantageous in areas with limited educational resources.

Yet, the question arises: can a machine truly replicate the nuances of human interaction fundamental to the learning process? Moreover, there's the challenge of ensuring that such AI tools maintain academic integrity and do not promote shortcuts in the learning journey.

The incorporation of ChatGPT into virtual learning platforms also raises issues of data privacy and security. Educational institutions and corporations will need to establish protocols to protect sensitive information while utilizing this technology. 

As these AI tools continue to develop, effective integration will require careful consideration of these matters. Nevertheless, embracing the ChatGPT revolution could lead to more engaging, efficient, and accessible learning experiences for individuals worldwide. Let’s discuss how we can balance the incredible potential of ChatGPT with these pressing concerns to elevate our collective learning experience.",active,1
1hhax1a,33,2024-12-18,Got the P!! Alhamdulillah (write up long post ahead),u/StrawberrySimple2089,step1,https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/1hhax1a/got_the_p_alhamdulillah_write_up_long_post_ahead/,"Hi everyone Im so grateful to Allah for this, Im still amazed and in shock lol with that being said this community really helped me and I’d like to give back so here’s my journey:

Im a final year med student (IMG)
at a 5 year program
Started my prep 2 years back but it was on and off. That is until this year in February I started studying full time.

RESOURCES: 

Sketchy for micro and pharm 
(life saver i tell u, got me absolutely free points on test day) I did anki for those in the beginning however couldn’t keep up but it really helped me.

Pixorize : for Biochem 
Its the best resource out there i kid u not. If you want free points on test day do the genetic diseases part from pixorize trust me you’ll be able to answer those questions at the top of ur head

For Systems : I used FA, Uworld and bootcamp (absolute GOLD for NEURO IMMUNO CVS).
If you plan on watching bootcamp these 3 systems taught by dr roviso are so so good i could literally hear his voice in my head whenever i went through these topics from FA

First Aid : the undisputed GOAT for step 1 and u cant change my mind. 
Reading first aid over and over is the single best thing that got me through on test day. 

How did I pair it with UWORLD?
Anytime I would get a question wrong on uword i would go back and revise that topic from first aid. Uworld is absolutely necessary i did 100% with 60% corrects. However i dont think doing 100% is necessary ur good to go even with 70-80%

Dirty medicine : 
Any concept that i was struggling with from FA dirty was there to save the day!! 
Also dirty medicine for metabolisms of biochem was super helpful during dedicated 

Mehlman Audios on YouTube In my free time

Dedicated started at the end of sept :
Took NBME 25 after finishing uworld got 68%

Went back and revised first aid like my life depended on it lol at this point we were inseperable💀😂 after finishing first aid again

NBME 26    76% 2 months out
NBME 27    83% 1 month out
NBME 29.   78%  3 weeks out
NBME 30.   77%  20 days out
NBME 31.    77% 15 days out

On the day of nbme i took a break and just relaxed after attempting it or would just do a bit of ethics from amboss (had already done it from uw)

I would keep 4 days for reviewing each nbme and revised my incorrects thoroughly from FA 

Chatgpt : Believe me when i say this but this guy (what even??) is a hidden gem lol
Any question or concept i was having a hard time with i would ask gpt to explain it to me “according to usmle step 1”.
I would even ask it to make me step1 style mcqs and tables on my weak concepts lol 

New Free 120 : 4 days before the exam got a 78% and that really boosted my confidence.

Day before test :  
I would advice not to study but if u really want to wind ur stuff up until 5pm and dont study shit afterwards, at this point youve done your best.

I revised a few immuno points from first aid and thats it. 
I couldnt sleep on the night of the test got like 1-2hrs of sleep max💀 was just laying there tossing around in my bed.

On the day of test:
Reached the test centre 1 hour early , took dates, bananas and some dry fruits and a sandwich with myself oh and eye drops (really helped since i have dry eyes) and a water bottle.
I took 2 paracetamol tabs before going in. 

Sat for the first block and was like “WTF IS THIS????”
The most important thing at this point was not to let my anxiety get the best of me so i stayed calm and attempted each block with a fresh mind. I took a break after the first 2 blocks ( I had also skipped the tutorial so that gave me extra 15 mims) and then took a 5 mins break after each block

THE REAL DEAL: 
It was not like NBMEs or Uworld, but it was unique in its own way. The length of the stems was similar to uworld but with more twisted options but here’s the catch DO NOT OVERTHINK THE ANSWER CHOICES. That is what helped me sooo much!! Trust me if your concepts are solid and you have scored 70+ in 3 consecutive NBMEs u can DO THIS!! Do not go for the answer choices with obscure new bullshit words that u havent heard before go for the familiar answer choices that uve seen in FA and uworld

I put my brain on dumb mode and would go for the answer choice that clicked the most with me. It was about educated guesses and eliminating the wrong options.

THE MOST IMPORTANT thing is NOT TO GET ANXIOUS if u attempt the questions with a relaxed state of mind u can definitely do it.

Time management was a bit of problem for me,  u guys should be able to skim through the questions and pick the most relevant information from them bcz there will be shit loads of useless info in the Qs u guys just have to extract those 3-4 points for ur diagnosis and u’ll be able ti get to the correct answer!!
I would finish each block just in time

My weak aread during exam : PSYCH was really weird on my form please guys learn the timelines properly !! It’s absolutely important to know how to differentiate between each condition.

Ethics was okay/easy on my form had around 3-5 Qs on each block and those weren’t insanely hard. I found first aid, uw and dirty medicine enough for ethics 

My form was also heavy on immuno. The first aid section was enough for me to answer those questions!!

Hem n onc : know ur cancers, leukemias,lymphomas, u should be able to differentiate between them. Also learn to differentiate between the bleeding disorders!!

After the exam:

I came out feeling like shit, cried straight for half and hour, i felt like an idiot while attempting the test but u guys please dont be an idiot like me loool trust ur NBME scores and trust the process and for my muslim fellows (TRUST ALLAH, He will get u through have faith in Him)

Last piece of advice : 
I did have repeat nbme concepts but u guys they were not many. So while u do need to polish ur nbme incorrect concepts do not rely solely on those. They can literally throw any concept ur way and u should be prepared for it. And for that first aid is enough.

Try to aim for 70 and above in atleast 3 consecutive NBMEs before u sit for the exam.

Good luck to all those who are going to take the test in the future!! Youve got this. Feel free to drop any queries",User_deleted,39
1hjdxul,62,2024-12-21,"I reviewed almost 100 applications from all over the world this week. Here are some red (and yellow) flags I found -- some were funny, some were cringe, and some were just weird.",u/AppHelper,IntltoUSA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/1hjdxul/i_reviewed_almost_100_applications_from_all_over/,"I'll start by saying that I feel incredibly honored to have so many students share their applications with me after I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/1hinnym/ive_read_over_50_college_applications_this_week/) here. I met over Zoom with students from over 25 countries on six continents, including multiple refugees from Ukraine and a child of genocide survivors in Rwanda. The resilience and creativity of some of these students was inspiring. I don't envy the job of admissions officers in granting or denying educational opportunities to these aspiring college students, many of whom are downright brilliant. My task was much more limited: look for ""red flags"" that might tank their whole application.

Last year I posted about [common mistakes I saw international students make](https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/1cblgxi/ive_reviewed_hundreds_of_international_students/). I continued to see those. My observations here in this post are not necessarily things that are common, but which happened to catch my attention this week for various reasons.

A few US-based students also signed up, and some of their experiences created an interesting contrast.

# General Style and Formatting

* Lots of [ChatGPT](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1h0vhlq/in_the_past_three_days_ive_reviewed_over_100/), particularly in endings. Plenty of ""I realized that X is not just about Y, but also about Z"" along with long, repetitive conclusions full of tricolons and em-dashes. Some were egregious enough to be an immediate red flag.
   * One student claimed to have written their essay and just had ChatGPT proofread it, but I asked them to share the chat thread in which they ""refined"" the essay, it turned out that ChatGPT wrote it from scratch and the student just iterated it a few times with different Common App essay prompts and a few personal details.
   * One of my own clients got a little lazy this week and had [ChatGPT write a conclusion to her essay](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1hhau1t/after_reviewing_several_dozen_more_applications_i/), which I called out and told her to re-write.
   * But I encountered just one ""tapestry""!
* Inconsistent curly and straight apostrophes and quotation marks. This is a red flag only if in the specific ChatGPT pattern of straight quotation marks and apostrophes for contractions but curly apostrophes for possessives, but it can also be caused by Grammarly and other tools, or just general lack of attention to detail.
* Inconsistent use of American and British/Indian spelling (e.g. ""organize"" vs. ""labour"" - and no, they weren't Canadian). This isn't a red flag unless the *same* word is spelled two different ways.
* A really odd one I've never seen before: using «European quotation marks» along with standard English ones. And this person was from Asia, not France or anywhere else that uses them.

# ECs

* Cramming as much information as possible without leaving any spaces whatsoever (reflects poor editorial discretion and general inability/unwillingness to think creatively)
* Trying to pass off helping a family short-term rental business a few hours a week as a job with a fancy title (and not mentioning that it's family-owned, something I figured out pretty easily)
* 15 hours a week, 30 weeks per year practicing and playing tug-o-war

# Essay topics

* A religious awakening and wanting to spread their religion on campus
* Overcoming the setback of not winning a Pokemon card tournament (not satirically or tongue-in-cheek, just played straight). This was from an American student and really contrasted with some of the hardships I read about.
* Learning to play guitar and dressing better to get more attention from girls (particularly a crush)

# LORs

* A recommendation where most of the checkmarks were just ""above average,"" and none were ""in the top 5%"" or ""one of the top in my career."" The content of the letter was consistent with this, saying the student was among the strongest of their batch (after a teaching career of several decades) and had some other faint praise. There's nothing inappropriate about such a letter, and it's important for recommenders to maintain credibility, but this international student was going for close to a full ride.
* English teachers making sloppy mistakes in punctuation and grammar (which means either it wasn't actually written by an English teacher, or the school doesn't have good English teachers, which are red and yellow flags, respectively)
* On the flipside, a letter of recommendation from a Hindi teacher in perfect English obviously written by ChatGPT, incluing characteristic headers. According to the student, it was written in Hindi and then translated with ChatGPT. But there was no indication of this in the letter or any accompanying note.

The only disappointing part about my experience were the ""no-shows"" who had booked free reviews and never joined despite multiple automatic e-mail and text reminders. Although a few were timed conveniently to give me a break from a whirlwind day, those were slots that could have gone to other students.",active,75

Paid user for both, and I would love to just dump ChatGPT as I use Google products for work and it would be a bit more seamless. Also, the search function is completely game changing for me as I'm often needing to crosscheck and cite and having sources handy speeds that up. On coding tasks, Gemini has been plenty helpful, but these are usually very basic in nature. The breakdown occurs when posing questions that require any element of research. Below is an example (with some minor details changed) that highlights the issue I'm having.

I have about 25 years in education, and work as a consultant in higher ed (and sometimes secondary). The work involves synthesizing programmatic offerings at universities, which typically involves hours spent researching what schools offer, any entry requirements on a major by major basis, unusual trends, and what the impact might be of a change in undergraduate admission policy or of offerings. Example - say UNC Chapel Hill starts a school of engineering and aims to enroll more out of state students... what might we see in terms of selectivity on a 1, 3 and 5 year basis, what might be the impact on other North Carolina public and private universities that offer engineering (NC State, for example), and how might schools that don't offer engineering be affected in terms of things like pre-existing dual degree programs. 

I am currently digging into a specific health science field, and posed a basic question to Gemini 1.5 Pro about the offerings that exist in a relatively small geographic area along with some specific questions about the types of programs. Grounding was on, and temp was set low. It gave me five schools (there are probably 30), then just stopped. I asked it to continue, and it responded by saying I hadn't given it enough sources, and then it provided me with websites to go and search. Now, all of these data are publicly available, typically through thr Common Data Set that each schools' OIR hosts. I shared that, and suggested it use the sources it gave me. It essentially refused and we ended up in a loop.

I tried the same thing with every Gemini model in AI Studio, and the responses ranged from factually wrong, to just incomplete. In one case, it was convinced a specific school offered a program in question because there was a student organization whose acronym was identical to the degree. Changed over to 1.5 with Deep Research and it did slightly better, but with some major omissions. More concerning, when it added those programs, it ""cited"" information but with no links. I asked it three times to add the citations or links and it just failed (""Something went wrong"").

Same question posed to o1 and it got it right on the first try, and went as far as to note areas of confusion that tripped up Gemini (ie, this school doesn't have the program but it offers a joint degree with this institution that might be interesting). I shared the best list that Gemini created with o1 and it immediately noted several mistakes.

I am fully willing to own the fact I am probably screwing something up, and it would be amazing if I could just drop the OAI subscription. Is this kind work outside the domain of Gemini? Are there things I can mess with that might help? I tried grounding like I said, temp, encouraging and nudging the model, etc. Nothing seems to help.

I came across concepts like intelligence, memory, personality, motivation, emotion, and learning, etc., and was fascinated to read interesting theories by various theorists. I even found myself relating real-life scenarios to the theories. However, this is the extent of our study of psychology, and while we will probably have another course on criminology, that’s about it. I want to learn more about these topics and was wondering if I can do that on my own without classroom teaching. I do think, though, that to gain deep insights into these concepts, I would need a strong foundation in biology, chemistry, and even statistics, some of which I did not study in high school, so I want to know whether I would strictly need them or if I can get by with just a surface-level understanding of these subjects. I must mention that I found CHATGPT incredibly useful to resolve my doubts and found conversations with the chatbot enlightening, it answered my questions better than my teacher could and want to know your thoughts on whether it can be relied upon to learn psychology.

For corporations, the integration of ChatGPT can dramatically personalize learning experiences. AI can quickly assess the needs of individual employees, tailoring training modules that suit their skill levels and learning pace, ultimately enhancing the efficacy of professional development.

In education, ChatGPT's utility goes beyond just personalized tutoring. It offers a dynamic interactive platform where students can engage in one-on-one dialogue, explore concepts, and receive instant feedback on their understanding. This kind of engagement was previously limited to human interactions, which could be resource-intensive.

Moreover, the ability to access a versatile AI tutor around the clock democratizes education, breaking barriers for students who may not have the means or opportunity to engage with human experts easily. It supports diverse learning pathways and can cater to different languages and learning preferences, potentially leveling the educational playing field.

Despite its potential, there are valid concerns regarding the over-reliance on AI for learning. Critical thinking and human touch in education remain irreplaceable, and striking the right balance is key. There's also the matter of data privacy and the ethical use of AI in educational settings that needs addressing.

How many times have you had to manually transcribe your handwritten notes to the computer?

GPT-4o can be your professional transcriber. I love this use case because now, I can transcribe my handwritten notes to the computer simply by taking a photo and asking ChatGPT to transcribe it.

GPT-4o can also transcribe text from books, documents, or even PDFs. This is very useful as it allows you to quickly extract text from various sources, saving time and effort that would otherwise be spent on manual data entry.

**Here you can get Free 1500+ ChatGPT Prompt Templates Collection. This will help your productivity a lot.** [**Get it here**](https://productcanyon.com/product/ai-prompts-templates/)

# 2. Your Color Matching Consultant

GPT-4o is a super accurate eyedropper. If you want to know the exact color of anything, you can simply ask our AI tool, GPT-4o.

It will tell you the exact Pantone or HEX color so that you can have it as a reference.

# 3. Nutrition Advisor

Are you tracking your food macros? Do you know the exact nutritional profile of your meal?

For a long time, I didn’t track my food macros. Nor did I know the exact nutritional profile of each meal. But when I started using GPT-4o, I learned that just taking a photo of my dinner plate can provide an accurate nutritional profile, including calories, protein, fat, carbohydrates, and even vitamins and minerals.

Note, however, that AIs are still quite biased, so if you really want legitimate nutritional advice, the best thing to do is to do your own research or consult a nutritionist.

# 4. Complex Concept Clarification Specialist

This is one of my favorite GPT-4o use cases. If you have a complex chart or diagram, you can ask GPT-4o to explain it in a simple manner.

When I see something complex, like a diagram or a chart for which I would like to have a detailed explanation, I simply ask GPT-4o to break it down for me in easy-to-understand terms. I sometimes prompt, “Explain it to me as if I’m 10 years old.” :)

This saves you tons of time by providing a direct, simple answer, rather than having to Google search and open different websites until you find what you need.

If you are a student or academic, GPT-4o can also be a great tutor, explaining complex concepts in detail.

# 5 . Book Guru

A couple of weeks ago, I went to the library, and a book caught my eye. What exactly is this book about? Is it worth reading? I asked ChatGPT and got quite a clear answer.

GPT-4o can give you the answer! Ask the AI to give you a digest of the book or feedback on the book recommendations, and you will instantly get an idea of what the book is about.

# 6. Your Translation Master

Whenever you are in a new country, you need an app to help you translate things, right? It could be a label, a restaurant menu, a banner, or a sign.

How many times have you had to manually transcribe your handwritten notes to the computer?

GPT-4o can be your professional transcriber. I love this use case because now, I can transcribe my handwritten notes to the computer simply by taking a photo and asking ChatGPT to transcribe it.

GPT-4o can also transcribe text from books, documents, or even PDFs. This is very useful as it allows you to quickly extract text from various sources, saving time and effort that would otherwise be spent on manual data entry.

# 2. Your Color Matching Consultant

GPT-4o is a super accurate eyedropper. If you want to know the exact color of anything, you can simply ask our AI tool, GPT-4o.

It will tell you the exact Pantone or HEX color so that you can have it as a reference.

# 3. Nutrition Advisor

Are you tracking your food macros? Do you know the exact nutritional profile of your meal?

For a long time, I didn’t track my food macros. Nor did I know the exact nutritional profile of each meal. But when I started using GPT-4o, I learned that just taking a photo of my dinner plate can provide an accurate nutritional profile, including calories, protein, fat, carbohydrates, and even vitamins and minerals.

Note, however, that AIs are still quite biased, so if you really want legitimate nutritional advice, the best thing to do is to do your own research or consult a nutritionist.

# 4. Complex Concept Clarification Specialist

This is one of my favorite GPT-4o use cases. If you have a complex chart or diagram, you can ask GPT-4o to explain it in a simple manner.

When I see something complex, like a diagram or a chart for which I would like to have a detailed explanation, I simply ask GPT-4o to break it down for me in easy-to-understand terms. I sometimes prompt, “Explain it to me as if I’m 10 years old.” :)

This saves you tons of time by providing a direct, simple answer, rather than having to Google search and open different websites until you find what you need.

If you are a student or academic, GPT-4o can also be a great tutor, explaining complex concepts in detail.

# 5 . Book Guru

A couple of weeks ago, I went to the library, and a book caught my eye. What exactly is this book about? Is it worth reading? I asked ChatGPT and got quite a clear answer.

GPT-4o can give you the answer! Ask the AI to give you a digest of the book or feedback on the book recommendations, and you will instantly get an idea of what the book is about.

1hobh7h,1,2024-12-28,Would you try smart glasses for language translation?,u/heyimryn,LanguageTechnology,https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1hobh7h/would_you_try_smart_glasses_for_language/,"Hello!

I posted this yesterday, but I'm gonna post it again lol. I'm looking for more responses and opinions, and would love to hear from you. All comments and opinions are appreciated.

For background info, I am a student at McMaster University and my team is participating in the Design for Change Challenge. We are designing a concept for AI-powered smart glasses that uses AR overlays to display translated text in real time for English as an Additional Language (EAL) students. The goal is to make education more equitable, accessible and inclusive for all. Our target audience is EAL students.

Our concept for the smart glasses is purely conceptual as we will not actually be creating a physical prototype or product.

Here is our concept: 

We will develop wearable language translator smart glasses that are powered by a GPT engine which uses speech recognition and voice recognition technology, enabling users to speak in their native language. The smart glasses automatically translates what is said into English and displays on the lens using AR overlays to display the text in real time. There will be a built-in microphone that will detect the spoken language, and will capture real-time speech and transmit it to the Speech-to-Text (STT) system. Using Neural Machine Translation (NMT) technology (what Google Translate uses), the text will be sent to the GPT model to process NMT results through Large Language Models (e.g., ChatGPT or BERT) for cultural and idiomatic accuracy, ensuring nuanced communication.

As speech recognition technology is not very good for people with accents and is biased toward North American users, we can use Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to train the GPT model using diverse datasets that include different accents, speech patterns and dialects, which we will collect from audio samples. We can also use Adaptive Learning (AL) algorithms to fine-tune voice recognition technology so the GPT model recognizes the user's voice, speech patterns, dialects, pronunciation, and accent. We will mitigate bias using a bias-free model such as BERT or RoBERTa.

We will also collaborate with corporations and governments to ensure ongoing funding and resources, making the program a long-term solution for English language learners across Canada and beyond.

Some features of our smart glasses are:

\- The glasses will create denotative translations that breaks down phrases into its literal meaning (e.g. 'it's raining cats and dogs' would be translated to 'it's raining hard') so that EAL students can understand English idioms or figures of speech. 

\- The smart glasses also would have an app that can be paired with the smart glasses using bluetooth or a wifi connection. The app would act as a control hub and would have accessibility features (high contrast, larger text, etc), customization (e.g., settings to change the font size of the text that will be displayed on the lenses), volume control, noise cancellation, etc.

\- The smart glasses would also allow users to view their translations through the app (like a transcription), which can be stored on the user's hard drive or in the cloud, and allow them to add new words to their language dictionary. There would also be subject-specific dictionaries with professional jargon related to fields of study (e.g., law, medicine, business, etc.), as EAL students often struggle with understanding specific jargon related to their field of study. 

\- There would also be an option for prescription lenses through a partnership with optical companies (e.g., lensology).

\- For visually-impaired individuals, there will be audio output, so that they can listen to the translations instead of looking at them through the AR overlay. Anyone can use the audio output if they choose to, not just visually-impaired individuals.

Would anyone be interested in this? I would love to hear your thoughts and perspective! Any insight is greatly appreciated. We are using human-centered design methodologies and would love to learn about your pain points and what frustrates you about learning English and studying in an English-speaking institution as an international/exchange student. Everyone is welcome to share their thoughts, not just international/exchange students.",User_deleted,0
1hpd7tg,1,2024-12-29,Built an AI Study Tool for My University - 676 Active Users & University Workshop Invite in Just 3 Days - https://exammakerai.com/,u/Primary_Ferret1254,microsaas,https://www.reddit.com/r/microsaas/comments/1hpd7tg/built_an_ai_study_tool_for_my_university_676/,"Hey Everybody,

I wanted to share something cool that started as a simple idea to help people learn better. Three days ago, I launched Exam Maker AI in the Netherlands at my university, and honestly, I wasn't expecting much – I just wanted to put it out there and see what happens.

Here's what's happened so far:

676 students are actively using it

2,990 exams have been generated

And the part that blew my mind was that I was invited to do a workshop at my university for 200 students on how to study with AI.

Why did I build this? Simple. I was tired of the old way of studying – you know, that endless cycle of reading, highlighting, and hoping you're focusing on the right stuff. I thought there had to be a better way to test yourself and learn the material.



Here's what Exam Maker AI does:

Drop in any text, PDF, or image you're studying from

Get instant multiple-choice questions that actually make sense

Works for literally any subject, language or difficulty

Keeps everything straightforward and focused on real learning



Look, I know ChatGPT can help you learn new stuff. But here's what's different: we're not trying to replace studying – we're just making it way more efficient. The students using it tell me they're catching gaps in their knowledge they wouldn't have found otherwise.

Right now, we've got this New Year's deal: unlimited exam generations for $9. Not trying to be pushy, but if you're a student or just someone who wants to learn new things faster, it's worth checking out.

The response so far has been honestly surprising, and while 676 users might not sound like much to some people, every single student using this to improve their learning means something to me.

If you want to try it out, head over to www.exammakerai.com. No pressure – just putting this out there for anyone who might find it useful.",User_deleted,2
1hpsg53,1,2024-12-30,ChatGPT Boosts Productivity: Key Sectors Undergoing Major Transformations,u/cporter202,ChatGPTautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTautomation/comments/1hpsg53/chatgpt_boosts_productivity_key_sectors/,"As AI continues to make leaps and bounds, ChatGPT, OpenAI's conversational model, is at the forefront of enhancing efficiency across various industries. Let's examine the key sectors experiencing significant changes due to the integration of this advanced technology.

In the realm of customer service, ChatGPT aids in managing large volumes of inquiries by offering quick, standardized responses. This instant communication capability allows human operators to focus on more complex issues, thereby elevating the overall customer experience.

Healthcare sees the implementation of ChatGPT in streamlining administrative tasks such as scheduling and patient queries. This reduces the burden on medical staff, allowing them to dedicate more time to patient care. Moreover, ChatGPT supports information dissemination by translating medical jargon into more understandable language for patients, thereby improving healthcare literacy.

Education has embraced ChatGPT as an assistive tool, where it helps create personalized learning experiences. The technology can generate quizzes, provide explanations, and even tutor students on a one-on-one basis. It's proving invaluable for educators, offering an additional resource to enhance teaching methods and content delivery.

The technology is also making waves in content creation. Writers and marketers use ChatGPT for brainstorming sessions, first drafts, and even to refine copy for target audiences. This AI-driven approach leads to increased productivity by saving time on initial content development and enabling a quicker turnaround for polished, ready-to-publish material.

In the coding and development space, ChatGPT lends a helping hand by debugging code and suggesting improvements, thus acting as an on-demand programming assistant. This allows developers to resolve issues more swiftly and spend more time on other critical tasks like feature innovation and software design.

Finally, in the legal sector, ChatGPT can process and summarize large volumes of legal texts, contracts, and case files, providing a valuable starting point for analysis. While it's no substitute for a lawyer's nuanced understanding, it significantly cuts down on preliminary research time.

The common thread across all these sectors is the theme of efficiency. By off-loading repetitive and time-intensive tasks to ChatGPT, professionals can refocus their attention on work that requires a human touch — creative, strategic, and empathetic thinking. It's imperative that as we integrate such AI tools into various fields, we stay mindful of maintaining the balance between automated assistance and human expertise. The challenge ahead lies in harnessing this technology's potential while ensuring it complements rather than replaces the irreplaceable value of human labor.",active,1

The main complaints about undergrads in 2024 seem to be: too much ChatGPT; insulting & whiny evals; can't take criticism; won't do the readings. Certainly, many students tick some of these boxes and some tick all. 

&nbsp;

It makes me wonder, though: what would the complaints of 2014, 2004, and 1994 have been? Can any old-timers remember? If r/professors was around back then, what would the top posts have complained about? Surely my generation of undergrads were no angels... or were they? I'm too old to remember...",active,85
