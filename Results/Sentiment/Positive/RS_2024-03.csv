I wanted to initiate a discussion on the diverse impacts that ChatGPT and similar AI tools are having on virtual learning and the efficiency of corporate training programs.

ChatGPT has opened doors for personalized learning experiences, providing on-demand support to learners by answering questions, explaining complex concepts, and offering resources. In a virtual classroom, this can contribute significantly to engaging students who might otherwise feel isolated or disconnected.

From a corporate training perspective, ChatGPT can streamline the onboarding process for new employees by providing instant answers to their queries, which potentially frees up human resources for more strategic tasks. The tool can also maintain a consistent training experience across different sessions and trainers, ensuring all employees receive the same information.

Moreover, AI's adaptability allows it to tailor content based on individual performance and feedback, leading to more effective learning outcomes. This could be particularly beneficial in developing soft skills, such as communication or leadership, which traditionally don’t lend themselves well to a one-size-fits-all approach.

However, there are concerns about how much we should rely on AI in these educational contexts, especially in terms of the accuracy of information, the lack of human touch, and the potential biases in AI responses.

I’m curious to hear your perspectives. How do you see ChatGPT shaping the future of education and corporate training? What have been your experiences with AI in learning environments so far? Let's delve into the pros and cons and discuss how we can ensure that the integration of AI like ChatGPT in virtual learning is done in a way that benefits everyone involved.",active,1

## Introduction

***Name:*** *Asksia ,* ***Website:*** [*www.asksia.ai*](http://www.asksia.ai) *,* ***Category:*** *Education + AI*

Student can ask any academic question and Asksia will instantly provide step-by-step answers. We have the functionality combining Chegg and ChatGPT, but we’re more AI than Chegg and more academic focused than ChatGPT. 

## Product Feature (1): Asksia vs ChatGPTs

OpenAI's current strongest product is GPTs, which is based on OpenAI's most advanced model, GPT-4, and equipped with a unified tool interface, program coding, DALLE·3, and internet capabilities. Even so, as a general-purpose product, it has many shortcomings in the service experience in educational scenarios.

Asksia focuses on excelling in educational scenarios, centering on students' many learning pain points, needs, and habits to optimize product functionality. It integrates many details with GPT-4, allowing every student to experience high-quality learning on the Asksia platform.

## 1. Detailed steps showcase

Even the most advanced GPTs products can not explain each small question in detail, step by step; they tend to become lazy with subsequent questions.

In contrast, we at Asksia have a reasonable approach to ensure that every small question receives a detailed explanation. Research has also found that when models are able to break down their thought processes in detail, step by step, the accuracy tends to be higher.

## 3. Precise and automatic video link

Asksia is capable of automatically linking to appropriate explanatory videos and verifying their availability, ensuring that learners are provided with the explanatory videos they need the most.

Although openai launched GPTs, its threshold is low, a large number of user-created agents can not handle more precise problems. Even if the **@ function** is used to link multiple agents, it still cannot provide appropriate external links according to the problem to enhance the learning experience.

I want to ask for help on a specific topic. My sister, a Grade 11 student, is asking help for her research. She's a very competitive kid and desires to produce a very good research project. When her advisor mentioned that proposals on mathematical problems are 'rare', because scientific ones are more preferred, she decided to explore a mathematical topic that would give her an advantage in terms of awards and recognition.

Some context: I completed a Math program in college, which is why she approached me for help, even though I didn't exactly pursue that field. It's been almost 10 years since I last faced challenging Math problems. Since college, I haven't had many opportunities to apply those concepts, except for perhaps the logical aspect, as I got into the tech field (started out as a programmer). I genuinely want to help her, as this could increase her chances of getting into a good university for college, but I'm aware that my knowledge on this subject is limited, and we need guidance.

—
The approved topic (no official title yet) is: ""Optimizing the waste collection process in a city to minimize transportation costs and maximize the efficiency of waste disposal.""

After doing some online research, I came across the concept of Maximal Flow, which seems relevant to the topic. I also discovered the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm, which could potentially be our method if applicable and feasible.

Now, here are my questions:

1. Is the research topic good / suitable? Does it make sense? We proposed other topics, but this one was approved.
2. Is the concept of Maximal Flow applicable to this topic?
3. Is the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm the best choice for a high school research project? (Timeline may be around 3-8months depending on the complexity)
4. I'm having trouble finding comprehensive resources online that explain the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm thoroughly. Could you recommend reliable resources where we can learn the concept and most importantly, its application effectively? This could be a book, video resource, article, etc.
5. Do you have any idea what data we would need for this topic? Which data should we gather to input into the algorithm?
6. I'm considering whether this could be solved through programming. I have a it of understanding of Python because to my job... So, do you know of any resources, like a GitHub repo that has a program that solves Ford-Fulkerson problems?

I've considered seeking assistance from ChatGPT for this, including the coding aspect, but I'm hesitant. I only want to include factual information in my sister's paper. Additionally, I read the rules/notes in this sub about not using ChatGPT for computations.

I'm glad I found this subreddit and see helpful people here. I hope my questions are appropriate, and I truly appreciate any assistance. Thank you in advance.

I offer a private tutoring service for artificial intelligence and machine learning in python. I am currently studying a Masters in Physics with Computing at the University of Bristol.  I can help you progress from an absolute beginner to an advanced practitioner in this subject. I will help you build up a unique portfolio in this area and the necessary skills to obtain a job in the field. 

My teaching style is concise, friendly, patient, and thorough. I tailor my lessons based on your specific needs as a student. I will use your feedback and my intuition to ensure you improve your abilities. The lessons are goal orientated.

 I will support you by identifying and fixing areas where you are struggling, this will improve your confidence and will have a radical effect on your performance. I will work with you to improve your organisation, workflow, efficiency, work ethic, problem solving ability, motivation, and knowledge of the subject. 

I am also always available to contact via email if there are any difficulties with the exercises set so as not to impede progress between lessons. I can even jump online for a short, free chat if requested. 

If you have any more questions regarding my method or would like to see a full course structure let me know and we can book a 15 min free chat, or we can jump straight into an hour lesson. 

In terms of my programming tuition we will focus on interesting projects and learn by doing. This will contribute to your portfolio.

Some examples of the awesome worlds we could explore are:

Simulating: Solar Systems, Disease Transmission, Ecosystems, Particle Collisions and much more 

Creating: Large Language Models, Neural Nets, Reinforcement Learning, Games and much more.

I have had 5 years of tutoring experience in mathematics, physics, and programming. Over 5 years,  I’ve completed around 1000+ hours of tuition.  Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

I am passionate about tutoring and love my job! Please don't hesitate to get in contact if you have any questions. Message me on reddit if you would like to talk more!",User_deleted,2
