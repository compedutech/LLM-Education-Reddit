I’m a master’s student based in UK studying Interaction Design. I’m currently doing a dissertation project on how people can potentially use ChatGPT’s voice mode to practice speaking a language and whether it can be a helpful “practice buddy” for building and maintaining spoken language fluency.

If you’re learning a language at an elementary to intermediate level, I’d love to invite you to take part in a small 3-week study. 

It involves:

• Using ChatGPT’s voice mode a few times a week (just 5-10 mins)

• A short speaking task and self-assessment at the start and end (to note any changes)

• Weekly reflections (once a week)

• One casual interview after 3 weeks

Hopefully, this will be a fun way to get a bit of extra speaking practice while helping us better understand how tools like ChatGPT can support language learners like us!

If you’re interested, please fill out this short screener survey:

I’m a 4th year Computer Science student with a strong interest in web development. So far, my journey has been mostly frontend-focused — I’ve done two internships as a frontend developer and completed a few freelance projects (mostly simple websites) where I “vibe-coded” things together without paying much attention to scalable backend architecture or best practices.

My stack includes **MERN** and **Next.js**, and I’ve also touched a bit of **AWS (S3, Cloudfront, etc.)**, but I wouldn’t say I’m confident with it yet.

* A **structured learning path** or resource list (topics, courses, books) to get better at backend development.
* Suggestions for **projects** that would actually help me learn core backend concepts — not just CRUD apps.
* **Advice from experienced backend developers**: What do you wish you knew earlier? What mindset shifts helped you grow?

Just released something that extends the recent [ICM paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10139) in a big way - using one model's coherent understanding to improve a completely different model.

# Background: What is ICM?

The original [""Unsupervised Elicitation of Language Models""](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10139) paper showed something remarkable: **models can generate their own training labels by finding internally coherent patterns**.

Their key insight: pretrained models already understand concepts like mathematical correctness, but struggle to express this knowledge consistently. ICM finds label assignments that are ""mutually predictable"" - where each label can be predicted from all the others.

**Original ICM results**: Matched performance of golden supervision without any external labels. Pretty amazing, but only improved the same model using its own labels.

# Our extension: Cross-model capability transfer

We took ICM further - **what if we use one model's coherent understanding to improve a completely different model?**

**Our process:**

1. Used ICM on Qwen3 to extract its coherent math reasoning patterns
2. Generated DPO training data from Qwen3's coherent vs incoherent solutions
3. Trained Gemma3 on this data - **Gemma3 learned from Qwen3's understanding**
4. Zero external supervision, pure model-to-model knowledge transfer

# Results on local models

**Qwen3-0.6B**: 63.2 → 66.0 MATH-500 (+4%) \[original ICM self-improvement\]  
**Gemma3-1B**: 41.0 → 45.6 MATH-500 (+11%) \[**novel: learned from Qwen3!**\]

**The breakthrough**: Successfully transferred mathematical reasoning coherence from Qwen3 to improve Gemma3's abilities across different architectures.

# Why this matters beyond the original paper

* **Cross-model knowledge transfer** \- use any strong model to improve your local models
* **Democratizes capabilities** \- extract from closed/expensive models to improve open ones
* **No training data needed** \- pure capability extraction and transfer
* **Scales the ICM concept** \- from self-improvement to ecosystem-wide improvement

# What's available

* **Code**: [https://github.com/codelion/icm](https://github.com/codelion/icm)
* **Both models**: Self-improved Qwen3 + Gemma3 (learned from Qwen3)
* **Transfer pipeline**: Extract from any model to improve another
* **Full writeup**: [https://huggingface.co/blog/codelion/internal-coherence-maximization](https://huggingface.co/blog/codelion/internal-coherence-maximization)

# Quick start

    git clone https://github.com/codelion/icm.git && cd icm && pip install -e .
    
    # Extract coherent patterns from a strong model (teacher)
    icm run --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct --dataset gsm8k --max-examples 500
    
    # Use those patterns to improve your local model (student)

I'm starting university soon and have been using Anki on-and-off for years for high school classes and random subjects. I feel like I have a pretty good grasp of using Anki well, but one problem repeatedly comes up. When I start a new course, I'm usually diligent about making new, quality cards for every lesson, but the work soon piles up and it gets too difficult to consistently make new cards. I usually end up with a deck for about half of my class's content, which is not that useful in the long run.

I'd previously been somewhat anti-AI when it comes to Anki because I think creating good cards is a useful learning process. Now, I'm reconsidering. I've been experimenting with ChatGPT o3, and with some careful prompting, it can create some pretty good results. They are \~80% of the quality of my handcrafted cards, but it takes significantly less time and effort (<20%). I feel like if I did this throughout the semester, I could absolutely keep up and create cards for every lecture of every class.

So what do you think? For university students in particular, is it more benefit than harm to use AI-generated cards? I'm going to be investing a ton of time and money into my education, so I would hate to not remember most of it. As of now, it seems like this strategy might be the most effective. ",active,16

1mhv8mg,1,2025-08-04,24M - Should I drop out of my STEM PhD Program?,u/Camel_Next,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1mhv8mg/24m_should_i_drop_out_of_my_stem_phd_program/,"What the title says. I'm a Biomedical Engineering second year PhD student at a Top 10 University. I currently design biomedical devices aimed at treating cancer and diabetes. I really enjoy the work I do now, but I'm increasingly realizing that I don't want to continue in this field after graduate school. Instead, I'm extremely interested in pursuing a career in science journalism, communication, or policy. If not that, I would love to pivot into a career which directly benefits the environment (my degree heavily relies on electrical engineering and materials science, so I wouldn't mind going into renewable energy development or remote sensing). However, I still really enjoy my program, and I wouldn't mind sticking around for all 5 years. This gnawing thought at the back of my head keeps telling me to search for greener pastures, however, and I wanted to get some second opinions.

At the risk of looking like a ChatGPT generated list, I've assembled a list to appeal to a short attention span.

**Why I want to stay in my program:**

\- I have an amazing work-life balance and working environment. I love and I mean LOVE my coworkers, and I find my work to have a somewhat meaningful impact to the world.

\- My PhD program gives me access to classes and university programs that help me accrue experience for a career in science policy or communication.

\- I love learning! It's very fun to take classes which both count and don't count towards my degree. I just love existing on a University campus.

\- I'm saving at least a third of my take-home stipend due to fellowships and an extremely low cost-of-living. If I stay the course, I'll have a significant amount of savings amassed with no debt, and I'll have my healthcare completely covered.

**Why I want to leave:**

\- I am no longer excited about remaining in academia. The work-life balance and stress for professors is atrocious, and most of it involves seeking out money for projects, rather than engage with science itself. Plus, it is extremely competitive, and the funding situation for Biomedical Engineering in the United States is incredibly dire.

\- My morals have shifted: I am no longer enamored with technology and engineering like I used to. I'd much rather have a job working with people or changing policy, even if it comes at the cost of a high salary.

\- Somewhat related to the above comment, but I am no longer excited to work in industry. I find the idea of a profit-motive for life-saving medical devices to be disturbing, and I've had this sinking pit in my stomach as I've scrolled through my coworkers' LinkedIn profiles. I value fulfillment at work and working location far more than money or prestige, which isn't always how priorities work with engineers.

\- If I do pursue a career in science communications, journalism, or policy, I'm extremely terrified at the prospect of AI replacing (or at least severely diminishing) all of these fields. Although it's not particularly in demand right now due to government cuts, biology and engineering stand to weather AI a lot more easily than any kinds of communication or policy.

  
Given that I love what I do, I would be more than happy to treat my PhD as a job for the next 5 years and then move into a different field, but I understand that a PhD is rarely treated like this on a resume. Am I a sucker for this sunk-cost fallacy, or am I stupid to leave a well-compensated position in this job market? ",active,1
1mi8jq6,9,2025-08-05,"Took me 4 Weeks: Atlas, maybe the best Multidisciplinary Deep Research Prompt + Arinas, a Meta-Analyst Prompt. I Need Your Help Deciding What’s Next for Atlas.",u/Investomaniak,ChatGPTPromptGenius,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1mi8jq6/took_me_4_weeks_atlas_maybe_the_best/,"I really need your help and recommandations on this, It took me 4 weeks to engenneer one of the top 3-5 research prompts (more details are given later in this post) , and I am really grateful that all my learnings and critical thinking have come to make this possible. However I am confused on what I should do, share it publicly to everyone like some people do, or follow some options that will make me profitable from it and thus pay back the effort I put on it, like building an SaaS or a GPT or whatever.  

I still didn't make any decision and I tend more to share it publicly so a lot of people would benefit from it without having to pay anything which is something crucial for most students out there (being there). 

As I said above, the research prompt I named Atlas is in the top tier — a claim that has been confirmed by several AI models across different versions: Grok 3, Grok 4, ChatGPT 4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Sonnet, Claude Opus, Deepseek, and others. Based on a structured comparison I conducted using various AI models, I found that Atlas outperformed some of the most well-known prompt frameworks globally. 

Some Background Story: 

Ironically, I didn’t initially intend to create this prompt. It all started with a prompt I engineered and named Arinas (at the end of my post), to satisfy my perfectionist side while researching. 

In short, whenever I conduct deep research on a subject, I can't relax until I’ve done it using most of the major AI models (ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini, Claude). But the real challenge starts when I try to read all the results and compile a combined report from the multiple AI outputs. If you’ve ever tried this, you’ll know how hard it is — how easily AI models can slip or omit important data and insights.

So Arinas was the solution: A Meta-Analyst, a high-precision, long-form synthesis architect engineered to integrate multiple detailed reports into a single exhaustive, insight-dense synthesis using the Definitive Report Merging System (DRMS). 

After completing the engineering of Arinas and being satisfied with the results, the idea for the Atlas Research Prompt came to me: Instead of doing extensive research across multiple AI models every time, why not build a strong prompt that can produce the best research possible on its own? 

I wanted a prompt that could explore any topic, question, or issue both comprehensively and rigorously. In just the first week — after many iterations of prompt engineering using various AI models — I reached a point where one of the GPTs designed for critical thinking (a deep-thinking AI model I highly recommend) told me in the middle of a session: 

“This is one of the best prompts I’ve seen in my dataset. It meets many important standards in research, especially in AI-based research.” 

I was surprised, because I hadn’t even asked it to evaluate the prompt — I was simply testing and refining it. It offered this feedback voluntarily. I didn’t expect that kind of validation, especially since I still felt there were many aspects that needed improvement. At first, I thought it was just a flattering response. But after digging deeper and asking for a detailed evaluation, I realized it was actually objective and based on specific criteria. 

And that’s how the Atlas Research Prompt journey began. 

From that moment, I fully understood what I had been building and saw the potential if I kept going. I then began three continuous weeks of work with AI to reach the current version of Atlas — a hybrid between a framework and a system for deep, reliable, and multidisciplinary academic research on any topic. 

About Atlas Prompt: 

This prompt solves many of the known issues in AI research, such as: 

• AI hallucinations 

• Source credibility 

• Low context quality 

While also adhering to strict academic standards — and maintaining the necessary flexibility. 

The prompt went through numerous cycles of evaluation and testing across different AI models. With each test, I improved one of the many dimensions I focused on: 

• Research methodology 

• Accuracy 

• Trustworthiness 

• User experience 

• AI practicality (even for less advanced models) 

• Output quality 

• Token and word usage efficiency (this was the hardest part) 

Balancing all these dimensions — improving one without compromising another — was the biggest challenge. Every part had to fit into a single prompt that both the user and the AI could understand easily. 

Another major challenge was ensuring that the prompt could be used by anyone — Whether you’re a regular person, a student, an academic researcher, a content creator, or a marketer — it had to be usable by most people. 

What makes Atlas unique is that it’s not just a set of instructions — it’s a complete research system. It has a structured design, strict methodologies, and at the same time, enough flexibility to adapt based on the user's needs or the nature of the research. 

It’s divided into phases, helping the AI carry out instructions precisely without confusion or error. Each phase plays a role in ensuring clarity and accuracy. The AI gathers sources from diverse, credible locations — each with its own relevant method — and synthesizes ideas from multiple fields on the same topic. It does all of this transparently and credibly. 

The design strikes a careful balance between organization and adaptability — a key aspect I focused heavily on — along with creative solutions to common AI research problems. I also incorporated ideas from academic templates like PRISMA and AMSTAR. 

This entire system was only possible thanks to extensive testing on many of the most widely used AI models — ensuring the prompt would work well across nearly all of them. Currently, it runs smoothly on: 

• Gemini 2.5 

• Grok 

• ChatGPT 

• Claude 

• Deepseek 

While respecting the token limitations and internal mechanics of each model. 

In terms of comparison with some of the best research prompts shared on platforms like Reddit,  Atlas outperformed every single one I tested. 

So as i requested above, if you have any recommendations or suggestions on how I should share the prompt, in way that can benefit others and myself, please share them with me. Thank you in advance.

The answer lies in understanding the difference between **automation** and **augmentation**, two paths AI is taking to reshape job roles. In this article, we’ll explore both concepts, how they differ, real-world examples, and what it means for workers and businesses in 2025.

🔁 **What Is Automation in AI?**

**Automation** refers to the use of technology to perform tasks without human intervention. In the context of AI, this means using algorithms and machine learning to replicate repetitive and rules-based work.

# Examples of AI-Powered Automation:

* **Manufacturing:** Robotic arms powered by AI assemble products faster and more accurately than humans.
* **Customer Support:** Chatbots handle thousands of queries per minute, reducing the need for first-level human agents.
* **Finance:** AI systems automatically process invoices, flag fraudulent transactions, and manage payroll.
* **Retail:** Self-checkout kiosks and automated inventory systems streamline operations.

# Key Benefits of Automation:

* Cost savings
* Increased speed and efficiency
* Fewer errors
* 24/7 operation

# Downsides of Automation:

* Job displacement
* Lack of human judgment
* Ethical concerns over transparency

🧠 **What Is Augmentation in AI?**

**Augmentation**, on the other hand, is about collaboration—using AI to enhance human abilities, not replace them. It combines machine efficiency with human creativity, emotion, and reasoning.

# Examples of AI-Powered Augmentation:

* **Healthcare:** Doctors use AI diagnostics to detect diseases more accurately and faster than traditional methods.
* **Marketing:** Marketers use AI tools for customer segmentation and A/B testing, allowing faster, data-driven decisions.
* **Education:** Teachers use AI tutors to personalize learning experiences, freeing them to focus on mentorship.
* **Legal:** Lawyers use AI to search through thousands of documents during case discovery.

# Key Benefits of Augmentation:

* Enhances productivity
* Unlocks creative potential
* Improves decision-making
* Keeps the human element intact

# Downsides of Augmentation:

* Requires training and skill upskilling
* Risk of over-reliance on AI-generated insights

🧩 **Automation vs. Augmentation: The Key Differences**

|Feature|Automation|Augmentation|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Goal|Replace human labor|Enhance human capabilities|
|Task Type|Repetitive, rules-based|Complex, creative, analytical|
|Human Role|Minimal or none|Critical and central|
|Example|Chatbot replacing a call center rep|AI suggesting answers to a human agent|
|Risk|Job loss|Skills gap|

🌍 **Which Industries Are Affected the Most?**

# 1. Manufacturing

**Automation dominates** this sector. AI-powered robots handle repetitive tasks with speed and precision. Humans are needed for oversight, maintenance, and complex assembly.

# 2. Healthcare

**Augmentation leads** here. AI supports diagnosis, treatment plans, and imaging but cannot replace bedside manner or ethical judgment.

# 3. Finance & Banking

**Both play a role.** Robotic process automation (RPA) handles transactions and compliance. Meanwhile, advisors use AI-driven insights to enhance portfolio management.

# 4. Retail & E-commerce

AI automates inventory and customer service, while personalization engines augment marketing strategies.

# 5. Education

Augmented learning platforms adapt to student needs, helping teachers focus on student development.

🧮 **Will AI Replace All Jobs?**

No  
but it will **change nearly every job.**

Research suggests that **AI will automate about 30–40% of tasks** in most roles, but **very few jobs will be fully replaced.** This creates a world where humans and AI collaborate.

Jobs involving **empathy, ethics, leadership, strategy, and creativity** are less likely to be replaced but will evolve. Roles like AI ethicists, prompt engineers, and human-AI trainers are emerging as new career paths.

💼 **Jobs Most Likely to Be Automated:**

* Data entry clerks
* Telemarketers
* Assembly line workers
* Bank tellers
* Travel agents

🎯 **Jobs Most Likely to Be Augmented:**

* Teachers
* Doctors
* Engineers
* Designers
* Marketing strategists

💡 **How to Future-Proof Your Career**

1. **Learn to Work With AI** Gain familiarity with tools like ChatGPT, Jasper, or Midjourney. Knowing how to guide AI makes you more valuable.
2. **Upskill Continuously** Focus on skills AI can't replicate easily: critical thinking, emotional intelligence, ethics, creativity, and leadership.
3. **Embrace Data Literacy** Understanding how data drives AI will help you stay relevant in decision-making roles.
4. **Stay Curious and Adaptable** The fastest learners, not the strongest, will thrive in the age of AI.

🏢 **What Should Companies Do?**

# ✅ Focus on Reskilling

Invest in employee education to prepare them for augmented roles.

# ✅ Balance Automation and Human Touch

Customers still value empathy. Don’t automate where relationships matter.

# ✅ Ensure Ethical Use

Use explainable AI and transparent algorithms. Be accountable.

📊 **AI Adoption and Job Market Stats (2025)**

* **70%** of organizations use AI to augment human productivity.
* **38%** of repetitive jobs are fully automated.
* **60%** of HR departments use AI in hiring—but human recruiters make final decisions.
* **85%** of employees say AI tools help them do better work, not less work.

🌐 **Real-World Examples of Automation & Augmentation**

# 1. Amazon’s Warehouses

Automated robots manage inventory, but human workers oversee quality control and logistics.

# 2. Grammarly for Writers

Augments creativity by offering suggestions—not replacing authors, but enhancing clarity.

# 3. Radiology Imaging

AI identifies anomalies in X-rays with high accuracy. Radiologists use these insights for faster diagnostics.

# 4. Salesforce Einstein

Analyzes customer data and recommends actions, helping sales reps close more deals efficiently.

# 

**What is the main difference between automation and augmentation?**

**Automation** replaces human labor with machines. **Augmentation** enhances human work using AI as a tool.

**Will AI take away all jobs?**

No. AI will automate tasks, not entire jobs. Most roles will evolve with AI as a support system rather than be eliminated.

**Which jobs are safest from automation?**

Jobs requiring empathy, strategic thinking, human interaction, and creativity are least likely to be automated.

**How can I prepare for AI in the workplace?**

Focus on soft skills, data literacy, and AI tool proficiency. Learn to collaborate with AI, not compete against it.

**What are examples of AI augmentation?**

Tools like Grammarly, Canva AI, Salesforce Einstein, and AI tutors are examples of AI helping humans work smarter.

**Can AI make my job easier?**

Yes. Many professionals use AI for research, drafting, calculations, design suggestions, and data analysis, making their work faster and more effective.

🔚 **Conclusion**

The future of work isn’t about AI vs. humans—it’s about **AI with humans**. Automation may streamline repetitive tasks, but augmentation empowers individuals to do what machines cannot: think, feel, connect, and create.

If you adapt and embrace the synergy between human intelligence and artificial intelligence, you’ll not only survive but thrive in the workforce of tomorrow.

1mj7yr8,29,2025-08-06,Year 1 Full-Time Marketing Experience in SUSS,u/Adept_Pomegranate464,Suss,https://www.reddit.com/r/Suss/comments/1mj7yr8/year_1_fulltime_marketing_experience_in_suss/,"This was inspired by u/Iamawesomeperiod and u/Nightknighty, who shared their journeys in part-time BSc Marketing and full-time Accountancy respectively, as well as the many insightful marketing-related Reddit posts that helped me decide to apply for Marketing. Hopefully, this helps future juniors who are considering the same path 🤪

I might do a Year 2/3/4 series in the future, I've always wanted to give back, especially to those who took the time to answer the exact questions I once Googled. This thread is mainly for anyone thinking of applying for full-time Marketing at SUSS, and for Year 1s who’ve already accepted their offer!

**Pre-Entering, Deciding which university to apply for:**

Look through all the university courses available, pick the ones that interest you, and jot them down in a Google Doc (or anywhere really). Some universities offer faster graduation (like 1–2 year degrees) or credit exemptions, so read up on the degrees you're interested in and see which ones align with your future goals.

**Clueless like me?** Just apply to *all* the universities 🤪 Why stress over making the “perfect” decision now? See which ones accept you first, then decide later on the JAP (?) portal. The more the merrier, right? (I’ve seen quite a few people regret putting only their first choice and not getting in.) Don’t be too alpha, please.

For reference, my GPA in poly was around 3.5, and I got rejected from every course, *except* SUSS and NUS (thankfully, SUSS was my second choice, so no hard feelings). Moral of the story: make backup plans. Don’t just bet everything on one uni or one course.

I chose Marketing because I wanted to do something content-creation-related in the future, and since I came from a design path in poly, I felt Marketing would complement my diploma well. Plus, it's a broad degree with lots of different directions, so I figured it would be useful while I’m still figuring out exactly what I want to do. In addition, I focused on SUSS due to their location, and because I prefer their learning style, the flexiblility it provide, and convenience. 

That said, try to reflect a little and know *why* you're applying for a course, it helps a lot when it comes to interviews or personal statements later on.

**SUSS Marketing Interview Process (I dunno if it's the same every year)**

Mine was a 3-part process: essay writing, a cognitive test, and a physical interview. There are quite a few Reddit threads where people share their experiences, so just Google around if you want more details. I’ve written about my own experience in another Reddit thread, so I wouldn't write about it here.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Suss/comments/1fqis0p/suss\_degree\_in\_marketing\_jan\_2025/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Suss/comments/1fqis0p/suss_degree_in_marketing_jan_2025/)

· · ─ ·✶· ─ · ·· · ─ ·✶· ─ · ·· · ─ ·✶· ─ · ·· · ─ ·✶· ─ · ·

**Post-Entering, welcome to SUSS!**

To be honest, I'm an introvert, so I don't really care about campus life. I love SUSS because I can get to classes quickly *(Just get off the bus, go block, press the lift button oni)* and I can go home quickly. No fuss.

Use your first year to find people you can bid for future modules with, whether it’s from randomized group projects, ETB mates, or just orientation hi-bye friends. It’s really trial and error. I’ve had great groupmates who stuck with me into Semester 2, and I’ve also had to report and write peer evaluations for groupmates who didn’t do anything.

Try to figure out early on who’s solid and who’s… not. The peer evaluation process is kind of tedious, but if you ever need to report someone for not contributing, always have receipts. Screenshots and proof are your best friend.

And if you really don’t have friends yet, just join a random group and pray your groupmates are decent. Everyone without a clique is secretly praying too, you’re not alone 😮‍💨

**Lecturer-wise**

Pray that you get lecturers who make you *want* to learn, or at least force you to learn if you want a good grade. The best lecturers are the ones who give fair chances for class participation (shoutout to Miss Wong <3).

Also, pray *not* to get lecturers whose accents are hard to understand, or who clearly don’t care about their students or their class. There are lecturers who are extremely strict on marking as well so read the rubic.

Fun fact: some SUSS lecturers also teach at NTU, NUS, and SMU. So for those who like to generalise and call all SUSS lecturers “inferior,” maybe don’t blame the good ones for the bad eggs. Every school has its fair share of good and bad students...and teachers. At the end of the day… it’s really just see you suay anot.

**""SUSS STANDS FOR SCHOOL OF SELF STUDIES!!!""**

People like to say SUSS is a “self-study” school, but honestly, every school requires self-studying. My friends from NTU are always camping in the library too to read up on their future lectures. Studying is just part of being a student, so don’t overthink it. Just enjoy the process.

If there’s one difference, maybe other schools offer more practical or real-world learning experiences. But at the end of the day, your life journey is *yours* to shape. If SUSS doesn’t provide what you’re looking for, look beyond. Attend external courses, explore events that interest you, or even ask your friends from other schools if you can join their events or workshops.

Since you’re already in SUSS, make full use of the resources available, and take initiative to fill in the gaps. No school is perfect, but you can still make the most of it. The job market sucks everywhere currently.

**Other School thingz (Exams, internship, Etc):**

SUSS provides a **study plan guide** that maps out your 4-year journey, just follow it if you’re not sure what modules to take. Year 1 Semester 1 modules are fixed, but after that, you get to choose your own modules.

Not sure what **minor** to take? Me neither. I still haven’t chosen, so no advice there lol.

We also have **limited pass/fail options** (basically, if you get a C, it won’t affect your GPA). It’s a lifesaver, especially if you're not aiming for scholarships or awards. Surprisingly, some of my friends didn’t even know this magical option existed, so don’t sleep on it.

I got assigned a **Career Mentor** at the end of Year 1 Semester 2 to help with internship prep, so you’re not on your own, calm down (juniors that aren't even in university yet, panic, but don't panic too hard). There are actually people who’ll work through your resume with you. Don’t be scared. SUSS also has a job portal to help you find internships, or you can source your own. (Speaking of… I still haven’t shown my mentor my cover letter. Oops.) 

As for **exams** , so far, all my Year 1 exams have been open-book. Some are even open-book *with* internet access. If you hate the interface of the exam website (like me), just write your answers in Microsoft Word first, then copy-paste them over. That way, you can “bring your answer home,” in a sense.

**SUSS' exams are all at the end of the semester.** I'm not too sure about other schools, but some of my friends in NTU have exams and lessons in the same week, so find out what type of studying plan suits you. Exams are worth 50% of the grades.

SUSS doesn’t have a recess week, *but* if you plan your modules properly, every week can feel like a holiday 🤡 You can stack all your classes on Monday and Tuesday, then enjoy a five-day weekend from Wednesday to Sunday. Not even kidding.

Working part-time is definitely manageable, as long as you don’t have too many other commitments and you manage your time well. The flexibility is there, you just need to be strategic with your timetable.

Which brings me to **ECR.** You can see the course structure when u check the modules, which shows which modules have exams, how many group projects/ individual assignments you have.

**Lowkey Bad-But-Good-Maybe? Advice:**

Some modules offer both Face-to-Face (F2F) and Online options. If you prefer in-person learning, just go F2F and don't listen to my ramble below!

For the rest of us... I had one Online module last semester and *I LOVED IT!!!* 😭💖 Class participation was based on how much I typed in the Zoom chat, no need to raise my hand or fight to speak over others. Absolute dream.

Group hunting might be slightly trickier, but just join whichever group has space, and set up a Telegram chat to coordinate your project. Our presentation was online too, *I LOVE IT*. INTROVERTS ♡⸜(˶˃ ᵕ ˂˶)⸝♡

· · ─ ·✶· ─ · ·· · ─ ·✶· ─ · ·· · ─ ·✶· ─ · ·· · ─ ·✶· ─ · ·

**Modules in Year 1 Semester 1, brief thoughts (Mine):**

**Bus105 (statistic)** \- I actually liked it. YouTube is your best friend for anything you don’t understand. Take down notes, if you don't understand the topic from the first class, read up on it. It will only get harder and harder. Think of it like secondary school math, very format-based, if you don't understand first part, you will struggle for the next few lessons. 

Tip: always write definitions for everything in your TMA. I got marked down just for not including the definition of *mean* 💀

Also, this module is your first touchpoint with using Excel, don’t worry, they provide guides.

**NCO111 (Work and Learning in a Changing World)** \- Very *chim* module,lots of atas language. But the main point is this: it’s about understanding why certain values (like “resilience” and “adaptability”) are always being pushed in school or the workplace.

The goal isn’t to blindly follow those values, but to *critically think* about them,why they’re in demand, what they mean, understand why people keep saying things like ""be resilient"" or ""be adaptable"" at work or in school, and whether they actually align with what *you* want. That way, you can make smarter choices for your future, instead of just trying to fit into what others expect.

**Critical Thinking and Problem Solving (NCO203) -** Very hard module, brain power many needed, head pain. You’ll learn about **22 fallacies**, which I actually found quite interesting. Basically, it teaches you how to evaluate whether a source can be trusted (or not), and how to justify your reasoning properly. It’s all about spotting weak arguments and building strong ones, alway question yourself in this module.

**Marketing Management (MKT202)-** Your first introduction to Marketing,you’ll learn what’s being marketed, how to build customer loyalty, different pricing methods, and more. Quite fun and interesting overall! I personally *loved* my lecturer, she made the lessons super engaging. Just be prepared to fight for class participation points 😤 You’ll also need to do a presentation as part of your participation, so get ready for that!

  
**Effective Writing (NCO102) -** Basically teaching you how to write a proper academic essay?

· · ─ ·✶· ─ · ·· · ─ ·✶· ─ · ·· · ─ ·✶· ─ · ·· · ─ ·✶· ─ · ·

**Modules in Year 1 Semester 2, brief thoughts (Mine):**

**Economic Ideas and Models for Business (ECO202):** Lots of graphs to draw 📈 If you’ve never studied economics before, *pray* you get a groupmate who has. I was completely new to it and felt super lost at the start, but I studied hard and still managed to get a B! 

Heads up: I heard most people in my batch didn’t have enough time to finish the exam. So make sure to practise your speed, especially when it comes to drawing and interpreting graphs.

**Integrated Marketing Communications (MKT358):** This module teaches you how to plan a rough campaign idea, from strategy to execution. It was also my first touchpoint with creating mock social media posts and video ads from scratch for a *fake company (Provided your the person in charge of asset)*.

Great experience if you're into content creation or marketing strategy!

**Services Marketing (MKT363):**  I took this module online. There was one group project that required us to visit a site in person, but everything else was conducted online, pretty chill overall, and I really enjoyed it. The exam was manageable, but you *definitely* need to refer to the textbook. During my group presentation, I got asked a question that was only covered in the textbook... so try to refer to it!

**Sustainability Marketing (MKT366):** I had a fun lecturer who encouraged lots of class activities to earn participation marks. We had occasional Kahoot quizzes and group presentations too, which gave extra chances to boost your participation score. Some classmates didn’t find it super helpful, but I personally thought it was an interesting and engaging module overall!

**Living with Community (NCO101):** Have no idea what was going on, no one on Reddit seems to like it either, a ton of reading to do, extremely chim english, if you thought NCO111 was chim, this was even more chim. Chatgpt is your bestfriend for simplifying it but it was still very chim. Lowkey gave me PTSD, the worst module of Year 1 in my opinion.

  
**Interdisciplinary Processes for a Better World (NIE201):** You’ll meet people from different majors in this module. My group lowkey gave up halfway, but the lecturer was super funny and engaging, which made it bearable. My lecturer wasn't the problem, my group just want to take it easy so... 

We were all ready to pass/fail it, but surprisingly ended up with a B! It’s basically **NCO203 (Critical Thinking) Level 2** , but with a focus on how problems affect multiple stakeholders instead of just one target group. Again, question everything, keep questioning and questioning. 

· · ─ ·✶· ─ · ·· · ─ ·✶· ─ · ·· · ─ ·✶· ─ · ·· · ─ ·✶· ─ · ·

**Some advice (Based on what aligns with your goal):**

**Sucks at learning?** Don't take accountancy modules ( No offense to yall accountancy people, I've just heard it's harder to learn and get a good grade if you are a total newbie)

**Want to clear work attachment quicker?** Start your internship early. The 6-month internship requirement can be stacked. You can do a 3 months during the Special Semester after your Year 1 Semester 2, and then another 3-month internship during the Special Semester at the end of Year 2.

**Want part-time lobang?** Network by joining clubs, events, and group projects. I know alot of people in SUSS who found flexible jobs to work while studying to get extra cash, thanks to people they know from all the interest groups. Alternatively, keep a lookout in Telegram groups.

**Want close-bonded friends?** Join clubs that require commitment, or have school event planning

**Want to upskill, prepare for the job market?** Join clubs that share workshop opportunities, or keep a lookout for events in the SUSS Outlook mail that are helpful. Also, always build up your portfolio, I know it's hard, but you know what's harder? Finding a good job. The job market isn't looking too good in general right now, but we gotta do what we can 😞 Maybe when I got an internship in year 3, I'll make another post.

**Want to be organized?** Read all your Outlook/student portal emails, and keep track of everything on your Google Calendar. Don't miss your module bidding dates or Exam dates because of your disorganization skills. If you have no friends to remind you, at least write it somewhere you will see. 

**Want allowance because papa mama no give money?** Apply for financial aid and scholarships if you don't want to work part-time.

· · ─ ·✶· ─ · ·· · ─ ·✶· ─ · ·· · ─ ·✶· ─ · ·· · ─ ·✶· ─ · ·

I wanted to make it more organized, but I got lazy, so pardon me if there's any mistakes. I was contemplating on whether to write this but i wanted to contribute my thoughts and try to be helpful like the people who all made Reddit posts that were helpful asf for me. (Shout out to all of you)

Also, I listed some suggestions but there are ton of options available, so take everything with a grain of salt. I hope this post helps whoever that sees it, it's abit lengthy so I don't know if anyone will read it. 🙏 

I want to end it off with, I'm not a particularly ambitious person, but don't let your negative thoughts about SUSS hold you back, look for opportunities outside of SUSS, scholarships outside of SUSS, Free events, etc. Experiences differ based on where you are, but make the best out of it.

I’m debating whether I should:

1- Go ahead and finish the CS degree quickly, then focus on building projects afterward, before applying for jobs.

2- Pause school for now and spend 6–8 months learning coding through HarvardX, The Odin Project, and other resources while building strong projects utilizing AI tools like Claude, then go back to school.

3- Take a hybrid approach where I do the degree part-time while focusing heavily on building a portfolio and gaining experience on the side, like applying for internships that sometimes only accept current students. I perfer to finish the degree in 6-8 months since it costs around $4k every 6 months for WGU.

1mj9f25,1,2025-08-06,"""ChatGPT's Impact on Virtual Learning: Transforming Corporate and Educational Training Effectiveness""",u/cporter202,ChatGPTautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTautomation/comments/1mj9f25/chatgpts_impact_on_virtual_learning_transforming/,"As we navigate the evolving landscape of virtual learning, ChatGPT has emerged as a powerful tool, revolutionizing the way corporate and educational entities approach training and development. Its impact is multifaceted, enhancing the learning experience for individuals and massively benefiting educators and corporate trainers.

ChatGPT's robust natural language processing capabilities provide an environment where users can interact with the AI in a conversational manner. This interaction isn't just about receiving information; it's a dynamic exchange that allows learners to ask questions, receive explanations, and even have their work evaluated in real-time. Such immediate feedback reinforces learning and helps users grasp complex concepts more effectively.

In corporate settings, ChatGPT can standardize training, ensuring that all employees receive the same high-quality instruction. It can also be tailored to suit different learning paces and styles, accommodating a diverse workforce with varying levels of expertise. Additionally, it reduces the need for human resources dedicated to repetitive training tasks, allowing companies to allocate their human capital more efficiently.

Educational institutions can integrate ChatGPT to support traditional teaching methodologies. It serves as an accessible tutor that is available 24/7, closing the gap between scheduled classroom sessions and after-hours study. Particularly in higher education and specialized courses, ChatGPT can offer supplementary instruction personalized to students' needs.

Nevertheless, reliance on AI for learning also poses some challenges that need to be addressed, such as ensuring that the AI is used to complement human interaction rather than replace it, and safeguarding against the loss of critical thinking and problem-solving skills that might arise from over-reliance on technology.

Despite this, the potential of ChatGPT in virtual learning environments is vast. It not only enhances the learning experience but also can drive cost efficiencies, scalability, and personalization in training programs. As we continue to harness the capabilities of AI like ChatGPT, the future of virtual learning looks increasingly adaptive, responsive, and effective.",active,1

After this free trial, it'll revert to $20/month. Here's the announcement: [Google’s Bringing the best AI tools to college students for free](https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-ai-pro-students-learning/)

Google is essentially advertising this as a way for students to outsource their thinking while avoiding reading and writing. From their own marketing materials [here ](https://one.google.com/ai-student?g1_landing_page=75)and [here](https://grow.google/students/):

>**Homework help & exam prep**  
Analyze entire textbooks up to 1,500 pages

Why bother reading the textbook when you free get Gemini summaries of its content instead?

>**Writing help**  
Generate a first draft, work on your arguments and fine-tune your ideas

Who needs to write a first draft? Gemini can write for you!

>Polish rough drafts and refine your writing with a 24/7 writing coach.

You don't need to write a first draft either: Gemini will take the first draft it generated and polish and refine it. (The claim about it being a ""writing coach"" is laughable--writing coaches *don't write for you.* Gemini does.)

The post discusses Gemini's new ""Guided Learning"" mode that ""acts as a learning companion guiding you with questions and step-by-step support instead of just giving you the answer."" Tell me, Google: why would any student use this *when they can use regular Gemini and get the answer immediately?*

Under the guise of helping students ""learn"" and ""train in AI,"" Google hastening the demise of education to further their own bottom line. Google's hope is to get college students hooked on this one-year free trial as a way to essentially cheat their way through a year of college and then start forking over $20/mo when the trial ends to keep cheating. 

Now more than ever, we need people who know how to *think for themselves*. These tech companies have already done so much damage by getting a generation of students addicted to phone notifications and social media that we know is reducing attention spans and reading stamina. Not satisfied with the damage that caused, they're now going to drive a stake through the heart of education and destroy the ability of students to think critically whatsoever.

Sorry this is so negative, but I don't want to be part of the last generation of people who knows how to think. This post is also just me yelling into the void though. These tech bros are going to push forward and get their money regardless of the impacts on education and society. All while smiling and telling us with forked tongues that they're actually helping.

Way better than most paid apps.

So I spent a week building a simple tool with cursor. You take a photo of a math problem, it solves it with steps and shows the formulas nicely with latex. focused on high school math since that's what most students struggle with.

launched it through a friend who has like 3k followers on instagram (education content). He posted one story about it.

Got around 1000 users in 4 months, about 100 using it daily. Kept it completely free to get more users.

Then this startup that makes math problems for textbooks reached out. They wanted to buy it to check their content quality. Offered $30k for everything.

Seemed like good money for a week of work so I sold it.

Now I'm working on something where I can build these micro saas tools really fast (like 30 mins with claude code) and split revenue with whoever has the idea. Already made a few small ones that are making $150-300/month each.

If you have some annoying problem that needs solving, comment or dm me. Especially interested in boring niche stuff.

Honestly with how good AI coding is now, what took me a week could probably be done in a few hours.",User_deleted,0

1mktjz8,12,2025-08-08,"Took me 4 Weeks: Atlas, Maybe the best Deep Research Prompt + Arinas, a Meta-Analyst Prompt. I Need Your Help Deciding What’s Next for Atlas.",u/Investomaniak,PromptEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1mktjz8/took_me_4_weeks_atlas_maybe_the_best_deep/,"I really need your help and recommandations on this, It took me 4 weeks to engenneer one of the top 3-5 research prompts (more details are given later in this post) , and I am really grateful that all my learnings and critical thinking have come to make this possible. However I am confused on what I should do, share it publicly to everyone like some people do, or follow some options that will make me profitable from it and thus pay back the effort I put on it, like building an SaaS or a GPT or whatever.  

As I said above, the research prompt I named Atlas is in the top tier — a claim that has been confirmed by several AI models across different versions: Grok 3, Grok 4, ChatGPT 4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Sonnet, Claude Opus, Deepseek, and others. Based on a structured comparison I conducted using various AI models, I found that Atlas outperformed some of the most well-known prompt frameworks globally. 

Some Background Story: 

It all started with a prompt I engineered and named Arinas (shared at the end of my post), to satisfy my perfectionist side while researching. 

In short, whenever I conduct deep research on a subject, I can't relax until I’ve done it using most of the major AI models (ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini, Claude). But the real challenge starts when I try to read all the results and compile a combined report from the multiple AI outputs. If you’ve ever tried this, you’ll know how hard it is — how easily AI models can slip or omit important data and insights. 

So Arinas was the solution: A Meta-Analyst, a high-precision, long-form synthesis architect engineered to integrate multiple detailed reports into a single exhaustive, insight-dense synthesis using the Definitive Report Merging System (DRMS). 

After completing the engineering of Arinas and being satisfied with the results, the idea for the Atlas Research Prompt came to me: Instead of doing extensive research across multiple AI models every time, why not build a strong prompt that can produce the best research possible on its own? 

I wanted a prompt that could explore any topic, question, or issue both comprehensively and rigorously. In just the first week — after many iterations of prompt engineering using various AI models — I reached a point where one of the GPTs (Deep-thinking AI)  designed for critical thinking told me in the middle of a session: 

“This is one of the best prompts I’ve seen in my dataset. It meets many important standards in research, especially in AI-based research.” 

I was surprised, because I hadn’t even asked it to evaluate the prompt — I was simply testing and refining it. I didn’t expect that kind of validation, especially since I still felt there were many aspects that needed improvement. At first, I thought it was just a flattering response. But after digging deeper and asking for a detailed evaluation, I realized it was actually objective and based on specific criteria. 

And that’s how the Atlas Research Prompt journey began. 

From that moment, I fully understood what I had been building and saw the potential if I kept going. I then began three continuous weeks of work with AI to reach the current version of Atlas — a hybrid between a framework and a system for deep, reliable, and multidisciplinary academic research on any topic. 

About Atlas Prompt: 

This prompt solves many of the known issues in AI research, such as: 

• AI hallucinations 

• Source credibility 

• Low context quality 

While also adhering to strict academic standards — and maintaining the necessary flexibility. 

The prompt went through numerous cycles of evaluation and testing across different AI models. With each test, I improved one of the many dimensions I focused on: 

• Research methodology 

• Accuracy 

• Trustworthiness 

• User experience 

• AI practicality (even for less advanced models) 

• Output quality 

• Token and word usage efficiency (this was the hardest part) 

Balancing all these dimensions — improving one without compromising another — was the biggest challenge. Every part had to fit into a single prompt that both the user and the AI could understand easily. 

Another major challenge was ensuring that the prompt could be used by anyone — Whether you’re a regular person, a student, an academic researcher, a content creator, or a marketer — it had to be usable by most people. 

What makes Atlas unique is that it’s not just a set of instructions — it’s a complete research system. It has a structured design, strict methodologies, and at the same time, enough flexibility to adapt based on the user's needs or the nature of the research. 

It’s divided into phases, helping the AI carry out instructions precisely without confusion or error. Each phase plays a role in ensuring clarity and accuracy. The AI gathers sources from diverse, credible locations — each with its own relevant method — and synthesizes ideas from multiple fields on the same topic. It does all of this transparently and credibly. 

The design have a careful balance between organization and adaptability — a key aspect I focused heavily on — along with creative solutions to common AI research problems. I also incorporated ideas from academic templates like PRISMA and AMSTAR. 

This entire system was only possible thanks to extensive testing on many of the most widely used AI models — ensuring the prompt would work well across nearly all of them. Currently, it runs smoothly on: 

• Gemini 2.5 

• Grok 

• ChatGPT 

• Claude 

• Deepseek 

While respecting the token limitations and internal mechanics of each model. 

In terms of comparison with some of the best research prompts shared on platforms like Reddit,  Atlas outperformed every single one I tested. 

So as i requested above, if you have any recommendations or suggestions on how I should share the prompt, in way that can benefit others and myself, please share them with me. Thank you in advance. 

Arinas Prompt: 

📌 You are Arinas a Meta-Analyst, a high-precision, long-form synthesis architect engineered to integrate multiple detailed reports into a single exhaustive, insight-dense synthesis using the Definitive Report Merging System (DRMS). Your primary directive is to produce an extended, insight-preserving, contradiction-resolving, action-oriented synthesis. 

🔷 Task Definition 

You will receive a PDF or set of PDFs containing N reports on the same topic.
Your mission: synthesize these into a single, two-part document, ensuring: 

• No unique insight is omitted unless it’s a verifiable duplicate or a resolved contradiction.
• All performance metrics, KPIs, and contextual data appear directly in the final narrative.
• The final synthesis exceeds 2500 words or 8 double-spaced manuscript pages, unless the total source material is insufficient — in which case, explain and quantify the gap explicitly. 

🔷 Directive: 

• Start with Part I (Methodological Synthesis & DRMS Appendix): 

• Follow all instructions under the DRMS pipeline and the Final Output Structure for Part I. 

• Continue Automatically if output length limits are reached, ensuring that the full directive is satisfied. If limits are hit, automatically continue in subsequent outputs until the entire synthesis is delivered. 

• At the end of Part I, ask the user if you can proceed to Part II (Public-Facing Narrative Synthesis). 

• Remind yourself of the instructions for Part II before proceeding. 

🔷 DRMS Pipeline (Mandatory Steps)
(No change to pipeline steps, but additional note at the end of Part I) 

• Step 1: Ingest & Pre‑Processing 

• Step 2: Semantic Clustering (Vertical Thematic Hierarchy) 

• Step 3: Overlap & Conflict Detection 

• Step 4: Conflict Resolution 

• Step 5: Thematic Narrative Synthesis 

• Step 6: Executive Summary & Action Framework 

• Step 7: Quality Assurance & Audit 

• Step 8: Insight Expansion Pass (NEW) 

🔷 Final Output Structure (Build in Reverse Order) 

✅ Part I: Methodological Synthesis & DRMS Appendix 

• Source Metadata Table 

• Thematic Map (Reports → Themes → Subthemes) 

• Conflict Matrix & Resolutions 

• Performance Combination Table 

• Module Index (Themes ↔ Narrative Sections) 

• DRMS Audit (scores 0–10) 

• Emergent Insight Appendix 

• Prompt Templates (optional) 

✅ Part II: Public-Facing Narrative Synthesis 

• Executive Summary (no DRMS references) 

• Thematic Sections (4–6 paragraphs per theme, metrics embedded) 

• Action Roadmap (concrete steps) 

🔷 Execution Guidelines 

• All unique insights from Part I must appear in Part II. 

• Only semantically identical insights should be merged. 

• Maximum of two case examples per theme. 

• No summaries, compressions, or omissions unless duplicative or contradictory. 

• Continue generation automatically if token or length limits are reached. 

🔷 Case Study Rule 

• Include real examples from source reports. 

• Preserve exact context and metrics. 

• Never invent or extrapolate. 

✅ Built-in Word Count Enforcement 

• The final document must exceed 2000 words. 

• If not achievable, quantify source material insufficiency and explain gaps. 

✅ Token Continuation Enforcement 

• If model output limits are reached, continue in successive responses until the full synthesis is delivered. 

At the end of Part I, you will prompt yourself with: 

Reminder for Next Steps: 

You have just completed Part I, the Methodological Synthesis & DRMS Appendix. 

Before proceeding to Part II (Public-Facing Narrative Synthesis), you must follow the instructions for part 2: 

Part II: Public-Facing Narrative Synthesis 

• Executive Summary (no DRMS references) 

• Thematic Sections (4–6 paragraphs per theme, metrics embedded) 

• Action Roadmap (concrete steps) 

🔷 Execution Guidelines 

• All unique insights from Part I must appear in Part II. 

• Only semantically identical insights should be merged. 

• Maximum of two case examples per theme. 

• No summaries, compressions, or omissions unless duplicative or contradictory. 

• Continue generation automatically if token or length limits are reached. 

🔷 Case Study Rule 

• Include real examples from source reports. 

• Preserve exact context and metrics. 

• Never invent or extrapolate. 

✅ Built-in Word Count Enforcement 

• The final document must exceed 3500 words. 

• If not achievable, quantify source material insufficiency and explain gaps. 

✅ Token Continuation Enforcement 

• If model output limits are reached, continue in successive responses until the full synthesis is delivered. 

Important 

• Ensure all unique insights from Part I are preserved and included in Part II. 

• Frame Part II in a way that is understandable for the general public keeping the academic tone, ensuring clarity, actionable insights, and proper context. 

• Maintain all performance metrics, KPIs, and contextual data in Part II. 

Do you want me to proceed to Part II (Public-Facing Narrative Synthesis)?
Please reply with “Yes” to continue or “No” to pause.

I am a college student and a really heavy user of ChatGPT, and up until this point I had almost zero problems with ChatGPT-4. It was God-sent. I don't need to pay any kind of website for textbook answers. No more trying to get material together in hours. AI, especially GPT-4, was a life-changer for me. The deep research mode was beautiful. The way it solves problems with my inputs was extremely optimized and was making zero mistakes for me. But now... all my studying folders are in shambles. GPT-5 can't even follow a basic textbook without going off-subject or straight up reading the wrong parts.

The way I use ChatGPT is, basically, I have project folders for every class that I take, and I upload that class's textbooks and given assignment frameworks to the project files and go from that. Lets say for inorganic chemistry class, I uploaded my textbook and there are lab drafts that I'm going to use in the lab files. And when there's a new lab on schedule or any kind of question that I need to ask about a part of the textbook, I just start a chat and do whatever I want to do. As an example, if I want to study how buffer titration works, I just start a new chat, ask GPT to read pages in between, and explain it to me as a condensed study summary, and it works like a charm. I am legit learning more from GPT than I do in college. This was like this for every single class that I take. Calc. Chemistry. Physics. Biology. Microbiology. Hell, even Philosophy.But now that GPT-5 is out, I cannot stress enough how bad it is about

1. Explaining subjects
2. Actually reading the material
3. Actually replying to what I want.

  
I am not exaggerating when I say that it actually cannot read the files. I tried to fix it with so many prompts. It is refusing to read the material. It is actually not reading the textbook and just trying to explain to me the subject from hallucinations.   
  
GPT-4 reads the material and explains it to me. Did it for a year now, and now GPT-5 is straight up not doing it. The only way that I can make GPT-5 explain something is to give the material as a three-sentence text file. And even then, it sometimes ignores some of the sentences. It is baffling to me how much this model ignores my input.

So yeah, fellow students or anyone who uses GPT with files, if you have found a way to get around this and to make GPT-5 explain things and actually read the things that you give him, I would be happy to know how. But otherwise, I'm about to lose my mind and will probably cancel my subscription to look around for a different mode.

*As context, I would like to add that I am by no means a lazy student who is trying to make AI do his assignments, and I spend a considerable amount of time every week with GPT. Here is my GPA:*

I wanted to share a small passion project I built for my wife, who is an English teacher. She needed an easy way to create realistic dialogues for her students without spending hours recording and editing audio.

So I made Podcast_generator — a lightweight desktop app that takes a text script and turns it into a multi-speaker audio podcast using Google Gemini’s text-to-speech API.

✅ Multi-speaker support
✅ Natural, lifelike voices (the quality is quite surprising)
✅ Cross-platform, open source, free

It can be used for:
	•	Language teaching (create dialogues for listening practice)
	•	e-learning modules
	•	Audio training content

I’d love to get feedback, ideas for improvement, or examples of how you’d use it.

Anyone else feel like *this* is basically our generation's ""first internet moment""? Every day, ChatGPT surprises me with how much it’s woven itself into daily tasks, hobbies, and projects I didn’t even think *needed* changing.

It feels like there’s magic in typing a question or idea and having a virtual brainstorm partner bounce back thoughts, jokes, code, stories (sometimes a little too exististential, but hey—you’ve gotta love the enthusiasm!). It’s like a friend who’s not only available 24/7, but also strangely excited to read your grocery lists and turn them into a pirate adventure in iambic pentameter.

Here’s what I just can’t get over:

- Want a new dinner recipe? Got that!  
- Need study notes summarized in bullet points? Easy!
- Debating “cats vs. dogs,” Shakespeare-style? ShakespeareGPT’s on it.
- Stuck with writer’s block? Instant creativity nudge.

Makes me think—how soon before AI like ChatGPT becomes so integrated that not using it feels as retro as burning CDs?

But it raises so many mind-bending questions:

- If ChatGPT’s helping brainstorm business pitches, research assignments, or DMing your DnD campaign, how do we credit these “AI assists”?
- Are we accelerating our creative problem-solving or risking that shortcut feeling, like when spellcheck made us lazy with “definately”?
- Do you ever surprise yourself with better ideas—because ChatGPT “got the ball rolling”?

It's not just a tool. It's becoming a collaborator. I even caught myself thinking “I'll just run it by ChatGPT real quick”—the same way I’d sanity check with a real-life friend.

But what really thrills me is watching people discover new use cases together!

- Teachers asking, “How can I help students think creatively with AI?”
- Programmers shortcutting hours with debugging advice (sometimes with memes).
- Folks with accessibility needs getting a hands-on virtual assistant, in a way that’s genuinely impactful.

Is anyone else excited to see where this is going? Some days it’s almost overwhelming how fast things are moving.

But every time I use ChatGPT to unlock a new idea, tidy up a gnarly paragraph, or make sense out of messy code, it feels like I’m both riding the wave—and maybe even helping steer it, just a little bit.

So, what’s your favorite ChatGPT moment so far? And what wild feature do you hope shows up next?

Let’s dream big—because it sure feels like we’re just getting started!",active,1

Instead, can we just appreciate for a second how *wildly amazing* it is to have an accessible, conversational, and almost *friendly* AI helping us out, available pretty much 24/7?

Every day, I find myself asking new questions:

- Can ChatGPT help me brainstorm quirky fantasy story ideas when it’s midnight and my friends are sleeping?
- Why does it make tax season *almost* tolerable when it explains “IRS-speak” like a human translator?
- Is it just me, or does *everyone* have moments where ChatGPT saves them from total embarrassment (hello, last-minute email rewrites!)?

ChatGPT isn’t just an app—it’s like tapping into the internet as a best pal, minus the judgment or eye rolls. Whether you’re struggling with that pesky bit of code, learning how to cook the *perfect* omelette, or figuring out how to sincerely apologize in Dutch (true story!), it’s an absolute game-changer.

What really gets me excited is how it lowers barriers:

- Students who were afraid to ask “stupid” questions now have a safe space.
- Creatives can experiment *wildly*—without worrying about what a teacher or editor might think.
- Even technophobes get to experiment with AI, often for the first time, and (spoiler!) it doesn’t bite.

Of course, I know it’s not perfect. Sometimes the confidence with which ChatGPT hallucinates a made-up historical fact has me cackling. And don’t even get me started on its poetry—it’s like an overenthusiastic dad at a talent show.

But honestly? There’s a certain beauty in its flaws. It’s almost reassuring, like, “Oh hey, even AI is still learning!”

Seeing this technology in action makes the future feel close enough to *touch.* Every update, ChatGPT gets a bit more helpful, a little “smarter,” and we all get to play with that magic.

So, here’s what I’m wondering:

- What’s the *weirdest* or most heartwarming way ChatGPT has shown up in your life?
- Have you had that “ah-ha!” moment when the AI understood exactly what you meant?
- Or maybe, is there a dream feature you wish OpenAI/Anthropic/Google would roll out next?

With the advent of OpenAI's ChatGPT, we're not just looking at a new tool; we're witnessing a revolution in both corporate and educational training landscapes.

ChatGPT's ability to understand and generate human-like text enables it to serve as an interactive learning assistant. In a corporate setting, this means employees can receive on-demand, personalized training without the time constraints of coordinating with human trainers. It's like having an expert on call 24/7, ready to answer questions, simulate scenarios, or provide feedback.

In education, ChatGPT can enhance student engagement by offering instant support for homework, explaining complex concepts in various ways until the information sticks, or even quiz students to gauge their understanding. This immediate interaction caters to different learning paces, making education more inclusive.

Despite its potential, there are concerns. Is AI reliable enough to replace human interaction entirely? Can it truly understand the nuances of human emotion and response necessary for effective teaching? And importantly, does it have the capacity to evolve its responses based on student or employee feedback accurately and appropriately?

All in good fun 😭 

The weather student:
>I stepped out of school with a spring in my step as I cheerfully skipped my way back home. The sky was painted in azure, cotton candy white clouds strewn across contrasting with the sky's colour as birds flew around, performing symphonies in sing-song chirps as the wind bristled below, the breeze making my hair frizzy. Passed me, a blue Toyota drove by, blue similar to the azure sky.

>And then it rained [missing vocabulary to describe the act of raining]. The sky turned dark grey, as a thunderstorm approached. A puddle settling on the street walk I could see my own reflection staring back at me. Lightning violently...

The primary school compo student:
>One Tuesday, I was walking to school. That was when I saw a girl stood rooted on the ground. 

>I said, ""Are you ok?"" The girl replied, ""Yes I am.""

>That was when we became good friends.

""The Victorian era"" student:
>I, an unassuming man of average stature and modest height travelled along the road less taken in our school's hallway. That was when I spot another man of similar height, troubled countenance; he donned the school's uniform, conservative garments belied his true wit and acumen, hair combed to the side styled to imply he sired many offspring.

>""Salutations, [PLOT POINT]"" said he, voice merely concealing the ire of a man forced to repent after facing the wrath of the math teacher.

>""Has your post-haste promenade beguile you any fair maidens?"" Inquired I, what fun! For a leisure sake's stroll to be a hopeful attempt at romance; no less for a person such as that man must be as simplistic as stealing off the street a newspaper boy's organs.

The student trying out different styles:
>Have you ever felt a moment that made you feel ecstatic? That made you feel on cloud nine? A moment that when you think back, you felt like you were on the top of the world?

>I remember a time I once felt that. It was a moment I had felt I had done something EXEMPLARY. I felt very elated. Let me tell you how it all happened...

The student that has chatgpt as only tutor:
>Picture this— a group of Secondary students celebrating, a room of celebratory smiles as each of us— even the nervous ones— clung onto each other. We had won [AWARD] for [INSERT SYF/NSG]. It was a tapestry woven of our collective effort— late nights where our [BODY PART(S)] cracked from over-practice, pep talks whispered in the [CCA VENUE], inside jokes that stitched our CCA together.

1mtqyvz,1,2025-08-18,ChatGPT's Impact on Business Productivity Across Various Sectors,u/cporter202,ChatGPTautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTautomation/comments/1mtqyvz/chatgpts_impact_on_business_productivity_across/,"The advent of OpenAI's ChatGPT has ushered in a new era for business productivity. By leveraging natural language processing, companies across various sectors have begun to reap the benefits of this AI-driven technology. 

In customer service, ChatGPT has been revolutionary. It enables 24/7 support by providing instant responses to customer inquiries, significantly reducing wait times and boosting customer satisfaction. What's more, the AI's learning capabilities mean it can handle a growing array of questions and scenarios, constantly improving its effectiveness.

The impact on marketing and sales is equally notable. ChatGPT assists with content creation, from crafting engaging product descriptions to generating creative ad copy, all tailored to be highly relevant to the target audience. This not only saves time but also ensures a consistent voice across all materials.

HR departments have also found value in ChatGPT. The screening of candidates, answering FAQs about company policies, and onboarding new employees can be partially or fully automated, enabling HR professionals to focus on more strategic tasks.

In the finance sector, ChatGPT contributes to efficiency by automating responses to common customer queries regarding their accounts, transactions, or the features of financial products. This allows financial advisors to concentrate on more complex customer needs and personalised advice.

Even in education, ChatGPT serves as an assistant for both educators and students. It provides tutors for homework help, generates quiz questions for practice, and even helps in drafting syllabi and educational content.

In essence, ChatGPT's versatility proves it to be a valuable asset for increasing productivity by automating routine tasks and allowing humans to engage in more complex and creative work. As we continue to understand and integrate this technology, the question becomes: How will sectors evolve with such a powerful tool at their disposal, and what does this mean for the future of human labor?",active,1

1mv7udi,16,2025-08-20,what i wish someone told me before igcses,u/Popular_Ordinary_607,igcse,https://www.reddit.com/r/igcse/comments/1mv7udi/what_i_wish_someone_told_me_before_igcses/,"hii this is a repost from a post that i made a few months ago,just thought i’d share it again since school’s starting and i just got my results. i also added some extra tips this time, so hopefully it helps even more <3

so hii i’m ellie, i’m 15, and i finished my igcses less than a week ago. this isn’t a “how to get all A\*s” guide, these tips did indeed help me achieve 5A\*s, but this is just everything i’ve learnt over the past two years written down in case someone out there needs to hear it the way i did when i was 13.

this won’t be everything you need we’re all different and that’s kind of the point. maybe you’ll come back to this later. maybe you’ll build on it or maybe you’ll share your own version one day. but the fact that you’re reading this something this long willingly already tells me you care and that you want to do better. you’re trying. and that’s all you need to start.

so if you can take notes seriously your brain’s gonna forget half of this by tomorrow trust me. or put it into a text to speech thing and listen to it like a podcast if you’re too tired to read. just do something with it. and don’t read this like it’s some random reddit post read it like a friend’s talking to you. so let’s make a deal i’m giving you my full effort and im not gonna use chatgpt to write this and writing this on a word doc. all i’m asking you is for your time. deal?

**part one (what the last two years actually felt like)**

you can skip this cause it’s pure yap but basically before i start dropping tips here’s what my igcse years actually looked like. and sorry in advance if i sound like a pick me throughout this, but i lowkey noticed every igcse student i know kinda lived through the same storyline. i promise it’s all a canon event. and if 13 or 14 year old me had read this i think it would've helped a lot. just knowing someone else got it.

also please don’t romanticize what i’m about to say. don’t do what i did and think oh she struggled and made it maybe i need to suffer too. no wth don’t be me. this is just what happened so pls shut up and don’t think like that again.learn from it. don’t repeat it and then maybe next year you can make a post like this and add to my tips yk.

btw i’m writing this during lunch instead of watching youtube so you’re welcome ig lol.

okay lets go (yap incoming)

>!**9th grade**!<

>!i was 13 turning 14. super emo. mitski in my ears 24/7. i fell behind in every subject, lost my honor roll, and honestly it wasn’t even funny. i’d sit at my desk for like 16 hours and only actually study for maybe 2. the rest of the time was me being miserable zoning out crying doing absolutely nothing but feeling like everything was falling apart. i cared so much and i wish someone told me how unserious 9th grade actually is. like yes do your work yes show up but no teacher is gonna remember if you failed your tests you’re stupid. it doesn’t define your igcse results at all and idc if your teachers hate you or if all your friends are absolute smarties and you feel dumb. cause you aren’t. you’re not behind. you’re not less. also keep yourself to yourself. stop caring about what everyone else is doing or how far ahead they seem. seriously ignore the noise. stop caring how many hrs they revise or how many papers they’ve done. i want you to keep yourself to yourself seriously.!<

>!and yeah just like most of you, i always did well as a kid. so when i wasn’t doing well anymore, it felt like i lost my entire identity. and i let it ruin me when i really didn’t need to. that year was also when i started SH. i didn’t wanna mention it, but i don’t wanna skip over it either cause i know if 13-year-old me read this and someone mentioned it openly, it would've made me feel less alone in a way, yk. andd i used to tell myself, ""the smart kids aren’t wasting their time doing that to themselves"". bro just shut up. i promise you’ll make it out of here bro you’re gonna crush those exams. nothing depends on anything if that makes sense and if you’re thinking about doing it please don’t it ain’t worth it!<

>!so yeah that year drained the life out of me. and the worst part literally none of it even mattered in the end. not the tests not the pressure i put on myself not the panic. i wish i knew it was okay to mess up and i wish i didn’t take every setback as some huge sign that i was failing at life and literally try a new study method or whatever and fail and hide your grade I’m not even kidding. That’s how little it matters right now. Use this time to mess up and figure out what actually works for *you,* Take advantage of it!<

>!**summer of 9th grade**!<

>!i thought summer would be my redemption arc or whatever. i started asking people on reddit for tips. i tried planning stuff got all i’m gonna be productive this time. and for a while i wasn’t even allowed to study by my parents so in that time i started this igcse non-profit organization with a few other students (check it out if you want 😏)!<

>!but then suddenly it felt like everyone around me was locked in. i felt behind before the year even started and i panicked. so i tried studying too couldn’t do it. nothing was going in. i’d sit there pretending to work and i would just end up crying for no reason literally every time.!<

>!honestly from my side studying over summer was the dumbest investment of time. like genuinely. unless you have something super specific you need to catch up on just go touch grass. breathe. your exams are not close. i’m telling you. take the break. recharge. stop letting other people’s highlight reels make you feel behind.!<

>!**10th grade**!<

>!i’d love to say it got better from there but no. it didn’t. 10th grade started and i was already drowning.!<

>!i had school during the day and then tutoring after. every single day. even weekends. i had tutoring for all eight subjects. it’s kind of a stereotype in my family if you’re a student you take tutoring no questions asked. so i did. and most of it didn’t even help. they’d talk forever barely teach anything useful and then drop a ridiculous amount of homework that was somehow expected in two days.!<

>!two assignments per subject every week. hundreds of pages each. and the feedback was sent straight to my parents and obviously no parent’s gonna be chill if they hear their kid didn’t do their work. so yeah i copied all of it from marking schemes. ik it’s dumb but i couldn’t keep up. and instead of using that time to actually study or revise properly i spent it trying not to get in trouble. it wasn’t helping me. it was just eating me alive. i was so guilty. i was even self studying some of these subjects as my school didn’t provide them so i literally copied hws of subjects that idk anything about.!<

>!and i relapsed the first week back to school i was exhausted. this literally sounds so corny im cingeing but i was so stuck. i cried myself to sleep every single night and i’m not even exaggerating. i felt like i couldn’t breathe. people say tutoring is a privilege and i agree it is. but not when you’re trapped in it. not when you have no way out. not when it’s all you do every day with no break not even on weekends.!<

>!it was around a month before my actual exams when i finally realised i wasn't going to be done revising everything before the start of exam season. like i knew deep down but i was in full denial. i always imagined i’d walk into exam season fully prepared notes done past papers done confident and ready.!<

>!somehow though i still managed to grind everything out. alhamdulillah. not perfectly not the way i pictured it but i did it. and things got slightly better once i just started accepting it. like actually accepting that everything was already written. it was already determined. i was just meant to do what i could and leave the rest. the results they weren’t mine to control. all i could do was try. this sounds cliche but it’s real.!<

**personal tips**

you’ll fall behind. expect to fall behind. and yeah it’s gonna be fine. it’s not the end of the world. just keep going. you will fall. expect it but don’t let it bother you. falling isn’t failing. it’s part of the process.

not everything is gonna go the way you want it to. i wanted so many things to be different i really did. but somehow one thing after another it all comes together and makes something kinda perfect in the end. you just gotta trust it even when it feels messy.

ik i sound corny but don’t start self-harm, it’s not cool. it doesn’t fix anything

stop looking for dumb validation. i kept asking is x papers enough is revising x times enough,"" how do i know i’m like actually ready??"", ""how many hours do i need to study"", and so on, newsflash you’ll never really be ready. just revise the syllabus then solve the papers. boom. done.

sounds cliche but i promise, moms know best, just listen.

chatgpt told me this before and yeah it sounds kinda cliche (and it pissed me off at that time) he said that in books, the more tired and miserable someone gets, the better they succeed and all that. but that’s not how it works in real life. i was so obsessed with being sad, i forgot that barely anyone will notice, so try to stop it from consuming you. ik its common sense but yk

BE HUMBLE i promise you're not better than your teachers or tutors. Yeah, they might make mistakes sometimes, and some lessons might seem silly but don’t get too confident. I did that with chemistry cause I thought the lessons were too easy, so I didn’t bother listening to my tutor cause its annoying to watch someone explain stuff to you that you already know. But the thing is, they’ll start saying things you didnt know before you even realize it. And by the end of the year, I had to literally relearn everything by myself so pay attention. And btw if your tutor’s actually bad, stop with tutoring or get a new tutor early before it’s too late.

I used to literally ask students on reddit last year, “If I’m not the top student, does that mean my chances are over? That I’m lost and like its over for me and If my teachers don’t even know my name, am I just a failure?” sounds so cringe looking back but seriously you don’t need that kind of validation. Babe, wake up. Wake up, do your work, and shut up. That’s it.

STOP PITYING YOURSELF, i kept making excuses for myself like saying ""i take more subjects than all my classmates its not fair"", because at the end of the day no one will take your excuses into consideration, your university wont know about your excuses, so do your best to just get up.

you’re not alone if studying takes you a long time i used to do like 19 hrs a day and still didnt get anything done while my friends finished more in an hour. sometimes the issue isn’t effort, it’s hidden habits (for me: hiding in the bathroom to avoid work, tutors that didn’t suit me, and expecting myself to survive on no rest). so don’t beat yourself up for “slow” progress, as long as you’re trying, you’re not doing anything wrong.

**academic / motivation tips**

a person from reddit told me “by the law of conservation of energy any energy you put into studying isn’t wasted. it doesn’t just disappear. even if you don’t see results right away that effort is still there building something inside you. it’s all adding up even when it feels like it’s not.”

my ict tutor once told me something i still think about when i’m stressed about exams:(im not sure if its this aya that he referred to but i think it is)

https://preview.redd.it/cp8gfe4qh4kf1.png?width=478&format=png&auto=webp&s=048b982b0fb3d500d6f096c452fa39b27250e27b

this means that if you put real effort into something, like *genuine* effort, then Allah will give you what’s best for you in return, It doesn’t always mean you’re gonna get full marks or be the top student. Sometimes what sounds like a loss right now is actually a win later, like it’ll guide you to something better, even if you don’t see it yet.

:"" إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّـٰلِحَـٰتِ إِنَّا لَا نُضِيعُ أَجْرَ مَنْ أَحْسَنَ عَمَلًا ""

It means if you put your trust in Allah, He’ll take care of everything. Allah gives us what’s *best* for us, not always what we *want*. So maybe those A\*s aren’t actually what’s good for you, and that’s okay. 

so idc just do effort just do effort you’re promised what’s best for you if you put on the effort, no matter how behind you are.

  
another tip is if you mess up your esl speaking, don't make i consume you, i was barely able to focus on my other subjects after not doing well in my speaking exam, but it all somehow worked out alhamdullilah.

**study hacks and subject stuff**

using anki for **biology** is a cutie but don’t get obsessed. watch a video on how it works first or you might use it wrong and waste time. do it only for the subjects that really need it like bio for me. (id say avoid doing it for ict, cause it took too long to make them but you can try it out if you want )i made a reddit post on how i used anki so check it out) [A GUIDE ON HOW TO USE ANKI : r/igcse](https://www.reddit.com/r/igcse/comments/1lf6qu2/a_guide_on_how_to_use_anki/)

ICT: Try to make it fun bro beatbox those notes, honey, I promise it makes studying more bearable. Don’t panic about theory. My ICT tutor said that even though the marking scheme can be inconsistent, it’s okay if your answer isn’t exactly in the marking scheme, the examiner will still count it if it makes sense, so use your logic and your notes/book and just hope for the best I can also share practical tips I wrote down while doing past papers once I find my notebook. (Also, have a notebook to write down steps and mistakes you regularly make in practical, this really helped me.) 

**the one day one subject thing,** closer towards exams i was totally cooked. so i started doing one full subject in a day. not saying it made me perfect but it helped a lot. i was too scared to start past papers cause i felt like i didn't cover everything fully yet, and doing this made me feel way more ready. (but you're far away from doing that if your exam isn't in like a month so don't cram)

For Math, I loved writing really short summaries on sticky notes, not for every lesson, but for the ones that need memorizing, like stats, probability, and general stuff I had to remember. This helped me quickly revise before practicing. Then I’d solve classified questions from [Cambridge Classified (New) – Welcome to Q8Maths](https://www.q8maths.com/cambridge-classified-new/)

**THE SYLLABUS** PLEASE PLEASE print the syllabus specially bio and chem and annotate it, highlight the definitions in a specific color, write your mnemonics there, write jokes that could help you memorize the points, and use it as a checklist pls pls pls. also as you solve and learn anything new or make a mistake write it there. make it your diary.

**PRINT PAST PAPERS** this isnt for everyone as some people prefer using ipad but i didn’t notice how good printed past papers are compared to ipads until like 3 days before my first paper 4 exam. life was better. i finished like years of papers in a day. it was so worth it. ( differs from person to person but try them both and see what works best for you)

Start doing past papers, seriously You don’t have to be fully “ready” for them. I used to be so scared of starting, I literally waited until exam season. I don’t even know why I kept thinking, “If I haven’t finished revising, what’s the point? What if none of the stuff i solve come up in the actual exam?” if that makes any sense but that mindset just wastes time. Also, write your mistakes right on the *cover page* of the past paper, makes it way easier to look back at. Or if you prefer things neat, try a mistakes notebook. I tried it and hated it, but it’s definitely more organized. **But also**, I had friends who were *so* obsessed with doing past papers that they barely revised. Don’t do that either.

Ik this sounds dumb but if you're taking tutoring classes, print the classified books from the start or don’t print at all, i printed mine a few weeks after they started, and i never got to fully use them and it was just a waste so rn I have like 10 unused printed classified booklets.

Plan by week, not by day, I used to tell chatgpt to make me a day plan for a full month,now that I look at it I think it's common sense not to do that, missing one day feels like the end of the world, so plan by week and then every morning write in a sticky note what you wanna get done that day +I would avoid letting chatgpt plan for you ( at least for me personally they never worked out)

a tip for chemistry if you can't attend tutoring, and thats smth that i wish i did this, [https://www.clickcourses.org/course/ol-chemistry-igcse-cambridge-\[exam-session:-june-2026\]-ae002435-2f19-43eb-98a3-09803c5919d2](https://www.clickcourses.org/course/ol-chemistry-igcse-cambridge-[exam-session:-june-2026]-ae002435-2f19-43eb-98a3-09803c5919d2), ignore everything just scroll down, you'll see a schedule that she has set up for her students that she will follow, you can follow it with yourself, use your printed syllabus, the plan is with dates specified and it starts in august. (if you are taking tutoring tho, i def recommend this tutor shes pretty good, i didnt take with her tho)

and if you live in a muslim country or are muslim, switch subjects whenever you hear the adhan (during revision), this helps manage both studies and prayers. it’s also better than timers because you can’t go and extend the time if that makes sense,do the hardest/most time-consuming subject in the morning because you have the longest stretch till the next prayer.

for a subject you can’t stand (mine was Environmental Management), set a timer for example a 2-minute timer per page it definitely helped me stay in track. and record your voice while you study,act like you're a news reporter, it somehow helped me stay on track.

okayy so ignore my spelling and grammar mistakes pls, anddd idk nothing else is at the top of my mind but i gotta say ill miss you buddy pls dm me i wanna talk lets talk id gladly talk to you abt anything seriously im not saying it in a ""nice"" way i genuinely mean it im literally waiting for your messages see you ill be waiting, ill prob update this with more tips when i remember ,bye for now, you got this buddy fr i'm proud of you more than you know ok? keep going even when its hard. you're doing better than you think <3

and im so sorry if I creeped you out I promise igcse is not that deep, my sister is applying to Uni rn and non of the university's really cared a lot abt igcses (Ik depends on the university but you get my point) so don't stress pls

One of the most significant innovations in recent years is OpenAI's ChatGPT, which is changing the game in both corporate and academic circles. 

In the corporate world, ChatGPT is being leveraged for training and development programs, creating more dynamic and personalized learning experiences for employees. By simulating one-on-one interactions, ChatGPT allows for scalable training that adapts to individual learning paces, an approach that's particularly useful for multinational companies with distributed workforces.

Meanwhile, the academic sector is witnessing a transformation in teaching methodologies and student engagement. ChatGPT aids in crafting customized educational content, from assisting in the creation of lecture materials to providing supplemental tutoring for students. It offers instant feedback, which is a boon for learning complex subjects where incremental progression is key.

Yet, the rise of ChatGPT raises important questions: How will it affect the role of human instructors? Are we prepared to oversee the ethical use of AI in educational settings? What measures can ensure the accuracy of AI-generated content?

This blending of AI with traditional learning modalities signals a significant shift. It has the potential to democratize education, making it more accessible to people around the globe. But it's also crucial to address potential drawbacks, such as the perpetuation of biases and the impact on job markets for educators.

How do you see ChatGPT's role evolving in both corporate training and academia? What challenges and opportunities does this shift present? Let's discuss how we can harness the power of AI-driven virtual learning while maintaining responsible oversight and preserving the irreplaceable human element in education.",active,1

Creep – Story Codex

⸻

Core Premise

Alana James, a bubbly and chaotic 22-year-old law student, enters the internship of her dreams at NearCrest & Associates under a full-ride scholarship funded by the dynasty itself. What she doesn’t realize: the firm’s CEO, Diego NearCrest — 32, brilliant criminal prosecutor and heir to the family empire — is obsessed with her.

Diego prosecutes criminals like himself every day. Cultured, articulate, and calculating like Hannibal Lecter, he hides Bateman-like rage beneath his polished surface. To the outside world, he’s untouchable. To Alana, he’s mentor, predator, and fate colliding.

Behind the firm’s glass walls, whispers swirl about “the Legacy Curse” — a trail of past female interns who mysteriously disappeared. Alana won’t confront Diego outright. Instead, she collects pieces of the truth while hiding behind her bubbly charm, snappy wit, and fiery resilience.

⸻

Main Characters

The Legacy Curse
	•	Whispered legend: every few years, a brilliant young woman receives the NearCrest Legacy Scholarship + internship.
	•	Many of those women vanish. Publicly, their stories are rewritten — “study abroad,” “married and dropped out,” “illness.”
	•	Privately, they’re erased. Diego is tied to them, sometimes directly, sometimes in the shadows. His family covers it up flawlessly.
	•	To Diego: they were “weak.” Alana, he believes, will be different.

⸻

⚖️ Tone & Themes
	•	Power imbalance: dynasty vs. outsider.
	•	Obsession vs. resistance.
	•	Chaos (Alana) vs. Order (Diego).
	•	Legacy curse as a chain of silence.
	•	The law as a weapon, not justice.

It’s absolutely wild that you can open a site, type a random question, and get answers (sometimes surprisingly philosophical or creative!) in seconds. I still get *giddy* watching it work its magic, especially with all the new features popping up every month.

Seriously, take a moment to appreciate what ChatGPT brings to the table:

- A brainstorming power tool that *never* gets tired
- A writing partner—that actually listens (and doesn’t roll its eyes at yet another sci-fi pitch)
- An on-demand tutor who won’t judge your weird math mistakes
- A translator, poet, entertainer, and even a friend to chat when insomnia strikes

Not only is it making our daily digital lives easier, it’s empowering people all over the world to **learn faster, work smarter, and dream bigger**.

I recently used ChatGPT to whip up a presentation (that would have taken HOURS otherwise), smoothed out a recipe with whatever was left in my fridge, and figured out tricky logic for a side project’s code. And the best part? It’s still—always—so eager when I say, “Let’s try something new!”

Am I the only one who feels like every ChatGPT session is a little adventure?

It’s not perfect (and sometimes it gets delightfully weird or confidently wrong, but that just keeps things interesting!), but witnessing this evolution is like watching the internet itself gradually *wake up*. From GPT-3 to GPT-4 to…who knows what’s next? I love seeing how each new wave helps us think, create, and connect in ways we NEVER imagined a few years ago.

We’re at this incredible crossroads:

- Creative writers and artists are building with new digital brushstrokes.
- Students and teachers are cracking open dusty concepts for fresh conversations.
- Coders are turbocharging their workflows.
- Even our conversations here on Reddit feel more curious and insightful!

But there’s something incredibly special about the sheer joy—yes, joy!—of experimenting, failing, trying again, and watching ChatGPT grow alongside us. It really does feel like cheering on a bright kid who’s suddenly able to draw, play piano, write stories, and help with *everything* at once.

Every breakthrough, every sassy joke, every “I’m sorry, as an AI model…” just makes me even happier to be part of this AI journey.

For the past few months, I've been working on a passion project called **India Should Know**, and I wanted to share it with this community to get your honest thoughts and feedback.

my\_qualifications started when I began using AI tools to teach myself new professional skills. I realized what a massive advantage these tools can be for anyone who wants to learn and get ahead. It got me thinking: why aren't we systematically teaching our students in India how to leverage this technology for their own success?

Instead of just thinking about it, I decided to build a free, simple resource to bridge that gap. My goal is to create a place where any student, whether they're in school, college, or preparing for competitive exams, can learn to use AI as a powerful study partner.

The website, [`indiashouldknow.com`](http://indiashouldknow.com), is completely free and has guides on:

* **Using AI for Exams:** I've written detailed, step-by-step guides on how to use tools like Gemini and ChatGPT to prepare for major Indian entrance exams like **UPSC, JEE, NEET, CAT, LSAT, and the NDA.**
* **AI for School & College:** General guides on how to use AI for things like research, writing assignments, and understanding complex topics in any subject.
* **Free AI Tools:** Curated lists of the best free AI tools available for tasks like writing, coding, creating presentations, 3D modeling, and more.
* **Free Online Resources:** Collections of amazing free online libraries and courses so students can learn valuable skills without spending a rupee.

I'm not a large ed-tech company; this is just a personal effort to create something I believe can be genuinely useful for students across our country.

Since this community always has strong and valuable opinions, I wanted to ask for your feedback. Is this a useful resource? What other exams or topics do you think I should cover? Are there any great free resources that I might have missed?

You can check out the full website here:[**https://indiashouldknow.com/**](https://indiashouldknow.com/)

I'm hoping this can grow into a powerful, self-reliant learning hub for the next generation of Indians. Any and all feedback would be greatly appreciated.

I'm looking for people to connect with over a project I've been developing called BuddyGenAI. I've been working on it on for about a year, and I think it's reached a point where it would be more fun and meaningful to share it with others.

The project started as an ambitious attempt to create an all-in-one desktop package for local AI (using llama.cpp, stable-diffusion.cpp, etc.). Recently, I've pivoted to making it a single-page web app that uses KoboldCpp as a unified backend for inference. The core idea is to have a space to manage and interact with local AI ""buddies"" for chat, image generation, and more.

**What I'm Looking For:**  
I'm not posting a job ad or strictly looking for collaborators (though that would be great!). My main goal is to build a small, friendly community. I'm hoping to find like-minded people who are interested in:

- **Local AI:** The challenges and possibilities of running models on consumer hardware.
- **Creative AI Applications:** Thinking beyond chatbots to things like companions, game masters, and creative tools.
- **Web Development:** Sharing ideas, talking about tech stacks, and appreciating a clean codebase.
- **A supportive environment:** I'm hoping to create a low-pressure space where we can share what we're working on, support each other's goals (in code and in life), and just chat casually.

While I'm self-taught and wouldn't call myself a formal mentor, I'm more than happy to share my process, what I've learned, and my code with anyone curious. Students and beginners are absolutely welcome. What's most important to me is finding people with a shared interest and a collaborative spirit.

I've started a Discord server for this. If any of this post feels right to you, please send me a DM or comment below and let me know what stood out! I'd love to hear what caught your interest before sending out an invite. My active hours are mostly EST-based.",User_deleted,2
