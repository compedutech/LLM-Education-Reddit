I’m a student teacher, who sometimes struggles to come up with inventive and engaging ways of presenting material and ChatGPT has genuinely come up with some really well thought out and engaging activities which ALSO link well to the learning objectives. With the mass problem of “teacher burnout” I do think this could be such a help to reduce teacher workload when it comes to developing lesson plans etc. Of course we still need to engage in preparing materials etc but I think it’s really good for coming up with those initial ideas in the first place or helps to structure a set of lessons where you don’t have a clue where to start! 

I’ve also found lots of the ideas generated by chatGPT are similar to the ones we’ve been shown in uni as “good examples” so I wondered what everyone thought? :) ",User_deleted,1

Like any disruptive technology, ChatGPT has sparked a mix of excitement and concern. In educational contexts, ChatGPT promises individualized learning experiences, bridging the gap between students' diverse learning paces. Teachers could harness this AI to create interactive lessons or to serve as a tutoring assistant, offering students instant feedback and guidance.

However, skeptics point to the potential drawbacks. The issue of academic integrity arises when considering how easily students could use ChatGPT to complete assignments, potentially undermining learning processes. Moreover, there's the fear that standardized curricula implemented by AI might sacrifice creative and critical thinking for the sake of efficiency.

In the corporate realm, ChatGPT's impact seems overwhelmingly positive, providing employees with on-demand, personalized training opportunities without significant downtime. Corporate training modules can leverage ChatGPT to simulate real-world scenarios, equip employees with soft skills, or walk them through complex problem-solving processes.

Yet, this technological revolution begs the question: Are we ready to manage and regulate the use of such AI effectively? Will the inflection point of AI integration into learning paradigms lead to an educational renaissance or a dilution of essential human elements in teaching and learning processes?

Let's explore the multifaceted impact of ChatGPT on both the educational and corporate spheres. How is it reshaping the way we learn and teach? What policies should institutions implement to maximize its benefits while mitigating potential issues?

And if I'm short on time to complete my work or assignments, I use it to help me finish all my work and assignments for me as soon as possible. It makes my life so much easier and could also help me learn faster. I am wondering, before ChatGPT existed, do uni students have a much harder time studying and completing their assignments or any other work due to everything being super-fast paced without students having enough time to fully understand the material being taught in each course?

**If you do not have the funds, or the time to do what I did, please stop reading. I cannot guarantee you will find the same success I did. Do not drop everything you're doing to do this.**

From February to the end of June I took a total of 6 certifications. These are the ones I recommend completing

SAA-003: This is the best certification to start with. If you have 0 knowledge, it'll take you 2-3 months. It took me 2 weeks to study and pass. I used Neal Davis to study for this. Below is a link to his page. I bought all his courses because I plan on taking every certification he has taught. I created a free AWS account this month and ensured I knew what every service looked like.

[https://www.udemy.com/user/63f4a578-c67a-456b-916c-ddadf73e9a26/](https://www.udemy.com/user/63f4a578-c67a-456b-916c-ddadf73e9a26/)

SAP-C02: This is the next step in the Solutions Architect path. This test is hard, it took me another month of studying and I used Neal Davis's practice tests, took them over 30-40 times. He has a lot of hands-on projects, I did them all no matter the cost. 

DVA-C02: Another associate exam. Focuses on deploying, packaging, etc applications and CI/CD workflows. Not a hard test, took me around another 2 weeks to study.

Terraform Associate: Extermely easy exam. I bet an absolute beginner with 12 hours of time could pass this exam. Just do all your projects in terraform and you won't even have to study. 

This was all taken during my final semester as Computer Science major at a state school. I was only taking 2 classes so I devoted all my time to this, spent 6-7 hours studying, and the rest of my free time on projects. I had a friend give me a few ideas, had ChatGPT come up with a few, and did a few of my own. Most of them had to with creating an application from scratch, and figuring out the best ways to migrate it to the cloud. I will not be posting my projects, it'd be dead easy to identify me. Come up with your own creative projects.

Here is the link to a project I did complete in full detail: [https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1fax48r/comment/llwtnlm/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1fax48r/comment/llwtnlm/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

These certifications are sort of the bare minimum of what companies are looking for in my experience. I don't know how hard it'll be even if you complete these because I had a few more under my belt, but I'd be surprised if it was a lot tougher. 

Interviews are a whole other story. I'll give some pointers on how to apply and other tips:

1. Do not memorize. I cannot say this enough. Especially for the certifications, the associate ones can be easily done through memorization. Do yourself a favor and do not memorize, the companies require a much more thorough understanding than that. Only start applying when you know you are comfortable having a conversation about the provider you studied for. 

2. My resume was not anything fancy. Just a simple name at the top with basic information on how to contact me, my cert badges on either side, followed by my professional summary, skills, projects, experience and education. It all fit on one page and was concise. I have learned that recruiters do not give a fuck about you, half the time they cant even understand half the stuff you claim you can do. They are looking for keywords found in the job posting, put those in, make sure they see it, and you're golden. I also only showcased 2 projects I thought were relevant to their company.

3. Do not apply to remote options. I got zero callbacks from job postings offering remote work opportunities. Simply too competitive. Just filter to hybrid/onsite. 

4. Do not spam apply. It is useless, you will get shortlisted. Apply to 40-50 companies you think you genuinely have a shot at, edit your resume to fit their exact needs, and once you get the call for that first interview, start studying up on all the gaps you had to add. 

5. You can apply to ones asking for Azure or GCP certs along with AWS ones. Do not apply to postings that are specific to Azure, GCP, etc.

6. Once you do get to the technical interviews, I found that most of my interviews that went well were more like conversations. The interviewers would ask me a question and then I'd not only answer it, but relate it to a project I worked on, just tried to show them that I had the experience in the services even though it wasn't in an actual job setting. We would talk back and forth, I'd learn something from them, they'd learn something from me. To be honest, it seemed like they were under qualified to interview me, but it was fun nonetheless. 

7. I never specifically prepared for any interview. After making my whole life the cloud, I was extremely confident when talking and never felt nervous during the process. You do not need to do any leetcode, but you will need to know your shit. HCL is a language you will need to learn. 

8. If you're applying as an international student, I want to wish you a good luck. I would not go down this path at all. Every single company I applied to refused to sponsor in their job posting, so you guys are better putting your time somewhere else. Maybe if you're omega rich and have nothing to lose.

It took a lot of money, I spent easily over 5-6 grand on learning everything. There is unfortunately no shortcuts I can recommend other than the shortened certification journey above. Again, if you can't put in the time or money, I don't recommend investing in this field. Do not start this journey if you don't think you can see it through. I didn't see the light at the end of the tunnel until I got quick callbacks so it was a gamble for 6 months.

Just to end this ""college essay"" I wrote out, I used to game quite a bit, but basically went ""cold turkey"" and destroyed my social life to get to this point and I do not regret it. I'd rather be crying with a job alone than crying with my friends that I don't have one. ",active,26
1ffllns,9,2024-09-12,"OpenAI’s new “reasoning” AI models are here: o1-preview and o1-mini

Formally named ""[OpenAI o1](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/),"" the model family will initially launch in two forms, [o1-preview](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/) and [o1-mini](https://openai.com/index/openai-o1-mini-advancing-cost-efficient-reasoning/), available today for ChatGPT Plus and certain API users.

  
OpenAI claims that o1-preview outperforms its predecessor, [GPT-4o](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/), on multiple benchmarks, including competitive programming, mathematics, and ""scientific reasoning."" However, people who have used the model say it does not yet outclass GPT-4o in every metric. Other users have [criticized](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/new-details-on-openais-strawberry-apples-siri-makeover-larry-ellison-doubles-down-on-data-centers) the delay in receiving a response from the model, owing to the multi-step processing occurring behind the scenes before answering a query.

In a rare display of public hype-busting, OpenAI product manager Joanne Jang [tweeted](https://x.com/joannejang/status/1834286774140498368), ""There's a lot of o1 hype on my feed, so I'm worried that it might be setting the wrong expectations. what o1 is: the first reasoning model that shines in really hard tasks, and it'll only get better. (I'm personally psyched about the model's potential & trajectory!) what o1 isn't (yet!): a miracle model that does everything better than previous models. you might be disappointed if this is your expectation for today's launch—but we're working to get there!""

OpenAI reports that o1-preview ranked in the 89th percentile on competitive programming questions from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/contests/). In mathematics, it scored 83 percent on a qualifying exam for the International Mathematics Olympiad, compared to GPT-4o's 13 percent. OpenAI also states, in a claim that may later be challenged as people scrutinize the benchmarks and run their own evaluations over time, o1 [performs comparably to PhD students](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/) on specific tasks in physics, chemistry, and biology.

1fgc3zc,110,2024-09-13,Passed Network+ today after studying for 12 days - My advice to those studying!,u/cashfile,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/1fgc3zc/passed_network_today_after_studying_for_12_days/,"**Warning this is going to be a looooonnnnnng post, I will provide a TLDR at the end. I'll also be breaking it into subsections to make it easier to read! If anyone actually makes it through this 5-page essay congrats lol! I spent like \~2 hr writing it hopefully it helpful to someone.**

**Overview:** In this post, I'm gonna mention how I passed the Network+ with just 12 days of studying including the resources I used, *how my initial studying plan failed*, and how I would redo it now knowing what I know as I believe I could complete it in 7 days final strategy.   The primary reason I'm writing this is to help those looking for certification as I think the common way I see mentioned through this thread is massively ineffective and something I initially fell into. Additionally, when I was 5-7 days in I really wanted to quit and just buy a new voucher for more time as I was seeing a lot of people saying it was impossible to study for in this short of a time period. But it was a post and YouTube video I found of people also completing it in a similar timeframe usually two weeks and made me think if they can do it so can I! Lastly, I’ve always wanted a super detailed write-down that included everything one did so I decided to make one. 

P.S. I don't recommend you take in 12 days, but I'll go further into recommendations section.

**Tech Background:** I am currently a graduate student in cybersecurity risk management (not a very technical degree, most GRC and policy-based), no prior direct IT (help desk, networking, sysadmin, etc) background but I previously worked as a software engineer for a year between undergrad and grad school. Additionally this past summer I worked as a cybersecurity intern, but again it was mostly policy-based creating, managing, and revising SoPs, documentation (Incident response for IT & OT, password policy, COOP, etc), running internal phishing campaigns, and creating cybersecurity training materials and internal newsletters. Lastly, I've been a security researcher at a University lab for the past 2 years working on the intersection of AI & privacy, with 3 publications thus far but there is no overlap with networking. My study is in regards to how AI can be used to enhance users' end privacy primarily in regards to photo sharing and social media. Between my undergrad in informatics (study of how people interact with computers think UX/UI, project management, etc ), work/research experience, and graduate school I primarily have a rough understanding of the OSI model (not as detailed as mentioned through the Network+), different cloud environments, and knew about 1/3rd of the information mentioned in Domain 4.0: Network Security but maybe not to exact degree/definition mentioned through the Network+. However, I don't think this played a huge role in my ability to pass it in 12 days as I studied all domains equally so even if I didn't have prior knowledge I would have covered it extensively, but it is important I mention it. Though my years of procrastinating in college have taught me how to devise a plan to learn things quickly and effectively.

**Why Network+:** The reason I decided to take Network+ is I wanted a more technical understanding of cybersecurity, as my scholarship gives me 3k a semester to spend on certificates and I want to take the OSCP I figured it best to start with a strong foundational knowledge of Networking+ before moving onto penetration testing.

**Why 12 Days\*:** I studied it in 12 days because the voucher was only to expire because I procrastinated and my professional development fund can only be used on each certificate once (i.e. no retakes).  It actually turned out to be just 10 days as I started on Monday, Sept 2nd and took the test this morning today Friday, Sept 12th. Besides not being able to study much on Friday morning due to my test center being an hour away, on Thursday, Sept 5th I had to go out of town and got back late at night and had no desire to study. Additionally, on Tuesday, the 3rd I only studied for 2 hours due to other school obligations. So in actuality, it was closer to 10 days that I studied and not 12.

**Why Days Are A Terrible Tracking Metric:** Before I go on, I want to see something that is commonly mentioned in this subreddit and that is how many 'days' a person studied. This is a terrible metric because someone who is a graduate student with a lot of free time can study 7-10 hours a day, This could be the equivalent to someone with a wife and kids studying for 3-6 weeks if they only have 2-4 hours a day to study.  Hours are a far better metric and through my 12-day journey, I put in roughly \~90 hours.

**My Initial Learning Plan:** My initial learning plan was similar to what I constantly see mentioned through this subreddit including people who failed tests more than once and that is to keep cramming the material from different sources. My initial plan was to watch the Messer videos (14hrs), and Mike Meyer video series (21 hrs), read the Network+ Review Guide (532pgs) then do the Jason Dion practice tests. For the first 3-4 days I attempted this, the review book was 532 pages so I figured if I read 80 pages a day I would be done in 6.5 days on top of that I would watch the Mike Meyer video series on 2x speed which meant that in 5 days I could complete it if I watched 2 hours day and then I could move on to the Messer video series also at 2x speed and complete it 3.5 days. I could complete both the video series & book in roughly \~ 9 days (assuming I'm reading alongside watching the video series) leaving 3 days for practice tests and reviews. This is similar to what I saw throughout the subreddit, take the material from various sources ideally a mixture of books and videos, and then take practice tests. So I set out on this path on Monday, Sept 3rd.

**How It Failed Miserably:** Firstly, I come from a research background where I have to lit reviews on dozens of papers that can oftentimes be boring but fuck me I have never read such a boring book. It has nothing to do with the author it's just that Network+ material can't be any more boring at least for me. Additionally, I underestimated how long it 'feels' to read network+ review books for \~4 hr straight every single day. Midway the through third day was \~200 into the 532-page review book, and I completed 4 of 11 hours of the Mike Meyer video series, but I still felt like I wasn't learning anything and it felt like I wasn't retaining anything. Particularly with domain 1 which to me even till the end I found the most difficult due to the sheer memorization of cables, connectors, etc. So instead of continuing another 2 hour of Mike Meyer video series, I decided to review Domain 1 by watching Messer's video on Domain 1. After 2 hour of watching I got done with Domain 1 and part of Domain 2 from the Messer video series. Still felt like I knew nothing but I remembered I had the Sybex Network+ Practice test book that came in a Network+ bundle. So I tried a handful of domain 1 questions which it included \~300, and after doing 10 questions and checking the answer I realized ... I had failed 8 out of 10 questions and I was stunned. As I had consumed material on Domain 1 via 3 different sources (1 book, 2 video series) and I still couldn't answer any of the practice questions. At this point, I went to bed discouraged and basically thought I could never adequately prepare with only 9 days remaining.  The next day I was out of town and when I got home I decided fuck it and didn’t study. The following day when I woke up (day 5, Sept 6th) and did a handful more practice questions was failing around 60-80%. This is when it clicked...

**The Clicking Moment:** I realized 3 core things - 1) Even though I had consumed the material from three different sources it wasn't sticking 2) Between the boring book and failing almost all my practice questions, my current method was unsustainable and I either needed to give up or devise a new plan 3) I was learning way more from my failure on practice question and reading the Sybex explanation that explained why the option was correct and way other 3 option were wrong than from any of direct material I was consuming.  This is when I realized my new plan!

**New & Success Strategy:** PRACTICE QUESTIONS... PRACTICE QUESTIONS... PRATICE QUESTIONS!!!! I decided to spend the majority of my remaining time (8 days) on practice questions, however, I knew I still needed some base foundational material so I went with Messer for 2 reasons. It was shortest at 14 hrs (7hrs 2x speed), and it was broken down to a domain similar to the Sybex Practice Test guide. The Sybex practice test book was the best resource throughout my entire study and I'll explain why in a section called ‘Golden Resource’. Sybex practice test book containing 1100 questions (\~300 questions for domain 1, and \~ 200 questions each for domain 2-5) I started doing roughly 100 questions a day. While continuing to watch rest Messer's video over the next 2 days. Up to this point 7 days in, Sat Sept 8th, I had only finished the domain questions for domain 3 and realized I was taking wayyy too long at this pace as answering the 100 questions took me roughly 6 hours between reading the paragraphs for each explanation as well as using mixture specialized version of ChatGPT I created (will discuss this later) to explain everything that Sybex explanation didn’t clear up as well as acronyms that were just expected to be known from A+ 1 & 2. After this point, I decided to just the odd question from domains 2-5 so roughly \~100 question from each section rather than the full 200 that way I could have Wednesday and Thursday to do practice tests. I stayed on this path studying \~6-7 hours a day by the time Wednesday morning came I had finished all five domains and was ready to move on to practice tests. Additionally, I want to note even throughout this time I wanted to give up as when I was doing practice questions even though it was better than consuming the materials, I was still failing 50-60% of questions on the first try (only went through once) and this was true through all \~700 questions I went through. However, I knew because of how I analyzed every question after I got it right or wrong if I saw the same question or a similar question again I would be able to get it right. I also really struggled with the acronyms as once I stopped reading after domain 1 & part way through domain 2 there weren’t many examples of acronyms being spelled out and you were just assumed to know. I solved this issue at the very end mentioned in my ‘Final Stretch’ section.  

**Final Stretch:** For my practice tests, I started with tests by ‘TotalSem’ never heard of them before and didn’t see in mentioned in this subreddit when I was looking for materials, but came across it on Linked Learning when navigating to Mike Meyers' course. They have 4 timed practice tests with 90 questions each (no PBQs). Figured the more pratice tests the merrier and I didn’t want to jump straight onto Jason Dion tests without. I will post my practice test scores for all practice tests I took in a section titled ‘Practice Test Scores’. Honestly, not the biggest fan of these tests due to the wording, I found the wording to be most confusing out of Sybex & Jason Dion, but overall worth doing if you have LinkedIn Learning but probably not worth subscribing for. I completed all four of these 90-minute tests on Wednesday and went over correct and incorrect answers in detail, additionally, I then did 1 of 6 Jason Dion tests. (I used Udemy 7-day free trial for Jason Dion's test, there should also be a LinkedIn Learning free trial for those who don’t already have it.). On Thursday day before the exam, I completed five Jason Dion practice tests and reviewed all the answers. On Friday morning, I watched 14-series playlists called ‘CompTIA Network+ 008 PBQs’ on Youtube by JustCallMeRed, which goes over 14 PBQs from the Comptia official CertMaster platform, this is extremely helpful. I watched all 14 videos at 2x speed and took roughly an hour this along with practice questions and knowing how to apply the knowledge is most likely all needed for the PBQs. Finally, I drove an hour, arrived 30 minutes early, and spent 15 minutes reviewing ports, RAID levels, as well as a few 802.11 standards, things I personally had trouble remembering will differ for each person. 

**Exam & Passing Score:** I passed the score with a 765 out of 900. Not terrible for \~9 days of studying, just glad for it to be over. I received 70 questions, four of which were PBQs. One note about the PBQs, I almost failed due to PBQs. I finished all 66 multi-choice questions with \~ 50 remaining. Finished two of my PBQs in roughly 20 minutes than remaining two of my PBQs were terminal based. I couldn’t get any command to run and had 30 minutes left to complete both of them. I spent 15 minutes figuring out how to do terminal base question, as none of the typical commands that came to my head and were mentioned such netstat, ip, hostname, etc weren't working. At one point I literally, almost gave up and just submitted the test and wanted to cry… But I kept trying with 15 minute left and no progress on the 2 PBQs, I used the help command. This displayed a list of commands I could actually use. If you get terminal PBQ use the fucking help command. It is a lifesaver. After that with \~15 minutes remaining, I was able to complete one of the two PBQs and do partial work on my second PBQ. This was most likely the difference between passing and failing. Due to this hiccup, I didn’t have any time to review my question even though I flew through the first 66 questions. | Exam Passing Proof: [Image Link](https://imgur.com/a/KDKj8YC)

**Acronyms & Ports:** On Wednesday I realized I was still lacking in regards to acronyms, and decided to download an Anki (SRS Flashcard) deck that contained all requirement acronyms listed Exam objectives \~200, I actually only ended up completing about 100 as I did first 100 on Wednesday night and didn’t have time to finish the remainder before Friday’s exam but it was helpful and I would recommend. Additionally, I downloaded a deck containing all the required port numbers twice, containing both Port -> Protocol Name Format as well as Protocol name -> Port format. I did this deck on Wednesday night, Thursday night, and Friday morning. Memorizing both acronyms and ports are life savers I would recommend this to anyone as really helps you narrow down potential answers, even if you don’t know what a word actually means such  CWDM, Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing is, if the question mentions wavelength it could help narrow down the answers or if mentions DNS you can image that CWDM probably wouldn’t be an answer. This narrowing down the potential answers can definitely be the difference between passing and failing. 

**Note Taking:** I didn’t take notes, but I did buy Messer Notes, and only used them a handful of times as quick reference material including to review while sitting in the car outside the testing center. Not needed at all, but helpful if you have the extra $30 lying around. Besides that, I don’t think taking note of video series is a valuable use of your time. You are far better off cramming more practice questions. 

**Subnetting:** 1) First fuckkkkk Classless subnetting, I hate it and it memorizing it feels like when a math teacher tell you won’t always have a calculator with you. For the exam you only need to know /25 - 31. Don’t even bother Messer 7 second subnetting diagram it wayy to complicated just use the one below it was the minimal amount of information but it all you will need for Jason Dion practice exams as well as actual exam. The Sybex question do ask question that go outside of /25 - 31. This table is super easier to memorize and takes 15 seconds to write down. The only thing you have to do in your head is calculate the associated network ID. For example (taken from Jason Dion) - What is the network ID associated with the host located at 192.168.0.123/29? For this look at /29 in the table, you will see 8 hosts. Out of possible answers: 1) 192.168.0.120 2) 192.168.0.112 3) 192.168.0.96 4) 192.168.0.64. The only possible answer is 1) because .120 that is less than 123 and within 8 host range. Additionally, a Network Address will always end with an even number (ex - .120) with the only exception being ‘.0’, while a broadcast address will always end with an odd number (ex. 255) this rule holds true for /25-/31 unsure if that is the case outside of those parameters .

**Golden Resource:** I'm going to shill here for a moment but out of all resources for practice questions which I will cover later, the Sybex Practice Test book or ideally online version (makes it faster to review explanations and grade answers by putting a copy on each monitor rather than flipping through the back of the book), had by far the best explanation! Better than Jason Dion, better than TotalSems practice tests (on LinkedIn learning), better than Compass Exam. It provides a detailed explanation of why you got something right and why the other answers are wrong. While most other resources focus on why the correct answer was correct, this resource also explain why the other is incorrect. For each question \~1100 (\~300 questions for domain 1, and \~ 200 questions each for domain 2-5) as well as additionally 180 question in the form of 2 practice test, it provide a paragraph explanation. By reading through these explanation even if you got the answer right you are essentially reading 1200 paragraphs, but it doesn't feel as boring as Network+ review guide and it show it in actual applicable circumstances. It is ironically the best Network+ textbook without being a textbook.  Additionally, the questions are broken into domains but questions are then ordered by subdomain as well so as you progress through the 300 questions for domain 1 you will notice the first \~50-60 are all domain 1.1 then the next 50-60 questions are domain 1.2, etc. It does go far more in-depth than you will need for Network+ such as subnetting questions you wouldn't be asked but having that extra solid foundation doesn’t hurt.  Lastly, don’t feel bad if you are doing poorly I was getting roughly 50-60% of the questions wrong through all \~700 questions I completed, however, I learned from every mistake. 

**Custom ChatGPT:** To answer most of my questions I created a custom ChatGPT using the legacy GPT 4 model, the only one that allows you actually create a custom model and upload PDFs and save it. I took a purchased copy of the PDF of 532 Network+ Sybex Review Guide, split five domains into their own chapter, and uploaded all five PDFs into the GPT’s knowledge base. I then used it to ask questions, I found this preferable to the newer 4o or 4mini model as well as Google. When using default ChatGPT or Google sometimes I would get an answer that didn’t align with the Network+ way of things. Lastly, by using this custom model, I could actually ask it what page it got it the information from and if I needed more information I could go directly to that section in the PDF itself and continue reading up on it. Note: To be careful in general with AI tools in the \~100-125 questions I asked it did get \~2-4 questions wrong. 

**Resources Used (& Recommended):** 

* Prof. Messer's Video (@2x Speed if you are in a time crunch - [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9134180/) have shown even with medical students ([study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10354881/)) dealing with complex information there is negligible to no memory or comprehension loss between 1x, 1.5x, 2x)
* Sybex Practice Test \~1100 questions + additional 180 questions from 2 practice exams
   * Only completed \~700 questions (300 from Domain 1, and 100 from Domains 2-5), didn’t touch the practice exams. 
* TotalSems Practice Tests (4) - 90 Questions 90 Mins (no PBQs) on LinkedIn Learning
   * Practice Exams Score (1st & Only Try): 87%, 81%, 72%, 86;
* Jason Dion Practice Tests (6) - 90 Question 90 Min (Includes PBQs) on Udemy
   * Practice Exams Score (1st & Only Try): 75%, 86%, 82%, 78%, 88%, 83%;
* Anki Decks
   * Acronyms \~ 200 cards - Taken from Network+ Exam Objectives
      * Only got half-way through
   * Port Deck \~ 50 cards (\~25 x 2) - Taken from Network+ Exam Objectives
      * Completed Deck in both formats (i.e. port on front and protocol on front). 

**How I Would Do It Over:** First cramming it in 12 days is dumb, but regardless day limit if I only had 70-90 hours to study, I would watch Professor Messer's video series in 2x, complete all \~1100 questions in Sybex practice book and additional 180 questions from two practice exams included, complete all 4 TotalSems practices test, and all 6 Jason Dion test. I would also complete either Anki deck or flash cards containing all required acronyms and another deck for required ports. Additionally, I would watch the 14-video series on PBQs on the day or a day or two prior to taking the exam. Lastly, make a note of anything you have terrible memorizing to review day of the exam ideally less than 1-2 hrs of material. For it was RAID levels, Severity levels, 802.11, and various fiber optics connectors.  This could be done in a week if you have 10 hours a day to spend for 7 days in a row, or could be done over 1-2 months. Regardless of the person, I truly don’t think going past 3 months is helpful as you will start to forget stuff. We’ve known since 1968 from psychologist [Dr. Welford's study titled ‘Fundamentals of Skills’](https://gwern.net/doc/psychology/1968-welford-fundamentalsofskill.pdf) that learning acquisition starts to diminish after studying the same topic for more than 3 hours in a row. This was also confirmed multiple times in more modern studies with some suggesting in less time on a single topic.  The longer after you will start to see diminishing returns. I would recommend around \~3 hours a day for a period of 25-30 days which would be 80-90 hours. 

**What's Next For Me:** After completing the Network+, I want to move onto penetration testing. I've bought vouchers for eJPT & eCPT. I will complete both of those before the end of this year and then move onto the OSCP by the end of this year. During this time I will also probably some time to study for Security+ between now and the end of the year. But I will never cram in this short of a time frame again because it was wayy to stressful and between studying for Network+, graduate school, and my research I was getting \~4-5 hours of sleep a night for two weeks straight.

**Final Note:** If you actually read all of this you are a MAD MAN, and you really should do something more useful with your time. Regardless, hopefully, this helped someone by either setting them on the right path or inspires that they don’t need to give up if their voucher is about to expire. You can do this people! 

**TLDR:** Don’t constantly use multiple video courses, and a book to learn the material. Pick one thing, such as Professor Messer's Video series, then focus on practice questions, practice questions, practice questions!! I recommend Sybex Practice Tests as it has \~1100 questions split between 5 domains plus in additional 180 questions from 2 practice exams included. Additionally do as many practice tests as you can, ideally including Jason Dion 6 practice exams. Your main form of learning should be through the practice exams and practice questions and learning why you failed or got a question correct. Even if you got a question correct take a moment to understand why it is correct and why the other options wouldn’t work. Ideally spend \~3 hours a day for maximal acquisition before diminishing returns, over the course of 30 days (\~90 hrs). This is enough time to complete all the information mentioned in the “How I Would Do It Over” section and be extremely comfortable on the exam for the vast majority of people.",active,134

In the corporate sector, the incorporation of ChatGPT-powered tools has revolutionized training programs by providing on-demand, personalized learning experiences. Employees can interact with AI chatbots to receive tailored instructions, clarify doubts, or practice skills at their own pace, without the need for constant human intervention. This not only saves resources but also enhances the learning process as individuals receive immediate feedback and support.

Moreover, ChatGPT's language processing capabilities make it an attractive tool for global companies to offer training in multiple languages, ensuring inclusivity and better comprehension for non-native English speakers.

On the educational front, institutions have begun to explore the potential of ChatGPT to aid in classroom learning and homework assistance. The ability to generate explanations, summarize content, and provide examples on a wide array of subjects makes it a useful assistant for both students and educators. Whether it's to prepare for exams, create engaging content, or simulate discussions – the possibilities seem boundless.

However, the integration of ChatGPT also raises concerns such as the potential for plagiarism, diminished human interaction, and over-reliance on technology. Finding the balance between leveraging AI for its benefits while maintaining the integrity of traditional learning will be crucial.

1flpirt,1,2024-09-20,My school suspended me over a hawk tauh hoco sign,u/Barackobama4real,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1flpirt/my_school_suspended_me_over_a_hawk_tauh_hoco_sign/,"This story is a bit long but i promise its worth reading. I (17M) wanted to ask this one girl out to Homecoming. My friends and I had the idea of publicity proposing to her in the middle of my High School lunch room with a sign and me reading out a poem. We figured that it would be funny and a rememberable experience so I didn't really care if she rejects me. Also Half of the lunch room already knew that my friends and I are the type to fool around so we could easily just say it was a joke even if she rejects me. Anyways I really wasn't that into her too. So then it came day that I was actually going to do it. My friends and I got a big sign and I got some cheesy love poem from ChatGPT to read outloud.

 My friend got a idea from Tiktok of putting down, ""Don't want Hawk Tuah, but lemme talk tauh at hoco."" We thought it was a funny remix of the hawk tauh meme, and that it was so stupid it was good so we decided to put it down. We also got tried to ask the people at our school store for the microphone, but it had no battery so that idea was scraped.  Then the moment finally came I was gonna ask her. My friend group gathered in a circle behind me, the girl's friend group was ready to record since we told them about it, and we told a couple of our other friend's and their friends from the lunch room to gather in front of me. 

 I stood up on the lunch table chair and yelled ""CAN I GET EVERYBODY'S ATTENTION PLEASE."" Everybody then stood up since they knew I was gonna ask a girl out(big sign gave it away.) I then read out my love poem. When I finished I held up my Hawk Tauh sign and asked her to hoco. At this point everyone knew it was a joke because I didn't look that serious when doing it and everyone including me and the girl was dying laughing during it. The girl, while dying laughing  shook her head no, but then I lied to crowd and said she said yes. At that moment everyone started going crazy and my other friend picked me up. I then posed for some pictures with the sign until the lunch bell rang. 

The next hour I had government class with the same girl I proposed too and couple other of my friends who helped me plan it out, and we were just laughing about it the entire hour. Even the teacher who also witnessed it thought it was the funniest thing he ever saw teaching. And I thought that was the end of it. But the next hour I got called down to the principals office. I knew it was about the hoco proposal but I didn't think much about it since I knew everyone thought it was funny and not serious including the girl. I arrived at the principals office and the principal said he got a tip from the lunch lady that I was holding a inappropriate sign. 

I then told him nothing about the sign was inappropriate and that I didn't mean it too be. He said your sign said ""Hawk tauh"" what does that mean? I said means to spit. He then said spitting on what exactly? I was confused, and I said, out of your mouth? He then told me to stop playing games and that it is a viral internet video of a girl saying Hawk tauh in an inappropriate context. I said I didn't mean for the sign to even hint at that, and that the word ""Hawk tauh"" is just a onomatopoeia that just means spitting. He then got mad and started accussing me of playing games with him and that I knew what i was doing.

 I said there's no proof that I even meant the sign to interpreted in any way bad and I did nothing wrong. He then put me in another office for 20ish minutes alone and came in and told me to go back to class. He also told me to not come to school tomorrow while he investigates (he didn't even suspend me, he just told me to not come to school.) I went back to class and finished the school day. When I came home my dad told me that he got a voice message from the principal saying that I was holding a sexual sign that meant spitting on the male genitals to a girl and that i shouldn't come to school tomorrow. My dad was mad, and he told what the sign said. I said, ""Don't want hawk tauh, but lemme talk tauh at hoco.""

 Then he got confused and asked how that would be sexual? I said he misunderstood the sign in some weird way and now the principal is trying to suspend me. The very next day I didn't come to school(I wanted to go to school since I wasn't suspended, but my dad said play it safe.) meanwhile while I was at home I started a petition on change.org in which I explained my situation and I spread it around people from my school. It ended up getting 130 signatures so far because of how people think im being treated unfairly by the principal. 

I heard from my friends who were in the girl's classes that she was getting called down to the office nearly every hour to be questioned by the principal. The principal even went as far to call the girl's parents and to what I assume explain his over sexualized perspective of how things went down despite having no proof that I meant anything bad. (The girl even defended me in the office too.) At the end of the that school day my principal called my dad saying that I was suspended for TWO WEEKS. My dad is very confused on how I got such a strict punishment for doing literally nothing wrong. We are planning on speaking to the school board about it and the principal. We are also planning on showing our petition to them. If you have a minute to spare, I'd appreciate it if you also signed the petition too🙏🏼.  The petition is called, ""Support Utica High School Student expression,"" on change . Org with me holding the same hawk tauh sign with a brown shirt. Thanks for reading",User_deleted,0

 I am an international student from Europe studying ECE at Zhejiang University in the UIUC program in China. I’ll end up with a Chinese degree, but ever since I was a kid, I always wanted to visit the U.S. and study there. I worked really hard for that dream. Since I was in the IB program and had to focus on my exams—on top of a heavy course load—I needed help with my university applications. I hired a company that was supposed to assist me with the process, but they ended up ruining all my dreams of getting into a U.S. college because they scammed me. They were writing all the essays with ChatGPT and similar tools.

After my dreams were shattered, I lost all motivation to study. My predicted grade was 40/45 (I worked really hard for that), but I ended up getting 28/45. They did help me get into universities in China because my dad requested it, and now I’m here. Honestly, I like this place, but it doesn’t feel the same, and I feel really depressed because I had a different vision for my future.

I can’t fully enjoy the ‘college life’ here because it’s just not what I wanted, and now I’m stuck at ZJU for four years. I feel really down because this isn’t where I dreamed of being.

1fnfxiv,1,2024-09-23,Approaching teaching intermediate students and advising them to integrate chatGPT in their studying ,u/Murmuring_Mystic4,ESL_Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/ESL_Teachers/comments/1fnfxiv/approaching_teaching_intermediate_students_and/,"Hello,

I've been teaching for about two years now, mostly to levels up to B1. This year, a former class of adults, with whom I already covered most of the basics of grammar, has showed up again. We've already covered topics such as modal verbs, the present perfect, conditionals, several phrasal verbs, and more. I can see they are somewhat able to express their opinions on topics, although with some difficulty. At the same time, I feel like rehashing the same topics at this point would be a disservice to them.

I've always been a fan of Anki to improve studying efficiency and, as I myself have started using chatGPT from time to time to quickly generate sentences that I would then propose to students for some exercises. Since the new term is starting, I have been thinking of saying to them directly: ""Look, as my goal is to help you become more independent, and given that we live in 2024, you should really know that you can use this tool to generate sentences that you can incorporate into your study routine.""

Most of these students do not aim for certificates and are here simply to ""improve."" However, I wonder how much more I can do for them, given that they are at a level where, with a bit of effort, they could manage their own studies. As I see it now, my role with them would be to: (1) correct their mistakes during activities; and (2) find topics and original material (videos, articles exc.) that can prompt engaging conversations and encourage them to speak. To be honest, I see myself as little more than a conversation partner or master of cerimonies now. Ultimately, I fear that I feel like my role isn't really that relevant at this stage anymore and I don't know what to do about it.

I'm aware that this question possibly stems from these somewhat self-defeating beliefs, and I know that this would make for a completely different discussion. Regardless of what angle you'll want to take, I'd appreciate any feedback from colleagues.

1fnoqgn,1,2024-09-23,ChatGPT's Impact on Business Productivity: Which Sectors Are Transformed the Most?,u/cporter202,ChatGPTautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTautomation/comments/1fnoqgn/chatgpts_impact_on_business_productivity_which/,"With the advent of OpenAI's ChatGPT, we're witnessing a paradigm shift in how businesses operate across various sectors. This powerful language processing tool has the potential to revolutionize productivity by automating tasks, aiding in decision-making, and offering innovative solutions.

One of the most affected sectors is customer service. ChatGPT enables businesses to provide instantaneous, round-the-clock support through chatbots, reducing wait times and freeing human agents for more complex queries. This not only improves customer experience but also streamlines operations and cuts costs.

In content creation and marketing, ChatGPT’s ability to generate written material quickly can significantly increase output without compromising on quality. Marketers can generate ad copies, articles, and social media content more efficiently, allowing them to focus on strategy and creativity.

Furthermore, the tech and developer communities greatly benefit from ChatGPT's ability to understand and produce code. This capability can accelerate the development process, debugging, and even serve as an educational tool for learning new programming languages or frameworks.

Education also stands to gain immensely, as ChatGPT can tailor learning materials to individual needs, answer student inquiries, and provide explanations for complex concepts, essentially offering a personalized tutoring experience.

1fnq8wn,1,2024-09-23,How to automatically generate class notes for your classes with ChatGPT and speech-to-text!,u/OmniTeacher,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1fnq8wn/how_to_automatically_generate_class_notes_for/,"Hello all! 

I know some students have IEPs that say they should always be given class notes, and class notes are generally just a nice thing to have, so I thought I'd share this workflow I came up with!

If you have Microsoft OneNote (through an Office subscription), if you click on the Home bar on the top menu bar, then the three dots on the right to see extra hidden options, all the way at the bottom is a Transcribe feature. And it works really well! Not perfectly, but surprisingly well, and best of all, as far as I can see, you can automatically speech-to-text an unlimited amount of audio per month? All you need to do is remember to hit Transcribe to start at the beginning and end (to stop) of each class period.

  
You can then click ""Add to Page - Text with Speakers"" to copy/paste the full transcription into a OneNote page. (I generally just make a new page for each class labeled like P1 09.23.2024, P2 09.23.2024, etc.)

  
FINALLY, copy and paste all of that into ChatGPT with the following instructions at the front! Just copy/paste this, then copy/paste the transcript text:

""The input you receive will be the outputs of a relatively, but not perfectly, accurate speech to text transcription software from a classroom environment with a teacher or teachers, and multiple student speakers.



You will do your best to account in the text you receive for the types of grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, dropped punctuation marks and quotation marks, and skipped words common in speech to text transcription outputs.  



Having done this, based on the class transcript you are provided, you will please:

1. Provide a brief summary of the main points (2-3 sentences)

2. Break down the content into 3-5 main topics

3. List 5-10 key terms or concepts

4. Generate 3 review questions



Transcript:

{transcript}



Format the output as follows:

Summary:

\[Your summary here\]



Main Topics:

1. \[Topic 1\]

2. \[Topic 2\]

...



Key Terms and Concepts:

- \[Term 1\]

- \[Term 2\]

...



Review Questions:

1. \[Question 1\]

2. \[Question 2\]

3. \[Question 3\]

""""""""

OR, if you want (and especially if you have ChatGPT pro, as the length of a full transcript of a 45 minute class generally seems to be too much for a free chatgpt account), you can try using this link I made up:

[https://chatgpt.com/g/g-YdG002zeX-transcript-summarizer-and-instant-class-notes-gpt](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-YdG002zeX-transcript-summarizer-and-instant-class-notes-gpt)

If that link or your free ChatGPT account both don't work because the transcript is too long, if you sign up for [Claude.ai](http://Claude.ai), and use the exact same prompt + copy/paste of the transcript, that SHOULD work, even with a free version!!!  


Just thought I'd share because I found this to be pretty cool and I hated typing up class notes for IEP compliance otherwise!",active,0

I do feel a bit guilty about using this tool, though. What do you think? Does this approach seem okay to you?
