1ellnjs,1,2024-08-06,💡 New App Idea: Node-Based LLM Interaction for Enhanced Productivity - Seeking Feedback!,u/Artistic-Lock-6710,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1ellnjs/new_app_idea_nodebased_llm_interaction_for/,"Hey everyone!

I’ve been working on a new app concept that I think could revolutionize how we interact with large language models (LLMs) and manage complex discussions. I’d love to get your feedback and insights on it! 🙌



**🎯 What is it?**

Imagine a node-based interface where each conversation can branch into different threads or nodes. Each node retains the context of the main discussion but focuses on a specific subtopic. This structure is designed to help users manage complex projects, brainstorm ideas, and collaborate more effectively.

  
**🚧 Challenges with Current Interfaces:**

When using current LLM conversational interfaces, I’ve noticed a few significant challenges. Tracking and revisiting previous topics in a linear sequence is cumbersome, making it hard to organize and connect information meaningfully. The sheer volume of information generated can be overwhelming, leading to cognitive overload. As I explore multiple topics, the interface can quickly become visually cluttered, making it difficult to understand the relationships between different discussions. Additionally, the constant need to switch contexts between exploring information and synthesizing insights disrupts my workflow and makes the process inefficient.



**🧩 Key Features:**

**1. Contextual Clarity**:

* Each node focuses on a specific aspect, making it easier to manage detailed discussions.
* Context retention ensures continuity and relevance.

**2. Organized Navigation**:

* Hierarchical navigation allows easy access to different nodes without losing track of the main topic.
* A visual map displays the overall structure and interconnections between nodes.

**3. Flexibility**:

* Parallel discussions can happen simultaneously without cluttering the main thread.
* Focused collaboration on specific nodes enhances productivity.



**📚 Potential Use Cases:**

* **Project Management**: Break down complex projects into manageable sub-tasks, each with its own discussion thread.
* **Brainstorming Sessions**: Organize brainstorming ideas into separate nodes for clarity and further development.
* **Research and Development**: Track different research topics and their progress in an organized manner.
* **Customer Support**: Handle multiple customer queries simultaneously, with each issue in its own node.
* **Educational Purposes**: Facilitate student-teacher interactions with focused discussion nodes for each topic or assignment.



**🚀 Why I’m Excited:**

I believe this app can significantly improve productivity and collaboration across various fields. Whether you’re managing a project, conducting research, or brainstorming new ideas, this structured approach can help you stay organized and focused.



**🤔 How You Can Help:**

**Would you find this tool useful?** If so, in what context?

**What features would you like to see?** Any must-haves or deal-breakers?

**What potential challenges do you foresee?** How can we address them?



**🙏 Thank You!**

Your feedback is incredibly valuable to me. I’m looking forward to hearing your thoughts and making this concept even better with your input!



**TL;DR:**

I’m developing a node-based app for LLM interactions to enhance productivity and manage complex discussions. Seeking feedback on its usefulness, features, and potential challenges. Share your thoughts!

ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art language processing AI, offers a personalized, interactive, and scalable approach to learning, marking a shift from traditional, often passive learning experiences.

In corporate settings, onboarding and continuous professional development are crucial for maintaining a competitive edge. ChatGPT facilitates this by providing tailored learning materials, engaging employees with conversational knowledge checks, and adapting to individual learning paces. Its 24/7 availability ensures that training sessions can be accessed at any time, thereby accommodating diverse schedules and work environments. This flexibility leads to better resource management and a decrease in training costs.

Educational institutions can also harness the power of ChatGPT to supplement classroom teaching. By integrating ChatGPT into their learning management systems, they can offer students additional support with homework, clarify complex topics through interactive discussions, and foster a deeper understanding of the subject matter. ChatGPT can also serve as a tool for language learning, directly conversing with students in the target language, thus providing immersive and practical language practice.

Furthermore, the use of ChatGPT in virtual learning environments facilitates personalized feedback and grading, allowing educators to devote more time to curriculum development and one-on-one student mentoring. This greatly enhances the overall educational experience.

However, as we embrace ChatGPT in learning and development, it's essential to address potential challenges such as ensuring the AI's responses are accurate and unbiased, maintaining engagement in the absence of human interaction, and protecting user data.

I completed only the bare minimum for every category of strength on my resume. I ensured I got a 90% or above on every course I took to get the best GPA and rank but my method of doing it was sleezy.

I procrastinated until the LAST second, I wasn't passionate about a single topic and I pretty much forgot about every important topic or piece of knowledge I learned. I only studied to ace an exam and not to actually learn or care. I abused AI so much that I aced two community college courses completely -to boost my class rank- using ChatGPT and none of my own words. I learned nothing except how to thoughtfully cheat.

Combined with my 1101 I achieved my A+ in just under a month, about 2 weeks on each exam with a day off every Sunday. I know that people all throughout this subreddit are recommending certain people such as Messer practice test and this persons lecture videos, which is cool and all, only problem is I am a college student trying to graduate debt free. Aside from the fee of the actual exams I didn't buy anything from any source nor did I enroll in any comptia boot camp. No bought study guide, lessons,or practice exams, everything I studied with was free. 

Although I did watch the video series with professor Messer on youtube (WHICH IS FREE) I have the attention span of a toddler, I would watch for 5 minutes then zone out and Tiktok for 20 minutes. So although I watched the entire series on Messer I didn't really retain any information. (That's just me though, if you have a great attention span and are a visual learner Messer will be great). 

The way I studied was going on the exam objectives for both test. Copying and pasting each lesson (NOT CHAPTER) title into quizlet and studying off there while posting questions I has in ChatGPT. Yep, you read it right, my main source of information was quizlet and ChatGPT. A highly underrated tool I don't see a lot of people mention, but I believe that it goes more in depth than any video series. I especially think its better than buying a whole ass text book and reading for god know how many hours. I never was a fan of textbooks, quizlets tell you the main information that you need to know for the test. I feel like most textbook those in comptia and pretty much everywhere talk a whole lot of nonesense that you don't even need.

Usually theres a couple of good quizlet for every lesson. My suggestion would be to look for the ones that have reviews (which is usually the first 1-3 links shown). I usually memorized about 5 quizlets or 5 lessons a day until I finish. Then spend 2-3 reviewing everything and taking the test.  I made sure to find quizlets that had every topic listed in the lesson.

Additionally if I didn't know a topic or it wasn't explain correctly I used chat GPT to clarify. (Seriously if you need to know the difference of something o ask  for examples, or just clarifications,  Chat GPT is the way.)

And for practice questions I used only exam compass. Just google exam compass comptia A+ and it should show up. Identical questions to the exam if your consistently scoring 75+ you'll do fine.

Mind you I am a full time college student with a job. I work 3 12 hour shifts a week as an EMT and taking summer classes to finish off my minor prereqs.  

Please don't feel pressured to buy books or resources if you know your budget doesn't fit. I don't normally make post but I just want people to know that it is possible to not spend money and get the A+.",active,302

1eqm0lr,111,2024-08-12,[R] Why and when tying embedding (a story),u/f14-bertolotti,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1eqm0lr/r_why_and_when_tying_embedding_a_story/,"Hello, fellow Redditors! I want to share a little research journey that took place during my work. Instead of presenting it like a traditional research paper, I’ll try to make it more engaging and fun to read. I hope you find this approach interesting, and I’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback in the comments!

# Background

Many of you might already be familiar with a technique called Weight Tying (WT), which was first proposed [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05859). In simple terms, WT works by sharing the weights between the input embedding layer and the output embedding layer (also known as the unembedding layer, output embedding layer, or pre-softmax layer). This technique is primarily used in the context of language modeling and offers two significant advantages:

1. It reduces the memory footprint by eliminating one of the two largest parameter matrices in large language models (LLMs).
2. It often results in better and faster outcomes.

While the first benefit is widely accepted, the second is a bit more complex. In fact, some LLMs use WT, while others do not. For example, I believe that Gemma uses WT, whereas LLaMa does not. This raises the question: why is that?

If you are interested, I found particularly insightful perspectives on this topic in this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1d2iurw/d_should_the_embedding_matrix_and_final/).

# Origin of the Idea

Earlier this year, I began exploring how to formalize the concept of semantic equivalence in neural networks. Interestingly, we can adapt the classical notion of semantics, commonly used in programming languages (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denotational_semantics)). In computer theory, two programs are considered semantically equivalent if, regardless of the context in which they are executed, they yield the same resulting context. To borrow from denotational semantics, we can express this as:

https://preview.redd.it/9wiyxh815aid1.png?width=268&format=png&auto=webp&s=c710b2162f616f3a1181c2fddb0dc1c5cba20b55

This can be read as: *""Program p\_1 is semantically equivalent to p\_2 if and only if, for all contexts* ρ, *the evaluation of p\_1 with* ρ *produces the same result as the evaluation of p\_2 with* ρ\*.""\*

But how do we adapt this notion to our scenario? Let's consider a simple example from Masked Language Modeling (MLM):

*""The <MASK> of water is half empty/full.""*

It’s clear that we can use either ""empty"" or ""full"" in this sentence without changing the outcome distribution of the `<MASK>` token. Therefore, we can say that ""empty"" and ""full"" are semantically equivalent in this context (""The <MASK> of water is half \_\_\_""). Realizing that two tokens are semantically equivalent if they can be swapped without affecting the output distribution, I arrived at this definition:

$$ \\sigma\_1 \\equiv \\sigma\_2 \\iff \\forall \\rho, y: p(y|\\rho,\\sigma\_1) = p(y|\\rho,\\sigma\_2) $$

This expresses that tokens σ\_1 and σ\_2 are semantically equivalent if, for any context ρ and outcome y, the probability distribution of y given ρ and σ\_1 is identical to the probability distribution of y given ρ and σ\_2.

# Preliminary experiments

With this notion in mind, I wanted to explore how a neural network would encode these semantic equivalences in its weights. I suspected that embeddings for semantically equivalent tokens would naturally become closer to each other during training. This intuition was partly based on my knowledge that BERT embeddings capture similar relationships, where words like ""learn,"" ""learning,"" and ""learned"" are clustered together in the embedding space (see [here](https://home.ttic.edu/~kgimpel/viz-bert/viz-bert.html)).

To test this idea, I designed a simple experiment. The goal was to train a Masked Language Model (MLM) on a binary parity problem. Consider a string like `10011D`, where there are three `1`s, indicating that the string is odd. Along with the binary string, I included a parity label (`D` for odd and `E` for even). For instance, other examples could be `11000E` and `00100D`. Then, I introduced a twist: I randomly swapped the symbol `1` with either `A` or `B` with equal probability. So, from a string like `10011D`, you might get something like `A00BAD`. Finally, I masked one of the symbols and trained a model to predict the masked symbol. This process resulted in a dataset like the following:

|Sample|Label|
|:-|:-|
|`00A?00E`|A|
|`00A?00E`|B|
|`00B?00E`|A|
|`00B?00E`|B|
|`0BB?A0D`|0|

In this setup, symbols `A` and `B` are semantically equivalent by design—swapping `A` with `B` does not change the outcome distribution. As expected, the embeddings for `A` and `B` converged to be close to each other, while both remained distinct from the embedding of `0`. Interestingly, this behavior was also observed in the output embeddings, which neatly aligns with the principles of the Weight Tying technique.

# Formalizing the behavior

If it were up to me, I would have been content writing a paper on the observation that MLMs learn semantic relationships in both the input and output embedding layers. However, to publish in a reputable conference, a bit of mathematical rigor is usually required (even though math isn’t my strongest suit). So, I attempted to formalize this behavior.

# Output Embeddings

When it came to the output embeddings, I couldn't prove that two semantically equivalent symbols must be close in the output embedding space. However, I did manage to prove that they would be close under the following condition:

https://preview.redd.it/xrgs5gm15aid1.png?width=167&format=png&auto=webp&s=4645df4fd53ccd7777936be9926d6018fffba9ff

Interestingly, this result is purely about conditional probability and doesn’t directly involve labels or semantics. However since it provided some insight, I was reasonably satisfied and decided to move on.

# Input Embeddings

For the input embeddings, I was able to prove that two semantically equivalent symbols would indeed be close to each other in the input embedding space. However, the assumptions required for this proof were so restrictive that they would likely never hold in a real-world scenario. So, it ended up being a ""junk"" theorem, written more for the sake of publication than for practical application. Despite this, the intuition behind it still feels compelling.

The idea is simple: if two symbols are semantically equivalent—meaning they can be swapped without affecting the model’s output—the easiest way to ensure this is by giving them identical embeddings. In this way, the network's output remains unchanged by definition.

Proving this theorem, however, was a real challenge. I spent several days in the lab working on it, only to have my results scrutinized by colleagues and find errors. It took me about two to three weeks to produce a proof that could withstand their reviews. Despite the struggles, I remember this period as a particularly enjoyable part of my PhD journey.

# The First Draft

Armed with these two theorems—one for the output embeddings and one for the input embeddings—I began writing the first draft of my paper. My goal was to convey the idea that **LLMs are semantic learners**. I started by introducing the concept of semantic equivalence, followed by the theorem related to input embeddings. Next, I presented the output embedding theorem.

However, as I progressed, I realized that I was missing something crucial: experimental evidence to support the output embedding theorem. While the theoretical groundwork was in place, without empirical validation, the argument felt incomplete (at least this is what a reviewer would say).

# Back to the experiments (First time)

As I mentioned earlier, I proved the following implication (though I’m omitting some of the hypotheses here):

https://preview.redd.it/xvmu4t025aid1.png?width=354&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0e1332ef0232481cb136719451ac609cfa42693

So, I decided to rerun the experiments, this time closely monitoring the output embeddings. As expected, the output embeddings of `A` and `B` did indeed converge, becoming close to each other.

This finding was quite fascinating to me. On one hand, we have semantically equivalent symbols that are close in the input embedding space. On the other hand, we have conditionally equivalent symbols—those with the same conditional probability across all contexts (for all ρ: p(σ\_1 | ρ) = p(σ\_2 | ρ))—that are close in the output space.

# Back to the Draft (First Time)

With these new experiments in hand, I revised the draft, introducing the concept of conditional equivalence and the theorem connecting it to output embeddings. This allowed me to clearly articulate how conditional equivalence is reflected in the output embeddings.

As I was writing, it struck me that the Weight Tying (WT) technique is often employed in these scenarios. But this led to a new question: what happens if we use WT with symbols that are conditionally equivalent but not semantically equivalent? On one hand, these symbols should be close in the input embedding space. On the other hand, they should be far apart in the output embedding space because they have different conditional probabilities. However, with WT, the input and output spaces are tied together, making it impossible for two symbols to be simultaneously close and far apart.

This realization sent me back to the experiments to investigate this particular setting.

# Back to the Experiments (Second Time)

In our previous experiments, we established that the probability of seeing `A` is the same as `B` in any given context. Now, let's introduce another layer of complexity by replacing the symbol `0` with symbols `X` and `Y`, but this time, `X` will be more probable than `Y`. This changes our dataset to something like this:

|Sample|Label|
|:-|:-|
|`XYA?XXE`|A|
|`XXA?XYE`|B|
|`Y?BAXYE`|X|
|`XXBBX?E`|Y|
|`XBB?AYD`|0|

When we train an MLM model on this dataset, it’s easy to observe that in the input embedding space, `X` and `Y` become close to each other, just like `A` and `B`. This is because `X` and `Y` are semantically equivalent. However, unlike `A` and `B`, `X` and `Y` do not get close in the output embedding space because they have different conditional probabilities.

Now, what happens if we tie the embeddings? We observe that `A` and `B` converge more quickly, while `X` and `Y` remain distanced from each other. Additionally, we noticed that training becomes a bit more unstable—the distance between `X` and `Y` fluctuates significantly during training. Overall, the untied model tends to perform better, likely because it avoids the conflicting requirements imposed by weight tying.

# Back to the Draft, Again (Third Time)

I was quite pleased with the results we obtained, so I eagerly incorporated them into the paper. As I was revising, I also discussed the idea that Weight Tying (WT) should be used only when conditionally equivalent symbols are also semantically equivalent. This can be expressed as:

https://preview.redd.it/g79ejj825aid1.png?width=441&format=png&auto=webp&s=67298479da49374d80ddcce7b716c5e4e5ef558c

Or, more concisely:

https://preview.redd.it/g5nle0h25aid1.png?width=216&format=png&auto=webp&s=68f0d715abf87495ae49273b518df6ccedc8a148

While discussing this property, I realized that my explanation closely mirrored the hypothesis that *""similar words have similar contexts""*. This concept, which I later discovered is known as the **Distributional Hypothesis**, made the whole paper click together. I then restructured the work around this central concept.

If we accept the formalization of the Distributional Hypothesis as σ\_1 sem.eqv. σ\_2 iff. σ\_1 cnd.eqv. σ\_2, then it follows that WT should be employed only when this hypothesis holds true.

# Submission & Reviews

With [ICML2024](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2024) being the next major conference on the horizon, we decided to submit our work there. Most of the reviews were helpful and positive, but a recurring critique was the lack of ""large-scale"" experiments.

I simply do not understand this obsession with experiments that require hundreds of GPUs. I mean, I submitted a paper mostly theoretical aiming to explain a very well-known phenomenon supported by a vast literature, isn't a small controlled experiment enough (which is included mostly to make the paper self-contained) when backed by the literature?

Well, I am a nobody in the research community, furthermore this is my first publication at a ""Big"" conference like ICML so I complied although these experiments do not add practically anything.

In the end, I was thrilled to have the paper accepted as a spotlight poster. It was a huge milestone for me, making me feel like a genuine researcher in the field. I dedicated almost a month to preparing the poster and video presentation, which can be viewed [here](https://icml.cc/virtual/2024/poster/32648). The effort was well worth it!

# Conference & Presentation

On the day of the conference, I arrived around 9 A.M. with only an hour of sleep from the flight—naturally, I was too excited to rest properly. I made it to the conference a bit late, and during the first tutorial session, I struggled to stay awake despite my best efforts with coffee. A little before lunch, I headed back to the hotel to catch a few hours of sleep. In the evening I attended the great tutorial presentation [physics of Language Model](https://icml.cc/virtual/2024/tutorial/35223).

In the next days, I made a few friends. Talked to a lot of people included [Alfredo Canziani](https://atcold.github.io/), an incredible AI communicator, and [Randall Balestriero](https://randallbalestriero.github.io/) an incredible scientist in the field. I saw also [Michael Bronstein](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.bronstein/) but of course, he was always surrounded and I could not bring myself to talk to him.

The last poster session was my time to present, and I was quite nervous, as it was my first time presenting at such a conference. To my surprise, many attendees weren’t familiar with the Distributional Hypothesis—a concept I assumed everyone would know, even though I hadn’t known the term myself. This made me question the effectiveness of my paper’s ""marketing"" (presentation, title, etc.). Perhaps I should have emphasized the ""semantics"" aspect more.

One particularly memorable interaction was with a tall guy from DeepMind. He listened to part of my presentation and then pointed out, in a very polite manner, that my theorems might not be correct. I was confident in the proofs, which had been reviewed by a PhD student in mathematics who had won some math competitions. We debated back and forth until I understood his argument, which involved a specific construction of the embedding matrices. He was right, but his argument broke one of the theorems' assumptions. You have to know that, I was not even showing this hypothesis on the poster because I did not believe that anyone would have been interested in these details. This guy practically had a deeper understanding of my theorems than me without seeing them. Well, in conclusion, Deepmind has some freaking guys working there.

# Conclusions

* **Use Weight Tying Only When the Distributional Hypothesis Holds**.
* **DeepMind Has Some Incredible People**
* **Do not go to the tutorials with 1hr of sleep** (3hr are okay though).
* **Writing the Paper is Crucial**: While I previously believed that experiments should come first, I now realize the importance of writing down your ideas early. Putting thoughts into words often clarifies and integrates concepts in ways experiments alone may not. This is perhaps the most valuable lesson I’ve learned from this paper.

# Limitations & Future works

If you're considering using the Weight Tying (WT) technique, you might wonder: when does the Distributional Hypothesis (DH) actually hold? Does it apply to your specific problem? Does it apply to natural language tasks in general?

Answering these questions can be challenging and may not always be feasible. Consequently, this work may have limited practical utility. It simply pushes the question when applying WT to when the DH holds. However, I suspect that the DH only partially holds for natural language, which might explain why not all LLMs use WT.

So, my idea is that it should be more useful to run the training with WT up until a certain point and then untie the embeddings to allow differences between tokens that are conditionally eqv. but not semantically eqv. (or vice versa) to arise. Unfortunately, I lack the GPU resources to train a meaningful LLM to test this hypothesis. If anyone is interested in exploring this idea or knows of similar work, I would greatly appreciate hearing about it.",active,139

I’m currently in the midst of pursuing a PhD in Health Economics in Germany (and I'm from another European country). I’m in my mid-20s, and if everything goes according to plan, I should finish my PhD by the time I’m 27 or 28. While I’m passionate about economics and enjoy my research, I’ve found myself increasingly drawn to the idea of studying physics, particularly the thought of engaging with frontier research.

To give you a bit of background without revealing too much for privacy reasons, I initially chose to study economics during my undergraduate years, largely out of a fear that I wouldn’t be able to handle the more challenging coursework in a subject like physics. Now, after come years of academic experience and research, I feel more confident in my ability to tackle difficult subjects and am seriously considering starting from scratch with a bachelor’s degree in physics once I complete my current PhD.

My ultimate goal is to dive deep into the world of physics by completing a full academic path in the field. This would involve starting with a bachelor’s degree, followed by a master’s, and eventually pursuing a PhD in physics. Although I’m still refining my specific interests, I’m particularly drawn to the fundamental study of matter, as well as the more mathematical and theoretical aspects of physics. Additionally, I’m intrigued by the potential to bridge physics and economics, exploring interdisciplinary research that could combine insights from both fields. 

Here are a few questions I’d appreciate your insights on:

1. **Is it realistic to start over with a bachelor's in physics after completing a PhD in another field?** Have there been cases of people successfully transitioning from a completely different discipline to physics at this stage in life? 
2. **How can I leverage the skills and experiences from my PhD in Health Economics to succeed as a physics student?** Are there any transferable skills that might give me a head start? 
3. **Financial sustainability:** How feasible is it to study physics while working, either within academia in my current field (economics) or potentially in industry? Are there common pathways where one can balance both? I’m also curious about opportunities to teach or do research part-time in economics while pursuing a physics degree, or if it would be more practical to find a job in the industry that aligns better with this new academic path.
4. **Career prospects:** After completing a PhD in physics, how might my career opportunities be affected compared to staying in my current field? Would I be limiting my prospects, or could I open up new possibilities? Are there specific careers where I could fully leverage expertise in both economics and physics?

Thank you in advance for any advice, experiences, or guidance you can offer! This is a big decision for me, and I’m trying to gather as much information as possible to make an informed choice.

And once I am done with them hopefully I will have a better understanding and how to write a better code, but as I am learning I noticed that there are things that can will need to understand the meaning of the code and what functionality it does, and this is where AI come in.

I don't have knowledge on how AI and LLM really work, so what can you guys advice me on my journey to build such tool, and do you think such tool can be built only using some LLM API like ChatGPT and a very good prompt and that's it, or thing llike this require more than a LLM with good prompt?

Also what books would you recommend to learn about LLMs and have an understanding about them and thier capabilities",active,0
1f22jsl,1,2024-08-26,Ai as an educational tool part 2!,u/godver555,ArtificialInteligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1f22jsl/ai_as_an_educational_tool_part_2/,"I made a post yesterday about education and AI. There was a lot of useful discussion between different people and with that feedback and reflection I came up with a new idea. I would like your opinion on this, could it work?

-----

When I was but a wee boy I wanted to become an archaeologist or a wildlife photographer. I spend a lot of free time reading books and looking at pictures and drawings of animals and dinosaurs. When I got older, around the age of 12, this slowly started to fade away. I never lost interest but I started to realise that these kinds of work fields are pretty hard to get into and that it isnt all as romantic as I had it in my head. I still wanted to learn more about these topics, but I never pursued them as I was too busy with school and friends and all the drama that happens around that time in most teenagers life. I ended up doing a business/manager focused study where I felt out of place. I just did it because all the rest seemed even more outside my scope. I finished it because it wasnt hard, but I was never passionate about it. After my studies I ended up in an office doing things that were not at all related to anything I had studied for the 10 years prior.

This story is something I think many people are familiar with and have experienced. How many of you remember any of the things you were forced to learn in highschool? Pretty much nothing for me. It helped me develop some writing skills and reading skills but I would have had those as well if I was learning about topics I actually enjoyed. This is not just archaeology or any kids dream jobs, but topics like wildlife conservation, history, engineering, creative writing, psychology and politics were all things I would have loved to have delved into over many of the topics that we did get. Some of these were explored in certain classes, especially history, but they never really sparked my interest due to how it was taught. 

Queue the reason why I tell you all of this: A new teaching/learning methodology. 

Imagine the following. You are 12 years old, just entered a new school and you get the freedom to pick 4 topics of your interest to learn about. You get a week to pick them. If you cant come up with something the school will provide you with 100's to pick from. It could be anything. Additionally you get 5 topics everyone has to do which would be the essentials (language, national history, math, a computer class and a topics class.) The topics class I imagine is where older students or teachers give a lesson about any topic that they are engaged in, exposing students to a variety of topics and spark new interests.

Now that you have picked your 4 topics you will be deep diving into them for 3 months. You get to write a short essay about why you like certain topics and what makes you interestedin them most. An educator (teacher) will generate a curriculum privately for you to delve into using an LLM. He will give you assignments to complete on these topics. LLM's are encouraged to use but students will have to include the sources of their information if they choose to use it. Using LLM's as a source of feedback and learning the students will enjoy engaging themselves in a topic. In the end students will be given oral examinations and give presentations which focus on argumentation and fact checking. The end result will be a grade that is not a number, but rather ""Insufficient, Sufficient or Excellent.""

So why all this? I believe that middle and highschool has so much more potential as a learning medium than it is now. As it stands students are forced to learn on topics they do not find interesting. It is demotivating. Students can learn key writing, reading and thinking skills in much more engaging way, learning more along the way if they get to explore topics that motivate them intrinsically. 

I think with the current state of ChatGPT Plus it would already be viable, but if there was an LLM focused on education and made specifically to cater to this methodology then it could be better and safer. As a side note, the importance of sourcing, fact checking should be underlined in every assignment and also taken serious by educators when providing feedback.",active,0
1f29fls,1,2024-08-27,Should I talk to my professor about allowing us to use AI for a project?,u/catboygod,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1f29fls/should_i_talk_to_my_professor_about_allowing_us/,"Apologies if this is a long one, I’m a certified yapper and I’m also just passionate about the topic. So I’m a college student who is studying theatre and this semester I enrolled in a costuming class. Although acting is my main goal, I’m very passionate about costume design as well as fashion. Today was my first day of the class, my teacher seems nice and I’m honestly ecstatic to improve my sewing skills. But when we started discussing our final project, something she said threw me off hard. For our final, we are required to provide costume design
renders for the characters of the play we are assigned before turning them into our final garments. I’m also an illustrator and character design is my speciality, so I was super stoked about this. I did a very similar final for my gen theater class last year and had a blast. I was happy until she said that we were allowed to use AI for our final renders. Now I’m a VERY avid hater of AI and an outspoken advocate against it since it started taking over the art world. I’ve been thinking about this since I got out of class about 4 hours ago and my anger and discomfort about it keeps growing. I’m far from a confrontational person but I think I would have a hard time letting this go. If I did talk to my professor my argument would be as follows:

What of academic integrity? If someone in a composition class turned in an essay written entirely by ChatGPT and they were caught, would they not be failed for that? Why is an any different just because it’s art? As per the syllabus, the designs should be original. There is nothing original about AI art. Someone could easily put in the name of the play and the characters name and get a design without and ounce of creativity behind it. I am aware not everyone in the class is there because they want to learn costuming seriously. Some are there to fulfill a credit, others just for fun. However, costume renders are a part of the trade, it is an essential skill to have when designing costumes even if you are not the next Michelangelo creating masterpieces for every render. The class is a costuming class, not just a sewing class. If it’s a fundamental aspect to the subject of the class that we are paying to be in, why let people cheat out on it altogether? 

My professor stated that as long as effort is put into your work, you will not fail, and that most people will get an A. I can look past that, I’m not competing with anyone and yes some people are doing it to fulfill a credit and don’t have any sort of interesting in drawing or even costuming. That’s fine. Even if their work is scribbles on a printed outline, or even a compilation of existing clothing pieces compiled to make an outfit, that would still be better than typing a word or two into a box and getting entirely stolen “art” lifeless mush. It saddens me to think that myself and others of my classmates will be putting genuine effort into our projects only to receive the same grade as someone who didn’t even bother to pick up a pencil. I feel very uncomfortable with such a person as influential as a professor endorsing AI and even letting people turn it in. 

I don’t think I can in my good conscience keep my mouth shut about this, so regardless of my initial question I’ll probably still do it. So I guess my real question is how should I approach this? I don’t want to overstep, this is her class and I can’t decide anything for her in the end. I don’t know if she’s unaware of how AI works or just doesn’t care. I’m really hoping it’s not the latter to be honest. Maybe I should talk to some classmates to see their opinion on it and maybe several of us could talk to her about it? I don’t want to gang up on her either, I’d like to approach this as professionally as possible. I’m not going to drop the class regardless of her answer because even though I’m super uncomfy with this whole situation, this is my only chance to take the class for an entire year and she’s the only professor who teaches it. 

Also for any AI bros in the comments who will try to change my mind about AI: save it. I do not give a fuck. ",active,1
1f2oxil,47,2024-08-27,I'm teaching AI to a group of High school kids that are neurodivergent. Here's how it's going. ,u/ResponsibleAd8287,OpenAI,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1f2oxil/im_teaching_ai_to_a_group_of_high_school_kids/,"# Teaching AI to NeuroSpicy Students: A Journey of Innovation and Fun

Greetings from sunny Florida! I’m a teacher at a small private school where I have the freedom to craft my own curriculum. My classroom is a vibrant mix of neurodivergent students, affectionately known as “NeuroSpicy.” We embrace every 'Tism under the sun—dyslexia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia, and more. It’s a lively bunch of six kids, each with unique challenges and incredible potential.

# The AI Class Adventure

I embarked on an exciting journey to teach my students how AI can enhance their everyday lives. I developed an 8-part series focused on prompt engineering, using a blend of ChatGPT 4.0 and Co-Pilot. The series kicks off with AI terminology and definitions, and wraps up with a deep dive into the ethical implications of AI. We tackle thought-provoking questions like, “If you create a T-shirt design using AI, who owns the image?” and “Is it ethical to sell AI-generated art?”

# A Success Story: From Struggles to Triumph

One of my students, a 15-year-old with severe spelling and reading difficulties, has been working on a book about his hyper fixation—Dungeons & Dragons. Despite his intellectual challenges, he’s written over 13,000 words across three chapters, thanks to AI. His mother has never seen him so proud. Our goal is to publish his book on Amazon, proving that he can achieve something remarkable and potentially support himself in the future.

# Integrating AI Across Subjects

AI isn’t just for writing; we use it to teach math, science, grammar, interactive games, and coding. I’m constantly exploring new projects and real-world applications for this technology. The results have been phenomenal, and my students are more engaged than ever.

# Encouragement for Fellow Educators

If you’re considering teaching AI, go for it! Use tools like Co-Pilot to develop your curriculum. It’s been a game-changer for my students, and I’m confident it can be for yours too. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk!

I teach a small private school in Florida where i have total control over curriculum. I had an idea to start to teaching them how AI could really benefit them in the everyday world they live. I have kids that are the full spectrum of being NeuroSpicy as we call it. Pretty much every 'Tism is represented. Dyslexia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia, all types of spelling issues, calculating, social, maturity and everything in between are in my class of 6 kids.   
  
What do I do in my AI class? I have built an 8 part series that is teaching them how to engineer prompts. I have looked all over the internet trying to find an actual curriculum that teaches the fundamentals of AI and how to implement those fundamentals. So I started using a combination of ChatGPT 4o and Co-Pilot. The series starts with terminology and definitions of the words that are used for AI and I finish with what are the ethical implications of using AI. I ask questions like ""just because you tell AI how you want a picture to look, then you edit that until you have it exactly how you want it, and then you take that and turn it into a T-Shirt design and sell it.....who owns that image?"" ""Is it okay to sell it if you didn't actually put pen/paint brush to paper to create that art""? It has been a fascinating conversation so far.   
  
I have a kid (15 year old), that cannot spell due to several diagnosis and truly struggles with reading, is in the middle of writing a book for his hyper fixation (DnD) that is truly great. He was my guinea pig last year. I taught him how to tell AI who the characters are, how they are related, what is their backstory, the environment, so on and so on and now he has 3 chapters with well over 13,000 words done. He feels so incredibly accomplished by this and his mother says it is the most proud she has ever seen him about anything. Now this is a student that also has pretty severe intellectual issues. He will forever be around a 10 year old. My idea is for him to complete the book and see if we can get it published on Amazon. If it sells 10 copies it can prove that he can provide for himself one day. He can, with enough work, feel accomplished on yet another level that he before thought would be impossible.   


I'm using it to teach math, science concepts, writing, grammar, interactive games, coding and I'm still trying to dig up new projects and real world usage for this technology.   
So if you want to teach your class AI....do it. Find a way to make it happen. I used Co-Pilot to develop my entire curriculum. So far it has been super successful. My kids love it and I can't help but think your kids will as well. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.    ",active,49
1f3f52u,1,2024-08-28,I am building an AI careers platform that helps job applicants in this tough job market,u/CareerDeckAI,SideProject,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1f3f52u/i_am_building_an_ai_careers_platform_that_helps/,"
Hello there! 

I am a fullstack software engineer with a profound interest in - you can already guess it - generative AI. While I was on holiday with my girlfriend last summer, we had a talk about her work. She is a career and personal development coach at a major university in Europe, and we were discussing the impact that tools such as ChatGPT were having on her students. 

What started as a quick resume writer prototype, has now evolved into a full-fledged AI careers platform called [CareerDeck AI](https://www.careerdeck.ai). 

From the moment you find a job vacancy to the moment thst you sign a contract: we aim to help job seekers with the following:
- write tailored resumes for specific job vacancies (did you know that each job vacancy requires a different resume?)
- write compelling and personalized cover letters for hiring managers (formatted in a unique and personalized way)
- help with job interview preparation by providing common interview questions and questions you could ask during the interview
- teach about all aspects of job hunting, salary negotiations strategies and networking in the CareerDeck Academy
- provide career guidance 24/7 by providing a ""Chat with AI Career Coach"", which has been augmented with my girlfriend's career coaching directives 
- practice the job interview - using video and voice - with an AI that acts as a hiring manager during a mock interview (coming Q4 2024)

I have not launched yet, but I think I am about 90% finished with the platform. I am now looking for feedback from actual users and I am hoping to find this in this subreddit. 

Testing out CareerDeck AI can be done in 4 simple steps.
1. [Sign up to CareerDeck AI using LinkedIn](https://www.careerdeck.ai/auth/sign-up)
2. Import your career history from LinkedIn
3. Find and add a job listing and add it to the interactive dashboard.
4. When the AI assistant is ready, you'll receive a tailored resume and cover letter. Use the editors to make changes and choose themes. Download the content as PDF!

As a token of appreciation, you'll get 10 free credits when you get started. This will give you 10 resumes, 10 cover letters and 10 preparation plans for 10 job listings.

Let me know what you think in the comments! Your feedback is of immense value to me.

Please note the following:
- CareerDeck AI is optimized for use on tablets and laptops. Mobile support is a bit flaky as of now
- Things can and will break. I don't expect any showstoppers, but rather minor things in the UI
- The landing page and feature pages are not complete, I am still finalizing content, but they should give you a good overall impression ",active,1
