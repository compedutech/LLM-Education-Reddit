17od3qe,1106,2023-11-05,Guide to the mythical viral coefficient. Modern examples + how it grew my business to $450k ARR.,u/Toxic-Headshott,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/17od3qe/guide_to_the_mythical_viral_coefficient_modern/,"**Note**: Been lurking on this sub and reddit in general for quite some time but I felt like this would be a valuable post for both people in the ideation and product stage. I wish someone told me these things when I started out. With that being said, some of this content might be a refresher for some of you, but hopefully I can shine light on some use cases that are still helpful. Also this is not to say I’m some big shot making $450k ARR, but I think there are lessons here. This post is for anyone who is in B2B or B2C that has an online presence. The focus is on software because that’s what I know, but this could be done with services or other verticals as well.  
  
The viral coefficient is a concept I’ve been interested in ever since I read the infamous Viral Loop book by Adam Penenberg back in 2009. A viral coefficient is just how many new customers an existing customer brings in on average. If you have a sustained viral coefficient of 2, then each customer brings 2 new customers and you spread organically. It’s how Facebook, PayPal, Email services, ChatGPT, etc. all grew. It would be wrong to limit this in scope to just B2C products. It can happen with B2B where you ask clients for referrals and word begins to spread about your product. There’s also more subtle ways of doing it just like how typeform did. If you’re doing anything in the digital space this is crucial to think about.   
To put it more succinctly: make something others love so much they tell their friends. Let’s walk through some examples and then explore specific takeaways.   
  
**Past Examples of Viral loops:**

  
**PayPal:** Paypal had a particularly interesting viral strategy. It started off as just sending money over the Internet to another person with a focus on the Ebay niche. If a new person signed up, they would get $5. Of course this incentive was unsustainable as they would have burned all their VC money, but it helped initiate the process. 

  
**Facebook:** Perhaps the most notorious example of a viral coefficient. Like PayPal, they started in a niche, which we all know was Harvard. It naturally played on people’s curiosity. If someone was posting about you or someone you knew, you wanted to sign up and see what was going on. Eventually they started opening access up to other universities before finally giving access to everyone. At that point, it completely blew up. 

  
**HotMail:** Hotmail utilized a pretty effective viral marketing strategy by including a tagline at the end of every email sent by its users that read ""Get your free email at Hotmail."" This basically turned every email sent into a potential Hotmail sign-up. By leveraging the network effects where users were communicating with non-users, Hotmail rapidly increased its user base. It started to spread like wildfire because each user inadvertently advertised Hotmail every time they sent an email. This signature line was so influential that despite the negligible cost of including it, it propelled Hotmail to amass millions of users within an extremely short period after its launch.  
  
**Uber:** This is the platform that I took the most inspiration from. Their viral growth strategy is probably most applicable to people here because it was multifaceted: word-of-mouth, referral incentives, strategic marketing campaigns, etc.. In its early days, Uber incentivized both its drivers and riders to share their referral codes with others by offering ride credit or a bonus payout. For riders, there was the appeal of a free or discounted ride for signing up through a friend's referral link was a strong incentive to try the service. And for drivers, the promise of extra earnings for referring new drivers played a big role in expanding the workforce quickly. Additionally, Uber capitalized on the exclusivity and luxury of its initial ""black car"" service to create hype in the markets it entered. The strategy was to create a prestigious image and then open the platform to a wider audience with more economical options like UberX, allowing it to scale up rapidly.  


  
**A viral loop in the making - a 2023 example**

  
**Example:** If this hasn’t started already, then most of the emails you receive are about to have another email CCd: m@mindy.com. This is an AI agent that was built by a cofounder of Paypal / first employee of YouTube, the third employee of YouTube, and an MD from Accenture. For the sake of not revealing too much and focusing on the product, just email it and see what it can do if you’re curious and you’ll see why I’m saying this. They’ve set up a system where onboarding another user is as simple as CCing the AI into the email and it will start interacting and performing autonomous tasks for you.   
  
**The takeaway:** If this works out, then it will spread faster than anyone can possibly imagine and may be the defining viral loop of the next year and possibly years to come. The reason? It’s easy to sign up and there’s a direct incentive to CC the AI to someone you’re emailing. It can go and help you solve problems you’re working on. Whether that’s parsing through a 60+ page document, researching an esoteric scientific tolic, or scheduling meetings for teachers and students. This is what’s important to remember: make it as easy as possible for customers to get you customers and when designing your product keep this principle in mind. If connecting someone to the existing product makes it better for you then you’ll have something that can blow up. The tricky part is creating something that has virality already built in, so for those of you not in the ideation phase, I feel you because that’s me.  
  
**My own company - a contrived but functioning viral coefficient**

  
**Example:** Not every product can have a viral coefficient like Mindy, that’s partially because they built it with that in mind. If you’re like me and already have a product, there are still things you can do in order to incentivize folks to use your product.   
For context in my own company (which I will not link to here for the sake of following the subreddit’s rules - if you want proof feel free to DM me), I bootstrapped one of those AI photo generators that was really popular in 2022 / part of 2023. I used stabilitiy’s stable diffusion image model + google’s dream booth to generate photorealistic and artistic images of user’s faces to show their friends. It never blew up in the same way Lensa/Remini did, but what I did was lock utility behind closed doors. More specifically, I locked certain photos users could generate behind closed doors. If they wanted to generate those particular types of photos, they’d have to do a social media post about the product and their results. This meant all their friends saw an image of themselves generated. Since their friends are the ones who know how they look, they were naturally interested to see how they themselves looked. Whenever someone with a big following would post this out, I would see a surge in traffic to the site.  
  
**My Takeaway**: While I didn’t have a viral coefficient of 1.0 and have since had lower growth numbers (partially due to comodization/market saturation), I found a way to get my product to market itself. Other than a few influencer ad campaigns, most of my growth was organic inbound. You can create incentives by giving users access to more features through a referral program. Of course, my example is specific to my company but I think there’s a lot of ways this can be done for many different companies. Including B2B. I ran a SaaS in the past (was acquired) and offered a really large client access to early features to give them a competitive edge in return for 10 warm introductions to other clients. If any of you want help brainstorming on your product, I’m happy to help in the comments. To build a viral product: start in a niche, make something people love so much they tell their friends, make the onboarding process simple (e.g. free to use), and most importantly create a product that incentivizes other folks to use it. If you didn’t build your product with a viral coefficient in mind, then creating a false sense of scarcity by locking certain product features behind a referral program or in the B2B case (asking for referrals to other clients) won’t get you to a VC of 1.0 but it will still help you get organic inbound. I’m hoping to take my learnings here and make my next product have a viral coefficient above 1.0. ",User_deleted,1109

#leaders #science #paper #tool #event #scheduled

Yann LeCun, a prominent figure in the AI field, has been instrumental in fostering the AI ecosystem in France. After leaving France 35 years ago, he established FAIR-Paris, providing opportunities for young scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs in AI research and development. His research is open and accessible to the global community [3]. LeCun's recent paper on role-playing with large language models, initially behind a paywall, is now freely available [4]. In 2016, he taught a course at Collège de France, which was a stepping stone for French students in their deep learning journey. Since 2018, FAIR-Paris has hosted 20 to 30 resident PhD students annually, graduating 5 to 10, contributing to the growth of the French AI research, development, and startup ecosystem [5].







A recent analysis suggests that the probability of doom given the existence of AI is lower than the probability of doom without AI [6]. However, there are still challenges to overcome in AI development. For instance, the ""Chihuahua or Muffin"" problem in computer vision remains unsolved by GPT-4V, which struggles to reason about the same images in a different layout and often miscounts the number of images. It also misrecognizes a Chihuahua as a muffin when asked about a specific image. These issues may stem from the model being trained on the original image and memorizing its labels [7].







Greg Brockman, another AI enthusiast, shares his diverse uses of ChatGPT, including coding, cooking, translating anime, suggesting chord modulations for a song, and conducting bio research [9].







In international news, Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping are expected to announce a landmark agreement banning the use of AI in autonomous weaponry and the control and deployment of nuclear warheads. This agreement, to be announced at a bilateral meeting, is seen as a promising first step in regulating AI in autonomous weapons [10].

I did bachelor's in CSE in India passed with great CGPA was exceptionally good at coding in my college, did great projects and all that barely few could do or think at that time. As a final year project developed a great full stack android app with Machine learning and all, and paid one guy just so we (me and my group member) can get certification that we developed this project with a company and they can help us out in project. Well they didn't helped but gave a legit certificate that we worked adding 1 year of experience on my resume, thought just on paper.
After that covid hit and things got delayed by 6 months and finally moved to canada, did masters in Applied computing from windsor. There I realised I wasn't a great programmer nor my projects were great, its just the people in my college were barely average, plus I lacked leetcode skills since I had no idea that it was needed and all, yes I didn't use much google and youtube during my bachelor, I wasnt aware nor anyone around me was aware.
My college professors were barely average as well. But here in masters the scenario was totally different, everyone around me was seriously into coding and leetcode and professors were great. Ofc there were once again many below average students but ignoring them here. Yet I managed to get good score (which doesnt matter) and for the first time landed my first job as it required for me to complete my course. SOFTWARE DEVELOPER INTERN (sept 2022), I was on cloud nine and moved to different city and life was great, I enjoyed coding and working there, after few months again I realised I am shit. Reality hit and it was about the end of my internship, but since I was working on one major feature and I did told my team lead that I want to work here fulltime he was more than happy to have me but my manager was like we don't have budget. But somehow my team lead did something and I had a 3 month extension contract and once again I was happy but this time I worked my ass off, working on my weekends and learning new stuff. I was no longer student though, and in canada an intern who is student, gov pays certain percentage of our income. Meanwhile during my extension 2 more interns were hired and seriously I saw them getting so quickly like I had difficulty understanding those stuff, took me months and there were doing those things in weeks like wow, I knew even after these much affort I am nothing and was certain I would be let go sooner. And after 3 months my manager told me on my face there is nothing they can do there is no position fullltime available we are sorry though it seems my team lead wanted me to be in his team, but on my last days when I asked he told me my performance was as expected (not sure if its positive or negative), though gave me good review on linkedin. I was let go in july 2023. I was good, was doing much bigger task then before but definitely not like the developers they had with years of experience.
Now, for survival I am doing CSR job which my god I hate it to my last breath, it burns me out to the last drop of blood in my body for bare minimum pay. Here as well there are high chances of layoff in feb 2024. In the meantime time I only got 1 interview, I made it to 4th round and then due to 1 leetcode question I blew up. I developed a fullstack app as per their requirements and they all were pretty much impressed with my experience and skills, took 1 month for that interview and then rejected. Later found they hired someone with more experience. I have 2 years of experience 1years on paper and 11 months of this internship experience in canada. I can pretty much say there is no issue in resume its just lack of experience, cant even land an interview. Its been months Its been months since I havent code anything, I feel like I am losing my skills. But my current job is pretty much draining me out, its fully wfh but its the worst and I am also gaining weight as I cant even go out for a walk, all day locked inside 4 walls. Drinking more coffee than as a developer just to function normally. Whatever time I have goes into cooking and other household chores.
Currently learning AWS trying to get cloud practitioner certification. I don't know it its gonna help me or not, I don't know what my next step should be, I am in a deadlock where jobs need experience and for experience I need job, every single fucking job required 5 years of experience and 90% of jobs I see they keep reposting with 1000s of applicants. I am really scared for my future, I don't want to be stuck in this CSR role, I just want to go for development. Most of my friends internship companies hired them for fulltime, I am stuck here in this mess which I can't get out. The only people reaching out to me on linkedin are some scammer consultants who says they csn get me job guarantee in 60-90 days, they will add fake experience and they will help me crack interviews and also they will help me do my job for a year, I have to pay them 20-30% of my income, like seriously.
Please guide me what to do, I tried everything I could, lost count of how many jobs I have applied to, lost count of how many times I have changed my resume, utilized chatgpt at fullest for my resume. Many times I think to move back to india. I am ready to work as a developer for less than 20$ an hour yet nothing.

He said he hired me because he valued my creative outlook and unique approach. Yay.
At our most recent meeting, he encouraged us to use chatGPT to write our lesson plans and said we should be teaching to the state test.

Should I be using my brain or not? Please advise.",active,21
