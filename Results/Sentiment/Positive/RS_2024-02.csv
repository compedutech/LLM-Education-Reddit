1aj1tlm,18,2024-02-04,Sec+ Result,u/SublimeVibe,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/1aj1tlm/sec_result/,"Hi all,

Just thought I would post my recent Sec+ result. I passed! JUST... with a 751. But Ps get degrees so I'm not complaining. 

I had only just finished Net+ back in December, and really did not put as much effort into preparing for this exam as I have with my other certs. But I'm happy to have passed it inside two months. 

I was actually preparing for a fail, and was already mapping out my study plan for the following few weeks mid exam! So you can imagine my relief when I was met with the ""Pass"" screen! I've basically been given two+ weeks of my life back! 

My tips for the exam: 

- Regardless of previous experience and study, go over EVERYTHING again. My yo-yo studying had a lot to do with thinking I already recognised/knew a lot of the info already which made it difficult to knuckle down. I should have gone in with a clean slate mentality

- Exam objectives... obviously.

- Professor Messer's study guide

- Controversial for some, but ChatGPT was invaluable. Obviously verifying what it the output was is key, but it's a great learning tool. 

- Another user posted a link to [this](https://cs.signal.army.mil/static/Course_Downloads/SY0-601v1_1-StudentStudyGuide.pdf) study guide which I found incredibly useful

- Time management is key. I did an online exam and flagged a number of questions. I gave myself about 15 minutes at the end to go back over my answers and believe had I not done this and changed a few, I more than likely wouldn't have hit the pass mark! Reviewing what you've selected is important as sometimes you can jog your memory for a previous question later in the exam.

Good luck to those sitting their exams!",active,19

So I consider myself as like an above average student. I graduated at a really high standard and high pressure high school and now that I’m in college, things are fairly easy for me in because I am really academically advanced and am used to pressure.

Now that months has passed, I got a lot of friends and am now part of a friend group, but not really. I’m not a part of their group chat but it’s okay for me because I really am not a part of their friend group in the first place, I just got adopted. But I am really close with them.

The problem right now is that, the more I hangout with them the more I pick up on their bad habits. I’ve become more reliant on ChatGPT, I don’t use my time wisely now, I swear a lot, and I don’t like the way I act now, and etc. The problem is, I can’t escape or at least distance myself away from them because one of them always comes with me or is following me.

My GWA on the 1st semester is 1.375 before I got really close to them. But right now I have a really low grade, I haven’t learned a single thing, I’m lost on what I want, and I’ve become lazier (academically). Part of it is because of me but I also feel that it is because I’ve become the average of the people I hangout with. Don’t get me wrong, they are really good people, not just in self-improvement and academics.

What do I do?,u/TheMormyrid4,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1al6xjc/suspect_chatgpt_what_do_i_do/,"I'm teaching a 2-2 (research credits). My students, for the most part, are amazing. The students in my creative writing course are extremely talented and dedicated. They sometimes ask if we can continue our workshops and discussions after class ends. Those interested usually meet in my office after for tea and writing/editing. 

My other course is a composition course for students with English as a second language. It's for high-intermediate language learners. They're required to write and workshop essays and most students love doing so. I encourage them to have fun with their essays. We've workshopped some great writing, and I've received comments that my course is their favorite course and that they're always excited to work on a new essay. One even said she thinks she's finding her ""voice"" as a writer.   


Anyway 

  
There's this one student in the composition course. I'm 95% certain he cheated on the English placement test. I had submitted his name to the Dean since I'm the one who grades the placement tests for incoming ESL students. Nothing was done, and so he ended up in my high-intermediate course. He has a very difficult time speaking in English and often doesn't seem to understand what I'm saying. I did meet with him after the first week and explained that he might do better in a lower-level course and that I think he might struggle greatly in this course. He said he wants to continue in my course and that he understands English well but has difficulties speaking it. Fine. I allowed him to stay. I suspect that he doesn't want to take a lower-level course because then he'll need to take more than one English course for his degree.   


Students were asked to write a compare/contrast essay and submit a rough draft for the workshop. He sent me an essay comparing and contrasting working from home versus working remotely. The problem is that the English is VERY advanced. Just the way it's written smacks of ChatGPT. However, the free online detectors only return it as a ""possibility of ChatGPT"". 

I'm wary of accusing this student. What if he reports me to the Dean and states that he didn't use ChatGPT,  and I just have it out for him? I'm tenured, but still.

ChatGPT's capabilities extend far beyond simple question-answering; it's a comprehensive tool that can tailor learning experiences to individual needs, streamlining the absorption of knowledge and skills across a variety of domains.

In the corporate world, the training traditionally involved costly resources, both in terms of time and money. However, ChatGPT offers on-demand learning, which means employees can acquire new skills or information precisely when they need it, without the lag of scheduling instructor-led sessions or pulling staff away from their core responsibilities for training. This just-in-time training method enhances productivity and allows for immediate application of learned skills to real-world tasks.

Moreover, ChatGPT can easily digest and summarize vast amounts of text, such as corporate policy manuals, procedural documents, or technical guides. It can then serve employees with bite-sized, easily understood explanations. By taking the heavy lifting out of comprehension, employees can spend more time applying concepts rather than decoding them.

In a broader educational context, ChatGPT can significantly diminish the workload on educators by providing assistance in grading, offering feedback, or generating educational content. This support can afford teachers more time to engage with students on a deeper level, personalizing their educational experiences, and fostering a more interactive classroom environment.

However, this isn't without challenges: ensuring the accuracy of information provided by ChatGPT, managing the potential for job displacement in training roles, and maintaining engagement without the human touch are areas requiring strategic planning and ethical consideration.

The question now turns to implementation: How can businesses and educational institutions harness ChatGPT effectively? What are the best practices to ensure it complements rather than replaces the human elements of learning? The potential is vast, but the journey to integrate these advances fluidly into our systems is just beginning. Let's discuss how ChatGPT is reshaping the landscape of learning and what we can do to maximize its benefits for an evolving workforce.",active,1

When I was in college (from 2012-2019, a long time - I know) we had to look at solution manuals or find solutions on chegg for homework assignments.   It was much harder than plugging in the questions and immediately getting answers.  Also the solution manuals or chegg answer keys were often for different problems with different numbers and variations.  Nowadays you can ask so many very complex questions and get very sophisticated answers.  I would imagine homework assignments are so much easier.  Even if you don’t copy them directly you still get a very good response to paraphrase or generate answers from.   It seems somewhat unfair to me that students now get access to this and I would imagine the rates of homework assignments being completed in classes has gone up a lot.   It also gives students a lot more free time because you aren’t spending so much time digging for answers.  I know lots of classes are graded on a curve (mine were anyways) so I’m sure many of the classes are still competitive.   But I am a little jealous of students nowadays.   

(A little off subject) I think back to my classes and how much easier they would have been to have access to such an asset of a tool..   I’m considering going back to school to finish my engineering degree and have applied for readmission (the gpa requirements went back down for my college).   I got an RBA degree and I can’t use it for much.  Might teach soon if things workout, but not sure what my path is quite yet.   Anyways I think college students don’t know how lucky they are, and if they’re not using ChatGPT I’m sure they’re at a disadvantage.  I’m guessing students everywhere are well aware of it and use it regularly.   I just think it’s kind of unfair that I had it as hard as I did, but I’m sure people before me think the same way since tech has constantly changed - like I can’t even imagine college without high speed internet or even internet in general.   It’s wild.  

Anyways, what are your guys thoughts about this?  Does anyone know if colleges are making things harder because of this?  And if so how are they changing things now that AI is around?",User_deleted,0

I have been building products since the last 3 years. In these years, I have managed to launch, scale and exit 2 SaaS products successfully.

**Today I am launching my 6th product -** [**Stock Market GPT**](https://stockmarketgpt.co/) **- An AI Investment Analyst to save you time researching your next investment.**

Like all my previous products, I will be building this in public and share my learning along the way. Here's what I have built so far :

* **Microsponsors** **( Fail )**  

   * My first product ever. I tried to create a marketplace for newsletter writers to find sponsorship opportunity. Got a few very big newsletter listed on the marketplace as well. However, building marketplace is tough. I found it very difficult to bring in sponsors. Ended up shutting it down,
* **AI Query (Exit - Pre revenue )**  

   * It was the second half of 2022 and GPT-3 was the most advance AI on the market. I decided to build a tool that can help developers and non-technical folks write SQL queries by just asking in plain english.
   * I got my first taste of success with this. Had a decent offer even before I figured out monetisation. Accepted the offer to focus on my next product which had already started gaining traction
* **AI Excel Bot ( Exit - Revenue Generating ) (** [link](https://aiexcelbot.com/) **)**  

   * AI Excel Bot was my wild success. I had worked hard on the SEO for the site, along with the UI / UX to make it the best AI to write excel formulas and general excel task. There was already a large competitor in the market. However, the reality is that you don't need to be the top player. There is always room for multiple players to survive in a large market. You just need to find the good differentiating factor
   * For AI Excel Bot, the differentiator was the chrome extension, that helped users access it anywhere on the internet.
   * Scaled the product to more than 40k users at the time of exit. However, in the end I decided to exit and focus on my software service business that needed more time.
* **Tutore AI ( Fail ) (** [link](https://tutore.co/) **)**  

   * I wanted to build something useful for students to help them learn better. Tutore was my idea to build AI tools for students. I did launch quickly with multiple tools. However, wasn't motivated enough to continue with the grind.
   * I have decided to sell the product. Have had some meetings with potential buyers but didn't agree on price.
* **Prompt Hackers ( 1k users but no revenue ) (** [link](https://www.prompthackers.co/) **)**  

   * Prompt Hackers is a directory of AI prompts for all the use cases you can image. I focused a lot on bringing traffic and newsletter subscription from the day 1. I have never had a problem bringing initial set of users to my products. Prompt Hackers was getting close to 20k page views a month. At the same time we had close to 1k newsletter subscribers.
   * Since our target customers were people choosing to use ChatGPT / Bard instead of some specific software for their task, I built a Prompt Generation and Prompt Optimisation AI. Along with this I also created features to build private prompt library. To make the experience even better, I launched a Chrome Extension that helps users access the prompt generation AI and their prompt library while using ChatGPT. However, I couldn't figure out monetisation.
   * I still get close to 4k page views per month with no marketing at all. There are users who use the AI tools and the prompt library feature daily. But, since I couldn't figure out monetisation, I decided to not put time into the project.

There you go. These are all the products I have built in the last 3 years. I have been investing myself, and know how much time researching a stock can take sometimes. That's why I built, Stock Market GPT.

I would love to hear feedback from the community. I will be sharing my learning with my new products along that way.

1axatqe,2,2024-02-22,DOE Announcement! ,u/epicurean_barbarian,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1axatqe/doe_announcement/,"Good Morning teachers of America! It's Secretary Barbarian here to unveil an exciting new development in the world of education. Starting today, we will offer students and parents the most flexible, accessible, and all-encompassing SPED designation yet created: DNLOCAS.

The DNLOCAS designation recognizes the unique plight of our most vulnerable children--those who are afflicted, through no fault of their own, with not liking or caring about school. The DNLOCAS designation (Does Not Like Or Care About School) is available to students in grades 9-12, and does not require any kind of medical diagnoses. Any parent who feels their student should be earning higher grades than they currently are can simply text DNLOCAS PLZ to their child's building principal or any district administrator who you've never met and has never set foot in your building, and they will immediately be granted DNLOCAS status retroactive to the most recent midterm. 

We are nothing if not sensitive to your busy work schedules, so here's a short list of easy-to-implement accommodations that all DNLOCAS students automatically receive:
1. Extra time on tests
2. Tests read aloud 
3. Tests and quizzes not to contain the words *analyze, summarize, interpret, find, select,  choose, calculate, craft, write, read, or please*
4. Can sit anywhere they want in the classroom
5. Not allowed to fail classes
6. Use of headphones at all times
7. Use of chatGPT on all work 
8. Not required to turn in work 
9. Not allowed to have grade lower than B- on days when parent happens to check grades
10. Can take breaks at will
11. Not required to feel discomfort
12. Can text mom during class
13. Teachers must notify mom if student feels discomfort
14. Not required to attend school

These accommodations will ensure success for our students who suffer from not wanting to be successful. Together, we can solve this equity issue!

Sincerely, 
Secretary Barbarian

p.s. - please remember to document implementation of all accommodations at least twice per quarter hour during contract hours. ",User_deleted,2
