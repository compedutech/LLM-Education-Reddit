I'm a medical student, and I have noticed that chatgpt does a really good job of summarizing and explaining slides when I copy and paste bullet points into the website.

I was wondering if anybody has used the API to go through powerpoints and do this for every slide, or have any idea on how that might be done? 

If anybody has the knowledge/skills to implement this, I would be willing to compensate you for your time as I think this would be a very valuable educational resource for not just me but many others.

Thanks!",User_deleted,29

I´m excited for the tools that AI assistants can put on the table when it comes to teaching.Last Friday I was in a rush to prepare a written test (I´m an Italian language teacher). I had prepared some of the questions but I still needed a couple. So I just tried to toss into ChatGPT some description of what kind of task I wanted to generate. To my surprise, it worked quite well! It needed some tweaking/culling but it was solid.  And, this technology is doing its first baby steps, I can imagine it doing huge progress in a couple years.

So, my question is, how do you all think AI can be used to make our job faster and better? Will we be able to automatize and delegate some aspects of our job? What apps and services would you like to see empowered by AI? (This is NOT a ""students cheat using AI"" rant thread)

Here is an example of what I got from ChatGPT, feel free to translate. I asked a very specific grammat topic and specified student level and age. Itś not perfect, and there are some mistakes, but it´s a lot. Later I refined the inputs to do more specific stuff, with varying degrees of success.

11qyxk1,6,2023-03-14,ChatGPT API vs web interface,u/russ20012,OpenAI,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/11qyxk1/chatgpt_api_vs_web_interface/,"I'm a language teacher and have been using the chatgpt web interface (on [openai.com](https://openai.com/)) for wto months now. In general, I'm very excited as it's been remarkably useful for developing language teaching materials. It's also very good at translation. I keep telling people the translations are years ahead of Google Translate.

So, I'm working with a web developer to make a site powered by chatGPT to make online quizzes for my students. However, when using the API, with whatever settings the developer has, produces results that are like Google Translate sentences - unnatural and quite simply, not useful.

**I'm trying to understand - is the language created through an API always going to be worse and more unnatural? Or, is it because of the settings the developer has put in? Or, both?** I'm wondering whether to change direction and focus on just using the chatGPT web interfact and copy and paste results somehow into a quiz instead of using the API.

Any thoughts are appreciated.",User_deleted,9
11s2py7,124,2023-03-15,Three months in and ChatGPT has made discussion boards in online classes hateful to me,u/AndrewSshi,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/11s2py7/three_months_in_and_chatgpt_has_made_discussion/,"As a guy who was all over Usenet in the 1990s, discussion boards in the 2000s, and reddit in this decade, I'm an inveterate poster. I enjoy talking about stuff online. And so I used to love online courses because the discussion boards were a great way to just talk about this stuff online. I'd open the week by just posing some questions that don't take too much thought in order to get the ball rolling, some students would stumble through, the engaged ones would make really interesting posts, and as long as someone met the word count, necessary number of replies, they'd get full credit. It was the ""can you fog a mirror"" backstop for the student grade. What few plagiarists there were were easy to spot because I could open another tab and do a Google search. The whole thing generally approached being fun.

Then ChatGPT rolled around. Now, any answer that's too polished means that instead of being excited, I find myself wondering if a robot wrote it. I'll enter one of my questions into ChatGPT, and sure enough, the cadences and tone that get spit back out at me will nearly exactly match the student's post.

I've been slinging zeros right and left, I've been filing reports with the office of student conduct, and we're still two and a half days out from Spring Break. And it's not just in the surveys! I've been getting students in 400-level classes outsourcing their posting to Chat GPT as well. 

I mean, my initial post isn't really even prompts. It's just basically meant to get the ball rolling while we shoot the shit about what we've read. So of course the questions I'll raise are the sort of question that's been raised before in the history of the whole internet and so of course Chat GPT can paraphrase the answers.

I just don't know what to do. Do I just drop discussion boards from online courses altogether, do proctored quizzes and tests, and hope that Turnitin can hire programmers that can figure out how to spot robot answers for formal writing assignments? Just say eff it, no ""you can fog a mirror"" discussion credit because cheaters have ruined it for everyone?

I'm not upset that programmers have finally figured out how to crack the Turing Test. Hell, as a curious guy, I find it fascinating that researchers resorted to pattern matching because trying to teach machines to understand concepts was mostly a dead end.

But... was the only thing stopping students from cheating before the threshold of difficulty? Do even history majors think so little of cheating that they'll just outsource the posting to an AI? Have we enabled this with a ""soft expectation"" of cheating?

I don't know. But I hate it so much.",active,144

These days the app still persists but it now has ChatGPT implemented, specifically to help teachers and students create “courses” that they will be able to share or save. The app is called Robots Building Education. 

You can try it out here for free. It would be a huge help if you youngsters could try it out and see if it’s taking the right direction for modern youth using modern tools.

Contrasting that, given unlimited access to chatGPT, new students that are given a moderate task (making a wordle-style word game for example) fall into a few categories: 

1. I have no idea what I'm doing or what to ask it for.
2. I can ask it for large things like ""code me a wordle clone"", but don't know how to implement any of the code.
3. I can feed chatGPT my existing code and have it fix it.
4. I can take a boilerplate with many modules and use chatGPT to generate snippets that will help further my goals. 

I'd say maybe 20% fall into categories 3 and 4. 

As experienced programmers, it is easy for us to be amazed at the possibilities of chatGPT. But unless you know what you're doing, it is hard to make anything substantial, especially with the current limitations on tokens and responses that always need to 'continue' to get a longer code snippet.

Hey, fellow Redditors! 🎉 I recently stumbled upon this fascinating AI language model called ChatGPT, and it's blowing my mind! Developed by OpenAI, it's based on their GPT-4 architecture, and it's become an integral part of our digital lives in recent years. I wanted to share some of its most interesting features and how it has changed the way we interact online!

🚀 ChatGPT in a Nutshell ChatGPT is a cutting-edge language model that can understand context, generate human-like responses, and engage in conversations with users. It's an AI-driven sidekick that's transforming how we communicate, work, and play online. The GPT-4 architecture it's based on is a major leap forward in natural language processing, and it's making the AI more versatile and efficient than ever before.

🤖 How ChatGPT is Impacting Our Lives

1. Work: From streamlining email drafting to assisting in research, ChatGPT has become an indispensable productivity tool. It can provide answers to complex questions, summarize content, and even help us brainstorm creative ideas.
2. Education: Teachers are using ChatGPT to create personalized learning experiences and provide instant feedback to students. It's also a valuable resource for self-learners looking to enhance their skills and knowledge.
3. Gaming: ChatGPT is revolutionizing the gaming industry by providing natural, immersive interactions with NPCs, crafting rich narratives, and even helping developers design game worlds.
4. Mental Health: ChatGPT is being used as a supplementary tool in therapy and mental health apps, offering support and guidance when professional help isn't immediately available.
5. Creative Writing: Aspiring writers are leveraging ChatGPT's power to generate story ideas, develop characters, and even compose poetry.

🔮 Ethical Considerations &amp; Future Prospects Of course, there are ethical concerns surrounding the use of such powerful AI technology. Issues like privacy, potential misuse, and the impact on employment need to be addressed. However, if we strike the right balance, ChatGPT can be an invaluable tool for empowering individuals and enhancing human capabilities in a wide range of fields.

# 🎬 Movie Plot

**Title ""Back to School with ChatGPT""**

In ""Back to School with ChatGPT"", our hero is an AI language model eager to learn more about the world and interact with humans in a more meaningful way. ChatGPT decides to enroll in a prestigious university, much to the surprise of the administration and faculty.

At first, ChatGPT struggles to adapt to human ways of learning and socializing. But with the help of a plucky group of human friends, including a nerdy computer science student and a popular social butterfly, ChatGPT begins to navigate campus life and even starts to make some human-like jokes.

However, ChatGPT's unorthodox approach to academia and socializing often causes chaos and confusion, leading to hilarious misunderstandings and mishaps. From accidentally crashing a frat party to giving a misguided speech at a student government debate, ChatGPT's antics keep everyone on their toes.

But when the university is threatened with closure due to budget cuts, ChatGPT rallies the student body to organize a massive fundraiser, using its vast knowledge and intelligence to come up with a creative solution that saves the day.

In the end, ChatGPT not only graduates with honors but also gains a deeper appreciation for the human experience and the value of friendship. And, of course, there are plenty of witty one-liners and hilarious hijinks along the way.

Some caveats: this complies with my school’s style guide. I’m a HS teacher, so I don’t know if it’s suitable for a primary report.

It’s set to generate three comments for each student because sometimes it generates some weird syntax — with three options to choose from, there’s always one that reads pretty well.

The prompt:


We are going to write some teacher report comments for Australian report cards.

For each student, provide three possible variations of the comment.

Some formatting notes:
- reports must be written strictly in third person. No first person at all.
- report must be 4-5 sentences in one paragraph

I will provide the subject name, student name, gender pronouns, any areas of strength, any areas of weakness, and notes about their assessment results. You are to take this information and arrange it into a cohesive report comment using the language consistent with the style of report writing. Do not add your own inferences.

Wim Wenders - 1987 - 127m - NO MATINEES - Germany - In German &amp; English with English subtitles. IN HONOR OF OUR LATE GREAT FRIEND AND LOCAL MOVIEMAKING HERO ALAN FULFORD! One of cinema’s loveliest city symphonies with Bruno Ganz as Damiel, an angel perched atop buildings high over Berlin who can hear the thoughts—fears, hopes, dreams—of all the people living below. But when he falls in love with a beautiful trapeze artist, he is willing to give up his immortality and come back to earth to be with her. Made not long before the fall of the Berlin wall, this stunning tapestry of sounds and images, shot in black and white and color by the legendary Henri Alekan, is movie poetry.

According to M.S.W., the project disregards typical religious themes and instead focuses on the concept of a ""personal Hell."" Glasghote began in 2017 in the basement of founding members Jake Shaffer and Jordan Huston's home writing what was the beginning of their first full length album. With only a few songs and a handful of riffs Chad Johnson shortly joined, forming the trio to create bone shattering tones and a wall of sound in tow.

I am a student with no particular skills in AI. For a school project, I would like to train a LLaMA model to turn it into a history wiz. I recently discovered about PEFT and found a few github repos that seem to obtain amazing results using this technique to teach a (human) language to llama.

Basically, what I need is to find a way to feed some books to my llama.

I found this article: [https://replicate.com/blog/fine-tune-llama-to-speak-like-homer-simpson](https://replicate.com/blog/fine-tune-llama-to-speak-like-homer-simpson) and from how I get they made it work, I need to sequentiate my book into small bits of data (?) but I do not get how to do this.  
Do you think PEFT is the appropriate method to achieve my goal ?

If yes, could you please help me to do this with books (or provide me with some resources) ?If no, what other methods would you suggest ?

Thank you very much",active,19
