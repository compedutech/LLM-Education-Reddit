I am a second year bachelor student from Australia, and I love education, I love learning new things. I remember in high school talking to my teachers about how long, and repetitive the process of grading is, and the impact it can have on mental health when you are staying up into late hours of the night grading papers.

I also noticed this trend amongst my university professors. I have an idea to solve this problem, and I wanted to get some feedback. Here is my proposed solution. Let me know what you think in the comments of this post:

Basically, it will be an AI grading assistant. However, the problem with going into chatGPT and saying ""grade this students paper for me"" is that it doesn't understand what it is looking for, even if you provide a rubric, it doesn't understand your specific style of grading.

I am thinking of creating a system where you upload all of your students papers, you would mark the first 15-20% of the papers manually, provide the rubric, assessment guide, and other relevant information. 

By doing this, the AI model will learn exactly what you are looking for when grading, and exactly what your style is. As it grades the rest of the papers, it will start to ask you for feedback, in the essence of ""I gave this student 4/5 marks on this section of the rubric because they did x. Is this what you are looking for?""

It will continue to learn how you want a particular assessment marked, and grade it EXACTLY how you would grade it.

The goal is to save time without sacrificing accuracy of grading. It's a rough idea, and probably needs a lot of work, but any feedback will be appreciated. ",active,0

I have been using ChatGPT, and it has boosted my retention. Here is what I do:

1. I upload the next day's five presentations and have ChatGPT give me an overview/quick summary of them. This is just so I can get an idea of what the presentations are about before class the next day.

2. I have ChatGPT make me comprehensive notes based on my presentations. I ask it to give the notes in a question-and-answer format so I can easily paste them into Notion and use the toggle feature on them.

3. I review my notes, then take an hour or so break.

4. I have ChatGPT make me an exam based on the presentations I uploaded, making it 25 questions per presentation. I make sure to ask it to make the questions at varying difficulty levels between 1-4 and to mix the questions up to practice interleaving. If I struggle with a topic, I will review it again and then have ChatGPT make me another quiz. ",active,12
1d74kf7,5,2024-06-03,I fell in love with journalism in a university who despises it,u/pooh_ta,studentsph,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentsph/comments/1d74kf7/i_fell_in_love_with_journalism_in_a_university/,"Hello, I am currently a senior high graduate and a campus journalist in our university. I am a feature writer who wrote over 10 articles in a span of 3 months in joining our school pub. 

The students here are great. I realised that I found my kind of people when I joined this organisation. Our initial advisor was not that accommodating to new members of our school pub but I didn't really paid attention to her. I love our new advisor though.

I was often praised by our EIC on how consistent I am and how beautiful my writing style is. I noticed din na I am the only active feature writer here. The other two were pretty busy I guess pero I still make time for writing even when I'm busy. (Lol side chika: nahuli ko na nag chatgpt yung isang writer namin, I scanned her work kasi it felt odd while reading it tapos ayun 100% and 17% yung plagiarized)

Weeks before our graduation I always thought that I ""might"" recieve an award—a recognition for my hardwork for all the articles I published. Pero nalaman ko nalang na wala palang ""journalist of the year award"" ang university namin. Which is idk weird? May ganyang award sa ibang univ e bat wala samin.

Our school pub is the most ignored org sa univ namin. No one actually gave a shit—including our principal. We interviewed her via chat about an event in our univ 3 months ago pero until now no response. Wala manlang respeto sa EIC namin na naghihintay sa chat nya para ma publish na namin yung article.

I'm just PRESSED (no pun intended) kasi sobrang active ng ibang teachers sa other orgs e, pero sa amin dedma lang. Wala ring press freedom dito. An article was removed from our another school pub here just because it highlighted the school's lack of safety precautions in our parking area. (Sumabog yung motorcycle dahil sa reflection ng light sa side mirror, considering the heat index)

So to end my rant, I just want to say to all aspiring student journalists out there to write because you love to write. Be a free journalist, don't let others chain you from big possibilities. Expose the corrupt and tell the stories of the oppressed. 

Journalism will never be neutral if the oppressed and oppressor exists.

One of the most interesting applications of ChatGPT is in the enhancement of learning processes, both in terms of efficiency and interaction.

Corporate training environments are evolving thanks to AI. Tools like ChatGPT can personalize learning experiences, catering to the individual needs of employees. This individualized approach ensures that learning is more relevant, which in turn can lead to improved retention of information and faster skill acquisition.

In the educational sector, the implications are just as profound. ChatGPT can support educators by providing additional resources for students to interact with. It can function as a tutoring aid, offering explanations and resources, or even generating questions and topics for debate. This can help to deepen understanding and engagement among students, resulting in a more efficient education process.

Furthermore, another key impact is the potential reduction in mundane tasks for trainers and educators. With ChatGPT, routine queries and doubts can be handled by the AI, freeing up valuable time for educators to focus on more critical tasks like curriculum development and personal student interaction.

However, as we discuss the efficiency gains, we should also be mindful of the challenges such as ensuring the AI's outputs are accurate and aligning the use of ChatGPT with educational goals. Moreover, the ethical considerations of data privacy and the digital divide must be addressed to ensure equitable access.

The implementation of ChatGPT and similar AI tools in learning is not just about replacing traditional methods but enhancing and complementing them to cater to the evolving landscape of corporate and educational environments. Let's consider not just the immediate benefits but also the long-term impacts on the pedagogy, learner engagement, and overall knowledge delivery systems.

PhD life, am I right? It's like riding a roller coaster with more downs than ups. Sometimes you nail it, but other times, you're left crying into your computer. This thread is a great place to share those weekly wins and losses. So, how's your week going?

Today is Wellness Wednesday! It's all about sharing those little gems that helped you survive this academic jungle. Got a blog post, paper, or article that was a lifesaver? Drop it here! Self-promotion is cool too, so if you wrote something awesome, let us know. Found a killer workout routine or a chill book? Share it!

Now, onto the AI debate. We've all heard about not using AI like ChatGPT to write entire sections of research papers, but what about using tools like Coral AI to summarize and reference research? It's still your writing, but the process is AI-assisted. Is this the new norm in academia or a slippery slope? What do you think?

And a big shout-out to those moments when you get recognition. Someone actually read my paper and recommended it to their students! They even asked for my slides and materials. What’s the protocol for sharing these? Is it cool to ask for their syllabus? How would you build on this academic connection?

Speaking of life after PhD, I've noticed a trend of PhD students joining companies like Meta and IBM as post-docs. What's the deal here? Are these roles a gateway back into academia or a step further into the industry?

And let's not forget the need to vent. PhDs are tough, but they have their perks too. I'd love to hear some positives. Personally, I loved the shared excitement for research during my master's. Industry work just doesn't have that same vibe. What keeps you going?

Pro tip: Beware of ""easy"" projects. If it’s almost done and someone quit, dig deeper. There’s usually a reason, and it’s often not a good one. Trust me, I learned this the hard way.

This week has been rough. Family stuff, stress, and now research setbacks. I was on track for three publications, but my supervisor delayed reviewing my first one, and now someone else published the same work. Major bummer. Anyone else been scooped? How did you bounce back?

Finally, balancing lab attendance with dissertation writing. I write better at home, but my PI prefers us in the lab. Anyone else in a similar boat? How do you manage it?

I have tested the language model Qwen2-72b-instruct against Llama3 and WizardLM-2 in two complex tasks and would like to share my experiences. I hope this exchange of experiences will be helpful for some of you.

It is often claimed that Qwen2 performs so well in benchmark results because it was trained on benchmark data. I therefore hesitated to test Qwen2, as I have been very satisfied with Llama3-70b-instruct and WizardLM-2-8x22b. Perhaps some of you can relate?

In the past week, I have used these language models and Command-R-+ in parallel for various tasks and can say that Qwen2 performs similarly strong or even better than the other three models in many, although not all, application areas.  


I have particularly tested the following two application areas:

**1)** Qwen2 performs significantly better than the other models in creative few-shot tasks. Specifically, I provide the models with 8 self-created, problem-oriented teaching introductions to mathematical topics that effectively motivate students to engage with these topics. Then, the model is prompted to develop a problem-oriented introduction to a completely different mathematical topic.

Command-R-+ unfortunately fails this task, Llama3 often lacks relevance to the mathematical content, and WizardLM solves the task but lacks creativity in choosing the introduction scenarios. Qwen2 performs the best with a clear margin and will replace WizardLM for me in this area.

**2)** Creation of self-study worksheets that are suitable for students to autonomously learn a mathematics topic and effectively activate students.

Llama3 creates worksheets with a good didactic structure, but the instructions for students are often misunderstood. Therefore, I usually have to revise the worksheets created by Llama3 extensively. WizardLM creates good worksheets. The numbers are chosen so that all tasks can be calculated well without a calculator. The didactic structure is quite good.

The worksheets created by Qwen2 are even more refined than those of WizardLM and allow for even higher student activation.  


Qwen2 is definitely worth a try in these application areas.",active,100

What you have seen or learned in the last few years, particularly when chatGPT became popular in 2022? 

For example, I have used it in the past for assisting me to refine my own writings where it isn't for research or important writing, etc but for the things it is really helpful with right now, like being a good organiser or editor (if you use it properly).

I've also seen student submissions where they have literally copy- pasted from the AI tool (there are a million ways to tell, easiest is when they leave the prompt boxes in).

Some Academics say it's helpful to them because it can help plan their learning. Some believe they will always be able to spot it. Some are incorporating it so that students understand the limitations. Others have no idea what it is but thinks it's a bigger problem than it currently is. Others are refusing to learn about it and subsequently say it's ""too hard"" to prove.

I'm interested in it all! This is a place of learning, so please help me (hopefully help you too)!

For anyone thinking or wanting to take the exam, DO IT, it's not that bad. But, if you haven't taken any prior exams, I suggest you study hard. I am a female student about to complete my bachelor's in cybersecurity, with NO experience in the IT field or anything related.  I suggest you all look at the objectives and make sure you know and UNDERSTAND everything that's on it. Really understand and differentiate the acronyms (MOU, MOA, SLA, SOW, BPA, CA, COPE, SCAP, EDR, etc). Know your directory traversal, SQL, buffer overflow, on-path, and social engineering attacks. There were questions that I was certain of and others where it's tryna trick ya, so I highly recommend using process of elimination. The following resources I used were:

1. **Professor Messer's** YouTube videos + practice exams which I only paid $30 (Yes, his tests are most similar to the exam) Review each question you got wrong and WHY
2. **Jason Dions** course (didn't really watch his videos just used it for the practice test and chapter questions)
3. **Chatgpt** for better comprehension and examples.
4. Looking up **YouTube videos** for practice questions. I used what other people have mentioned like Andrew Ramdayal's 50 questions video and cyberkraft for PBQs (but didn't really watch his PBQ vids since I kinda knew what the PBQs would be like)
5. I typed down my own study guide while watching Professor Messer's videos as well as adding my examples to reinforce what I learned.

Tip: If you haven't taken a cert or have any knowledge of the topic, I recommend you write down flashcards as well as make your study guide (typed or written) and include every objective.

The PBQs are exactly what others in the forum have said....so start scrolling. 1 involves setting 2 site to site VPNs and choosing the strongest encryption, and the 2 one is determining the infected device + other stuff.  

Lastly, thank you to all of those who have shared their advice, information, and experiences about their exams. You guys truly contribute so much to the community.

1dl2hba,2,2024-06-21,"26 and want to apply to medical school, would you recommend it?",u/red-bean-bun,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1dl2hba/26_and_want_to_apply_to_medical_school_would_you/,"hello, posted on r/premed and got some lovely responses but I'm hoping to get more opinions here. Also looking for other paths a junior swe can take in this economy. Thanks for reading 🩷

I (26F) have been a SWE for over a year and it looks like I will be PIPed (a somewhat merciful firing) within the next 6 months. I am applying to jobs, but the tech market is currently abysmal especially for juniors so it's been taking a while. Unless some miracle happens, I will most likely be unable to get out of the PIP due to my skill issue.

Reasons for skill issue:
- I am dumb, shy, and slow (in general,  but also with special regards to programming). No way around it, it is what it is. Current company has high expectations which I cannot meet.
- In the words of my therapist, I have severe depression and social anxiety 😬 So that has been a major roadblock of mine
- Was a math major, decided to get MSCS at a cash cow to learn more about CS. The MS was useless and I ended up missing the tech boom. One of the biggest regrets of my life, but the damage has been done. Total student loan debt is 300,000 including parent plus loans.

I cannot see a way out of this hole I dug. My current plan is to apply to government jobs to pursue PSLF because I am not cut out for big tech and cannot pay down these loans otherwise. However, with tech layoffs happening, these government positions are becoming unicorns as everyone wants stability and good WLB. I also do not see a future for me in tech having to keep up with AI until the next new fad, or later on competing with AI for a job.

So, I have been oddly comforted by trying once again to pursue medicine. The amount of loans I will take on is enormous though, and my parents are getting old and will need me to take care of them financially in <5 years. I was hoping that I could be in residency within 5 years so I can contribute financially and also pursue PSLF. I have a year of savings if my mother loses her job as well (my dad does not work and they both do not have a retirement plan, I am the retirement plan 🥲).

What stopped me from applying right out of undergrad:

- GPA: I took the engineering version of premed reqs in the first 2 years of college because I was a math major. It was harder than it needed to be and this meant I had to leave all math upper divs to the last 2 years. Unfortunately, proof based math upper divs are an entirely different beast and I tanked my gpa to a 3.4 (downward trend bc senior year avg was 3.0). Q: Would I be able to leave out the irrelevant upper divs in BCPM? Things like calc, diff eq, lin alg, and discrete math I would definitely add but does abstract algebra need to be in there 🥴 Last I checked homomorphisms have nothing to do with medicine help 😭

- Low volunteer hours: 150 ish (some could count for shadowing). I got rejected by one of the better volunteer programs after interviewing with them 3 times... That was interesting and definitely made me think I wasn't ready for med school. They were definitely right though, it just hurt so much getting rejected by your fellow classmates and peers over and over again for a volunteering position 😭 I really put myself out there, but it isn't enough and I know I still have problems with stuttering, no eye contact, blanking out

- MCAT: Low 500s, expired now. Example of skill issue 🗿 no comment 

- Personal statement: I couldn't really formulate why I wanted to be a doctor, I just thought primary care specifically was neat since when I was little while being treated for a chronic condition, the doctors were so kind to me when I was a bit hysterical haha. I liked the applications that math and cs have in medicine too. Writing was a weak point of mine and so is cars 🫠 and chatgpt did not exist back then ffs 

- My mother got laid off from her job when I started undergrad (she has always been the sole breadwinner). When she still was unable to find a full time job in my 3rd year with the added stress of upper div math, my mental health tanked further and I checked out of all my premed responsibilities. I took a food service job to try to help  out my parents, but I was bad at that too and my parents didn't want me working at the time. 
She did not find a stable job until the middle of my MS, so it was hard for me to drop thousands on apps when we were struggling. We used a combo of gov assistance and money from a tutoring job of mine to pay rent for a year. I decided to go CS so I can make money as quickly as possible to help my family, but I could not predict so many layoffs and mf chatgpt coming for my neck in 2024 💀

Recent things: 
- MSCS gpa was 3.4, okay for CS bad for premed, also a downward trend bc again, hard classes at the end (operating systems made me sweat every day). Did literally nothing to help my gpa...
- Part time tutoring job for over 2 years (1000 hrs)
- Current SWE job (2000hrs) is a big player in the healthcare space, thinking I could leverage that somehow
- Was aiming to retake mcat end of Aug, seems too late to apply this cycle though 😭 I really do not want to wait one more year because my parents aren't getting any younger and im going to lose my job this year, but a lot hinges on this mcat score
- Clinical hours (150) are just the ones from undergrad, so if I need to wait one more year I was hoping to get a clinical job, my current job may prevent me from doing so though 🙃 ahaha I love this I love life live laugh love!!
- I did have research (250hrs) in undergrad for 2 years, no pubs, 2 posters, some competition entries
- rec letters: 1 good old one (i hope) from my PI, 2 mediocre old ones, hoping to get 1 new one from old boss (i think should be good)

Man, I am at the end of my rope here and don't know what to do anymore. I thought by now I would have things figured out but nothing is clear and I have been having dark thoughts every single day. When I study for the mcat though, I do feel a sense of hope which is nice. This was my dream since I was a child, I just hit so many roadblocks. I would like to chase my dream one more time though... If it doesn't work out, I truly gave it my best shot. I also can't really tell if this is my depression talking, trying to find a way out of the mess I've created for myself but ahaha!! Manic pixie dream and whatnot 💃

tl;dr I want to apply again to medical school at 26/27, I need people to talk some sense into me and tell me to say goodbye to medicine for good bc I can't seem to let it go",active,3

I've been exploring the fascinating implications of integrating ChatGPT into various applications, and I must say the potential is truly riveting. For starters, this AI language model developed by OpenAI has shown remarkable versatility and adaptability, which has triggered my curiosity about how far it can be pushed in different environments.

Think about customer service, for instance. Integrating ChatGPT could revolutionize the way companies interact with their customers. By building it into chatbots, we can provide real-time, intelligent, and contextually-aware responses to customer inquiries. This not only improves the efficiency of customer service teams but could significantly enhance the user experience by providing quick and accurate assistance round the clock.

But let's not stop there. Imagine what ChatGPT could do for content creation. Whether we're dealing with blogs, social media posts, or even generating creative stories, the potential for AI-generated content is huge. Could we see a future where AI is responsible for drafting initial article outlines, or perhaps even entire novels? With its ability to understand and generate human-like text, it's not too far-fetched.

The landscape of education also stands to benefit from AI integration. With ChatGPT, personalized learning experiences can be crafted. It can adapt to a student's individual learning pace and style, providing customized explanations and resources that would make learning incredibly efficient.

But with great power comes great responsibility. Integrating ChatGPT into these domains raises important questions about ethics, privacy, and the potential effects on job markets. How do we ensure that AI supports rather than replaces human workers in sectors like customer service? What safeguards should be in place to protect user data as it interacts with AI?

I'd love to get your thoughts on this. How viable do you think integrating ChatGPT is in your industry or daily life? Are the benefits worth the trade-offs? Share your insights, experiences, and even your concerns as we delve into the era of conversational AI. Let's decode the future together!

For me, I suggest using AI tools such as:

**(chatbots):** [ChatGPT.com](http://ChatGPT.com) 4o - you can utilize their new features for learning effectively.

[claude.ai](http://Claude.ai) - minsan eto ginagamit ko kapag wonky ang GPT. still, very reliable and sometimes i prefer this over the latter.

[gemini.ai](https://gemini.google.com/app) - if i am doing something with connection to the google workspace. 

**(search engines):** [perplexity.ai](http://perplexity.ai) - lifesaver if you're just looking for quick finds. the citation parts are really useful. 

[exa.ai](http://exa.ai), [phind.com](https://www.phind.com/search?home=true), and [correkt.ai](https://app.correkt.ai/) - same purpose, but perplexity is the best. you can segway between these if you are having a hard time finding specific information.

For [correkt.ai](http://correkt.ai), hindi ko pa to masyado nagagamit but for background info, this was made by UCSB students. 

**(academic research):** [elicit.com](http://elicit.com) - really useful ang summary parts. saved my life in RRLs.

[consensus.app](http://consensus.app/search/) - good for looking at findings as it has more specified aspects.

[typeset.io](http://typeset.io) - useful sometimes but be wary of false positives.

**(general learning):**

[explorer.globe.engineer](https://explorer.globe.engineer/) - this is amazing if you want to learn something. it divides it into many subtopics!

[google.com](http://google.com) - not an AI, but you can find so many materials just by learning how to use it properly. for example, you can add ""filetype:pdf"" to a search and it will only show pdf. this has been useful to me when i practice mathematics. ex: google search - ""calculus workbook with answers filetype:pdf."" you'll be amazed on how much free stuff there is online.

[zlib](https://singlelogin.re/) - again, not an AI tool but this is very useful for broke students like me hahaha.

these are the tools that i actually use on a daily basis. super useful neto and it really is a huge help when it comes to tedious, boring tasks. feel free to add! baka may di pa ko nalalagay.
