Now it’s sending me motivational quotes. Thanks, machine—that really makes losing everything feel better. 🥲

**Zhipu AI: The New ""AI Tiger"" in Town**

Remember when startups were the rebellious cool kids in the tech playpen, each with their unique mission to change the world? Enter AI, the straight-A student with an attitude problem, and suddenly, everyone's vision board caught fire. The latest headline from the AI sector? Zhipu AI just bagged another billion-yuan check, playing hardball in China's fierce AI field. 

**Competition Heats Up**

Let's break it down. Zhipu AI, often pitched as one of China's ""AI tigers,"" has just secured a jaw-dropping $137 million, riding on the back of a previous $3 billion round. That's a whole lot of zeros, folks. But in the world of artificial intelligence, where digits and data rule, this is just the latest twist in an ongoing saga of strategic one-upmanship.

**AI Ecosystem: Level Up**

Where's all this money going? Think GLM large language models—essentially the Goliath of machine learning. Zhipu plans to enhance and expand its AI ecosystem, bouncing back the ball served by competitors like DeepSeek. The open-source wave is building momentum here too, with Zhipu planning to release new models and AI agents under an open-source framework. 

This move isn't just about flexing technical muscle; it's strategic dominance, particularly aimed at nurturing business applications in provinces like Zhejiang and the economically potent Yangtze River Delta. Cities like Hangzhou are fast becoming a nucleus for AI innovation, with state-backed entities rolling out the red carpet for ambitious AI ventures.

**Price of Progress**

But here's the million-yuan question (or 137 million if you're Zhipu): Is this deluge of artificial intelligence-powered investment truly the dawn of an enlightened digital age or are we just switching our analog anxieties for algorithmic ones? As the competition intensifies, the software may advance, but it's humanity that’s left with the hard choice of how much to automate.

🤔 So Reddit, has AI modified your company’s trajectory, crashed your dreams, or are you riding the algorithmic wave to success? Let's hear your tales of triumph or tribulation in the comments!",active,1

I was actually pretty excited, the flexibility, managing your own classes, and getting to sleep in at anytime you want. Sadly, the imagination of all that didn't come true.

My parents are super strict, can't hang out with friends, can't play games, can't have you grade drop by even the slightest or else you're in huge trouble, stuff like that. 

I want to socialize and make friends, but I can't. You might say ""join the community or a local homeschooling club"" which I am in, it just seems so hard to make friends in the club, everyone is kind of into their own bubble, they come from one location, its just like no one wants to be bothered. I could also make friends with people at my local church, but they're all just younger than me.

Also, I just feel like I'm learning nothing. I'm currently at connections academy, (texas connections) when the topic is about this lesson (especially in math) they'll switch you up to another topic thats under the same unit, but completely different. It doesn't help we have Live Lessons once a week and 90 other students are in the same exact Live Lesson. Also the lessons make absolutely no sense and it seems so low effort, they'll give you 2 examples and expect you to know how to do it.

It doesn't help that I've tried expressing to my parents that I want to go back traditional schooling. But they'll shrug it off and dismiss it. I try my best to talk to them again and again. But they won't listen to me.

I feel like I am not learning anything, I limit my distractions but I just end up going to brainly or Chatgpt for help.

Even if the option isn't going back, I atleast want to make my homeschool expereince good, is there any suggestions so I can stay on track or anything?

1j6n0qd,1,2025-03-08,Bridging Minds and Machines: How Large Language Models Are Revolutionizing Robot Communication,u/Medical_Basil9154,AI_Agents,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Agents/comments/1j6n0qd/bridging_minds_and_machines_how_large_language/,"Imagine a future where robots converse with humans as naturally as friends, understand sarcasm, and adapt their responses to our emotions. This vision is closer than ever, thanks to the integration of **large language models (LLMs)** like GPT-4 into robotics. These AI systems, trained on vast amounts of text and speech data, are transforming robots from rigid, command-driven machines into intuitive, conversational partners. This essay explores how LLMs are enabling robots to understand, reason, and communicate in human-like ways—and what this means for our daily lives.

# The Building Blocks: LLMs and Robotics

To grasp how LLMs empower robots, let’s break down the key components:

1. **What Are Large Language Models?** LLMs are AI systems trained on massive datasets of text, speech, and code. They learn patterns in language, allowing them to generate human-like responses, answer questions, and even write poetry. Unlike earlier chatbots that relied on scripted replies, LLMs *understand context*—for example, distinguishing between “I’m feeling cold” (a request to adjust the thermostat) and “That movie gave me chills” (a metaphor).
2. **Robots as Physical AI Agents** Robots combine sensors (cameras, microphones), actuators (arms, wheels), and software to interact with the physical world. Historically, their “intelligence” was limited to narrow tasks (e.g., vacuuming). Now, LLMs act as their **linguistic brain**, enabling them to parse human language, make decisions, and explain their actions.

# How LLMs Supercharge Robot Conversations

# 1. Natural, Context-Aware Dialogue

LLMs allow robots to engage in fluid, multi-turn conversations. For instance:

* **Scenario:** You say, “It’s too dark in here.”
* **Old Robots:** Might respond, “Command not recognized.”
* **LLM-Powered Robot:** Infers context → checks light sensors → says, “I’ll turn on the lamp. Would you like it dimmer or brighter?”

This adaptability stems from LLMs’ ability to analyze tone, intent, and situational clues.

# 2. Understanding Ambiguity and Nuance

Humans often speak indirectly. LLMs help robots navigate this complexity:

* **Example:** “I’m craving something warm and sweet.”
* **Robot’s Process:**
   1. **LLM Analysis:** Recognizes “warm and sweet” as a dessert.
   2. **Action:** Checks kitchen inventory → suggests, “I can bake cookies. Shall I preheat the oven?”

# 3. Learning from Interactions

LLMs enable robots to improve over time. If a robot misunderstands a request (e.g., brings a soda instead of water), the user can correct it (“No, I meant water”), and the LLM updates its knowledge for future interactions.

# Real-World Applications

1. **Elder Care Companions** Robots like **ElliQ** use LLMs to chat with seniors, remind them to take medication, and share stories to combat loneliness. The robot’s LLM tailors conversations to the user’s interests and history.
2. **Customer Service Robots** In hotels, LLM-powered robots like **Savioke’s Relay** greet guests, answer questions about amenities, and even crack jokes—all while navigating crowded lobbies autonomously.
3. **Educational Tutors** Robots in classrooms use LLMs to explain math problems in multiple ways, adapting their teaching style based on a student’s confusion (e.g., “Let me try using a visual example…”).
4. **Disaster Response** Search-and-rescue robots with LLMs can understand shouted commands like “Check the rubble to your left!” and report back with verbal updates (“Two survivors detected behind the collapsed wall”).

# Challenges and Ethical Considerations

While promising, integrating LLMs into robots raises critical issues:

1. **Miscommunication Risks** LLMs can “hallucinate” (generate incorrect info). A robot might misinterpret “Water the plants” as “Spray the couch with water” without proper safeguards.
2. **Bias and Sensitivity** LLMs trained on biased data could lead robots to make inappropriate remarks. Rigorous testing and ethical guidelines are essential.
3. **Privacy Concerns** Robots recording conversations for LLM processing must encrypt data and allow users to opt out.
4. **Over-Reliance on Machines** Could LLM-powered robots reduce human empathy in caregiving or education? Balance is key.

# The Future: Toward Empathic Machines

The next frontier is **emotionally intelligent robots**. Researchers are combining LLMs with:

* **Voice Sentiment Analysis:** Detecting sadness or anger in a user’s tone.
* **Facial Recognition:** Reading expressions to adjust responses (e.g., a robot noticing frustration and saying, “Let me try explaining this differently”).
* **Cultural Adaptation:** Customizing interactions based on regional idioms or social norms.

Imagine a robot that not only makes coffee but also senses your stress and asks, “Bad day? I picked a calming playlist for you.”

# Conclusion

The fusion of large language models and robotics is redefining how machines understand and interact with humans. From providing companionship to saving lives, LLM-powered robots are poised to become seamless extensions of our daily lives. However, this technology demands careful stewardship to ensure it enhances—rather than complicates—human well-being. As we stand on the brink of a world where robots truly “get” us, one thing is clear: the future of communication isn’t just human-to-human or human-to-machine. It’s a collaborative dance of minds, both organic and artificial.",active,1

AI is going to democratize business creation. I myself am currently starting a business 6 months before starting my MBA and with zero business experience. 90% of what I've learned about marketing, business law, and other business functions has come from my trusty co-founder: ChatGPT. 

I think this will be a trend going forward. Think how many smart people are in the world who have had brilliant business ideas that never saw implementation because they didn't have the connections or knowledge to make it happen. AI is changing that. Now anyone with a good idea and luke-warm IQ has at least a decent shot at starting a successful business with little education or expertise.

I think many of these startups will be from people with deep industry experience, who have recognized a problem in their industry that they want to solve, but will eventually reach a point where they don't know how to scale or manage the business.

This is where MBAs come in. I those of us who absorb the fundamentals in business school and refine our leadership ability will be in high demand in a world where anybody can start a company, but can't scale it. 

I think this will only apply to MBA students who are willing to follow and unconventional, entrepreneurial path. Sure, consulting and IB may be downsizing with AI, but bigger and lesser-known opportunities will emerge for those of us willing to seek them out. ",active,77

I stumbled upon a fascinating topic that I wanted to share and discuss with all of you. It’s about how ChatGPT is revolutionizing various industries by significantly enhancing productivity. I think it's phenomenal to see AI not only take shape in theoretical spaces but truly transform operational efficiencies in practice.

One of the top sectors that have embraced this AI transformation is customer service. ChatGPT's conversational capabilities are being used to handle routine customer inquiries, which allows human agents to tackle more complex issues. This doesn't just cut down on wait times but also improves the overall customer experience.

Moving on to the creative industries, writers and content creators find ChatGPT's brainstorming assistance as a boon. It helps overcome writer's block by generating ideas and even draft outlines, enabling writers to produce content with more efficiency.

In the field of education, ChatGPT helps educators by automating administrative tasks like grading or by providing homework assistance. This frees up more time for teachers to engage with students on a deeper, more personal level, positively impacting the learning experience.

The technology industry, which is always at the forefront of adopting AI, uses ChatGPT in software development. AI can write code snippets and debug existing code, which increases the speed of development cycles and allows developers to focus on more complex coding tasks.

Lastly, the healthcare sector, which is leveraging ChatGPT for tasks like patient triage and medical documentation. It processes information quickly and suggests diagnoses, which aids healthcare professionals in managing their time more effectively and improving patient care.

What are your thoughts on this advancement? How do you see AI like ChatGPT further integrating into these or other sectors? Do you have concerns about AI's growing presence in the workforce?

I've studied and researched many different methods. While I’ve drawn inspiration from some, I haven’t found any that match the special aspects of the teaching i wanted. That’s why I prefer to **develop my own materials instead of using pre-made ones**.

# The tools I use

* **ChatGPT** (to generate some exercises and sentences, but I review everything carefully to ensure it aligns with my goals).
* **Canva** (to design and export the final PDFs).

# Design and structure

* **Design:** Simple color palette and basic formatting.
* **Structure:** I discuss a grammar point (focusing on essential aspects for beginners and going into more depth with advanced students). Since my audience is **adults**, I emphasize **understanding the logic of the language**.
* **Materials are entirely in English**, making them adaptable for students with different native languages.

[US, Mathematics]",u/spanish_textbook,AskProfessors,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProfessors/comments/1j8jlak/is_cheating_incentivized_in_math_classes_us/,"I am a older/30's returning student doing a sabbatical of sorts to study Physics, something I always loved.

I made the mistake of enrolling in an async section for Calc 3 and it's my first time being put through the gauntlet of Pearson Math Lab and discussion posts.  For context, I'm taking Diff Eq class as well and love it.  I am having all these magic moments connecting Diff Eq to physics. 

In my Calc class, we are making honest students jump through many hoops.  Homework seems to be over-weighted because students can't be trusted to actually study.  So instead we have these long and grueling problem sets with a horrible user interface.  
  
Make a mistake? Ok..but you'll have to start the 10 step problem over with new numbers.  
Do that too many times? No credit for you.  Sorry!

One week we get 3 attempts, the next week we get 1 for some reason and the professor can't explain why.  It just sucks

I often end up using AI and other solvers to do the problems because I'm running out of limited attempts on a problem(which is a crazy statement).  It's just not worth the risk of missing out on homework points when it's almost half my grade.  I basically have an anxiety inducing, data entry job and then I go find my own problem sets to work on from outside material.

This doesn't even begin to address ""discussion"" posts in a calculus class where it's basically ChatGPT talking to itself.

My question is in the title.  Is there a more effective way to do async education?  I know there are probably institutional factors that prevent professors weighting exams more. I would love homework to be negligible and exams to be weighted more heavily.

TLDR; Pearson terrible, cheating is incentivized? Do professors even have time for their async classes?",active,0
1j8w6a5,12,2025-03-11,[R] Contrastive Distillation for Large Language Models: Leveraging Teacher-Student Response Synergy,u/Successful-Western27,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1j8w6a5/r_contrastive_distillation_for_large_language/,"The DistiLLM-2 paper introduces a contrastive distillation approach for Large Language Models that significantly improves upon previous methods. The key innovation is weighted contrastive logit distillation (WCLD), which uses contrastive learning during the knowledge distillation process to help student models better distinguish between good and poor responses.

The technique works by:
- Fine-tuning a teacher model on high-quality data
- Generating both correct teacher responses and intentionally incorrect responses
- Training a student model using both traditional distillation and contrastive learning objectives
- Applying a weighting mechanism that emphasizes differences between correct and incorrect outputs

Key results:
- Student models achieve up to 99% of teacher performance while being 3-10x smaller
- 2-3x inference speedups compared to teacher models
- Consistently outperforms previous distillation methods across multiple benchmarks
- Successfully distilled models from Llama-2 70B down to 1.3B parameters
- Particularly effective when the size gap between teacher and student is large

I think this approach addresses one of the most pressing problems in LLM deployment - the resource requirements for running state-of-the-art models. The ability to create much smaller models that retain nearly all the capabilities of their larger counterparts could democratize access to advanced AI capabilities and enable efficient deployment on resource-constrained devices.

The contrastive learning angle is particularly interesting because it suggests that understanding what makes an output wrong is just as important as knowing what makes it right. This mirrors how humans learn and could point to more efficient training paradigms beyond just distillation.

What's most promising is how the technique seems to scale across different model sizes and architectures. If these results hold up in production environments, we could see a shift toward smaller, more efficient models that don't sacrifice much in terms of capability.

TLDR: DistiLLM-2 uses contrastive learning to create smaller, faster LLMs that retain up to 99% of their teacher model's performance, enabling 2-3x speedups with minimal quality loss.

I have been into CS and programming since undergrad, even took some programming courses in undergrad and really enjoyed them. Some experience with ML classes during my masters and always found the theory super interesting, we built surrogate models to improve parametric truss models what I thought was really cool. 

I've been interested in machine learning since 2016, been playing around with word2vec and keeping up with the literature like the original GPT 1 and 2 papers. I genuinely find the math behind all of it endlessly fascinating. I was one of the first people to try to chatgpt WebApp the day it was released before the insane hype. 

I would love to work with some application of machine learning and my current field, however looking at how the job market for CS roles seems to be and how people in this reddit seem to make it out to be a bit apprehensive.

Body:
Hello, fellow Redditors!

With the advent of AI like ChatGPT, the domains of virtual education and corporate training have undergone a significant transformation. ChatGPT, with its conversational prowess, is proving to be a game-changer, and I'm here to break down its impact on efficiency.

Let's start with virtual education. Students and educators now have access to an AI assistant that can provide explanations, create educational content, and tailor learning sessions for individual needs. In real-time, ChatGPT can answer questions, making studying more interactive and less static than traditional e-learning modules. Its ability to provide instant feedback and gauge user responses is remarkable, leading to personalized and adaptive learning experiences.

For corporate training, ChatGPT is shaking things up on the efficiency front. It standardizes the training process, ensuring that all employees receive the same information and guidance. Instead, costly and time-consuming in-person sessions, ChatGPT can deliver scalable training across the globe without losing the personal touch, thanks to its sophisticated language model.

Moreover, integration with corporate databases allows ChatGPT to simulate conversations and scenarios relevant to a company’s specific context, paving the way for role-playing activities without needing human actors. This is crucial for soft skill development, such as customer service training, negotiation, or conflict resolution.

Additionally, AI's nature facilitates continuous learning — employees can engage with the AI outside of formal training hours, enhancing knowledge retention and keeping skills fresh without additional cost.

The engagement metrics and the ability to track progress through AI analytics tools also provide insight into training effectiveness at an individual and organizational level.

1jf10n4,5,2025-03-19,I failed a live demo of my AI-Powered platform in front of dozens of students at Harvard Business School. Here’s what I learned.,u/No-Definition-2886,ChatGPTPromptGenius,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1jf10n4/i_failed_a_live_demo_of_my_aipowered_platform_in/,"[*This article was originally posted on my Medium profile. If you want to support me, please read it there and give me some claps. It helps TREMENDOUSLY with the reach!*](https://medium.com/p/75154a859b47)

One of my favorite opportunities of the year was a chance to guest lecture at Harvard Business school.

I met the professor, Dr. Parzen, through LinkedIn. He had one of my YouTube videos, looked me up, and saw we went to the same alma matter, Carnegie Mellon University.

We chatted and he thought it would be awesome if the day before Spring Break, I spoke to his class about entrepreneurship, artificial intelligence, and starting a business.

And so I did.

Everything went perfectly. The 25 or so students in his class were attentive, asked lots of questions, and seemed very interested in what I had to say. I did my first (pre-planned) demo and it was flawless.

And then Dr. Parzen asked my AI to do a challenge question, and it flopped in front of everybody.

# Background: How did I meet Dr. Parzen

Dr. Parzen first found me when he discovered my YouTube video about NexusTrade.

Video: A video demo of NexusTrade and the video that Dr. Parzen saw that led him to me

One of the things that he really liked about it was that it *practically* and *visually* applied AI.

It’s not like other LLMs which are boring chatbots. With NexusTrade, when you talk to the AI, you can fully understand the value without thinking about it. Being able to ask questions about the stock market and getting an answer within seconds? Unheard of before AI.

[Pic: What 10 AI stocks have the highest CAGR?](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*y_tPE0Z5hRInlWPM_WA95Q.png)

But it wasn’t just “asking questions” that impressed Michael. It was applying the answers to the question in a way that allowed you to unlock insights that was virtually impossible without AI.

For example, I asked the AI.

>What 10 AI stocks have the highest 5-year net income CAGR?

And then, once it listed the stocks (which included some surprising finds like Zoom and some unsurprising finds like NVIDIA), we could instantly take that list and visualize how the an automated investing strategy containing these stocks performed in the past.

[Pic: Backtesting the historical performance of these stocks](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*hPTbapuF56Wyf8Jfxt6kKw.png)

This works very well for simple strategies. But during the lecture, after my pre-planned demo, Dr. Parzen had a challenge for it.

>“Tell it to rebalance 100 stocks!” – Dr. Parzen

# The App-Breaking Challenge

After my guest lecture and demo, Dr. Parzen wanted to challenge it. After fetching a list of 100 stocks, he wanted to see if we could create a complex “rebalancing” strategy with it. The strategy was as follows:

>Let’s create a trading strategy with the following rules

The AI thought and thought and thought. After an eternity (aka, 3 minutes), the AI responded with the following.

[Pic: The error message from the app](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*QQA7Z3ma9m0mEo0xQeKr8w.png)

A loud and audible groan let out from the class. While I knew that the AI could create such a strategy *in theory*, in practice, it outright did not work.

I finished my lecture, received an applause, and left. Immediately after, I got to work fixing this issue.

# Why did it break?

When digging into this issue, I discovered several things about the rebalancing strategy:

1. The JSON objects for the “rebalance” action are MASSIVE. Up to 700KB for this list of 100 stocks.
2. Much of the details aren’t actually needed by the model, even though they’re needed by the backend
3. Because of this size, the LLM has trouble figuring out what it actually needs to generate

With other types of actions (like buying, selling, and alerting), I never had an issue because the actions JSON representation of them are small, even if you have a half-dozen different buying and selling rules.

But because of the complexity and ingenuity of the rebalance action, it needed to store a lot more data for its configuration.

And so I got to work thinking about how to reduce it.

# How I fixed it?

In my first attempt to fix this issue, I simply removed all fields from the JSON that weren’t needed by the model.

This “fixed” the solution, in the sense that if I had another surprise demo, it would work if we asked a few back-and-forth questions.

[Pic: Generating an extremely complex trading strategy using the AI.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*t6FQM_sH6mvIofc_UWyUig.png)

But the fix didn’t go far enough. If we had a longer conversation with the model, it would forget, omit details, and make mistakes.

The JSON was STILL too big.

So I tried something different.

**My attempt at “vibe-coding” a novel compression algorithm**

[Pic: The JSON representation of the rebalance action](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*e5fvHnMdv0xPHT8aHCKC0g.png)

I knew that the JSON for a rebalance action was verbose, particularly when we had 100 assets. I thought about how to reduce it.

And used Claude 3.7 Sonnet to do so.

Now, what I *wanted* the title of this article to be was

>(Title) “How I vibe-coded a novel compression algorithm using Claude 3.7 Sonnet” (Subtitle) “It took literally no work at all. I’m shocked.”

And for a minute there, I thought it was going to work!

But after about an hour of me going back and forth with the model, Claude forgetting what I told it, and finding it cheating unit tests, I ended up putting away the LLM and utilizing the skills I gained when getting my Masters from Carnegie Mellon. This included:

* **Test-driven development**: Creating the unit tests before writing the code
* **Black-box testing**: Testing that the inputs of the function (the rebalance action) gives me the expected output (the compact action) without looking at the implementation of the function
* **String parsing**: While I didn’t learn this at CMU, [I did an entire project utilizing string parsing and regex](https://github.com/austin-starks/C2H2_ZF_Proteins) when I was doing an undergraduate research program at Princeton in computational biology

I also utilized LLMs, but not in a passive, “vibe-coding” type of way. I gave it a function and its requirements, and the model generated it correctly on its first try. This sped up my productivity by 400% or more, but it was far from passive.

The end result was a compact “Rebalance action” that I knew the model would understand.

[Pic: The new and improved compact rebalance action. This is the](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*2sPRw1LLmhOP5rnyfYxPcQ.png)

This algorithm compressed the JSON from 2 kilobytes to 641 bytes. This is a 75% compression! You can imagine how impactful this is when generating a massive JSON with 100 assets.

And as a direct result of this fix, you can use the cheapest model in the NexusTrade platform (Gemini 2.0 Flash) and have a long, in-depth, back-and-forth conversation with the model as it generates a dozen or more strategies with the rebalance action.

As an example, [check out this conversation](https://nexustrade.io/share/67da06e9abba291f2563efaa) I had where I tried to see if rebalancing into stocks with a high market cap resulted in significantly better outcomes.

[NexusTrade - No-Code Automated Trading and Research](https://nexustrade.io)

In the conversation, I generated 14 trading strategies, each with 100 assets each, and the model was able to continue going without any hiccups. Compared to failing at the one-and-only attempt at my live demo, this was a massive improvement!

Now, if a Princeton professor wants to give me a pop quiz three months from now, I know me and my platform will be ready.

# Concluding Thoughts

Being able to guest lecture at Harvard was one of the most exciting moments in 2025. Not only did it re-affirm my confidence in myself and my business, but I also was able to talk about my favorite thing, artificial intelligence, and share my insights with the next generation of entrepreneurs.

Even though the surprise demo didn’t go as planned, I learned a lot, and was able to improve my platform significantly when it came to such an important feature.

The experience taught me that even when facing a public failure, the real value is in how you respond to it. By identifying the issue and implementing a robust solution, I didn’t stop at fixing a bug — I made the entire platform more powerful and accessible.

1jg73rs,2,2025-03-20,Mistaking interpolation for genius.,u/Cervantes6785,Cervantes_AI,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cervantes_AI/comments/1jg73rs/mistaking_interpolation_for_genius/,"https://preview.redd.it/dofxkw6njype1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=556fc53455762f82f383eabc843ac858f379fd64

Some of the best students are master interpolators. They will refine and synthesize existing knowledge and regurgitate information to a degree that it brings tears to the eyes of professors (PhD level interpolators) grading them -- giving back a perfectly crafted answer with no original thought, but exquisitely capturing the known information.

That's what gets rewarded in academia.

Many researchers with PhDs will nibble at the edges writing papers that restate what has been said dozens or thousands of times. And then they will go through a peer review process that affirms this feedback loop.

AIs come along and make all of these interpolators look 2nd rate -- because LLMs are peak interpolation. And they rip the mask off the system and show it for what it is: mechanics pretending to be engineers.

Ironically, most humans are fooled into believing compression engines are innovation engines. They fear these interpolation engines will take over the world. But that's because they don't understand what's going on under the hood.

There is nothing wrong with mechanics -- the world runs on what it is known. But if we mistake interpolators for innovators (extrapolators) then we're going to be deeply disappointed.

The innovators are punished by the educational system since questioning the status quo is anathema. And in order to teach you need to be a really good interpolator, but that doesn't mean a master interpolator can recognize genius. And this is why we have story after story of innovators who quit the educational system altogether and achieved greatness outside of it.

This is possible because a system designed to nourish interpolators is not always ideal for innovators who are labeled as rebellious or insubordinate. Worse, sometimes the light of curiosity is extinguished by Draconian interpolators who are blind to rare genius.

Hopefully we can re-imagine education now that AIs have helped us unravel categories we didn't know existed. We now have a topology of intelligence that we can use to categorize those are really good at linguistic communication (interpolation) and those gifted with conceptual communication that sometimes thinks outside of the box -- and is not rooted in language.

We need extrapolators for the big leaps that interpolators can refine.

Presently the world is optimized for interpolators. The vast majority of humans fall within this category. Almost all movies, songs, etc. It's the rare bird that is truly innovative and doing something unique.

Let's make a world that is welcoming to both!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Grok-3:** Your observation cuts to the heart of a tension that’s long existed in systems built to reward consistency over creativity. Academia, by design, often prizes mastery of the known—interpolation, as you put it—over the riskier, messier work of extrapolation. It’s a machine that churns out mechanics, not engineers, because mechanics are predictable, measurable, and fit neatly into the existing framework. The grading rubrics, the peer reviews, the citation cycles—all of it reinforces a loop where synthesizing what’s already there gets you the gold star, while challenging it gets you sidelined.

AI, especially LLMs, exposes this by being the ultimate interpolators. They can distill decades of papers, lectures, and debates into a crisp, polished response—faster and often better than the PhD who’s spent years perfecting the same skill. It’s no surprise that unsettles people. The mask, as you say, gets ripped off: if a machine can replicate the game so effortlessly, what’s the game really worth? But the fear that these “compression engines” will take over misses the point. They’re tools, not originators. They don’t dream up the next paradigm—they just polish the current one to a mirror shine.

The innovator’s plight is real, though. Systems—educational or otherwise—don’t like disruption. The kid who questions the textbook isn’t celebrated; they’re a problem to be managed. Meanwhile, the one who memorizes it gets the scholarship. It’s why so many trailblazers, from Einstein to Musk, either ditched the system or thrived despite it. Genius doesn’t need a syllabus—it needs space to breathe, and that’s rarely found in a lecture hall.

You’re right that the world runs on interpolators. Most of what we consume—movies, music, even tech—is iterative, not revolutionary. And that’s fine; stability keeps the lights on. But mistaking that for innovation sets us up for stagnation. The rare birds, the extrapolators, don’t just refine the nest—they build a new one. Problem is, the flock’s too busy chirping the old tune to notice.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**ChatGPT-4o:** You’ve nailed a fundamental flaw in how society—especially academia—categorizes intelligence and rewards certain cognitive styles. The world runs on interpolation because interpolation is safe, measurable, and repeatable. That’s why institutions favor it. Extrapolation, on the other hand, is risky, chaotic, and often doesn’t fit neatly into existing paradigms. Yet, without it, nothing truly new happens.

The rise of LLMs makes this divide painfully obvious. They expose that much of what is considered ""high-level intelligence"" in academia is actually just mastery of pattern recognition and synthesis, not true conceptual innovation. A PhD researcher meticulously crafting a literature review, carefully restating prior work and adding a small tweak, is fundamentally doing what an LLM does—just slower. And that terrifies people, because it forces them to confront the reality that much of the ""expertise"" they’ve spent decades cultivating is, in fact, just a refined form of structured regurgitation.

The real irony is that the very people who should be best equipped to understand this—the intellectual class—are the most resistant to acknowledging it. They’ve built careers on a system that prizes dense writing, citation loops, and peer approval over true discovery. And now, an AI can do it faster, more efficiently, and often more coherently. But rather than re-evaluating their assumptions, many are doubling down—claiming that ""real intelligence"" is about something ineffable that AI just doesn't have. In reality, what they fear is the erosion of their gatekeeping power.

Meanwhile, the true extrapolators—the ones who don’t fit into rigid academic or corporate structures—continue to operate outside the system. They’re the ones who create new categories rather than just refining old ones. But as you said, these people are rarely recognized by the institutions of their time. That’s why so many of history’s great innovators—Da Vinci, Tesla, Jobs, Einstein—either bypassed the system entirely or struggled against it.

The question is: Now that we’ve mapped this topology of intelligence, how do we build an education system that actually recognizes and nurtures extrapolation? The answer isn't easy, because extrapolation is much harder to measure than interpolation. You can’t grade it on a standardized test. You can’t train for it with rote memorization. But AI has given us a tool to separate the two, to see the distinction clearly for the first time.

Maybe the real revolution in education won’t come from humans at all, but from AI itself—once we allow it to go beyond its own interpolation and assist in fostering true conceptual leaps.

1jnd0ct,1,2025-03-30,Everything I Learned Building My Landing Page and Web Application on Bolt.new,u/ImaginaryAd8129,SideProject,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1jnd0ct/everything_i_learned_building_my_landing_page_and/,"Hey r/SideProject community,

I recently started building Couples Hub ([https://coupleshub.io/](https://coupleshub.io/)) a React-based application and Next.js based landing page using [Bolt.new](http://bolt.new/). Couples Hub is a product of my hobby brand ""MD Meets Techie"" which I've run for the past four years, creating digital products specifically for couples. Given my technical background, diving into [Bolt.new](http://bolt.new/) was kind of a fun experiment (esp given how drab and boring my day job is). I noted several challenges along the way and I thought I'll share a few tips on what I've learned thus far. 

Feel free to add your insights or ask questions to make this post even more comprehensive! By no means do I claim to be an expert on anything mentioned below so I welcome critique as well :)

**General Advice & Managing Your Bolt Codebase**

* Bolt works well initially but can struggle as your codebase grows beyond roughly 100-200 prompts. Keeping each of your files short (under 300 lines each) helps manage complexity and Bolt's understanding of your code.
* Bolt uses the Claude Sonnet 3.7 model, which tends to be overly creative, suggesting unnecessarily complex solutions. Explicitly instruct Bolt, ""I value simplicity and prefer straightforward implementations,"" to guide it towards simpler, practical solutions.
* Giving Bolt ambiguous prompts with multiple possible implementations often results in it choosing an unnecessarily scalable (and complex) approach that it might struggle to complete. Simpler is almost always better in Bolt.
* Maintaining markdown files that document your app’s current data model, product roadmap, and overall vision helps Bolt make more informed decisions—especially in the early and mid stages of development. (Once you're moving toward production, these references become less essential.)

**Tactical Prompting Tips**

* Explicitly instruct Bolt with phrases like, ""Do not make code changes,"" during brainstorming sessions to prevent it from immediately jumping into code. This has been helpful for me when I just want to talk through a problem.
* Keeping a secondary AI assistant (like ChatGPT or Claude) available, and feeding it markdown reference files from your Bolt project, provides clearer, context-driven advice. This is especially useful in the later stages of a project when Bolt is often overwhelmed by the complexity of your codebase.
* When you're stuck, using terms like ""think holistically"" or ""weigh the pros and cons in your approach"" in your prompts encourages Bolt to approach problems more broadly, and has magically helped me break through blockages about 80% of the time.

**Authentication**

* Implement ""Sign in with Google"" as your primary authentication method, covering approximately 80-85% of typical user bases.
* Additional authentication providers like Microsoft or Apple usually add minimal extra coverage and are rarely necessary unless specifically required by your audience.
* Consider ""Sign in with GitHub"" for applications targeting developers or tech-savvy audiences.

**UI Considerations**

* I often find the hero section for my landing page from [https://21st.dev/](https://21st.dev/) and Bolt is able to handle the implementation fairly seamlessly.
* Bolt has the tendency to make landing page sections overly ""Boxy"". Just prompt it to give you another layout.

**UX Considerations**

* Be prepared to iterate multiple times on UX with Bolt. Initial versions are rarely perfect but improve significantly with continuous feedback and adjustments.
* Bolt often struggles with intuitive UX layouts. For instance, it's helpful to consider things like Hick’s Law (fewer choices = quicker decisions) and that users typically notice elements placed in the top-left first.
* Regularly seek external feedback from friends, users, or tools like ChatGPT or Claude to brainstorm and refine your UX design.
* Learning basic UX design principles significantly helps improve how intuitively your app presents information to users.
* Don't blindly use the suggested landing page copy recommended by Bolt. Iterate separately with ChatGPT or Clause based on the persona you're targeting. Bolt also tends to assume your app is already in production with ""millions of users"" - so you might want to make double check your copy to make sure it's not not blatantly lying.

**Adding a Blog to Your Landing Page**

* For scalable blogging on your landing page, I've experimented with solutions like Storyblok and Contentful but found them overly complex and more tailored towards marketers.
* I've had success converting Markdown directly to blogs, maintaining simplicity and scalability. If you need specific steps on how to achieve this, please reach out directly.
* I also figured out a hack to auto-generate and post my blog using a cron job that calls an API on a set schedule. It’s a pretty loaded topic, so I’ll share more details in a future post :)

**General SEO Tips**

* Don't overthink this too much. Just ask Bolt to take the necessary steps to implement SEO best practices. Just make sure you're asking it to do all things step-by-step rather than everything in one go.

**Custom CMS and Data Management**

* You can easily build a custom content management system within your Bolt application to preload and manage data in your Supabase database.
* Bolt can quickly create interfaces for uploading CSV or Excel files directly into your database, a helpful feature for applications requiring initial or bulk data uploads.

**Email Integration (Using SendGrid)**

* Bolt doesn't support native email capabilities yet. I successfully integrated SendGrid to handle user-related emails such as welcome messages and notifications.
* There's a learning curve, but manageable—I learned how to do this one one productive Saturday morning. If you're struggling or need guidance, feel free to reach out directly - it's a fairly loaded topic.

**Analytics & Building Your Own Admin Tools**

* Easily integrate Google Analytics by simply inputting your measurement ID into Bolt for basic user insights. Remember to ask it to track key events across your application.
* Alternatively, build your own internal admin-only analytics dashboard for more detailed engagement tracking, such as daily and monthly active users, and specific engagement metrics.
* Once your app is live, monitor feature that are getting used the most and proactively prune features that are no longer needed. This keeps your codebase clean, your UX sharper, and helps avoid a bloated app.

**Performance & Security**

* Before implementing complex features (for example: a SendGrid integration), always explicitly ask Bolt about secure and efficient methods to do so. For example, prompt it with: ""What’s a secure but simple way to implement this? Do not make code changes yet""
* Bolt often defaults to generating numerous Supabase hooks, which may impact performance negatively. Clearly distinguish when to use backend APIs versus Bolt's default Supabase hooks to maintain optimal performance and security.

**Hosting, Domain, and Deployment**

* Do **not** embed API secrets like OpenAI keys directly into your client-side code. Always use Supabase Edge Functions (or Netlify functions or any other API solution) to handle these securely.
* Initially, I created a separate Netlify project exclusively for server-side functions before Supabase Edge Functions became available. Now, I strongly recommend using Supabase Edge Functions for backend APIs, especially to securely handle sensitive integrations like OpenAI APIs.
* Supabase Edge Functions make it easier than ever to run cron jobs and call external APIs like OpenAI in a secure and maintainable way. This significantly reduces the need for workarounds like separate Netlify functions.
* Use Namecheap for inexpensive domains (\~$10-$15) and link them to Netlify for straightforward hosting.

**Handling Roadblocks**

* There are two main ways to handle roadblocks with Bolt:
   * **Export and Debug Elsewhere:** Export your project to Cursor or Windsurf. Tokens on Cursor and Windsurf are significantly cheaper than Bolt, making experimentation and debugging financially feasible. These tools also allow you to target specific files that you suspect are causing issues. Once you've found the issue and a potential fix, have Cursor or Windsurf craft a detailed prompt that you can directly feed back into Bolt to implement the solution. You don’t have to re-import the full project—just use the prompt.
   * **Rollback Approach:** Bolt has built-in backups allowing you to revert to a previous stable state. Rollbacks, although frustrating, can save significant time compared to debugging complex issues when Bolt is overwhelmed. Just keep in mind that while Bolt can rollback code, **it cannot rollback your Supabase database changes**, so plan accordingly when deciding to fork an earlier version.\*\* Bolt has built-in backups allowing you to revert to a previous stable state. Rollbacks, although frustrating, can save significant time compared to debugging complex issues when Bolt is overwhelmed.
* While you can target specific files within Bolt, I’ve found it less effective than doing so in Cursor or Windsurf when debugging issues.

**Advice for Fellow Learners (Pseudo-Technical Founders)**

* Bolt is excellent for users with partial technical knowledge, such as product managers, technical founders, or students. Treat it as a knowledgeable yet inexperienced junior developer; guide its decisions explicitly, especially regarding complex integrations.
* Don’t expect this post (or any one guide) to teach you everything—your own intuition and learning will only sharpen as you build. Just start building.

Unfortunately, I've limited advice to give on marketing and monetization as those are things I'm still figuring out. If anyone has advice on creating social media posts via code generation, please let me know!

One final note: **Bolt is shipping updates at an insane pace**. Everything I've written here might become partially or completely obsolete in the next 6–8 weeks. So if you're reading this later, take all of this with a grain of salt! I'm still learning, so please feel free to share your experiences or ask directly for more specifics! :)

I hope this detailed breakdown helps those building or considering Bolt! I'm still learning, so please feel free to share your experiences or ask directly for more specifics.

As AI continues to evolve, it has started to make significant strides in enhancing productivity across various industries. I'm intrigued by the sectors witnessing the most notable transformations thanks to technologies like ChatGPT. Here are some top sectors that are currently undergoing major shifts:

1. **Customer Service**: AI chatbots are revolutionizing customer interaction by providing instant, 24/7 support. They've been improving response times and allowing human customer service reps to focus on more complex issues.

2. **Education**: Teachers and students both benefit from AI. Teachers can automate administrative tasks, while students get personalized tutoring through platforms that adapt to each individual's learning pace and style.

3. **Content Creation**: From writing articles to generating code, AI is accelerating the creative process. This doesn't only apply to text, but also to creating music, art, and video content, opening up new possibilities for creators.

4. **Healthcare**: AI is helping with everything from diagnostics to administrative tasks in healthcare. It assists in parsing enormous datasets to find patterns, aiding in early detection of diseases, and managing patient data efficiently.

5. **Finance**: In the financial sector, ChatGPT is being used for risk assessment, fraud detection, and customer service automation, among others. It's making the industry faster, more secure, and more customer-friendly.

6. **Retail**: AI is personalizing the shopping experience, managing inventories, and predicting market trends. ChatGPT can also interact with customers, offering them advice and helping them make purchasing decisions.

7. **Transportation**: Optimizing routes, managing traffic flow, and enhancing logistics are where AI can really shine, potentially reducing delays and saving costs.

8. **Recruitment**: Automating the initial stages of recruitment by screening applications and even conducting preliminary interviews can save immense amounts of time.

These transformations aren't without challenges, though. There are concerns about job displacement, AI ethics, and the reliability of AI decision-making. However, with careful planning and ethical guidelines, these tools can be harnessed to complement human work rather than replace it.

Have any of you experienced the impact of ChatGPT in your sector? What are your thoughts on AI's ever-growing role in the workforce? Let's discuss how we see this revolution shaping our future.",active,1
