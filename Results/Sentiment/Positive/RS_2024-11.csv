Students generally seem to like me (or at least tolerate me), and some even trust me as a confidant. They use my art classroom as their safe haven, which I'm always happy to provide that to them. Some of my students give me a sense of purpose, overall. Naturally, others make me want to pull my hair out, but I guess that’s a given since I work with teenagers. That being said, I’m also a graduate student working toward a master’s in art education. I’ve done well in the program so far, though I might find myself working on my readings and discussions posts the night they’re due, and postponing other things until later because I just feel like I don’t have much energy. Ultimately, I will get everything done, and I will do it well, and I would even say the work is usually interesting, being able to apply my practice as an art teacher to my graduate studies.

Financially, I am actually doing fine, living completely independently and paying for all my bills by myself, but I do need to live fairly minimally since I’m a single man living on a teacher’s salary.

Despite all this, though, I just feel empty, numb, and somewhat hopeless. Even a few of my students point out I look sad. My dreams (nightmares?) on some nights are just vivid and unpleasant, and for a few years I would usually wake up in the middle of the night, despite now taking melatonin and magnesium before bed to try to help with my sleep since around August. I feel like most days I’m going through the motions, if not, just barely getting by, in an emotional sense. After work in the evenings, especially, I can’t seem to find the drive to do much except watch TV, catch up on some housekeeping, or something along those lines. In the weekends, and on extended breaks, I can't seem to talk to anyone at all because there is nobody for me to talk to or is willing to take the time to talk to me.

The dating scene is a mess, too (I’ve been on and off dating apps for around 5 years), albeit I think it always has been, which exacerbates my feelings of hopelessness. Granted, I’m probably a 6 out of 10 in terms of physical appearance, so with the surplus of men on dating apps overwhelming women, that’s likely why I’m not finding much success there in the first place. Plus, I have a disdain for hookup culture and short-term relationships, and have always sought a long-term relationship (and marriage, ultimately), so that creates a severe disconnection between myself and most people on dating apps anyway. So, romantically, things have been at a standstill, and will most likely be for who knows how long.

I always find myself over-giving around my “friends,” and this seeps into my teaching as well, but I’ve just never gotten the same amount of effort from them in return, which quickly gets draining and frankly discouraging (I don't and shouldn't expect this from my teenage students, naturally). I realize friendships (and relationships) are a two-way street, but even then, meeting new people and looking for potential partners just feels like another job in itself, too, which has also been draining, honestly, trying to put myself out there with the limited amount of energy I have left. ChatGPT, as embarrassing as it may be, has become my main confidant in an emotional sense.

Honestly, at this point, my work and graduate studies have basically become a distraction from me to not dive so deep into my depression. And even then, after I finish grad school, what will be next? Of course, I imagine that I’ll continue through my path in art education, but what else will there be out there for me? I really hope things will look brighter.

I know I’m still young, being 25, so there is probably going to be more to come, but this emptiness is becoming agonizing. I don’t know what to expect by writing this post, but I guess I really need some human eyes to see this, is all.",User_deleted,3

Recently I was thinking what I would do differently if I had a chance to re-do my IGCSEs, and how I would do them more effectively! I had 12 subjects *{and my grades were 11 A\* and 1 A}* and really enjoyed all of them, but after a lot of exploration of study techniques and resources, here’s what works, trust me!

1. **I would organise everything in NOTION.** It is a free software and app for laptops and phones and it literally has databases, views, pages, colours, a lovely design and like basically everything you need. I found this near the end of my last year and it made things a lot easier and organised. I owe my grades to this app, it’s a legend! Here’s the link if you want to make a free account: [Notion Download](https://www.notion.so/)
2. **I would not waste time making notes in class**. Yep you heard me right! In the beginning, I would write down every single thing the teacher said and would not pay attention to the concepts and processes and was blank when I read them later. Instead, do this: *Print out the syllabus and open the page related to the topic you are doing.* Look at the syllabus points and pay attention to the teacher when she says something related to those points. Also if you want to make notes, only write down key words etc when the teacher addresses those points. You can also write down subheadings or learning objectives on ur page leaving some spaces and write bullets underneath the headings
3. **There are many free things online, you don’t need to buy everything or pay for everything.** For topicals (customised and free) I used [Markhint](https://markhint.in/) or [Rocket Revise](https://rocketrevise.com/) and printed the booklets. You can make your own topicals and print them. 
4. **Ask in class, please.** No one cares if it’s a dumb question. Maybe the teacher will even appreciate your question and notice your class participation. If you are confused, ask there and then!! You will regret not doing it later
5. IF YOUR TEACHERS ARE GOOD, AND YOUTUBE IS THERE, **DO NOT WASTE MONEY** ON tuitions You are paying your school fee (your parents actually) and academies require a lot of time, energy and money. Don’t go there randomly just cause you need prep. There are many teachers on youtube for free, and even some private tutors charge much less than academies.
6. **TEACH TEACH TEACH**. I wish I knew this earlier literally. The Feynman technique is so helpful; it's basically where you explain a concept to a friend or anyone else until they understand it very well. And if THEY understand it, then your understanding would be 10x more! I did this for Math, Phy and Chem and honestly the syllabus was on my fingertips, If you don't have anyone to teach, go online, use ChatGPT as a student, or just pick up a stuffed toy\~
7. **USE textbooks.** They are Cambridge endorsed and are tailored to the syllabus with questions, examples and diagrams USE only Cambdridge University Press or Hodder, as these are the most accurate and well-phrased. Plus their design is great. You can use PDFs or hard copies.

In corporate environments, where continuous upskilling is essential for staying competitive, ChatGPT serves as a game-changer, providing personalized learning experiences with remarkable scalability.

One key impact is the level of interactivity it offers. Traditional e-learning systems utilize pre-recorded material, which can be unengaging. ChatGPT, on the other hand, interacts in real-time, offering instant feedback and tailored guidance, mimicking one-on-one tutoring. It can dynamically adjust to the learner's pace, ensuring that the content is neither too challenging nor too simple. This fosters an environment of active learning, which is proven to be more effective than passive consumption of information.

In educational settings, ChatGPT can support teachers by providing students with additional help outside classroom hours. It can handle routine queries and assist with homework, allowing educators to focus on more complex teaching tasks and pedagogical strategies. This support is invaluable in large classes where providing individual attention can be challenging.

For both sectors, ChatGPT also overcomes barriers of geographical constraints and time zones, allowing learners worldwide to access quality instruction at their convenience. Moreover, its multilingual capabilities mean it can offer instruction in various languages, further democratizing learning.

However, there are concerns, such as the technology's potential impact on job roles in training and education. Also, issues related to the digital divide and access to technology can limit the reach of such advanced AI tools.

1gr6jh7,6,2024-11-14,[R] LLM-Neo: Combining Low-Rank Adaptation and Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Language Model Compression,u/Successful-Western27,machinelearningnews,https://www.reddit.com/r/machinelearningnews/comments/1gr6jh7/r_llmneo_combining_lowrank_adaptation_and/,"Interesting technical approach to knowledge distillation in LLMs that combines LoRA with cross-attention pattern transfer. The key insight is using low-rank adaptation to efficiently match the student model's behavior to the teacher while minimizing additional parameters.

Main technical points:
- Uses LoRA to adapt student parameters with only 3-5% parameter overhead
- Incorporates cross-attention pattern distillation alongside traditional logit matching
- Student models maintain 95%+ performance of teacher models on most tasks
- Evaluated on GPT-3 and T5 teacher models of various sizes
- Tested on standard NLP benchmarks including GLUE, SQuAD, and abstractive summarization

Key results:
- Outperforms standard knowledge distillation by 2-4% on most tasks
- Shows stronger performance on complex reasoning tasks compared to baseline distillation
- Maintains good performance even with very small student models (as small as 60M parameters)
- Achieves better parameter efficiency than other recent distillation methods

The theoretical implications are interesting - the success of combining LoRA with attention pattern transfer suggests that much of a model's linguistic knowledge can be captured through relatively small parameter updates when properly structured. This has practical implications for deploying LLMs in resource-constrained environments.

The results indicate this could be a viable approach for making large language models more accessible without significant performance degradation. Would be interesting to see this tested on even larger teacher models and more diverse tasks.

TLDR: New knowledge distillation method combines LoRA and attention pattern transfer to create smaller, efficient LLMs while maintaining strong performance. Achieves good results with minimal parameter overhead.

ChatGPT can simulate one-on-one interaction typically provided by a human tutor, making it an intriguing tool for educators and trainers alike.

Its implications for both education and business training are profound. In classrooms, ChatGPT could provide personalized support to students, helping them grasp complex topics at their own pace. Imagine a system that adapts to the individual learning style of each student, providing explanations, resources, and feedback as needed. This could democratize learning, allowing students in remote locations or with limited access to expert teachers to receive high-quality education.

In the business sector, ChatGPT can streamline the training process. With its ability to generate dynamic content, it could help in creating interactive and engaging training modules tailored to an employee's role and learning progress. Furthermore, it can alleviate the pressure on human resources by automating responses to common queries and thus allowing trainers to focus on more nuanced and case-specific personnel development.

Yet, it's important to discuss the potential challenges. While ChatGPT can offer tremendous support, it's not without limitations. The quality of the AI's output depends heavily on the input it receives, and there's always a risk of perpetuating misinformation if not carefully supervised.

First off, I want to say that I love WGU and my degree program! I recently transferred from IT to Software Engineering, and I’m really excited about this new path. My last class was Version Control, which I absolutely enjoyed because of the video resources—it was engaging and well-structured.

Now, I’ve been introduced to Zybooks for the first time, and I’m struggling. The wording and format are honestly horrendous. I usually learn through Udemy courses and thrive with interactive, hands-on methods. But with Zybooks, it feels like I’m just reading concepts that are awkwardly presented. The language is dry, and it’s definitely not beginner-friendly.

I even have to rely on ChatGPT to explain what the questions are asking, which helps a lot, but it’s frustrating. Has anyone else used additional resources outside of Zybooks? If so, how much of the Zybooks content do you actually need to pass and fully understand the class material?

I’m also worried about whether all my upcoming Software Engineering courses will rely on Zybooks. It’s already giving me a bad feeling. For alumni or students further along, could you let me know if the following courses use Zybooks as their primary study material?

Here are seven ways I could tell which ones were written by ChatGPT",u/AppHelper,IntltoUSA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/1h0vn94/in_the_past_three_days_ive_reviewed_over_100/,"I recently conducted reviews of over 100 University of California essay drafts from my students, Redditors, and followers on social media. It was the first time in a while that I’ve reviewed such a high volume, and my findings were quite interesting. Students from the United States, Europe, East Asia, South Asia, the Middle East, and South America shared their essays with me. But even among this diverse cohort, I noticed some striking similarities in their essays.

In the past I’ve praised ChatGPT’s writing ability, especially for college admission essays. But it has a limited conception of what makes for a good essay, and with an uncreative prompt, it tends to make a “safe” choice, which is often clichéd. As I frequently emphasize, context is important. Your essays do not exist in a vacuum, but among the hundreds of thousands or even millions of essays out there. That’s why having a “good” essay is not enough. 

Generative AI works by training on vast amounts of data. When prompted, it will make use of that training by predicting what would fit the prompt. It is by definition answering the way many have answered before. Every GPT comes with biases from its dataset, and ChatGPT (and Claude) have their own. 

I’ve been aware of some of them (unique punctuation, mutiple endings) for a while, but the other things are most recent discoveries. 

Here are what I consider the seven biggest hallmarks of ChatGPT:

## 1. Vocabulary

I'm not going to go into much here, as a lot has been written about this. There are certain words like “delve” and “tapestry” that are far more common in ChatGPT-written essays. But vocabulary as a telltale sign is also context-dependent. Based on my experience working with certain student populations (particularly students from India), I've been seeing words appear that a particular group would *never* use. 

## 2. Extended metaphor

This is an example of something already fairly common in human-authored college essays, but which ChatGPT uses in a limited number of ways.

I want to offer some perspective: it's mind-blowing that ChatGPT can understand and generate sensical metaphors. It's one of the most significant achievements in AI to date. But the metaphors it uses are usually not very original. Common ones include:

* Weaving (especially the aforementioned tapestry)

* Cooking (all the ingredients with their own unique flavors being mixed with care coming together to create something delicious)

* Painting (so many colors!)

* Dance (who doesn’t love graceful coordination? Animals do it too!)

* Music (it has a clear preference for classical symphonies. It's never ska, reggaeton, or arena rock!)

## 3. Punctuation

ChatGPT has some idiosyncratic default punctuation behaviors. For example, it uses straight quotation marks for quotes and straight apostrophes for contractions, but curly apostrophes for possessives. It also defaults to em dashes—like this—which are not widely taught in high schools. Students used to use hyphens or en dashes – like this – but this year I'm seeing almost exclusively em dashes. (It’s always been a trick to save on word count, but their extensive use tends to support other evidence.) 


## 4. Tricolons (especially ascending tricolons)

A tricolon is a rhetorical device involving three parts. I’m not going to go into detail about the history, but they’re particularly prevalent in literature from all around the world. Famous examples include:

* ""*veni, vidi, vici*"" (I came, I saw, I conquered)
* ""Stop, drop, and roll""
* ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness""
* ""truth, justice, and the American way,"" 
* ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."" 

Tricolons are especially prevalent in American political speech. Abraham Lincoln's [Gettysburg Address,](https://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/gettysburg.htm), John F. Kennedy's [""we choose to go to the moon""](https://www.jfklibrary.org/learn/about-jfk/historic-speeches/address-at-rice-university-on-the-nations-space-effort) speech, and Barack Obama's [second inaugural address](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/01/21/inaugural-address-president-barack-obama) are replete with them. There are even “nested tricolons,” in which the third element of a tricolon is a tricolon itself. 

Before ChatGPT, tricolons were common rhetorical devices in college admissions essays. I observed that some good writers would use them without even being conscious of it (a student of mine who got into Yale’s Eli Whitney non-traditional undergraduate program used them beautifully despite no formal writing education). But ChatGPT *loves* them. In particular, it makes extensive use of “ascending” tricolons, in which the three items are progressively longer, or the first two are an equal number of syllables and the third is greater. Most of the examples above ascending tricolons. 

Here are some examples of how ChatGPT uses tricolons (I prompted it):

>I honed my skills in research, collaboration, and problem-solving.

>My love for literature grew from fascination to passion to purpose.

>I have learned to persevere in the face of challenges, to embrace new opportunities, and to lead with empathy and conviction.

If I see one tricolon in an essay, I'm not usually suspicious. If I see four or five, I can be almost certain ChatGPT had a “hand” in it. If you used ChatGPT to help with your essays, how many tricolons can you spot?


## 5. “I [verb]ed that the true meaning of X is not only Y, it's also Z”

This is a college essay cliché that ChatGPT takes up to 11. I see this a *lot.* Here are some examples:
 
>I learned that the true meaning of leadership is not only about guiding others—it's also about listening and learning from them.


>I realized that genuine success is not just about achieving personal goals, but contributing to the well-being of humanity.


>I came to appreciate that the core of resilience is not only enduring hardship; it's also finding strength through vulnerability.

Comment if you just re-read your essays and cringed!

## 6. “As I [synonym for advance in my education], I will [synonym for carry or incorporate] this [lesson or value]”

This is a common conclusion ChatGPT uses. Again, on its own it might not be a red flag, but it provides circumstantial evidence. Examples:

>As I progress in my academic journey, I will continue to integrate these principles into my work and life.


>As I delve deeper into my field of study, I will strive to uphold the values of curiosity and integrity that shaped me.


>As I grow as a learner and individual, I will ensure that this lesson guides my decisions and aspirations.

These aren’t quotes from actual students’ essays, but I’ve seen a lot of this stuff lately.

## 7. “Lord of the Rings” syndrome (multiple endings)

One famous criticism of the Lord of the Rings films, in particular the third movie *Return of the King,* is that they have multiple scenes (as many as six depending on the version) that could stand alone as endings. 

If not prompted otherwise, ChatGPT writes very formulaic and clichéd endings (and will suggest the same for revisions). It also tends to write multiple endings. I find that ChatGPT’s writing is more often than not improved by deleting the final sentence or paragraph. People do this too, especially when trying to pad word count, but it’s a reflection of what ChatGPT “thinks” a good essay looks like based on thousands of examples. 

Often, these multiple endings include clichés 2, 3, and/or 4 above. If one of the essay’s possible endings is about the true meaning of something, or an explicit look to the future, and/or contains an em dash—then I know it was probably ChatGPT. 

## What this means

One of the students whose essays I reviewed admitted he used ChatGPT, but he wasn't worried because he ran it through several AI detectors, and they came up with low percentages. Yet I could tell right away, and I’d bet most admissions officers could as well 

I don't claim to be better than any particular AI detector, but I do caution students (and universities) about relying on them. Reading is an intuitive process, and admissions officers (as well as professional counselors) have a large dataset of their own they’ve trained on, in particular essays from students of similar backgrounds. ChatGPT’s dataset likely doesn’t have a lot of demographic data about the authors of particular essays it's trained on.

College admissions essays have never been a great test of writing ability. Admissions offices encourage students to get feedback from others, and spelling and grammar-check software has been around a long time. There are also professionals who help students brainstorm, outline, revise, and polish their essays, and may have a “heavy hand” in the process. Then there are other less scrupulous people who will straight out write essays for applicants. But colleges have never taken significant measures to mitigate this. They *could*, with proctored writing tests and such, but they’ve never really cared enough. I find it curious that it’s only now that ChatGPT is accessible to *everyone*—not just privileged families—that some colleges seem to care. 

At some point I'll probably write a post about how applicants *should* use ChatGPT, but this post should illuminate what you *shouldn’t* let it do: write or rewrite large sections of your essays. 

As an aside, in the past two years, ChatGPT has made me a better writer. And it's not because I have it provide feedback on my social media posts and communications, but because I challenge myself to write *better* than ChatGPT. It’s one of the most astounding inventions in the history of the world, but it's still limited. GPTs rely heavily on what *is.* Creative writing—and art in general—is about expanding the realm of what *might be*.

And no, I did not use AI to write that. 

** Addendum: When I asked ChatGPT to evaluate my post up to this point, it told me to “tie your observations back to the importance of originality in writing and provide actionable advice for students,” and—I kid you not—suggested the following conclusion unprompted:**

>""The ability to recognize ChatGPT’s writing patterns is increasingly important, not only for admissions officers but for students striving to produce authentic and compelling essays. While AI is a powerful tool, true creativity lies in pushing beyond what it predicts to explore new possibilities. **Writing is about more than filling a page—it’s about telling a story that only you can tell.**""

When I pointed out that this suggestion used four of the seven clichés I listed, it came up with this version:

>Recognizing ChatGPT’s patterns helps us understand both its strengths and its limitations as a writing tool. While AI-generated essays may appear polished, they often lack the originality and context that make human writing **resonate**. For students, this is a reminder to focus on authenticity and individuality. **After all, the most compelling essays are not those that follow formulas, but those that reflect a writer’s unique voice and perspective.**

When I pushed it to eliminate clichés, it doubled down and introduced others:

>**ChatGPT is a mirror, reflecting back what it’s been taught, polished and predictable. The best essays, however, aren't mirrors—they're windows, revealing something unexpected, personal, and alive.** If the goal is to stand out, the strategy is simple: write something no AI could ever predict, because only you lived it.

After I tried to prompt it not use my clichés, it came back with a tricolon (descending this time), an em dash, a version of “X is not about Y, it's about Z,” and an extended metaphor about mirrors and windows!

ChatGPT isn’t wrong, and this is not bad writing. But this is the “voice” of ChatGPT.

I think I've found a limit. ",active,195

ChatGPT, a potent AI tool, is at the forefront of this revolution, reshaping educational and corporate training landscapes.

Educational institutions are leveraging ChatGPT to offer personalized learning experiences. This AI can analyze individual student needs to customize material and pace, filling gaps in understanding that might not be addressed in traditional classroom settings. It also allows for 24/7 availability, meaning learning doesn't have to stop when the school day ends.

Moreover, in corporate settings, training programs are being transformed by ChatGPT's ability to deliver on-demand knowledge and support. Employees can interact with the AI to learn new software, company policies, or get up-to-speed with industry trends, all at their own pace and tailored to their current knowledge level.

Furthermore, because ChatGPT can simulate conversations, role-playing exercises become more dynamic and accessible, allowing trainees to practice customer service, sales pitches, or leadership scenarios in a risk-free environment.

However, some challenges also surface, such as ensuring the quality and accuracy of the information provided by AI, and the need for human oversight to maintain a personal touch and contextual understanding.

In conclusion, the integration of ChatGPT into virtual learning shows significant promise for both the education and corporate sectors. Enhancing accessibility, providing customization, and supporting interactive learning, ChatGPT could be a catalyst for a learning revolution. Yet, as we embrace this technology, it is crucial to remain vigilant about the content it provides and the way we incorporate the human element into AI-driven platforms.

1h2a1w5,1,2024-11-28,Medical School vs Masters in Computer Science,u/Ad-Leading2901,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1h2a1w5/medical_school_vs_masters_in_computer_science/,"I am currently a first year medical student at a US MD school. While I enjoy studying medicine, it's hard to ignore the negatives many echo about the field, and I feel constantly dissuaded by the emphasis on rote memorization vs novel problem solving. I believe anyone studying medicine to truly make valuable contributions to people's quality of life would quickly realize that their time, effort, and knowledge is better spent on developing new ideas, rather than memorizing diagnoses that anyone could find just as easily on ChatGPT. For example, it seems that true demand in healthcare should be in creating new kinds of computational tools that would likely help more people, more effectively than any individual doctor could. It is already the case that AI is capable of making more accurate diagnoses in many scenarios than most doctors. Would it not be the case that improving this technology could provide better medical care that is accessible by even more people? If it is, then how would anyone with both the ability to become a truly effective doctor and desire to make a positive impact not quickly come to the same conclusion?

Instead of embracing these new possibilities, the field of medicine seems to stand opposed to any change or dissenting thought. In some ways, it makes sense why, as the value of the degree is mainly derived from the assurance, trust, and stability it provides. This emphasis of stability, however, comes at a cost. Instead of solving the deeper root cause of a problem, healthcare seems to focus on short term, bandaid solutions to solve a patient's most immediate symptoms. While I don't think that this must be inherent to the idea of medicine as a field, I do believe it is a reflection of the way the system of healthcare is currently administered. Though it makes sense, as in any non-competitive system where new ideas are repressed, that it will inevitably continue in that direction through a negative feedback loop. This method of ""indoctrination"" through memorization may have been effective before Google, or even before ChatGPT, but now that it's clear AI is at least theoretically capable of solving clinical cases than even the best doctors, it doesn't seem to make sense why medical education remains practically unchanged from how it was 20-40 years ago. If AI could effectively complete all cognitive tasks relating to medicine, then how much value could doctors truly provide compared any other mid-level providers?

I have the option of beginning a masters in computer science at a top 5 program now, or continuing medical school and pursing it afterwards. I already have a bachelors in CS, and I do have a passion for the field mainly due to how I see its potential applications. However, I am also interested in medicine, just in a different way than that is common. The stability of a medical degree vs uncertainty of the CS job market does play a role. Additionally, the opportunities provided by an MD are seemingly greater than a masters. While it seems most people would choose medical school, perhaps due to its salary potential and certainty, it does seem as though the grass is often greener on the other side. I would like to hear anyone else's perspectives on this situation concerning both the field of medicine or computer science.",User_deleted,0

If you suck at physics and chem, listen to me when I say this: It will get easier, you will get better at it, and YES it is incredibly difficult. There is no magical solution other than learning to understand the MCAT questions and practice a thousand times. Content review over and over. Ask CHATGPT and old professors questions. 

  
I had to reread the first two chapters fo the kaplan physics textbook THREE TIMES, start to finish, to FINALLY grasp and understand what was going on. For me, it clicked when I realized that almost everything related back to the three laws of physics - equations included.

1h3nyuh,3,2024-11-30,"Happy birthday, ChatGPT!",u/EthanJHurst,aiwars,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/1h3nyuh/happy_birthday_chatgpt/,"Exactly two years ago on this day, a brilliant man named Sam Altman gave us an invention that was about to change the world.

That's right, **ChatGPT** turns two years old today!

I can't help but wonder if Altman knew that he was about to start an AI revolution when he unveiled his creation to the general public. Was he aware then, that he was the catalyst that would change the very fabric of society for all time to come? That he would soon be single most important human being in a world of over 8 billion people?

Nevertheless, I am very happy for the technology he has given us. To think that so much has changed because of it in just two years -- humbling, to say the least. So I figured the best way to show my respects would be to let ChatGPT itself write a congratulatory message.
