1cimrew,7,2024-05-02,Check for plagiarism in Discussions & Quizzes Q&A,u/Only-Entertainer-992,University,https://www.reddit.com/r/University/comments/1cimrew/check_for_plagiarism_in_discussions_quizzes_qa/,"Hi everyone,

As part of the PlagiarismCheck.org team working on similarity-checking tools, I want to share a new solution for checking Quizzes and Discussions in Canvas. Our team observed many requests, and we see this feature as a much-needed feature to save educators time.

**How can I do that?**

With the Integrito browser extension, you will see the Integrito check button right near each student's answer in Discussions and Quizzes. You literally need one click to get the result!

**What exactly do I get?**

Once you have set the Integrito extension, you will see the plagiarism check result and AI detection result right in Canvas near each student's answer. You'll also have access to a more detailed report with the sources and analysis.

**How does it work?**

Set the extension and check for AI and plagiarism in one click via the “Integrito сheck” button. Click “Open report” for comprehensive analysis. Once the answer is checked, you will see the result every time you open the discussion, so there is no need to recheck it.

**What browsers support Integrito?**

You can download Integrito for Mozilla, Chrome and Edge browsers.

**Cost:** checking for Similarity & AI withdraws pages from your balance in PlagiarismCheck.org. 

Packages start at 5.99$ (20 pages included).

[Contact our team **to get 20 pages for free to give it a try.**](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://plagiarismcheck.org/contact-us/&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1714672518088660&usg=AOvVaw396WSGEsNQ2qadUn53l55j)

But Integrito does not only that. It also works for Google Docs and helps to check for text originality.

To add a little background:

Our team has already worked for 7 years to help educators save time and uphold Academic Integrity.

When OpenAI released ChatGPT, many spheres faced a crucial challenge: How to tell AI-generated text from humans? This question sounded like a call to action for our team, and this is how we came up with our TraceGPT AI detector. We delivered it quite fast, even earlier than our competitors.

When AI detectors started to be everywhere, the questions started emerging: “So how do we know that the checked text is ChatGPT generated?”. We started thinking, “Well, we can’t tell for sure, for the reason that we don’t see the process of its generation. And that’s struck us like, “So why can’t we look at the generation process if we actually can?”. That is how we changed the approach from evaluating the ready text to seeing the process of creating it. So this is how we came with Integrito, which provides one-click Activity report in Google Docs and shows how the text was written, number of words added, time spent, writing sessions, contributors and the possibility to compare text versions. This is how one can see the writing process from a 360-degree perspective and make a decision about its origin.

**Cost:** the report is free.

Honestly, I believe it's a great improvement to the teachers' routine! What do you think? I would gladly answer any questions and would appreciate the feedback!",active,8

In the world of business, efficiency and innovation are king—enter ChatGPT, a game-changer capable of driving productivity to new heights and causing significant shifts across various sectors. 

ChatGPT stands out as a powerful AI tool built upon the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture. Its capacity to understand and generate human-like text has allowed businesses to automate tasks that previously required significant human resources. From drafting emails to generating reports, ChatGPT helps companies save time and focus on more strategic tasks.

One of the most visible impacts is in customer service. Chatbots powered by ChatGPT can handle inquiries 24/7, providing instant support and freeing human agents to tackle more complex issues. This not only boosts productivity but also enhances customer satisfaction.

Beyond customer service, ChatGPT is making waves in content creation and marketing. It's crafting everything from product descriptions to promotional content, enabling marketers to scale their efforts without sacrificing quality. The creative potential of AI is ushering in a new era where ideation and content generation align seamlessly, giving businesses a unique edge in their marketing strategies.

However, the implications extend far beyond these areas. In the legal sector, ChatGPT assists with document reviews and drafting legal documents, a labor-intensive process that can now be done in a fraction of the time.

As we navigate through a digital renaissance in education and corporate training, the role of AI, particularly ChatGPT, is becoming increasingly noteworthy. This intelligent language model has shown remarkable potential in reinventing how we approach learning and development, both in academic settings and within the corporate sphere.

In the realm of virtual learning, ChatGPT has been facilitating personalized education experiences, offering instant feedback to students and serving as a 24/7 virtual tutor. The implications are vast, with the possibility of democratizing access to quality education, regardless of geographical constraints or resource availability. Students, educators, and autonomous learners are leveraging this tool to supplement traditional learning methodologies, leading to a question worth pondering: Can ChatGPT enhance learning outcomes in a significant and measurable way?

In corporate settings, the stakes are different. Training and professional development are key to maintaining a competitive edge, and ChatGPT has the potential to deliver tailored training modules, simulate complex scenarios for problem-solving exercises, and even act as a support system for just-in-time learning and knowledge retention.

But it's not just efficiency we're after; we're after effectiveness. How does the integration of ChatGPT into these learning platforms affect information retention and employee performance? Are we seeing improvements in how quickly new skills are acquired and applied in the workplace? Importantly, is there evidence to suggest that AI-led training can rival, or perhaps even surpass, traditional human-led training programs?

What also must be addressed is the nuance in different subjects or skills being taught. Is ChatGPT equally impactful when teaching hard skills, like programming or data analysis, as it is with soft skills, such as communication or leadership?

I invite the community to dive into these questions, share empirical evidence, personal experiences, and insights on the effectiveness and limitations of ChatGPT in shaping the future of virtual learning and corporate training.

The impact of ChatGPT across these key sectors is a clear indicator of how AI tools can elevate human potential. By handling routine tasks and providing intelligent assistance, ChatGPT allows industries to leverage their human capital more effectively, fostering innovation and driving progress. What are some other sectors where you've seen ChatGPT make a significant impact? And how do you think AI will continue to shape our approach to work in the future?",active,1
1cr8jqt,30,2024-05-13,Could ChatGPT4o revolutionize education?,u/Luk3ling,singularity,https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1cr8jqt/could_chatgpt4o_revolutionize_education/,"Imagine a world where education from K-12 and even through higher education is accessible, free, and tailored to each individual's needs and interests without any of the predatory business practices or commuting to worry about. 

With AI systems as robust as GPT4o appears to be; namely being equipped with vision and voice capabilities, I think Education would be one of the most practical and impactful ways to implement this technology.

Technology like ChatGPT4o could be the foundation of such a system. It already seems capable of interacting naturally with students, understanding their needs, and providing personalized learning experiences. 

The technology certainly appears at a glance to be robust enough to replace tutors for primary education and support students through higher education.

We need to gather the best educators across various levels of education to collaborate on the design of comprehensive, adaptable curriculums. Leveraging AI, we'd be able to make sure curriculums are continuously updated and improved based on the latest educational research and feedback.

While ChatGPT4o is envisioned to be free for everyone, ensuring that everyone has the necessary devices and internet access would be crucial. This is of course an initiative we need our governments working on. 

Non-profits and education organizations that actually want people educated and thinking critically would likely be easy to get behind such a goal in numbers.

Even if it wasn't implemented directly into schools but instead used as a supplementary source of high quality guidance and feedback. Or as a way to fast track kids who show extra promise when interacting with these AI Tutors and Curriculums.

I feel like this big of a leap could easily revolutionize the future of education. 

Not only can we make education more accessible, but we could also make it more engaging and personalized, allowing people to finally discover their full potential!

How feasible does such a revolution seem to anyone else here? What would some of the key concerns be for you in such a system?

My biggest concerns would be the wrong people being able to mandate the contents of said curriculums, but we've already got that going on as it is.",active,29
1crl54d,1,2024-05-14,"Spent a whole week studying for a final exam, and regularly went into office hours to bomb it",u/Alone_Bread3632,CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1crl54d/spent_a_whole_week_studying_for_a_final_exam_and/,"I am in a class that is at the end of my major's path. So far in my college career, I have done pretty well with grades and have never had issues with any of my classes except this one. Today after taking my exam, I think that my suspicions are right.

To start, my professor promised us that if we regularly go to class, go to office hours when we need it and made sure to be a part of the classroom then we would not fail regardless of exam score. The first exam, I will give the benefit of the doubt; I was not ready for the exam. It is what it is, you learn. However, there were some oddities that I noticed.

For context, this is a math heavy class, and you typically will need to write down intermediate calculations on your exam paper because the questions typically require a lot of steps and the same numbers/variables bounce around. There are 16 questions, 75 minutes (about 4.7 minutes) per question which in hindsight now that the final is over, it was ridiculous he gave such little time, but not actually his fault (directly).

In that classroom, I noticed two people *actually* writing something down on their paper. Additionally, the professor allows you to bring a cheat-sheet to the exam but allows this cheat sheet to be on your computer. He doesn't actually monitor his exams, he has his TA do it. You see where I am going with this? To me, it's a little bit odd that everyone seems to be typing on their computer to ""find"" what they are looking for on their cheat sheet. However, I marked it up to my own frustration with the class and just finding a reason to push the blame for me not studying.

Second exam rolls around, and I'm going balls to the wall for this one. Do all the practice problems he assigns, go through the textbook/slides multiple times (yes, what a normal college kid should be doing) and started as early as possible. Exam rolls around and I get steam rolled again. However, this time seemed different: I actually studied the material, and I know for a **fact** that it was impossible for some of the people in that class to finish early. I know this because the steps involved were tedious, meanwhile, my own friend group would brag about cheating this class. You know, I'm not going to be a shitty friend and snitch on them, I'm pretty close to these guys. However, that time my impulsive thoughts got ahead of me when I heard a flurry of typing right at the start of the exam. I look to my right and every single person on my row is on the internet/chegg. I was extremely frustrated; I spent day and night to study for this exam. It's frustrating because I don't want to say anything, but I know if they were caught and he was aware of the cheating, he'd find out with the first exam (after some adjustments) that the difficulty is insane. Still, I kept to myself, went to office hours and discussed the exam and the final coming up.

This final exam was my time to come back. While some of those same friends in the class were going out during the middle of dead week, giving me crap for doing it the ""right way"", I was hunkered down for two and a half weeks (granted I was also studying for other exams, I prioritized this exam more than any other exam). I studied things in the chapter that weren't on the slides, worked my absolute butt off more than I had for any other exam before. It's not so much that the problems themselves are difficult, it's the timing. I had a plan, however, and that was to practice the problems until I could get it under 4 minutes and 30 seconds by timing it on my phone. When I ran out of problems, I'd have ChatGPT generate new ones for me so that they were always fresh.

You know, I don't know what I was expecting. It was over before it began because the first question encapsulated multiple questions from the recommended problems in the textbook into one, while also adding some extra steps to actually get the starting variables that the practice questions would originally give you. I was boned. I already felt pretty confident that most of the people in there were cheating, but this last exam confirmed it. There was a clear typo for one of the numbers on a question that would make answering the problem impossible toward the middleish/end of the exam, and I was the only person in that class to ask the TA about the typo that would have been corrected or at least pointed out during/before the exam if people were actually taking the test. To add, I wasn't corrected until after I completed the problem, the way it was written and had to start over; originally being told ""Do what you think is right or leave a comment by the question."" I mean it's one thing failing all three exams because you're lazy and uncommitted, but its another to watch your peers not care and get congratulated for their work while you're portrayed as the lazy or just plain stupid student in that class. The only thing that even gave me hope for that class were the Case Studies that I'd have to do well on, although I won't complain, they were actually really cool. The only other person at office hours was the only other girl I saw in that class actually doing the work, and I could tell too that she had also struggled with the exam.

The average exam scores are in the high 80s/90s. As a professor, I'd be happy and think that it was too easy. I think that's what happened too because I noticed with each exam that the problems that were pulled from whatever test bank they came from weren't getting progressively harder, but became more tedious and took away from the time you'd have to complete it.

This isn't the first class for my major that this has occurred. It was an intro class to my major, and the professor got in trouble because over 90% of people ended the semester with an A+ by allowing take home tests. The opportunity for me was always there, and you know I'm pretty happy that even if he does go back on his word and fails me anyways, at least I can sign up for the class again with someone else and do better without resorting to cheating. It absolutely boggles my mind because technical interview questions for my major are very similar to this class, so I'm shocked more people don't take it seriously. But, for those who are interested and would like to time themselves on working out DCF and M&A problems in less than 4.5 minutes then shoot me a message hahaha.

TL;DR: Professor and TA failed to monitor cheating and inadvertently made it impossible to pass without cheating yourself.",User_deleted,1

This AI revolution is reshaping the way we think about virtual learning, providing opportunities that were previously unimaginable.

ChatGPT, with its ability to understand and generate human-like text, is playing a significant role in this transformation. Not only does it open up access to personalized learning experiences, but it also enables an interactive environment where students and professionals can get immediate feedback on their queries.

In education, ChatGPT can be an invaluable resource for students. It can serve as a 24/7 tutor, capable of explaining complex concepts in various ways until the student grasps the information. It can also assist in language learning, writing assistance, and even creating more engaging coursework.

For corporate training, ChatGPT's potential is equally significant. It allows for on-demand training sessions tailored to the pace and style of the individual employee. This kind of personalized learning leads to more effective skill acquisition and can help employees stay current with evolving industry standards and practices.

However, with all these advancements, we must also consider the implications of using AI in education and training. How do we ensure the authenticity of learning? What about the role of human instructors? Can AI adapt to the nuanced needs of all students?

I'd love to dive into these questions and hear your observations on ChatGPT's impact on virtual learning and corporate training. What have your experiences been with AI in education? What do you perceive as the greatest benefits and the biggest challenges? Let's discuss how we can harness AI's potential responsibly to create the most effective and equitable learning experiences for everyone.",active,1

1cubkmh,2,2024-05-17,My startup journey into post-grad experience,u/Wrys0,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1cubkmh/my_startup_journey_into_postgrad_experience/,">TLDR; At 19, I decided to pursue entrepreneurship to build products that bring joy and contribute meaningfully to the world, inspired by my immigrant parents' sacrifices and success stories. My background includes a transformation from a game-obsessed teen to a driven entrepreneur. After a breakup during my sophomore year, I channeled my energy into learning new skills, losing weight, and starting my first company—a social network for goal sharing. Despite many mistakes and pivots, I gained invaluable experience. Now, I'm developing an app to connect early-stage entrepreneurs and am determined to succeed, even after recent setbacks with a cofounder leaving and an accelerator rejection. - ChatGPT



I'm 21 years old, and I'm turning 22 in a few months. 

I decided less than two years ago to pursue entrepreneurship to build products that would make people so happy to use, so that I'll have made a genuinely valuable contribution to the growing world and flip my old hedonistic ways.

This is not one of those stories about bankruptcy to riches, but something more relatable for the young budding entrepreneur who has gone through a life changing event - it might seem naive to the more experienced who have been there done that, but real for us now. 



# Family Background

I come from a middle class family of immigrants who escaped their dictator-run country when they were in their 20's in hopes to put their child through college. They worked for over 25 years to scrimp and save the money for all four years of classes. My father started a wholesale furniture business with some brothers and $0 to their name in the deep countryside of Vietnam; 20 years later they're making three million in ARR and I'm proud of him. My mother is a senior accountant at a big firm, and was moved from foster family to foster family as a young teen to complete her associates degree at UMass Amherst.

**I don't have that kind of a story, but I want it**. I come from a more privileged place because of them, but I still yearn for my own success story that carries the same weight.



# My Background

**I was obsessed with playing video games**. I was on the computer by 5am before the bus arrived at 7 to pick me up, and I was back on it for another few hours after school. During winter and summer breaks I would play all day every day. I was a fat, lazy, computer-addicted 200lb 5'7"", chips-gulping kid, and I somehow was still able to get a girlfriend, haha.

It was 2020 in March when quarantine periods were announced. I had the idea to build an MMORPG Minecraft server (called SiegeRPG), and I learned a lot of skills in just one year: design, leadership, people management, java/kotlin programming, blender modeling, many more. By 2021 I lead a team of 60 volunteers, with 100k unique players and a few thousand in profits. I started my University's Minecraft club in my 2nd semester of college and quickly brought it up to 300 members.



# My life-changing Event

That girlfriend I had in highschool found a guy friend she got close with --too close, and subsequently broke up with me in my 2nd semester of sophomore year; she said we were incompatible. It makes me chuckle looking back on it now, but I know at that time that was the most hurt I'd ever experienced. I cried in bed for weeks and didn't go out for days. I was a mess, and I learned the guitar to hopefully get her back. I was REALLY down bad.

I'm glad I decided to be proactive... I don't think I would have picked up the guitar if I hadn't made my Minecraft server or club, and missed out on the thrill of building something from nothing. I probably would have continued to be someone to pity like I had been in the many years prior. My small decision to learn the guitar at that point in time struck a chord in my brain and I kept wanting to play.



# My wins

Over the next year I dropped 40 lbs -my abs were showing for the first time! I got my first job, my first car, dressed nicely, took up boxing, and learned dozens of skills and earned certificates that would help me develop a business one day. By my junior year I left gaming behind me and I haven't touched it since. The Minecraft server was discontinued, and the club was handed to a new president, who has since raised it to 600 members :) 



# Why entrepreneurship?

I naturally leaned into entrepreneurship for the allure of it's erratic lifestyle. **I saw the discomfort, fears of instability, bankruptcy, and depressions, and I said I want that.** My father's story of building his business from 0 to 1 with two children and two full time jobs was filled with these moments. I was witness to them all. I wanted to pursue this lifestyle of scary growth and failures, akin to my sudden break up and ""glow up"" period. I wasn't naive to the struggles of building a startup, oh, but I was.



# My first startup

In my junior year of college I started my first company, a social network to share life goals and hold your peers accountable. I made EVERY single mistake that first-time founders could possibly make. Here's 10 pieces of advice for young founders:

1. Researching articles online isn't enough to validate a need for an idea. Go talk to actual people who have the problem you believe they do.
2. Have a good balance of pessimism and optimism. Be critical of your own decisions.
3. Don't start an LLC when you haven't made a good bit of money that proves you're solving a real problem.
4. Just don't bring in volunteers to help you; they will add more management that you shouldn't be handling as a young founder. If you're looking for help, look for cofounders.
5. Learn everything by hand now. If by small chance you're getting traction, you'll need to learn those skills anyway. Don't bother paying for outside assistance.
6. Be frugal and resourceful. 
7. Reach out for mentorship, participate in entrepreneurial communities, build a personal brand that people will know you for; this will come in handy.
8. Start with a problem you have, see if at least one person will pay for a solution to that problem, design a solution and get a resounding yes from your user, build the MVP, get more users.
9. Shut up about I am ""X"", so I can't do ""Y"". Are you an introvert and you're afraid to talk to people? Too bad, learn how to sell or never get a sale - your choice. Are you non-technical and your startup requires some coding? There are so many resources out there for you. 
10. Many, many, many, of you have the ability to set aside time for meaningful personal development, but will opt on saying that time doesn't exist for you. That's a way of phrasing a false reality that will help you feel comfortable and ignorant of a more productive reality. Do you actually want to be an entrepreneur? That comes with the good and the bad.

By the end of my 1st semester of senior year I had pivoted 10 times. Every week during that semester I was experiencing lows and highs. In the beginning I built a team of 12 and an MVP before I had talked to a single potential user in person. I even started an LLC and wasted money on legal contracts. My first mentor showed me some reality by asking just one question, and I couldn't answer it adequately enough, ""Who is your target user, and why would they use it?"" 

Over the next 3 months I had over 200 15-minute interviews with users for different solutions I pivoted to, and by the end of it I was trying to solve for a completely different idea that I didn't really care about - helping students get the skills to succeed in the job market.



# My current venture

I had a few projects come and go from January 2024 to March 2024, but this recent one I'm working on has stuck with me. I wanted to bring together founders in a networking event on my college campus. I hosted one in early March and 12 people came together and talked for over 2 hours about their experiences. We all exchanged phone numbers, and they asked me to host another one - so I planned one in April and 25 people showed! 

My vision for this venture is to help early-stage entrepreneurs collaborate on startup issues genuinely and authentically. I've tested a few different ways about doing that and I'm now developing an app to facilitate week-long masterminds. 



# Where I am

I've been working minimum 12 hours a day, from 8am to 11pm most days. I don't have a job if you discount my startup work, and I'm living with my mother. Now I'm getting closer to reality and what I've asked for from the entrepreneurial life style when I started. I'll have a story worth sharing.  


I initially wrote this post to vent about how my third cofounder left yesterday - and with it my plans to move to NYC to room with him, and how I was looking forward to moving out of my mother's to join an accelerator in Florida for the past 4 months, but they didn't want to fund me yesterday too. 

  
When I started writing this post I wanted to give some context into this current predicament I am in, but now I realize that I'll be okay. Sometimes things don't go as you planned them to be 100 times in a row. You have to get back on your feet. Maybe this is why, ""never give up"" is cliche - because it's been advised many many times.",active,2

I'm an elementary school teacher from Germany using ChatGPT in my classroom in different ways to make learning more fun and effective. So far I am just winging it and seeing what sticks. Here’s what I’ve done so far:

    
-Helped students get feedback and improve their stories.

-Used voice to text to help with reading aloud and enunciation.

-Took photos of homework worksheets to create core concept sheets for better understanding.

-Made advanced questions and contextual assignments to match students’ interests.

-Created questions to deepen understanding of the material.

- Made guides for parents to help with homework.

- had students make posters on the benefits and dangers of AI and fed that into CHatGPT to assist in transforming that content into a podcast that my students then recoreded with GarageBand


But I need some help and advice:

-Improving GPT Responses: Sometimes the answers I get are too detailed or not focused enough. How can I make GPT responses better and more to the point?

-Homework Assistance Bot: I want to build a bot that students can use in the morning to review their homework. They can scan their homework, find mistakes, and understand what they did right and wrong. It could also ask deeper questions for my advanced students. I think this will make homework more effective, especially for those who struggle and don’t get enough feedback. I have seen GPTs where you just have to type in a number to continue and it guides you through a predetermined set of questions. Something like that would be sweet for my young students.

Next school year, we’ll get access to a ChatGPT API, and hopefully, all students will get tablets. It seems like our state is setting us up to experiment. Data protection laws might become an issue, but as long as all student work uploaded is anonymous, we should be good—though nobody knows exactly how it will work yet.

I'm also working on showing my still skeptical colleagues the benefits of AI. My principal is supportive and sees the potential, even if they don’t fully get it yet. They’re encouraging me to help my colleagues see the value too. A lot of them are super skeptical. They think it is just the next toy that will fry our students brain not seeing the incredible potential IF used right. Please, please help me! I feel like a Trailblazer exploring a whole new world of education. There literally is nothing to work off of. Exciting times but also really challenging.",active,7

1cy4kq1,1,2024-05-22,"""ChatGPT Impact on Virtual Learning: A New Era in Education and Corporate Training?""",u/cporter202,ChatGPTautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTautomation/comments/1cy4kq1/chatgpt_impact_on_virtual_learning_a_new_era_in/,"The advent of ChatGPT has undoubtedly sparked a wave of potential transformations within the realms of education and corporate training, ushering in a new era that warrants a thorough exploration.

Within educational institutions, ChatGPT can serve as an interactive tool to aid students in various ways, such as providing clarification on complex topics, offering personalized tutoring, and even generating practice questions. Its natural language processing capabilities mean that it can adapt to diverse learning styles and pace, thereby catering to individual needs in a way that traditional educational resources may not.

Moreover, the implications for virtual classrooms are considerable. ChatGPT’s integration could potentially enable instant feedback on assignments, facilitate engaging discussions, or streamline the peer-review process by providing initial assessment remarks. It could also act as a study companion, guiding students through difficult coursework whenever human assistance isn't available.

In the corporate landscape, ChatGPT may revolutionize training programs by creating simulations for customer service, leadership scenarios, or technical problem-solving. For businesses, the impact is twofold: it not only enhances the learning experience for employees but can also serve as a cost-effective method of delivering continuous, up-to-date training.

However, the introduction of such AI tools into learning environments comes with a set of challenges and considerations. The question of how to maintain academic integrity, ensure equal access to technology, and the cultural shift towards embracing AI in educational contexts are just a few of the hurdles we must navigate.

Let's discuss the potential and pitfalls of ChatGPT in the paradigm of virtual learning and corporate training. How do you see this technology shaping the future of education and professional development? What are the best practices to ensure that its application supports learning outcomes and skills acquisition efficiently and ethically? Your insights and experiences can help us paint a more comprehensive picture of this emerging landscape.",active,1

1d1bulw,113,2024-05-26,A Guide to Supplementing Your Income for Students,u/IvyRoney,UniUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/1d1bulw/a_guide_to_supplementing_your_income_for_students/,"Posted this last year and a lot of people seemed to find it quite helpful so I thought I'd share it again.

I've frequented this sub for some time and something that inevitably comes up time and again is the financial struggle of being a student. So basically what I've done is expanded on all the ways one can earn extra money in the UK, and also separated them by category. This list is based on my own experience of using various online sites and methods to supplement my own income over the past years, and I'm hoping that it will be relevant and helpful to many people in this community.

As always, the best advice for someone who needs more income is probably to get a job or to work towards a promotion, however, these things can also take quite a long time to achieve.

This list is for people who are looking for ways to supplement their income right now, and who would benefit from having a little extra each month to tide them over until their situation improves.

Anyway, Here is the list:





# Testing:

**(1) Usertesting:**

With this site, you test out the usability of apps and websites and get paid for it. Many of the tests only take 10 minutes and pay around £8.50 per, which is really good. Of course, you won't qualify for every test you apply to, but even if you apply to 10 and only qualify for 1, you're still going to be earning around £8.50 for that half hour of your time, as it only takes a minute or two to apply for each test. There are also longer tests you can apply for, which pay much more.

Your work consists of interacting with 'prototype' or ‘in production’ websites or mobile apps while speaking out loud to share your thoughts, emotions, criticisms, and suggestions. For the longer tests, you will sometimes have to video call with someone while you are completing the user test, which may sound a little offputting at first, but you'll find that this actually makes the hour go much faster than if you were doing an hour of shorter tests.

**(2) Userlytics:**

Like with Usertesting, you are getting paid for your feedback as you test out the usability of apps and websites. Again, you will have to have your microphone (and sometimes video) enabled while you share your impressions of the video, website, prototype, app, etc. that you are testing.

This site also pays quite well for the time you need to put in per test. Typically, the shorter tests pay around £4-£8, while longer tests can pay up to around £70, though qualifying for these is not a common occurrence in my experience.

It's important to note, that with this site and all testing sites, different people will qualify for different tests based on the answers they give in the screeners, which determine if you are a suitable candidate for the test you're applying for. With this in mind, my advice is to stay determined and keep applying, because you never really know when you'll be the perfect candidate for a test, and sometimes the test you're a perfect fit for will be one of the highest paying.

**(3) Intellizoom:**

This site is very similar to the others in that you are being paid for your [feedback.It](http://feedback.It) contains ""Think out Loud"" studies which require you to talk as you complete various tasks. Like with the other testing sites, what you earn will depend on what studies you're a match for. This site doesn't have quite as high an earning potential as other testing sites, with studies that require you to record video and audio usually paying around £8.50, and standard studies paying around £1.50.

**(4) Testingtime:**

Again, with Testingtime, you're being compensated for testing apps, websites and other products.  Your value as a tester comes from the fact that you're helping to influence the development of future products and services.

**(5) Utest:**

This isn't a site I see mentioned too often. It's essentially the same as the others in that you'll be matched with testing projects based on the information you've entered on your profile. The majority of projects involve functional testing, where testers use an app or website and look out for bugs and issues.

# 

# Projects & Tasks:

**(1) Teemwork:**

A crowd-sourcing site where you can complete various jobs and tasks. There is a great variety of jobs available, with tasks such as translation, evaluation, and video/audio collection showing up frequently. It would take a long time to list the all various tasks that appear on this site, as there really is a varied amount of work available on a daily basis.

This site pays very well for the time you put in, with many tasks paying £25-£30 for less than an hour of your time. When you first sign up, you may not see a huge amount of jobs available, but I would recommend checking back as often as you can, as some days there is a lot more available work than others. This site also pays out to Paypal.

**(2) Appen:**

This is a site where you can apply to work on various projects online, including social media evaluation, translation, data collection, surveys, paid conversation and many more. The rate of pay is very competitive, with some jobs paying up to £20 per hour. Most jobs pay around £11-£15 per hour (which is still great for online work) and I have not found it difficult to qualify for projects.

The potential earnings from this site over the course of a year can easily enter the £100s or even £1000s, so if it's not on your radar it really should be.

Apply for as many projects/tasks as you can, it's well worth taking the time to apply because even if you get one project, that can be hours of work at a great hourly rate.

**(3) Clickworker:**

Like others listed, Clickworker is a 'task for pay' site. Very similar to Neevo in that the tasks you perform are used to help train AI.

There's a decent variety of tasks available, my favourite being voice recordings of various sentences and phrases. There are also many tasks that revolve around taking photos of random things. The payment is fast and reliable and uses Paypal, never had any problems with these guys.

My advice is to get onto the UHRS section of the site to earn more money, there's a banner at the top of your jobs section which you can click to qualify for UHRS. You'll need to do a sort of exam to qualify, but it's mostly just a test of your English comprehension skills as far as I remember.

**(4) Neevo:**

Companies submit projects to Neevo to help improve their AI systems. When you’re a match for a project, you’ll be asked to complete a set of simple tasks, which could be in the form of text, audio, images or even video.

It's a straightforward 'task for pay' site. They payout through Paypal and the variety of jobs is good. I check this site every now and then, I know it's a smaller earner so I don't like to give it too much of my time. My advice would be to keep your eyes peeled for higher paying jobs that come along, Some of the lower paying tasks aren't really worth it for the time you need to put in.

# 

# Studies & Research:

**(1) Prolific:**

This is definitely one of the top paid study sites around. With Prolific you get paid cash for engaging in the research of Academics and Universities from around the world. There are Surveys and studies about scientific research, new products and public opinion. From minutes to hours, to multipart studies over longer periods, there's a respectable range of studies to participate in.

This site pays out to Paypal, it has a range of interesting surveys, and studies pay a minimum of £6.50 per hour. Each study or survey tells you the amount you'll be paid for completing the task and also gives you the hourly rate of said task, which is very useful.

If you compare Prolific to other Study/Research sites, like Respondent or User interviews, for example, you might at first notice that the pay per task is much lower. However, what sets Prolific apart from sites with higher paying studies is the frequency with which you'll receive tasks. I often leave the Prolific tab open while I'm working on something else, and it's not unusual to receive 5-6 short studies over a 2-3 hour time period. The advantage here is that you'll receive tasks based on the information you've entered on your profile, whereas on other paid research sites, you would be applying for higher paying tasks with screeners, but it may not be often that you get accepted for the studies you apply for.

**(2) Respondent:**

I'm sure some of you have heard about Respondent, It's a site where you get paid for taking part in various studies. The studies can be both remote and in-person but these days most of the available studies are remote.

It doesn't take long to apply to studies so even if you don't qualify, you haven't wasted too much time. Also, the pay is excellent when you do qualify, with studies generally paying between £10-£150, depending on the type of study and the amount of time it takes (Generally ranges from 15-90 minutes).

It's not really a site that you can depend on for frequent payouts, but even if you land a few studies that pay £60 or £70 each, you're doing very well for the time you put in, so I do think this one is worth checking every day if you have 5 minutes to spare.

**(3) User Interviews:**

User Interviews is a site where you get paid to take part in various studies. There are normally a lot of studies available to apply for and the screeners are usually short and sweet.

This one has a high earning potential, due to the vast variety of study topics offered on the site. If you check your homepage frequently enough, it won't be long before you find a study that is looking for an applicant with your background/interests. Studies can pay anywhere from around £8-£200.

**(4) Grapevine Panel:**

A market research site where you get paid for your input as you participate in group discussions and one-to-one interviews. You'll be notified by email when projects become available and it pays quite well for the time you put in.

**(5) Dscout:**

So with this site you are rewarded for helping with Market Research. The way this works is that you are given ""missions"" where you offer your opinions/feedback on various products or services in exchange for payment.

The Pay is good and the payout is received promptly through PayPal. I also like that you answer photo and video questions, it keeps me a bit more engaged.

Although the pay per task is reasonable, I wouldn't say that the frequency of available tasks is its strong point. Check as often as you can for available missions and apply for all of them. It may take a little bit of time to get your first mission but once you do, more and more will appear.

**(6) Angelfish Opinions:**

Another market research site where you get paid to take part in focus groups and surveys. Pays £1-£100 per task.

**(7) People for Research:**

Get paid to take part in market research. This site pays very well, with many projects offering £40-£80 per hour.

**(8) Focus Force:**

A research group that pays for your opinions and various products and services.

**(9) Focus 4 People:**

Get paid up to £150 for your participation in various research projects.

# 

# Surveys:

**(1) Qmee:**

A site/app where you get paid to help influence products and services by completing [surveys.One](http://surveys.One) of the stand-out advantages of Qmee is that you can cash out whenever you like, from as little as 1p, and it also pays out to Paypal.

There is usually a decent amount of surveys available, and for a paid survey site, the pay is relatively good.

**(2) Attapoll:**

An app where you get paid for answering surveys.

The surveys have a star rating so you can see which ones are most popular amongst users. The payout is fast and I find myself using this app more and more when I'm doing idle things like taking the train or on lunch break.

You can cash out to Paypal once you have earned £3. As with the majority of paid surveys, you're certainly not going to earn a fortune, but if work is scarce on some of the higher earning sites, then it's always good to have these types of tasks as a safety.

**(3) Lifepoints:**

Another reliable Survey site, You share your opinions on numerous products and brands and get paid for it.

There's a nice variety of surveys available every month and at certain points throughout the year larger surveys appear which pay quite well, it's just a matter of checking your jobs page often enough to catch these. Also Pays out through Paypal.

My advice would be to be patient. Some days it may seem that there are very few surveys available, but check back the next day and there could be much more after appearing.



# Matched Betting:

This one is quite a unique means to make extra money in a short period of time, It's called Matched Betting. It's a very simple process but it's imperative that you read the Guides in full before you begin.

Matched Betting is where you use bookmaker sites to complete various 'Free Bet' offers (e.g Bet £10, Get £30 in Free bets), but the whole idea behind the process is that every time you ""make a bet"", you match that same bet on the exchange (meaning the value of your qualifying bet will always be returned to you).

So for example, if I bet £10 for Real Madrid **to Win** on the Bookmaker Site at odds of 2.5, I then also make a Matched bet on the Exchange (This is a separate site such as Smarkets or Betfair) where I bet for Real Madrid **not to win** at odds of 2.5 (or as close as I can get to those odds). In this way, I am covered in all outcomes (win, lose or draw), and it allows me to fulfil the requirements of the bookmaker's offer (e.g Bet £10 and get £30 in Free bets). The money from my initial bet has now been returned to me and I also have a £30 free bet credited to my account.

When I receive my £30 free bet, It's the same process of matching again but this time using my free bet on the bookmaker site. This is where I secure a profit, because I'm not using 'real money', and even if I lose on the bookmaker site, I will be paid out on the exchange.

This one is great if you can spare some money to get started. Your money isn't 'invested' or 'tied up' in anything, It's just that you'll need cash in order to complete the various free bet offers. You can withdraw your money at any time, but most people leave £100-£200 in their accounts just because it's easier than depositing money every time you want to do an offer. Over the course of 30 days, that £100-£200 or so will grow to £600-£700.

The main advantage of Matched Betting is that it really doesn't take a lot of time to hit that £500 profit mark. Over a 4 week period, I worked my way down through the list of welcome offers, nice and handy, and having completed 20 offers at 15 minutes per offer, I came out at £470 for 5 hours total of work.

Not to knock paid projects/survey sites, but if you don't have the time or desire to invest in that kind of online work, the obvious advantage with Matched betting is speed and simplicity.

NOTE: If you have a history with gambling, do not come near Matched Betting. Matched Betting is not gambling, but the fact you will be using betting websites to facilitate a profit is too much of a temptation- It's not worth it.

# 

# Transcription:

**(1) Rev:**

With Rev, you'll be paid to transcribe speech in audio and video files. If you're unfamiliar with this type of work, all it is is converting speech into text, like creating subtitles for a video, for example.

As a Transcriptionist, you can earn around 20-90p per audio/video minute. As a Captioner, you can earn around 40-90p per audio/video minute. If you also know a foreign language, then you can earn even more. This site pays out to Paypal weekly.

**(2) Way With Words:**

This is another popular transcription site. You'll earn around 35p-£1.50 per audio minute, depending on the project, and you'll be paid into your bank account monthly.

# 

# Content Moderation:

**(1) Modsquad:**

This is a site where you get paid to moderate content and help manage various online communities. The upside of this type of work is that it's flexible and you can choose projects that align with your own interests and knowledge.

The amount you earn depends on what kind of project you're working on and what skills you have. If it sounds like something you might be interested in, then all you need to get started is a computer, an internet connection, and a phone.

**(2) Crisp Thinking:**

With Crisp Thinking, the type of work you're applying for is something known as a 'Risk Analyst Contractor'. I know, it sounds like a very niche type of job, but in fact, it is content moderation just like Mod squad.

Essentially your role is to identify risks in online content. You can apply for this project by joining the waiting list on Crisp Thinking, found at the bottom of the 'careers' page, reading: 'If you wish to apply for freelance moderation work, find out more here'

I have read that this work pays very well, which is why there is usually a waiting list, but if it sounds like something you could see yourself doing in your spare time, then you might as well apply and hope for the best.

# 

# Freelancing:

**(1) Fiverr:**

Offer your services as a Freelancer and get paid. You can earn a lot from the ""gigs"" you post, but you'll need to have some kind of service you can offer that people will pay for. I'd recommend taking a look at what other people are posting and seeing if you could offer similar work.

You'll need to think of some kind of service that you can charge money for, but this can be just about anything. This also means that there's unlimited earning potential because you're creating your own work.

**(2)  Freelancer:**

Another great site where you can offer your services as a Freelancer. You can post projects offering whatever category of skill you possess, be it ghostwriting, programming, data entry, or blogging. If you have a service to offer, then you can get paid for it on this site.

Like with Fiverr, I would recommend taking a look at the home page of the site to see what kind of services other users are offering. This will likely give you some ideas of the type of projects you could post, because even if you don't think you have a skill you could charge money for, you probably do.

**(3) People Per Hour:**

I like this one because you can send proposals to complete a certain task. For example, you might see a post where someone wants a person to write social media posts or proofread a piece of work.

There's always a good variety of jobs available, and the more you build up your profile, the more work you'll get.

**(4) Guru:**

Another popular freelancing site. Essentially the same as Fiverr or Freelancer.

# 

# Selling/Renting:

**(1) Vinted:**

This is a great Site/App where you can sell your old clothes. Maybe it doesn’t sound like your thing or you don’t think you have anything fashionable enough to sell. Believe me, You can sell any item of clothing here.

I’ve sold clothes here in the past and have been pleasantly surprised with a nice few sales. The process of signing up and getting started selling is very easy, and the items of clothing you list will likely receive attention even if you aren’t a top seller.

**(2) Facebook Marketplace:**

Sell your old stuff. This one should honestly be mentioned in every thread where someone has asked how to make some extra cash in a hurry.

We all have stuff we don't use anymore lying around the house and as obvious as it may sound, the items that seem old and worthless to you will be new and exciting to someone else.I'm talking anything, literally anything: Old clothes, books, plant pots, gadgets you don't use anymore, furniture, homemade crafts etc.

Old Clothes seem to really sell fast, which isn't surprising because people get excited when they see something that's their style and really cheap. So clear out your wardrobe.

If you're into crafts, you could sell stuff you've made there too. The point is, You could easily make £50-£100 or more if you do a thorough sweep of your house for stuff you don't want/use anymore.

**(3) Fat Llama:**

This is a site where you can rent out pretty much anything. I first discovered it when I was trying to find a cheap place to rent some tools.

You can browse the site and see what kind of things other people are renting out, you'd be surprised by the number of items in your own home that you might not have use for but others would be happy to rent from you for the day.

# Something Different:

**(1) Rover:**

This one is quite a great site where you can offer your services as a dog sitter/dog walker. You can have dogs dropped off at your home and get paid to look after them for a duration of time.It's ideal for people who miss having pets or who get a bit lonely working from home, etc. The pay is usually around £20 per day for dog sitting, maybe £6-£10 for dog walking. If you're at a loose end anyway or just feel like having a furry companion during your free time, This site is a nice way to earn a little money and make some canine friends.

You just make a profile and enter your address so people in your area can find you, Bonus points if you have a dog in your profile photo with you.

**(2) My Tutor:**

MyTutor is an online-tutoring site, I don’t see this site mentioned a whole lot but it really is a gem. This one is ideal for students and recent graduates, but if you have skills or knowledge in any teachable subject then you should check it out. You don’t need any previous experience as a tutor to work here.

You can earn up to £20 per hour and the work is rewarding and meaningful because you are helping others to learn. It’s also very “social” online work, which some people may see as a nice change.

Also, If you like the idea of tutoring but don't have knowledge in any of the teachable subjects listed on My Tutor, There is also the option of teaching ESL, which you can do a quick TEFL course on and may be worth the investment if you think you'd be interested in that type of work. It can be quite a good earner too. You can do these classes freelance or work for an online company such as Preply or Hallo.

1d1lo5n,1,2024-05-27,Need ideas: First time teaching MS STEM,u/ucfierocharger,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1d1lo5n/need_ideas_first_time_teaching_ms_stem/,"I’m a second career teacher, my previous career was as an industrial designer and have extensive engineering knowledge as well. I have taught middle school (8th grade specifically) math for the past 4 years but this year my principal asked me to take over the STEM elective position that has been vacant for 6 years. I taught the robotics club and have taught stem in summer school the past 2 years and really enjoyed it. After some consideration, I accepted the stem position and am very excited.

We’ve got a cricut and a makerbot. There’s a full woodshop and a cooking classroom in addition to the classroom I will have to operate from. We’ve got microscopes, telescopes, and a garden. There are no stem standards for the state specifically, but I should tie the projects to a math or science standard of some sort. Aside from that I’ve got free rein to design the class as I see fit. 

I want to do: 
-the traditional balsa bridge/tower project
-video game coding project
-mousetrap car or catapult 
-something with AI/ChatGPT

I have an M&O budget of $4,000 (for around 300 students between the two semesters) as well as a giant capital expenditure budget (I wasn’t told an exact number but was told just lmk what you need and we will find a way to get it, based on what I know of the district finances from being on the budget committee, I’m assuming it’s in 5 figures, probably 10-20k or possibly more)

So I need ideas for projects, what do you all do? lemme know what your ideas or best projects are!",active,0
1d1xyki,1,2024-05-27,Requesting recommendations for resources for 10-year-old native German beginner,u/ominousbarkingdog,OnlineESLTeaching,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineESLTeaching/comments/1d1xyki/requesting_recommendations_for_resources_for/,"I've been teaching an 11-year-old German kid with some prior English knowledge for a few months.  He's been doing well and now his mom wants me to teach his younger brother who speaks no English. 

I explained to her that I'm not really comfortable doing it as I'm a qualified High School teacher with limited experience teaching kids but she's adamant that she wants *me* to teach him (her other kid really likes me). 

I don't speak German apart from a few words and phrases, but at least I can read and (mostly) pronounce German words.  When I have trouble explaining the meaning of new vocabulary, ChatGPT usually helps me bridge the gap.

I get a lot of lessons for my advanced students from ESL Brains, but they don't have material for A0 speakers and I can't damn well translate every single sentence using ChatGPT.  Can anyone recommend a good source of kid-friendly material, ideally lessons designed for German speakers? 

Thanks in advance.",active,1
