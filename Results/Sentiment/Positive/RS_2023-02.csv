And i noticed that literally 2/3 of all computer screens where actively using chapgpt looking up definitions, terms, code and concepts from the presentations. 

Speaking for myself chatgpt so far this year has helped me tremendously to understand new concepts and logic.

I think this is a extremely powerful tool for learning. And that it is a big shame universities is banning the tool.",User_deleted,3

1141q7s,94,2023-02-16,Heartbroken from cheating,u/dragonfeet1,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1141q7s/heartbroken_from_cheating/,"So in the Before Times I had a student in an intro level course. They were terrific--did all the homework, had great things to say in class discussions, just a dream to have.

I saw their name on the roster for one of my online upper level classes this semester and was honestly delighted because they'd been such a great student and I just felt relief that there'd be one solid star in the class.

Got a few weird hits on Turnitin on an assignment and then I got one that was 60% from Coursehero. This doesn't always mean anything--sometimes Turnitin flags stuff that's like...literally words from the textbook.  But 60%? I felt like i had to investigate what was going on.

Well, it's exactly what you reading this probably realized at the start of the last paragraph if not this entire post. Not only have they been copypasting off coursehero, they have been uploading my assignments and their work to coursehero.

I'm devastated.  If even my star student is cheating...? 

(EDIT: I want to say, the class is not too difficult--there's an open book quiz directly on the readings each week, a discussion post every other week, and a written 2-3 page assignment every other week.  It's not that I'm asking too much.)

They are begging me to let them know how to 'fix it'. Fix it? There is no fixing it, for all the work I now have to do:

I now have the unfun task of having to write all new assignments for the rest of the semester, since my tried and true good ones are all over coursehero.  I found that I can't even do my favorite thing, which is assign an essay exam for the final, since all my take home exam questions are up there...WITH answers.

NB: I've tried to make a coursehero account but my school's stupid three factor authentication or some nonsense is preventing their email from getting through to validate me.  So I'm stuck having all my years of hard work crafting exams and assignments up there forever.

Sorry for the vent. I'm just so...this is not what I went to grad school to do. I want to TEACH, and I want to spend my pedagogy time working on better teaching...not outfoxing Coursehero ,ChatGPT and all the others.  Thanks for listening.",active,102
1156br1,8,2023-02-17,Where do I learn more about Social Robotics / Social AI?,u/cooleym,Futurology,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1156br1/where_do_i_learn_more_about_social_robotics/,"I love learning about social robotics and what they mean for our society. Stories like, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, Blade Runner, 'Be Right Back' from Black Mirror, all contain ideas I love about how robots/AI affect our society. I love thinking about how these stories are also criticisms of the direction of our society. I love looking at how the robots on the forefront of today are affecting the world. I love thinking of how different cultures perceive the same robots differently. I love questioning how you should design a UI based on the background of the user. I love asking the questions of: can robots feel emotions?, should we make AI that are meant to replicate people who've died?, should we fear artificial intelligence?

I want to find resources/websites/people/subreddits where conversations, and even better, debates over these ideas happen. I've become very frustrated in this pursuit so far, so I'm wondering if there's anyone here who may be able to help. For some context, I'm an undergraduate at a university in the US and I've taken some classes on ethics in technology but I don't feel they're advanced enough for me. They do ask these sort of questions, however, I feel they don't go very in depth with them. They kind of just ask students these questions to get them started thinking about them. Most of the students in these classes tend to have not thought of these ideas before, and these classes are kind of introducing these questions to them; Whereas I like thinking about them all the time and revisiting these ideas with every a tech news headline that comes out. I'm working on trying to find professors and other students at my university that are also interested in these ideas, but I am wondering if there's also resources online you all may know about that may be helpful in my process. Let me know what you guys think, thanks.

&amp;#x200B;

PS.. Here is my take on the some of the questions above:

Can robots/AI feel emotions?

Yes and No. I don't believe that we as humans shouldn't be worried too much about whether robots/AI can or cannot inherently ""feel"" emotion, because I think emotions lie in the eyes of the observer. Let me explain. If a robot is able to mimic the emotions of humans to the level of which it is believable, and we as humans perceive them as real emotions, then they are real emotions. Emotions are not real until we think they are real. When we as people start believing that the robot/AI has felt an emotion, then it has. Because what matters isn't necessarily whether it is literally true or not, but rather what we believe to be true or not. Here is the video clip that taught and inspired me on this from Lex Fridman: [https://youtu.be/0VH1Lim8gL8?t=4603](https://youtu.be/0VH1Lim8gL8?t=4603)

Should we make AI that are meant to replicate people who've died?

This question is largely the question of the film 'Be Right Back' from Black Mirror. My answer is: there is no objective answer, because AI, like all technology is a tool. What is a tool? A tool is creation that is made to help us achieve a goal better, or faster than before. For example, a wrench is a tool, a car is a tool, a gun is a tool, chatGPT is a tool. The outcome of what is done with these tools can be debated as good or bad, but the tool itself was only a means to the goal. With that being said, an AI that is able replicate a person who was once alive, can be used as a tool to: help someone grieve the lost of a loved one, let someone finish their will, allow malicious people to still be able to spread hate... and so on. The point is, the technology is just a tool, and it is not inherently good or bad. To generalize a piece of technology as either is wrong.",active,9

How I’m using ChatGPT to study:

- create a syllabus for semester 1 of my chosen topic
- create mandatory and optional reading list (internet articles included) based on the topic
- ask to summarise chapters of said reading so I don’t really have to download the books
- create follow up sections and topics I want to learn more about (i write these down on the Cornell method template on Goodnotes)
- ask to create essay questions or possible quiz questions (with answers if I just want to revise)
- ask to create flashcards 
- if a topic is difficult to understand, I ask it to write a rap about key events or talk to me like Trisha Paytas etc would
- ask to create questions a teacher would ask in class to engage students

I was doing all of that before with a LOT of Googling but it’s amazing how much time ChatGPT saves me!",active,65

# Project Details

**Project Name:** The shape of code

**One Line Summary:** Determining authorship attribution by leveraging NLP and topology to identify patterns in malicious source code.

**Summary:** Students will design and create technology to address the code authorship attribution problem. Society has seen a recent increase in malicious applications of technology, such as the use of deepfakes to create misleading high-quality images or key logging malware to steal an identity. While authors of these malicious programs do not sign their work, a stylistic fingerprint is left in the code base. These markings may be used to identify the authors from a set of potential suspects (i.e. attribution).Leveraging Natural Language Processing (e.g. large language models such as GPT-3) and Topological Data Analysis (TDA), students will determine unique shapes and patterns in the code base/binaries, allowing for solutions to the attribution problem. NLP allows for the vectorization of the code while TDA uses advanced mathematical tools (not available in standard deep learning architecture) to identify unique structures in the shape of the data. This technology has the potential to significantly impact the current cyberspace environment by improving our ability to attribute the authors of malicious technology.",active,24

I have a Plex library that I share with my family members; however, my parents need Chinese subtitles. In addition to downloading subtitle files, converting them from Simplified Chinese to Tradiaional Chinese, and the saving them with UTF-8 encoding, I also use MKVToolnix to remux the files so that the subtitle are included as tracks in the video files with appropriately labelled track names. While this was fine for movies, it gets hectic for TV shows as I'd have to do this for every, single, episode. Therefore, I used ChatGPT to create a bash script that does exactly that for me. After some trial and error, it managed to give me a working script that did exactly what I wanted!

# Downloading All PDFs and ZIPs from a Website

As a teacher, I am quite the resource hog. I found a website that had a plethora of documents that would be useful to my teaching and my students but they were hosted under many subdirectories and subdomains. It also had a slightly-more-complicated login process so a simple wget command wouldn't work. Therefore, I asked ChatGPT to create a bash script that uses wget to download filetypes it would prompt me for and the location of the cookies file needed to login.

She guided her students with patience and care,
Encouraging them to problem-solve and dare.

Her lectures were filled with passion and zeal,
And her students' successes were her greatest thrill.
From calculus to algebra, she taught them all,
And her dedication shone like a beacon tall.

As the years went by, she watched them grow,
Into engineers, scientists, and doctors, who know.
That their math professor was the one who inspired,
Their love for numbers and knowledge never tired.

Now, as she prepares to leave this place,
Her students gather to honor her grace.
They thank her for the lessons she imparted,
And for the memories that will never be parted.

Grateful for the journey, she shares her goodbyes.
She knows her legacy will continue to thrive,
As her students go forth and multiply.
