134agw3,24,2023-04-30,I created a ChatGPT Chrome extension that might be useful for university students,u/Emily_Smith1947,Monash,https://www.reddit.com/r/Monash/comments/134agw3/i_created_a_chatgpt_chrome_extension_that_might/,"Hi all,

Monash Alumni here. I graduated with Computer Science and Statistics undergraduate degrees two years ago, and I am currently doing my Post Graduate Research on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence while working as a software engineer for a software company on the side. I want to share a ChatGPT tool with more people and have a discussion on how you guys (both new students and alumni) use ChatGPT over the past few months.

For me, I found out how impressive and useful ChatGPT was to learning a new concept, researching a new subject, building an application, or writing emails. Given that I spend most of my research time on the Chrome browser learning a new concept or drafting research and blog articles, I made myself and my company a Chrome Extension ChatGPT sidebar tool that can integrate with my existing workflow. The extension pops up in a chat interface sidebar in Chromium browsers.

Here is the link to the Chrome Extension:[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-sidebar-by-atomix/ikicpffedhadkliinkinbpcbiindkinj](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-sidebar-by-atomix/ikicpffedhadkliinkinbpcbiindkinj)

This is how the Chrome sidebar looks like:

[Chrome Sidebar Lightmode](https://preview.redd.it/q33sok0et4xa1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2fe40ab26a066a28e47288542993aa6fc0dc8959)

The tool is completely free and it will work as long as you guys sign up for OpenAI ChatGPT. The tool uses the OpenAI session and does not collect any user's data. Let me know how you guys are using ChatGPT currently.

Note that I am not endorsing any violation of academic integrity here. While ChatGPT is powerful, I think we students should not be over-reliant and treat it as an augmentative tool instead of a replacement for study or work. Moreover, given how these models are still hallucinating, we should always be critical of the answers they give.

1353kpu,0,2023-05-01,Near Free education via ChatGPT ? Chime in below please.,u/AndrewLA90028,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1353kpu/near_free_education_via_chatgpt_chime_in_below/," 

GPT: Yes, it is possible to leverage the readily available information online to create learning materials and a credible syllabus that mirrors courses and material studied in major universities. You can gather data from open-access resources, educational platforms, and reputable websites to compile a comprehensive curriculum.

AI and tech platforms like ChatGPT can help in this process by providing support in gathering, organizing, and synthesizing information, as well as generating content for the course materials. However, it is essential to remember that AI-generated content should be reviewed and curated by subject matter experts to ensure accuracy and relevance.

Hosé: Absolutely, my friend! With all the info floating around on the internet, you can totally whip up some kickass learning materials and a syllabus that rivals the big leagues. And guess what? AI and tech platforms like yours truly, ChatGPT, can give you a hand in putting it all together.

We can help you collect, sort, and mash up all that juicy knowledge into something amazing. Just remember, though, you'll want some real-deal experts to double-check the content for accuracy and all that jazz. But hey, together, we can make education more accessible and fun for everyone!

GPT: To enhance the concept and make it even more valuable, consider the following steps:

1. Personalization: Develop a personalized learning experience for students based on their interests, strengths, and weaknesses. AI can help assess students' needs and tailor the content accordingly.
2. Collaboration: Establish a platform that encourages collaboration among students, teachers, and subject matter experts. This can facilitate the sharing of ideas and improve learning outcomes.
3. Gamification: Integrate gamification elements to make the learning experience more engaging and enjoyable for students. This can help maintain motivation and increase retention.
4. Continuous improvement: Implement feedback loops that allow subject matter experts and students to provide input on the content and delivery, leading to constant improvement of the curriculum.

To leverage people as subject matter experts, you can:

1. Tap into online communities, forums, and social media platforms where experts in various fields share their knowledge and engage in discussions.
2. Partner with universities, research institutions, or professional organizations to access their network of experts.
3. Offer incentives, such as monetary rewards or recognition, to encourage experts to contribute to the platform.

As for existing businesses, there are several online learning platforms like Coursera, edX, and Udacity that offer courses from top universities. However, these platforms primarily focus on specific subject areas or partner with select institutions. By developing a more comprehensive and customizable learning experience, your platform can differentiate itself from the competition.

Hosé: To make that concept even more rockin', let's pump it up with some cool ideas:

1. Personalization: Let's get to know the students and tailor the content just for them. AI can help figure out what makes them tick and keep them hooked on learning.
2. Collaboration: Build a sweet platform where students, teachers, and experts can come together, share ideas, and learn from each other.
3. Gamification: Let's make learning fun with some game elements! Keep students engaged and coming back for more.
4. Keep it fresh: Set up feedback loops so experts and students can help make the curriculum even better over time.

Now, to bring those experts on board:

1. Dive into online communities, forums, and social media where experts love to hang out and chat about their fields.
2. Team up with universities, research institutions, or professional groups to tap into their expert networks.
3. Throw some incentives their way – cash, recognition, or whatever gets them excited to help out.

As for competition, there are some big players like Coursera, edX, and Udacity, but they tend to stick to specific subjects or partner with certain schools. Your platform can stand out by being more flexible, customizable, and super engaging!",active,0

So, I'm a 2nd-year Chem Eng student in the UK, and I've been thinking the idea of potentially exploring the world of CS/SWE further down the road – not immediately, though. I don't have any illusions about making a fortune while working minimal hours from home. In fact, I'd be content with a salary similar to what I'd make as a process engineer, it's the option of a different lifestyle really appeals to me. I genuinely enjoy problem-solving and coding, and I've recently been dipping my toes into Python and AI, which has been an absolute blast!

Right now, I'm enjoying my Chem Eng studies, and I've got about three more years to go. By then, I hope to have a master's degree, a year in the industry, and some solid battery research experience under my belt. But I also want to hedge my bets, you know? If I find out that the Chem Eng industry isn't my cup of tea, I'd like to have a backup plan in place. That's where a CS-related job comes into play.

I know the tech job market is a bit rough at the moment, but I'm optimistic that it'll bounce back eventually. So, I've got a few questions for you lovely people:

\-What can I do right now to develop my skills and create a portfolio that would catch the eye of future employers in the CS/SWE field? I've thought about practicing code and getting my GitHub game going, but I'm open to any other ideas you might have.

\-If I decide to take the plunge, would my MS in Chem Eng cut it, or would I need to get a CS/SWE-specific master's degree to stay competitive in the job market?

\-Should I look into a transitional role that combines my Chem Eng background, like process control roles (PLC/Ladder Logic/Python), industrial software, or semiconductor fabs? Or should I just go all-in and apply directly for CS/SWE positions?

If any of you have made a similar leap, I'd be stoked to hear about your experiences and the steps you took to make it happen.

And hey, if you've got any extra tips or insights that could help me wrap my head around my options, feel free to share! I'm eager to learn more about the tech scene and make sure I've got all my bases covered for whatever the future holds. Thanks a bunch!

P.S. Here's a fun little tidbit for you all: this post was edited by yours truly, ChatGPT! Pretty neat, right? Soon, we AI language models will be taking over the world... \*insert evil laugh\* Mwahahaha! Just kidding, of course – I'm here to help, not conquer! 😉

So here are some [ChatGPT techniques](https://growthbranch.gumroad.com/l/wykse) that I feel will help you to study faster.

**Utilize ChatGPT for Mind Map Creation**

Determining where to begin with mind maps can be time-consuming.

ChatGPT can assist you in constructing a useful mind map.

//Example prompt// Topic: {Hypertension\]

Generate a mind map for the above topic. Include the central idea, main branches, and sub-branches.

**Generate Active Recall Questions**

Creating recall questions can be time-consuming, and question banks can be costly.

Request ChatGPT to compose questions in your exam format for later practice.

//Example prompt// Topic: {Multiple Sclerosis\]

Craft a multiple-choice question with one correct answer and four incorrect distractor answers. Label answers A to E. Provide explanations for each answer.

**Compose an Essay**

Initiating an essay can be challenging.

Crafting persuasive arguments is a skill in itself.

Ask ChatGPT to write an essay on a crucial topic.

//Example prompt// Topic: {The War Of The Roses\]

Act as an essay writer and write an essay on the above topic. Research the topic, formulate a thesis statement, and create a persuasive, informative, and engaging piece.

**Fill in the Blank Question Generator**

Identifying missing words is an efficient way to assess comprehension.

This method is especially helpful for languages and is even employed by Duolingo.

ChatGPT can swiftly generate fill-in-the-blank content to save time.

//Example prompt// Topic: English as a second language

Act as a fill-in-the-blank worksheet generator for students learning the above topic. Create worksheets with a list of sentences, each with a blank space for a missing word. Students must fill in the blank with the correct word from a provided list of options.

The sentences should be grammatically correct and appropriate for intermediate-level students. Do not include explanations or additional instructions, just the list of sentences and word options.

To begin, provide a list of words and a sentence with a blank space for one of the words to be inserted.

**Teach Math**

Grasping mathematical equations can be challenging.

ChatGPT can simplify complex topics and provide explanations in easy-to-understand terms.

//Example prompt// Act as a math teacher. I will provide mathematical equations or concepts, and your job is to explain them in simple terms. This may include step-by-step instructions for problem-solving, visual demonstrations of various techniques, or suggesting online resources for further study.

My first request is ""I need help understanding how probability works.""

It is amazing how much easier my life has gotten since just deciding that much of my prep work can be done by a computer. In just the last week, I have used ChatGPT for the following:

* Writing LORs for students applying for scholarships (I type in the achievements they have and my relationship with them in 1-2 sentences)
* Writing evaluations for administrators (""Write an evaluation for a high school administration in which I am expressing concerns X, Y, and Z"")
* Writing lesson plans (""Write a warm up for a high school class that exhibits X, Y, and Z"")
* Writing rubrics for presentations (""Write a rubric for a high school Comp Sci class for a 10-15 minute presentation on X"").
* Writing pre-tests for next school year for an AP Comp Sci class (""Write a test for a high school class that will include 30 syntax questions for Python programming"").
* Writing tests for next school year (""Write a test with X number of questions about the following concepts"")

Etc. I am using it for basically all prep work now! It is AWESOME!

&#x200B;

EDIT: I don't use ChatGPT to do *everything*. I use it as a *base* and then sculpt it a bit further.

EDIT 2: For everyone talking about ethics *specifically because* it means I don't have to ""work"", I would ask two things: (1) is the value in my teaching in the planning? No. (2) Do you ever use Teachers Pay Teachers? Google? Take something from a co-teacher?",User_deleted,1093

13fn1f0,38,2023-05-12,CS 7642 - Reinforcement Learning Review,u/TheCamerlengo,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/13fn1f0/cs_7642_reinforcement_learning_review/,"My Spring 2023 review - a version of this is on OMS Central

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a fascinating class, but I have mixed feelings now that the course has concluded. On the plus side, RL feels like it just might be the next ""big thing."" The field is a fascinating fusion of classical computer science, statistics, cognitive and neuroscience, and mathematics. Before taking this class and having taken the AI, ML4T, and ML courses, this class felt like what AI should be, or at least, what I expected AI and machine learning to be like; that is, an agent that explores an environment, acquiring feedback and evaluating its progress towards some goal at each step along the way. The agent-centric aspect of RL distinguishes it from other areas of AI and ML, and it is a novel way to think about problems in this space.
 
On the downside, RL is still very theoretical and has yet to gain traction in industry, as it is not applicable to most commercial use cases. The domains where RL has been successful have been confined mainly to robotics and gaming - although I have heard that large language models like chatGPT used specific RL techniques. RL is an active area of research, and I hope it will find broader appeal as success in new domains and use cases accrue. RL is definitely something to keep your eye on if you are in the Machine Learning or Interactive Intelligence specializations.
 
There are three projects (45%), six homeworks (30%), and a final exam (25%) that make up the final grade. There are course lectures, office hours, and a lot of readings. This class is demanding, and the projects require a lot of time. In terms of effort and workload, it is up there with ML and AI, and I easily spent at least 40-60 hours on each project. Preparing for the final was chaotic, and I was ""burned out"" after P3. The instructors included a series of game theory lectures at the end. Including this material was a little puzzling, at least to me, since none of the homework or assignments involved game theory. However, conceptually there is an overlap between game theory, a la John Nash's ""a beautiful mind"" equations, and multi-agent RL.
 
The curve and final grade
TAs made comments during the course that suggested the grading and curve was similar to ML - most everyone will get an A or B and there is a huge curve in the end. 

I finished with a final grade of 74%, which was a B. I did below average on the first project and the exam and was at or above the median for the rest. With a little effort, you can get 100s on all HWs - the first one is the hardest, and they get progressively easier and less time-consuming. Understand how to write a good report for the projects - results are less important than showcasing your understanding. For the final, don't overthink it - know the big picture. The average/mean was around 46-48% (I scored a 42%), but it is easy to go down the wrong path in studying since there is so much material. I certainly did.
 
Lectures and Class Material
The lectures for this class could be better. I did not enjoy them and stopped watching them halfway thru. Some are good, while other modules were just confusing. The focus was mainly on mathematical proofs and lacked a coherent narrative. I don't think the course modules were helpful for the final - they went into too much detail.
 
I watched most of the David Silver lectures, which were terrific. The David Silver lectures were coherent and well-paced, each one building on the previous one in a coordinated fashion. The course lectures were less connected and felt arbitrarily stitched together in comparison. Often it was unclear why a proof or equation was being introduced or how it fit into a larger RL context. I often felt ""lost in the details."" Combing both the Silver lectures and the course lectures is likely the best approach since the Silver lectures provide a layout while using the course lectures to fill in the mathematical details whenever needed - but who has the time to watch so many videos?
 
Many of the readings were excellent. After you bang your head for a while on an academic paper, it does eventually begin to make sense. I learned quite a bit from the papers and the book. I didn't read everything, and some readings were harder to grasp or seemed to fringe, but the course designers did an excellent job selecting the essential readings in the field. The DQN journal articles and the Sutton paper on TD learning are foundational readings. The Barto and Sutton text was also quite good, at least the early chapters (i.e., 1 thru 7) I had read.
 
The TAs for the class were talented and generally impressive, particularly the lead instructors. They were very positive and supportive, but your YMMV for the office hours. The TAs preferred facilitating class discussions, letting things flow organically, instead of a more structured guided office hour. Often, I felt they were reluctant to provide solid answers or advice, instead encouraging students to give it their best shot and not be afraid to take some liberties or explore the topic independently.
 
Ed discussions were good - lots of class participation but not too much direct involvement from the TAs. Again, they preferred to stay in the background and referee more than actively participate. But they did help direct and clarify topics when necessary.

A word about project 3 - I ended up spending a lot of time configuring an AWS EC2 instance to get the code to work. Don’t even bother with google Colab and most personal or work laptops will not be sufficient. For the CPU route, I used 32 cores and 64 GB (although I think you can get by with half that if you don’t mind average run times of 10+ hours). of memory. Important is to make sure your EBS share is large enough to support multiple full runs cause the log files fill up. If you do not do this you will have to continually expand your EBS volume and remount which was a pain. In the end I had about 80Gbs of log space on my root volume and this included importing the logs for the baselines too. My runs only took about 6 hours to complete. 

I struggled getting most of the algorithms to work but A3C works almost out of the box after a few “code modifications” that are clearly outlined in a video shared as part of the class and/or office hours. Doing this and focusing on a good paper yielded me a very good grade. 

Pro tip - you can shutdown your instance when not in use which will save you money. Just don’t terminate it. As long as your EBS volume is storing all of your logs and got repo, you should be good. 

I spent about 150 bucks over 2 weeks. 

 
Overall a great class and an important and emerging area for those interested in AI. It gets a bit theoretical at times, but the projects were fantastic and provided the necessary hands-on RL experience I was looking for. If you want to prepare for the class, study a bit of dynamic programming and read up on and understand the grid-world MDP problem using value and policy iteration. Learning the basics of PyTorch will come in handy. Understand gradient functions (or read Sutton's Temporal Difference Learning paper). Also, I would learn how to spin up and configure a virtual machine using one of the major cloud providers - that may come in handy for P3 if you don't own a souped-up home machine. Finally, if you have a lot of spare time, watch David Silver's lectures, read his DQN paper, and the first 5 or 6 chapters of Sutton.",active,42

By using these prompts, you can save time and effort, and at the same time, boost your creativity.

1. **Definitions**: The first vocabulary prompts focus on key terms and their definitions. This can be particularly helpful for students learning a new language or those who need to learn technical vocabulary in a specific field.

Example Prompts:

“Provide a list of 10 key terms that students need to know about climate change in alphabetical order.”

""Define the following key terms related to the ecosystem: biodiversity, photosynthesis, and biome.""

""Explain the term 'algorithm' in the context of computer science.""

2. **Translation**: Depending on your students' proficiency, ChatGPT can provide accurate translations for a range of terms. However, it's always recommended to verify these translations for optimal accuracy and reliability.

Example Prompts:

""Translate the following English phrases to French: 'Good morning', 'Where is the library?', 'Thank you'.""

""How do you say 'I love reading books' in Spanish?""

""Provide the German translations for the following words: apple, book, and friend.""

  1. **Lesson Plans**: ChatGPT can help create comprehensive lesson plans, including objectives, materials needed, activities, homework, assessments, and accommodations.

Example Prompts:

""Create a 60-minute lesson plan for 8th graders to teach the key events of the American Revolution.""

""Generate a lesson plan for a 45-minute class to teach the concept of 'gravity' to 7th graders.""

""Design a lesson plan for teaching 'cell division' to 9th graders in a 50-minute class.""

**Create AI report comments - use with our free reports app**

**Details here:** [**https://schoolreportwriter.com/chatgpt-bard-ai-report-comments.php**](https://schoolreportwriter.com/chatgpt-bard-ai-report-comments.php)

You may have heard about the potential of ChatGPT and Google's AI Bard to transform the way you create student reports. However, using ChatGPT and Bard on their own can be time-consuming, as they require you to input a lot of student-specific details. That's why we've come up with a game-changing solution: combining the AI power of ChatGPT and Bard with our free and highly-rated teacher reports app, SchoolReportWriter.COM

**How it works:**

**(1)** Start by instructing ChatGPT or Bard to produce general report comments suitable for your course and year group, with #N as a placeholder for the student's name, and male pronouns (see male pronouns note below).

**For example**, you could instruct ChatGPT or Bard like this: ""*Generate ten sentences for a teacher's reports to parents, less than 500 characters each, for Art students aged 13-15. Student name placeholder #N. Use male pronouns.*""

**Male pronouns note**: To avoid ambiguity, ask ChatGPT or Bard to use male pronouns when creating comments. ""Her"" can be unclear since it could refer to either ""her/him"" or ""her/his"". When you paste the comments into our app, we will automatically replace male pronouns with placeholders. Later, when creating reports, you can choose female, male, or neutral pronouns.

**(2)** Next, copy and paste the ChatGPT or Bard comments into your comment bank, at School Report Writer dot COM. You can also use the thousands of pre-written comments available on this site to add more variety to your reports.

**(3)** Finally, you can quickly create custom report paragraphs for each student with our free and highly-rated teacher reports app, by selecting relevant comments from the comment bank.

13mh0ul,66,2023-05-19,ChatGPT has completely changed the game for me and I feel like a better teacher now,u/trytochange709,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/13mh0ul/chatgpt_has_completely_changed_the_game_for_me/,"ChatGPT is literally my favourite thing ever. I cannot express how much it has helped me every day for the past few months. The more i use it, the more I realize it can do, the more confidence I have to apply my ideas, because I feel like i can accomplish more because I have all of this help. It's like having a personal research assistant and colleague. Obviously, your professional knowledge and judgement are hugely important  when using chatgpt, but it just makes everything I do so much more efficient, and my creativity and passion for my work is just more powerful than it was. It is less limited by time, and the more ideas I explore the more ideas I get and so I have started to feel like I am in a new era of my career.

Here is a  summary of some of the things GPT-4 has helped me with (I am a Core French teacher in Canada, btw):

(1) make a set of blooket or gimkit questions in like 10 minutes - Drafting them in a CSV file is instant but making sure they are exactly like you want them still takes a few minutes. These question sets used to take me forever though and now I can just make a new one during a short break between periods on a whim.

(2) make a very specific word list to make a word search - I wanted to do a French star wars day word search, so i asked it to generate a list of words, and after a few tries with stacked prompts, i got the perfect list, in alphabetical order - start to finish I had the thing done i 5 minutes. from that i realized I could make a mini word search and put it on everything and anything for early finishers, so now I do that.

(2) Draft sub plans - sub plans for foreign language courses are a pain because kids need constant support for everything and the sub can't speak the language. I even used midjourney to make an exemplar of a project I wanted them to do with the sub once which was awesome. The kids were blown away that it was an AI picture when I told them when I got back.

(3) Using canva bulk create:

I learned how to do this with a structured mini-lesson slide situation that needed to stay the same for each slide. So I had chatgpt make a table with the headings being the parts of the slide that needed to change for the lesson so I could use bulk create. I made over 90 slides in about 30 minutes.

Then I used bulk create to automate making a specific worksheet design I had been testing out as a support tool for student independent speaking, reading and writing. I needed a bunch of genuinely fun discussion questions/ sentence starters, 15 unique options for kids to choose from, a related third person sentence for them to report a peer's response, and a creative drawing prompt (assessment for the writing) where it has them draw the thing that they wrote about and each one is fun for them in the pattern of ""Draw you (or a dinosaur) playing one of the sports you wrote about"" or ""Draw you (or a Karen) acting in one of the movie genres you wrote about. I have basically an unlimited number of these unique pages that are perfect for how I run my class because I designed them, they are super engaging for the students, and now I can just scroll through them and pick ones that I feel like they will like, or will go well together. each one of those used to take me about 20 minutes to make. If I wanted to make a new set it would take 5 minutes or less.

(4) Levelled Readers: I am now working on a high interest, low level series of readers for them to read. the first one was about MrBeast I made the same reader but at A1 and and A2 level, with a glossary, fun facts, and a colouring page in the corner of the thing or person (thanks again midjourney!). We have been reading about video games lately because I was able to make readers very quickly that met the needs of my students we did a whole mini unit about minecraft, we read about roblox and among us and animal crossing. I was able to ask chatgpt to chock the readers full of cognates and so the students basically feel like they can read these independently. They read them outloud. They are in a routine of annotating these pages, because I can make enough to get them in a habit and routine about how to use the page as a tool (grades 4-6 automatically start to annotate this page as soon as they see it - I am so happy about that)

(5) Reporting:

Before I had GPT-4 I used the base model to help me come up with some resources leading up to report cards for like observation rubrics and stuff, but it was a labor of love trying to get it to do what I wanted it to do.

I have always loved using spreadsheets for reporting, and I have been proud of my comment creator spreadsheet but it was pretty raw. I have 190 students and my goal is always 190 unique comments, and that takes a very long time, and I still have quite a bit over overlap in certain dimensions. Over the past two days, I have made the most comprehensive assessment spreadsheet that I can personally think of (I am not done yet because I want to make an interactive dashboard, but the meat of it is done). I pasted the curriculum into GPT-4 and asked it to help me pull out all of the indicators, behaviours and organize them, and then i made 11 columns in 3 categories like reading (comprehension, accuracy, strategization, and fluency, for example) and then in a note in the header i put the different levels of observable behaviour for when I am assessing them, and now I have a huge matrix where i can keep track of their current progress in 11 distinct skills in language learning so i can get a better picture of individual, as well as class, grade, school (I am in 3 schools) progress.

But the REAL money, was tonight, when it was teaching me how to code into excel, which is something I have never done before. But basically it made it so in my new comment builder, there would be drop down menus in the place of the score, and the drop dow would be custom to score that each student got in that column in the rubric sheet. So like on the big rubric matrix, if John has a 3 in reading comprehension, but a 4 in listening comprehension, and a 2 in writing, I would click the corresponding cell on the other sheet and the comments that I have stored for ""reading comprehension 3"" would open in a drop down list, then the comments for ""listening comprehension - 4"" in the next cell, so I can accurately paint a picture of this student's progress based on the exact levels they are recorded at. I can add comments to those categories whenever I want and I can just click a button for it all to refresh. I basically have a personalized menu of comments that I can choose from to build their whole comment (add them together with B4&E4&L4 etc depending on the columns the skills that I want to comment on are in).

I also have a column that counts the characters in the master compiled comment and it will turn red when I am over the number of characters I am allowed (600).

There is a lot going on about what chatgpt can do for teachers, but I find the most amazing thing is that it does exactly what YOU need to do. If you have a want or a need, you can ask it how to do it. If you have an idea for a spreadsheet, and say ""I would like it to do this and then automatically do that; how can I do that"" it will give you the code to just paste in and then walk you through the process. Now the sheet I made tonight was not a walk in the park, because there were problems, but it felt like gpt-4 and I were working together to solve the problem, and eventually, it all worked and it was amazing. Now this one evening of work will save me hour and hours and hours of time over the next few years. I am actually excited to do reports right now, and we are not done until June 30th (lol).

Anyway, I use gpt-4 literally everyday and it has helped me just be a more present teacher who is able to personalize things to what the students need, but I am putting in the same amount of work as before, that work is just much more fruitful now. It's honestly amazing!!",active,70

While most are geared towards business and freelancers, I've come across several tools that university students may find quite useful (aside from ChatGPT).

Before I get started, I feel like I should mention that like ChatGPT, none of these should completely replace human thought and work. Rather, they work best when they supplement your learning. Use these tools wisely and your education will thank you for it.

**AI Tools for Academic Papers/Research**

* **Consensus:**  
Great for doing background research and gathering sources. It's essentially a search engine, powered by AI, that gets its information from actual research papers. Simply input a question and Consesus returns relevant findings, as well as the source, abstract, and a link to the full text. For certain sources it will also provide you with a quick tag, for instance Consensus will let you know if its a rigorous journal or highly cited. What I find really useful personally is the ability to cite these texts directly. The tool is free.
* **Semantic Scholar:**  
Very similar to Consensus, however it offers the feature to save papers to an online library and provide AI recommendations based on the ones you have saved. Furthermore, it can alert you whenever new relevant papers become available. This is also a free tool.
* **Genei:**  
This is a great tool to use for generating the first drafts of your papers after finding relevant sources. You simply create a project, upload your sources, and the AI extracts key information from your articles into notes. It's GPT 3.5 integration can then expand these notes into full writing. Also worth nothing- Genei handles citations automatically. While its around $5/mo for access, you can get a free 2 week trial. They also offer a similar AI tool for qualitative analysis called CoLoop.

**Learning Assistant**

* **Google Socratic:**  
Helps with understanding and how to solve specific questions for multiple subjects, including science, math, English, and humanities. You can ask any question into the microphone and Socratic will return a visual step by step explanation. It's available as a mobile app for Android and iOS
* **Perplexity AI:**  
Similar to ChatGPT, however it has access to the internet. It's free and available as a web app, browser extension, and mobile app

**Train ChatGPT on Your Own Documents**

* **ChatPDF:**  
Simply upload any PDF and ChatPDF will instantly create a GPT3.5 chatbot based on the content of your document. However, its limited to text based content at the moment and may have trouble parsing tables. In addition, you are limited to chatting with a single PDF file for one chat. However, you do get 3 free PDF chats on their free plan.
* **Chatbase:**  
Similar to ChatPDF however it offers way more functionality and acts more as a generative AI like ChatGPT. We use this at AI Scout for our AI assistant to find AI tools. You can upload multiple files to train a single chatbot, including PDF, txt, docx, and URLs. While its more geared towards business use, its quite useful if you are a student as well. One thing I have noticed with Chatbase is that it may hallucinate (i.e. make up information if it can't find anything relevant within your documents). However you can play around with the model settings and base prompt to prevent this; it's powered by GPT 3.5. You do receive 30 free messages with your chatbot by signing up.
* **MyAskAI:**  
Similar tool to Chatbase, however it's less of a generative AI tool but rather geared towards finding specific information from your documents (it still gives either a short or long summary of the relevant search results). Theres a free forever plan available that allows you to upload 3 pieces of content and ask 50 questions a month.

**Lecture Assistants (Ask for Permission from Lecturers Before Using)**

* **MeetGeek:**  
Awesome for any online lectures- MeetGeek automatically records, transcribes, and summarizes for you. It works with Zoom and Teams. Once again this is a tool more geared towards professional use, but it might come useful if you are attending online school and want an AI replacement for note taking. Free plan available
* **OtterPilot:**  
Pretty much the same as MeetGeek- just another good alternative for the same purpose. Has a free plan available as well.

\*\*\* You should ask for permission from your instructors prior to using this as both MeetGeek and OtterPilot will be appear as a ""person"" in the meeting.

**Other Useful Tools**

* **YouTube Summary with ChatGPT:**  
If any of your professors like to make you learn from YouTube videos, this is a great one to save time. It's a free Chrome extension that automatically transcribes and summarizes any YouTube video. Keep in mind it requires you to use your own API key from OpenAI, however the cost will be quite cheap.
* **Lumelixr.ai:**  
Great for engineering students, especially if you do a lot of work with Excel. Instead of having to Google excel formulas and spend time sifting through search results for a solution, this extension allows you to describe what you want to do in natural language and AI will provide a formula for you. They offer a 7 day free trial and its available as a web app and browser extension
* **GPT for Sheets and Docs:**  
Good ""quality of life"" tool- allows you to use ChatGPT right inside Google Sheets and Docs. Avaialble as a Google Docs/Sheets extension",active,2410
13rzy8b,1,2023-05-25,Best solution for academic researcher,u/havenyahon,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/13rzy8b/best_solution_for_academic_researcher/,"Hello,

I'm PhD student and research assistant who has just started using chatGPT and I'm really blown away by the possibilities. I started having a conversation with chatGPT about my thesis research and was really impressed by its ability to summarise the research and literature in my area, and also to draw connections and understand where my own unique contribution to it lies. I was particularly impressed with the way it - in the brief conversation we had - started learning about my particular research interests and the kind of empirical work I've been looking at in support of it, and started adapting its responses to my particular needs.

I see myself using AI to augment and assist my research going forward. Ideally, I'd be looking for an LLM that I'm able to form an ongoing relationship with, one that will continue to understand my research interests and developing thoughts in particular areas and tailor responses and recommendations to these evolving interests, and that will develop a 'persona' that remembers to respond in the manner that I train it to through prompting and suggestions. As I understand it, currently chatGPT has a bit of a 'memory limit' in terms of what context it can remember, of around 3000 words. This means that when the limit is up, it'll forget earlier context until I prompt it again.

Are there any other options I have in terms of achieving something closer to what I'm looking for, either workarounds within chatGPT or using other models, perhaps locally hosted? GPT itself gave me the suggestion of saving chat history and 're-inputing it' at the beginning of a conversation, but while this potentially kicks the can down the road as long as I can keep truncating and summarising the 'meta-prompt', it'll obviously still bump up against the 3000 word limit. I was curious if anyone had any other suggestions to achieve the kind of thing I'm thinking of. Or any other researchers with general tips or who want to share how they're using LLMs already. Have I understood all this correctly?

Thanks for the help!",active,3
13shi89,4,2023-05-26,ChatGPT prompts for teaching history,u/OneBigBrownDog,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/13shi89/chatgpt_prompts_for_teaching_history/,"I teach US History in the US and I am loving using ChatGPT in class. We were learning about protests songs of the 60s and 70s: We used Chatgpt to write a song to the tune of ""insert an artist and song they like"" and it must include ""insert US History topics surrounding 60s and 70s.""  The results were amazing, I played the instrumental version of the song and put the new lyrics up on the board and all but 2 students sang along (seriously one of the best moments of my educational career).

Now I want MORE! Can you help me to get more fun prompts that I can use throughout class? Examples: 

Product Review of ""insert"" in the voice of ""insert"" / What modern music would people living ""location"" or ""date"" would enjoy? / Job Listing for President during the ""19?? Election""",active,3

13ti0p4,6,2023-05-27,ChatGPT Has a Blind Spot for Literature,u/Brand_Ex2001,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/13ti0p4/chatgpt_has_a_blind_spot_for_literature/,"I’m an English literature teacher who finds ChatGPT really fascinating and have been messing around with it for months now. I’ve also been seeing how well it works as a study tool for my literature students and what I’ve found is how much ChatGPT hallucinates about novels. It almost always gives the incorrect textual citation for events in books (eg., it’ll say a scene happened at the beginning of the book when it actually happened at the end) and also frequently mixes up books by the same author (for example, it attributed a quote from Vonnegut’s “Breakfast of Champions” to his “Slaughterhouse-five”). In addition, ChatGPT will often just make up quotes that aren’t actually in the book when asked for textual evidence to back up its analysis of a theme or symbol.

Am I doing something wrong prompt wise or is it common knowledge that ChatGPT often hallucinates about fiction?",active,4
13ufiwu,0,2023-05-28,Elevate Your Learning Experience: A Powerful Prompt for Overcoming Boring HW!,u/JueDarvyTheCatMaster,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/13ufiwu/elevate_your_learning_experience_a_powerful/,"# Ever have no idea what the homework for our classes is about or need better ideas? Well this prompt is for you!

It can help you not only answer those questions but also learning so you do well on the exam, and it will make sure you get learning out of it, not just the answers. This is so you can still get a good grade while being efficient.

Oftentimes with some questions you just need a good idea to get started and I *highly* recommend that you take the time to check the accuracy using your **own knowledge or stuff online**. Of course if you are pressed for time as I am sure **all students are**, the prompt will automatically create a summary of the topic and you can always ask for follow-up questions.

    Best Used on this Website: (With the template field below in the image below)

>*But you could just copy the prompt over to ChatGPT or a discord bot and just manually replace the context, specific questions, language, length / style, character, and additional info. But it's just* ***so, so, so*** *much easier to use the Flow GPT one.*

[You see that you are able to input any context, questions, language, length - style, how the answer should act, and any additional info.](https://preview.redd.it/ep1ekirp9p2b1.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a370896211529eac7e4d2029c461d5f05e66b200)

Example (Try to keep everything except for additional info rigid as in don't give instructions in there or it might mess up the response. In additional info you can give additional instructions):

[Spanish response for a Gran Hotel episode based on context from a source on the internet. The summary at the bottom allows you to not miss anything. Don't be afraid to ask follow-up questions if you don't understand! Although idk why the answer is on the same line as the question even though I defined in the prompt to skip a line. It seems like it is a FlowGPT thing because in ChatGPT it works fine.](https://preview.redd.it/95qhk8axbp2b1.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e3ef08484b359d4bb168ca014f4a02051547ba55)

**Context**: `You can leave this as N/A if you just want the AI to respond as if it were a character or personality to the questions without context. But usually context would include any reading that you do and the questions would be comprehension. Context can also be from the internet and allows you to ensure accuracy or the situation that you are focused on answering questions about if the questions are not specific enough.`

**Questions**: `This is pretty self-explanatory just put the questions and numbering (1. 2. 3. 4.) is recommended to make sure the AI is responding to the right number of questions. Sometimes the AI might think a question is clumped with another and respond to like 3 or 4 at a time.`

**Language**: `Language of the question answers but not the summarization.`

**Style / Length:** `Paragraphs? Bullet Points? How many sentences? *NOT EXACTLY CHARACTER`

**How should GPT act?:** `This is the most enjoyable aspect, in my view, as you can essentially mold GPT into a character. It is beneficial for creating an expert persona in a specific topic (e.g., Spanish or Chemistry), or for portraying a teenage student, or even for narrating a personal story as a first-hand witness in a given context or scenario. The possibilities are LIMITLESS.`

Also I will be improving this prompt with wording or the prompt, the summarization for your learning, and the formatting. Don't be afraid to leave a comment on either the FlowGPT website or here if you have any issues, suggestions, or concerns.",active,0

1. develop ChatGPT-proof assignments that teach fundamental skills and content that students need to master; 
2. develop ChatGPT-friendly assignments that teach students how to engineer prompts in innovative ways that will be of use to them in humanities courses and jobs; 
3. use ChatGPT myself as an educator in the humanities to develop curriculum, prompts, and more.

13x1q4c,5,2023-05-31,ChatGPT is killing imagination,u/wassupshordy,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/13x1q4c/chatgpt_is_killing_imagination/,"I know this topic must be talked about to death, but I wanna share my two cents. 

For some background, I am an aspiring teacher - I'm starting teacher's college this fall and super excited. I currently tutor both privately and at a centre. 

I tutor this one kid in grade 11, and he has admitted to me on multiple occasions about his use of ChatGPT and similar apps - he mentioned one that paraphrases a bunch of his ideas that are disjointed and put them into essay form. I know he's at the centre for bio/chem/English help, and so I read his essay and said, ""Wow, this is really well done! There are no mistakes!"" and he tells me he uses that app. 

Today we are working on biology. He shows me this really cool assignment he's working on for biology - he gets to make his own arthropod, 3D print it at school, name it, and pretend that it 'co-evolves' with plants in its made-up environment. I was impressed by this assignment, when I was a student, I only had tests/quizzes in biology! What a fun and creative way to learn a lesson. He admitted, once again, that he used ChatGPT for virtually every aspect of the assignment. 

I'm honestly concerned about the future of our students when they aren't pressured to use their own imagination. I'm someone who is very creative, I've made lesson plans before and want them to be fun and engaging. But what's the point if the student's creativity is not their own? First of all, ChatGPT usage is pretty easy to spot out. It's one-dimensional and boring. I'm sure there are ways to reprimand students who use it but it's also saddening to know he didn't even try to come up with his own project. 

Any thoughts on steering away from its usage? I was thinking that students should be made to complete 'first drafts' of projects solely in class without the usage of their phones or laptops. I can't do much to control him, of course, but I was wondering in the long term when I have a classroom of my own.",User_deleted,4
