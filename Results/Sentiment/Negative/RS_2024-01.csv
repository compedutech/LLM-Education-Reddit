18x5u8f,1,2024-01-02,Revenge: My friend robbed me - I have proof they plagiarized A LOT,u/Strong-Scarcity-6382,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/18x5u8f/revenge_my_friend_robbed_me_i_have_proof_they/,"**The situation:** Essentially, I left a very expensive laptop (>$2000) at friend's place for a few weeks because I had to leave the country suddenly due to family illness and couldn't take it with. We'd been friends for ages and I thought I could trust her. Cut to yesterday, I came to pick it up and she said it's gone and someone must have stole it. However, I have proof from another friend that she actually sold it. I feel enraged, but I know for a fact that the police in our country will do nothing about this. In addition, I have no money for a lawyer - so legal routes of revenge are out. 

**Here's what I've got to work with:** I shared my OpenAI account with this person early last year, and they've been using it ever since to complete their Masters coursework and thesis. Like, basically every assignment they wrote has been pure ChatGPT. Currently I have 9 separate examples of ChatGPT logs relating to coursework (e.g., ""write a 9 page paper about x""), and 17 examples of ChatGPT logs relating to her thesis (e.g. ""create a survey to measure well-being"", ""write a paragraph on why x research topic is important"", ""fill out this ethics approval form""). The university is terrible and the professors are underpaid, so I guess they don't bother checking much for AI use which is how her plagiarism has so far escaped notice. I figure since I have the logs for all her prompts and ChatGPT's responses (which are essentially identical to her assignments), if I send this information to her advisor and the department's disciplinary committee lead, it will presumably cause her to be reprimanded in some way. I genuinely don't know if they would slap her on the wrist, fail her for a few subjects, or suspend her from the program. 

**Here's some considerations:** 

\- *She's still using the ChatGPT account* for uni, and doesn't know I'm considering this revenge. So, I'm wondering if I should hold off on giving this information to the university until she has used ChatGPT for more coursework or for her actual thesis (she hasn't started yet, but when she does I know she will use ChatGPT). This way, there would be even more damning evidence of plagiarism.

\- She has a pet dog who I love and want the best for, and I'm worried that if I fuck up her degree I'll be making life worse for this dog. The dog would certainly be better off if she gets her MA on time this Spring instead of potentially missing her chance at jobs and PhDs. I am genuinely considering not doing any of this out of sympathy for the dog. 

\- She might find out I did this, and try and get revenge on me. I don't want to start a blood feud. 

\- Snitching is a fu\*\*ed up thing to do, and I don't take it lightly. Even though she lied and stole, it is not in my nature to snitch on anyone and I have never taken revenge on anyone in this way before. It will cost me sleep in future if I go through with this. However, not going through with this would also cost me sleep as I am not a forgiving person and I know the only justice in the world is the justice we create. 

**How can you help me?** Tell me, if you think I should go ahead with this, how I can maximize the damage. Tell me what kind of additional proof, if any, I should send to the university aside from shared ChatGPT logs (I'm using the Share Conversation function built into ChatGPT). Tell me who I should send it to aside from her advisor and the head of the disciplinary committee (What about the head of the department? Surely there is a limit to the number of people I should send this info to?). I am a PhD student in another program where plagiarism is taken very seriously, but I know that at her university they don't really care. Students have been caught before by Turnitin or teacher intuition, and they've been given slaps on the wrist. Do you think I can be confident that if I send this proof of *extensive* plagiarism, *something* will happen? 

tl;dr: A person I thought was a trusted friend betrayed me badly, but I have proof she used ChatGPT to submit a ton of work for her MA and MA thesis. I am now considering sending this to her university as a form of revenge.

I'm a graduating student struggling with a dilemma that's been bothering me lately. I find myself relying extensively on AI tools for my coding projects, and I'm worried it might not be the best approach for my development as a programmer. I'm not sure if this reliance on AI will become the norm in the future(10years from now), but I'd like to discuss whether it's a bad practice, especially as someone who's about to enter the professional field.  
Here's a glimpse into my process: I have a basic understanding of programming fundamentals, and I tend to grasp new concepts quickly, but I often struggle with the practical application. When I start a project, my approach involves piecing together tutorials, snippets from existing codebases, and often uses AI (like ChatGPT) to fill in the gaps or solve errors.  
For instance:  
 1.) I search for tutorials or similar projects and incorporate parts of their code into my own.  
 2.) If I need a specific function or solution, and I can't find it readily available, I turn to ChatGPT to help tailor or create that function for me.  
  3.) When the different code snippets don't align or produce errors, I again rely on AI to troubleshoot and make them compatible.  
basically all my codes are snippets.  
This cycle continues until I complete the project, with ChatGPT often assisting in making the code cleaner, more reusable, and easier to manage.   
While this approach gets the job done, I can't shake off the feeling that I might be taking shortcuts and not truly learning or growing as a developer. I understand how the code works, but I worry that relying too much on AI might hinder my growth and independence in problem-solving.  
I'm open to any advice, opinions, or constructive criticism. Has anyone else experienced a similar reliance on AI tools in their coding journey? What are your thoughts on this approach, especially considering its implications for someone entering the professional field?  
I appreciate any insights or guidance you can provide. Thank you.",active,3

I'm not proficient in german so I asked my prof to let me write in english, but the thing is english also isn't my first language either, but it's easier this way anyway, because a lot of research paper that I read is in english  


Now the the problem, because this is my first academic paper, I need to use academic level words and sentences. There are times that I don't know how to convey my idea in an academic way so I ask chatgpt (GPT4) to do it for me, then rephrase it if it uses too advanced words with a simpler word, this is why I need a chatgpt detector, a reliable one. I have written abstract, introduction and method parts already, 80% of them are written by myself, and when I put my paragraphs into various ""GPTZero"" tools, the results are also various, some are 99% human written, and some are 99% AI written. And the worst thing is that they think the paragraph is AI generated because it has U.S school graduate level, of course it is, it's a literature review lol. Also I don't think I can believe the results of those that claim 99% human written either

I’d like to offer you some advice as a current teacher for the next time you’d like to criticize this sub for expressing our frustration with students: shut up. 

Without us, your children wouldn’t learn a thing. Saying things like “those who can’t, teach” is patently false. Moreover, I’d say the correction to that phrasing is “those who can’t teach, complain”. 

Some of you will become parents. I have no doubt you’ll be a horrible one, given how little respect you have for teachers, and you will essentially be neglecting your child by doing “hands-off parenting”. Just know that you’re an embarrassment  to others future fellow parents on your PTA boards, your social media, etc. 

Keep disrespecting teachers, and watch as we walk off the job. Remember what people said about learning loss? Good luck to students learning from ChatGPT and the Internet. I’m sure that’ll go over really well. 

I’d like to see you work in a classroom for up to 30 students at a time, planning lessons that are catered to different learners, along with parent outreach for problems, abusive parents and/or unsupportive administration, and instances of children abusing teachers. I’m sure you wouldn’t last more than one day. You don’t have the mental or emotional endurance to handle what you do, so you sit with your smartphone or computer, acting like a keyboard warrior who thinks Google or negative perceptions of teachers are 100% reality. Learn some nuance, and learn some emotional intelligence. 

Best,

I see so many lecturers post here, frustrated with what students are like nowadays and I can understand them. So many students seem to need information spoon fed to them, barely attend lectures or seminars, or rely on AI. 

I tried to do my best, but it feels impossible. I have to work 20-30 hours a week to afford being at uni, my course has 20-30 hours of lectures a week scheduled, and I have to complete projects and somehow revise for exams at the same time. It's so much. Last year I just completely gave up attending lectures and my grades went up about 10% for all my modules. I have stopped learning the content and just trained myself to learn how to prepare for the exams. There's basic knowledge that I should know for my course and I've retained nearly none of it.

The less I attend to lectures and actually learn content, the better my grades seem to do.

One thing I've never done is cheat. The closest I may have gotten, is ask chatgpt how to structure reports, or give me generic descriptions of topics to help me find starting points to complete my assignments. But about 90% of the students I've talked to have cheated (sat exams together, copied assignments of past students which for my course wouldn't be flagged as it's a STEM subject and the numerical results will be the same for everyone). They are the ones who are on track of a 1st or a 2.1. The rest seem to be struggling nearly as much as I do, and the ones that don't have one thing in common, they come from upper middle class families and have had private education throughout their lives. They don't have to worry about rent, or food.

I have so many mixed feelings. Honestly, I know that I do not have the knowledge that I should from my course and probably shouldn't be able to graduate. Most lecturers are right when they say we are getting lazy. But unis can't make us pay 9k a year just to fail us. Education and knowledge is becoming inaccessible. 

I just wish uni hadn't been so expensive, so I could actually try and fail as many times as needed before I was someone who should have a degree. I want to deserve this.",User_deleted,83

In early 2023 I changed the syllabus to encourage use of generative AI, and provided caveats about how their writing needs to be perfect and they are responsible for not sounding like a robot. Well that first semester sucked and I realized that I do not want to sit around reading the output of AI. 

So I have created some more complex writing assignments, intricate group interactions to force collaboration across various writing-related domains, and I am trying but I really need to figure out how to make sure these kids are doing the readings.

As much as I hate to do it, I need to quiz them. So I am using LLMs to create my quizzes for me. I create a bunch of questions and use the test bank feature to generate unique quizzes for each student (FU Chegg). My school uses D2L, and here is the prompt that I have worked out. After pasting in the text of the chapter (in my case by tearing the pages out of the textbook and scanning them) into the LLM, this is the prompt:

(I have done this in ChatGPT but am using Claude now because of the larger context window. ChatGPT requires the chapter to be broken into like ten page chunks but Claude can take the whole thing.)

If you create an “all of the above” or a “none of the above” answer choice, do not randomize the answer order. If you refer to the source document, refer to it as “the reading”. Please make less than 15% of the total questions have “all of the above” or “none of the above” type answers.

I apologise in advance for the long context I am about to give and I hope to receive some feedback on how I should ask questions and perhaps advice on how I can repair the damage done.

**Background:** I come from a background where there are a lot of handholding when it comes to studying and so I often went for consultations with my teachers to ask questions. As I am very anxiety prone, I don't deal with ambiguity well and often need reassurances by teachers by checking my understanding with them. I hence developed these (bad) habits of seeking reassurances and  accumulating my questions, where I would mark out areas I am unsure of and arrange for a time with professors to work them through. 

**What happened:** It happened yesterday that it took 6 hours of the professor's time to work through all my questions with me. And I was ignorant of how busy professors are until he told me at the 5th hour mark that he had put on hold his work for the day for my questions. Looking back, I understood why he wanted to help as much as he could, as I have a summative coming up and had told him previously that I hope to clear my questions before it got released, in case the questions overlapped. However, as I am very anxiety prone, I could see that that's my anxiety speaking and being paranoid about everything and anything. If he had told me earlier that he needed to end the consultation, I would have been more selective and prioritised my questions, as I still had time to work the rest through. However, by the time it got obvious that he could be annoyed, the damage has been done.

Worst of all, thinking back, I see how I might have come across as reliant and not resourceful as I could have used ChatGPT for them. However, this is where I am unsure about what professors would prefer students to do. 

A) Search the net and work them through yourself

B) Ask about anything and everything 

I would say that I have tried thinking them through myself however, as I was cross referencing materials and genuinely confused about how answers seem to be inconsistent. As I am confused myself, I am also worried about confusing myself further and hence thought that asking professors was the way to go.

As I still have the rest of the term to go and he heads the module, I am worried about reaching out to him anymore as I sent him an apology email that went unanswered. 

Do you think that he is offended and I have damaged my professional relationship with him, especially when I do have some intentions to propose a research to him in the future? If so, what would you suggest I do moving forward?

Thank you so much in advance for your reply

TLDR: Being wrongly accused of plagiarism by using ChatGPT, need help figuring out what to do.

My close friend who attends a prestigious university has been wrongly accused of plagiarizing an essay they submitted. Apparently the tool used to detect ChatGPT stated that they had plagiarized and had most of the essay written by ChatGPT. My friend is a hardworking and dedicated student, and has never once used ChatGPT during the course. 

The professor singled them out and gave them the two choices, either to rewrite the essay or go to the office of student conduct. Which they can’t do since it would be put on their record and be kicked off their scholarship. So they either have to accept a shitty grade and a reputation of plagiarism or risk losing their scholarship and education.

There is no solid way of proving that they didn’t use ChatGPT and wrote it themselves. Character witnesses aren’t convincing enough and showing browser history is unreliable since you can delete it.

19eb9wg,6,2024-01-24,"Wrongly accused of plagiarism using ChatGPT, what to do?",u/wrongly_accused_,University,https://www.reddit.com/r/University/comments/19eb9wg/wrongly_accused_of_plagiarism_using_chatgpt_what/,"Hi, I want to start off by saying this happened to a close friend of mine. I don’t know where to post this since I am unfamiliar with reddit, but I need help. 

TLDR: Being wrongly accused of plagiarism by using ChatGPT, need help figuring out what to do.

My close friend who attends a prestigious university has been wrongly accused of plagiarizing an essay they submitted. Apparently the tool used to detect ChatGPT stated that they had plagiarized and had most of the essay written by ChatGPT. My friend is a hardworking and dedicated student, and has never once used ChatGPT during the course. 

The professor singled them out and gave them the two choices, either to rewrite the essay or go to the office of student conduct. Which they can’t do since it would be put on their record and be kicked off their scholarship. So they either have to accept a shitty grade and a reputation of plagiarism or risk losing their scholarship and education.

There is no solid way of proving that they didn’t use ChatGPT and wrote it themselves. Character witnesses aren’t convincing enough and showing browser history is unreliable since you can delete it.

As an English teacher, I have faced many, too many assignments generated by ChatGPT. The students are well aware of the fact that they will not receive a grade if caught. They still do it anyway, counting on my mercy or stupidity.

But recently I found out that’s only the tip of the iceberg. This year I got the position of an associate professor and started teaching serious disciplines in my native language. And this has opened my eyes to some other examples of shenaniganery. An introductory personal essay on why they chose this specialty written by ChatGPT was expected, however odd. But below are two cases that blew my mind and started my quixotic fight against these year’s freshmen.

**Case 1.** I got used to research proposals written by a language model. But now I’m noticing that a list of references in some students’ works contain particularly frequent surnames, our local equivalents of Joneses, Smiths, etc. And then it occurred to me that even lists of literature are generated. On one particular occasion, I had a chuckle when an eminent linguist was said to have published a book on fashion. That was a new one. I gotta let him now the next time I encounter him at a conference.

**Case 2.** I figured that these freshmen aren’t really cut for research, so I gave them a simpler task: take notes on a YouTube video. Well, that failed miserably. What happened was that they downloaded the subtitles of the video, extracted the parts they deemed important, put them into a translator, and splashed the result into a final document. Best part of this? The subtitles were automatically generated and contained no punctuation whatsoever. Several students sent those notes without any translation or further edits.

I am genuinely concerned for two reasons.

One: **I am not motivating them enough.** Yes, half of students genuinely light up and can’t stop asking questions after a lecture. But, alas, there are other students who sit in the back and talk loudly throughout the lecture as they clearly don’t consider myself to be an authoritative figure who has something to teach them.

Two: my colleague who has a closer relationship with students said that they confess that **they are bored**, every academic activity is boring to them. And this is scarier. Desensitized, they just don’t want to get involved into deep work. Having these automatic tools at their fingertips is alluring to the point that it doesn’t seem like it’s a good investment of their time to bother doing a task themselves.

I’m trying to talk some sense into them, but I seriously doubt that this is working. I didn’t seem to notice this in previous years, but these freshmen... they are a different breed. How do you approach this? Basically, stop caring?",active,48
1adq44b,1,2024-01-29,Is this even possible !,u/Mikaa7,AskProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/1adq44b/is_this_even_possible/,"Its been hours... I am researching and didn't found any relevant info + chatgpt just keep teaching me ethics lol.  
So here's the thing. Let's take example of a website with text ""Hi Mates""    
Now I want to use that website + some changes in it. Just like we can do with inspect element.  
I want to change Hi mates to Hi Students and host same website on different link.  


I think, I suck at explaining this one.

In short, Can you just take someone's website, made changes to it via inspect element and host that site of different link. Whenever, someone will visit my link...He will see my inspected version instead of real while I am using someone's already hosted site.  
I think it should be possible if we can inject some cookie file while our link loads.  


Can you please answer. Is this even possible ? If yes How and If no what's stopping us from doing so.

1ae81ha,32,2024-01-29,How to Catch the Cheaters?,u/MissionPeak193,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1ae81ha/how_to_catch_the_cheaters/,"I’m teaching two online courses this semester. I’ve already caught at least 3 students cheating by using AI to generate their responses.  

Now, I’ve discovered something upsetting. I have two students that shares very similar responses, albeit one seems to have had a personal touch added. The both mention a very specific phrase that I did not mention nor was mentioned in the reading, which stuck out like a sore thumb.  

I suspect one or both of them used AI to write their responses, but they did not submit the discussion posts on the same day: one submitted it on Friday, and the other which seems even more ChatGPT-written was submitted the next day. It could be, however, that the second student was copying the first student’s work who did not use AI — that’s definitely within the realm of possibility.  

I need advice on how I can catch one or both of them, get them to fess up, etc. I don’t have the option of meeting them in person. Any ideas?",User_deleted,31
