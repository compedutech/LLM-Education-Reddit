1j0p31o,1,2025-02-28,I hate my sister so much it makes me physically ill...,u/thelittlenewyorker,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1j0p31o/i_hate_my_sister_so_much_it_makes_me_physically/,"For as long as I can remember, I’ve never liked my sister. We’ve always been fundamentally different. As kids, I was careful with my things, while she was destructive—breaking toys, ignoring boundaries, and taking my prized collectible Barbies out of their boxes despite knowing they weren’t to be played with. My parents always dismissed it, insisting I should share and forgive, which only bred resentment.

Fast forward to adulthood, and little has changed. My sister is nearly 30, unemployed, and financially dependent on our parents. She took almost eight years to finish undergrad (likely thanks to ChatGPT and remote learning) and refuses to take any job outside her degree, claiming it’s beneath her. She doesn’t pay rent, yet my fiancé and I have been covering it for years in the apartment we share—one that belonged to our late grandmother but is now owned by my mom and her siblings.

Despite contributing nothing, she helps herself to food, toiletries, and household supplies without replacing them. She idolizes the Kardashians, cakes on makeup, and dates a finance bro who drives a sports car but still lives with his grandmother to avoid rent. She spends most of her time at his place, but when she’s here, she’s loud, messy, and entitled. 

She weaponizes our childhood, claiming our strained relationship is my fault because I “never got over” disliking her. But in reality, I’ve tried. I bought her a leather bag for her internship, cooked for her, and even loaned her money. She never acknowledges or appreciates anything. She’s recently talked behind my back to my friends who were cat sitting for me, twisted my words to stir drama, and even created a rift between me and my cousin, whom I was once as close to as a sister. I've decided I don't need a relationship with her after these things unfolded (in the last 5 months). 

I also got engaged in December. Now that I’m engaged and planning for the future, I need her gone. I want to start a family soon, and I can’t stand the thought of her still lingering in this space. She has options—her boyfriend has money, she prefers being outside the city, and she’s said as much—but she won’t fully move out. My mom refuses to push her toward independence, continuing to work in a nursing home to fund my sister’s lifestyle and our younger brother’s tuition. I even loaned my mom $4K for his semester, which I didn’t mind, but if she weren’t supporting my sister, she might not have needed it.

If I leave this apartment, it will be the second time I’ve had to uproot my life because of her. The first was when she turned 18 and moved in with me and my grandmother, only to make things unbearable until my grandmother asked *me* to leave instead. At the time, I was just starting my career, making $34K, drowning in student loans, yet I had to figure out how to support myself while she stayed.

I’ve built a successful career, but I live in an expensive city. Staying in this apartment with my fiancé for a few more years—at least until we have a baby—would be a huge financial advantage. But my sister distorts reality, making me seem like the problem, even though my life is peaceful when she’s not around. Even my therapist has pointed out that she exhibits narcissistic traits. Yet she accuses *me* of projecting, despite the fact that I have a career, friends, and a life. Some of my closest friends don’t even know I have a sister—I genuinely have nothing positive to say.

It honestly embarrasses me that I hate her this much. Am I crazy for thinking she should be the one to move? Is it wrong of me to feel like I don't want a relationship with this person after this chapter of my life comes to an end. I don't feel she has the emotional maturity to ever change and she makes me physically sick when she's around me. ",active,0

No Academic Integrity violation. 

The part that really irks me about this, is the prof didn't even teach us how to do the assignment. He just linked us some random documentation, and then we had to figure it out ourselves, so how in the world is my solution 'strange' if he doesn't even show us the correct way to do it? 

This is my very first time working with the format he has given us, and after checking my solution I did have a few extra things that could have been condensed, but it makes more sense in my head to complete it the way I did. 

Do I even bother reaching out to the professor? The grade impact is only .1% of my total final grade, and the last thing I want this prof doing is going through all my assignments trying to nitpick every single thing and then start an actual academic integrity case, because this dude would 1000% waste his entire day doing this. There's no way to run this through an 'ai detector' or anything similar to that, nor did he even cite the work being from either a specific website or another student. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation, and how did you handle it? ",active,35
1j105pg,54,2025-03-01,For J2s taking As (especially slackers),u/bestslacker101,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1j105pg/for_j2s_taking_as_especially_slackers/,"For starters, congrats to everyone who survived As last year yay. Getting back the results has been hella stressful and while some people did very well (🥳), others may not have done as well (😔). Unfortunately i fall into the latter category and not only is my score objectively not great, it also fell below my expectations for myself. Who can i blame but myself? 
Anyway for people who are too lazy to read whatever thats at the bottom i kindly tldred everything after each para 🐦‍🔥

Ok so brief intro, i’ve pretty much been failing throughout my jc career, three of my subjects were constantly hovering in the U-S grade and never made it above that (barely got any As for the others too 🤓). Ngl it’s probs cos i was super unmotivated to study and didnt revise much. Maybe it was burnout but my daily schedule was ‘Wake up, school, nap, eat, repeat’. Didn’t do 98% of the tutorials, went for lectures without my notes (main reason: i forgot to bring), u get the idea 🥶. Now i wouldn’t say I’m a bad person, because i’m polite and i dont skip classes. But i was definitely a bad student who didnt take it seriously, even when it was right before prelims and the actual As. Unsurprisingly, I got a whopping 30+rp for prelims with 3 fails (as usual) 💀 But damn somehow i was unfazed by that. Before As, i did try a bit harder to revise more but ‘more’ was not enough. I gamed a lot, napped a lot, procrastinated a lot to the point where i would just pretend to study in front of fam and friends when nothing was entering my puny brain. In the end, i got a high 70 (A for everything except a couple of the subjects that i was always failing😱🤯). Obviously that is not good at all, perhaps good for my standard cos it is a freaking crazy jump from 30->70, but i know that if i had just put in more effort i couldve scored a 90 💯💯 
[TLDR: prelims 30+, As 70+]

What’s my point of writing this? I keep seeing so many posts of people having insane improvements from prelims to As and writing motivational words for this years J2s (thanks for the encouragement 😍). Those are so inspiring but i know that some people might use it to justify slacking more so here’s ur wake up call ☎️ (from a fellow slacker). 


1. If youre not feeling stressed, u should at least feel a bit worried. Ask urself what the heck is going on because unless u wanna be stuck with uni courses u might not like (like engineering 😐 (no hate)), u should probs start to feel the heat. Are u burnt out? Do u just not care? Are u numb and devoid of emotions from stress overload? Trust me, this is very important. From here, how do u wanna help urself? (Sorry ihave no advice for this cos i couldnt help myself either LMAO) but by finding the root of why u feel this way, it might benefit u in the long run. 
[TLDR WHY ARE U NOT STRESSED YET]

2. Teachers and seniors often say that failing is normal and u just have to keep working hard even if u keep failing cos itll pay off. But the thing is, if youre getting U or S, do u even know what youre studying? Hell i didnt understand fraaking chem at all 🥲 Best way to find out is by trying to answer any qns ur friends have. If u also dont know, then ofc u dont know ur content. If u dont have many friends, just flip to a random qn from ur tutorials or prac papers and see if u know how to answer it off the top of ur head. If u go ‘oh shet 💩 wth is this’ then u dont know the content. And if u are alr aware that u dont know the content, try diff ways to understand that concept. Yt vids, lecture notes, ask teachers/friends/cousins. Chatgpt. 
OKAY but this wont work if youre a slacker, because if youre like me, knowing that u dont know the content wont necessarily push u to study. Then how? Idk man. U HAVE TO push urself. Even a 10 min study 30 min chill type revision schedule is better than vegetating. 
[TLDR FAILING IS NOT NORMAL AND U CANNOT GET USED TO IT. What have u been learning the entire year bruh. Brush up on ur content and seal any gaps.]

3. Also if ur friends are getting similar grades as u (im talking about failing or close to failing), u should not use it as ur consolation that ‘my friends are failing too so its ok’ because its NOT 😐. Dont have to ditch ur friends either (unless they tell u failing is ok), u just have to focus on urself and tell urself that u need to get better. Dont be stagnant and stuck in that dark place of bad grades just because knowing youre not the only one in that position makes u feel better. Set urself as your own standard or look up to schmates who did better than u without putting urself down cuz u are not trash 💯. 
[TLDR JUST COS UR FRIENDS DIDNT DO WELL TOO DOESNT GIVE U AN EXCUSE TO FEEL HAPPY WITH UR BAD GRADE]

4. If u love doomscrolling 😍 on tiktok or insta or snapchat or yt or whatevs, make sure its not a problem for u. Pls dont doomscroll while studying cos its so damn addictive and youll end up wasting away for 3h after a min of studying. Imo, delete insta and use the web version. Why? Cos theres no reels button and the interface is kind of a turnoff (=less addictive 🥰). Might work for yt but not sure about the rest (u can figure out a way). 
[TLDR REDUCE DOOMSCROLLING, FIGHT THE URGE]

5. If you’re having trouble even getting started picking up a pen to study or flip through ur notes, i get that. U just feel so drained and even when u try to read the words they just dont register at all. In that case, u might have to talk to someone about it cos u might have underlying issues (possibly depression or serious burnout or maybe u feel too swamped and overwhelmed im not sure). Something might be wrong and i didnt bother addressing my issues, look how i turned out 😭. Most importantly dont take it out on urself because it wont help u at all. Just try ur best to push through okay. Or u can dm me to talk cos sometimes sharing about issues with people u dont know is easier. 
[TLDR LACK OF MOTIVATION, get some help maybe]

6. Last one, dont be complacent and set ur standards realistically. U see all these miracle stories on reddit of people jumping from 40->90 and they rightfully deserve that 🫡, but u CANT just slack and expect the same thing to happen to u. U cant sit and wait for the bell curve to save ur bum or pray to kongzi or any god without putting in effort and hope to get a crazy rp. I had this mindset that since my seniors who failed certain subjects (even during prelim) ended up doing well, maybe i have a chance of doing well too despite failing prelims and maybe thats why i didnt bother trying that much harder for As 😔. This kinda mindset means youve alr lost the race even if u end up doing well; the race against urself. So dont think youll be one of the miracle scorers of 2025, just try to drag urself off the bum sofa and start working (even 5 min a day to start ur study arc is enough (only at the start tho)). 
[TLDR DONT CHILL AND HOPE THAT YOULL SCORE WELL WITHOUT WORKING HARD]

Okay thats about it. I probs missed out some of the things i wanted to say but thats the bulk of it. Ultimately As is a final boss that u have to whack the heck out of, and its sad that u have to mug ur bum off just to score well even if u dont like the subject. But as long as u give ur best, no matter what u get, at least youll be able to hold ur head high and say that u already gave it ur all so u wont have any regrets (trust me the post result regret is not something u want to experience 🥲). Of course like others have said, dont stress too much and take breaks and enjoy ur j2 experience, but if youre a hardcore slacker u probs need to stress more BUT not too much. Feel free to talk to me or ur seniors or friends or cousins or relatives if u need it, might be helpful 🫡 Alright jiayou and happy mugging 🦾🦾💥

Like my teacher always confiscated my iPad whenever she had the chance to and called my parents and last time when me and my friend were late, ALL SHE DID WAS POINT AT ME AND SCREAM AT ME infront of the class and my friend didn't even get acknowledged. It's clear the teacher only dislikes me heh.. And this year is worse my favourite science teacher changed to this annoying science teacher who only took my iPad when everyone was literally playing games in their iPad. Only mine. Because my form teachers decide to put me in the front row and the teachers are blind when it comes to the back row. She's like ""why can't I confiscate your iPad? "" and she promised to return it to me next lesson but she gave my form teacher who was very delighted to call my parents so I will get yelled and beat up. It's so sad and like my math teacher always picks my deskmate because she is really poor at maths and always fails. And my deskmate started complaining loudly and suddenly his attention shifted to me??? I was always doing well in math and he would say I'm distracted for not listening when I literally wrote down all the questions and solved them before he did. All I did was draw a bit because what do u expect me to do while waiting for you?? And he always gave me the hardest questions and when I ans them he gets annoyed. That time I answered the question correctly everyone agreed and he said it was wrong and scolded me. And when another student answewd exactly what I said he wrote it down and said it was correct?? Just one more working. And after school he scolded me for 30minutes and said I'll do very badly if I continue drawing in class and not listening. get a life man. My Chinese form teacher help makes my day better by letting other students have their iPads back but of course keeps mine for 3 days. And I studied 2 weeks, memorised my entire Chinese oral script to prenset in front of the class. I admit I did look at the script because I'm really shy and I was too nervous to look at the teacher. I tried the be Loud but I have a chronic sore throat and cough. If I got any louder my voice would literally start croaking and I would have a coughing fit. How is it my fault you would give us a microphone and say u can't hear us? I tried my best I'm not as healthy as loud as the others. I got 55 for Chinese because of that. I couldn't believe my score because I actually worked so hard for it. Hah no one else in my class got below 60.. Even my friend who used CHATGPT for her Chinese oral and did it 1 day before with no preparation whatsoever and stumbled over her words got a fucking 65. I didn't funble my words and studied for weeks I tried my best and it wasn't enough? Everyone said my script was good except for my sister who was always on odds with me. Maybe I should have used chatgpt... I thought it was good. I get my teacher hates me but to this extent? Maybe I should try to be a teachers pet.. 😞",User_deleted,0

1j47t41,5,2025-03-05,Dumb question? about students consistently citing wrong edition of text.,u/H0pelessNerd,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1j47t41/dumb_question_about_students_consistently_citing/,"TL;DR: Students citing a different edition of text. Why? And what, if anything, to do?   
  
\-----------  
N.B.: This is *not* an invitation to discuss the shortcomings of discussions or of online teaching. I teach online, and we do discussions, so it's not up for debate. And yes, I already know how to fail them if they don't do the job (which I'm constantly trying to make harder for ChatGPT to do, and with some success). So while I do sincerely appreciate the support in doing so, it's not necessary to point that out.  
  
But I do have these **two specific questions** today: 

All of a sudden, most of my students are citing the wrong edition of the textbook in their discussion posts. My immediate suspicion is that they are either (a) getting posts from other people's classes from Chegg or similar, or (b) asking ChatGPT and whatnot to generate posts with citations and the high school edition is its favorite source. (Although a couple of weeks ago I got a different, weird little niche edition cited.) 

At first, I thought one or two folk had taken the course already in high school, but now I'm seeing my dual ed students doing this! A hard copy in their library that's easier to use than our eBook (which is a low bar, let me tell you) is a possibility, but wouldn't explain our regular students doing it when there's a hard copy of our edition in our libraries. 

The simple solution is to say 'you can't cite other editions,' and I plan to do that. But that won't satisfy my curiosity, which is now *burning*. So I thought I'd ask: **Have y'all seen this before? And what might it mean?**   
  
The more complicated solution, and the one by far more miserable for me, is to call every single damn one of them in and tell them that if they can't show me their physical copy of the high school edition then ipso facto they did not write this post themselves and I'm reporting their asses. **What would you do?**

i am in eleventh grade. why am i seeing other teenagers in my grade not knowing how to spell basic words? not having the keyboard memorised? not knowing how to pronounce basic words? using ai for everything? not bothering to read anything because they don't know a word and can't be bothered to do a ""\*word\* definition"" google seach?

i talk to my tenth grade science teacher every day after school because i really vibe with her and the amount of conversations we've had over teenagers not knowing the most basic of things is baffling and i feel like no one else in my school bats an eye.

the amount of times i've overheard other eleventh graders saying that they're using chatgpt to write summaries for books because they can't be bothered to read or whatever is mental. or using some app to do their algebra 2 work because they don't know how to do it.

the reason i say that i feel as if i'm in the twilight zone is because i would not consider myself an exceptional student or someone who is super smart above the rest of kids in my grade. i don't read that often, i'm quite lazy, etc. and i feel like i'm going crazy because how am i noticing this but no one else seems to notice it or care?? we're one grade away from graduating and you can't read a small paragraph out loud?? is that not concerning?? am i the only one in this school who thinks that teachers should not have to be explaining to seventeen year olds what ""spite"" means or how to spell ""mirror""?? why is ""aloof"" a vocab word, shouldn't everyone know what that means by now?? is someone in honours/advanced english asking what an e-book is not concerning??

My teachers have so CLEARLY and blatantly been using AI to give me feedback and it's not even accurate. PLEASE its actually pissing me off because it's so obvious, it's like they put no effort in trying to hide it.

Let me give you some little anecdotes:  
My EE. I do NOT trust any of my 'ib teachers', whether they are ib certified is another topic to be questioned(used to be an A level school, and next year will be A level again, cooked.) So I got a external tutor(s), for EVERYTHING, EE, TOK, History, Math, Physics, Eco. I also got it graded by Clasify twice for EACH, yes this is getting expensive ey, all in a span of 3 months, the cost is amounting fr, okay so I got my EE to be a 29 by clasify, nice, I had to restart in December because my teacher had said its an A, with 27, but my whole EE was just too broad, so clasify gave me 14, 1 mark away from a D, my external tutor agreed (qualified and current IB Math EE and IA examiner and moderator), okay great I redo it, get 29. nice. my teacher agrees, gives me 28 just to be sure, life is good. then suddenly a RANDDDDOm ass goofy ass teacher who idek if hes a real math teacher, used chatgpt SO OBVIOUUSSSLY and said it gave him 18/34 and they have to put the predicted to 18, I argued and now idek what it is but idrc I asked my examiners online and they said they dont care what teachers say, they grade how THEY think it is. BUT THE AUDACITY of this teacher to COPY AND PASTE it from chatgpt and send it to me, with the bold text, the BLUE DIAMOND symbol, and little emojis, everything. Absolutely ridiculous.

and rightnow I just got a chatgpt feedback from my taecher for my IA, but they read through it atleast and added her own little comments, atleast thats respectful yk, but some parts of the feedback were just wrong so I had to correct them, but thats okay atleast they put effort unlike the other teachers.

  
okay enough with the anecdotes, because theres so many times this happened and I could talk about it forever.

Here is my perspective on this matter:

Teacher usage of ChatGPT or any AI alike, is a like putting a reverse button on evolution, in the past millennia , us humans have grown and learnt so much and evolved so much in our cognitive thinking and views, especially within the last century. Yet the teacher's reliance on these tools, reduces their cognitive and subconcious ability to actually help us, for they rely on the AI, to give us feedback, lowering their ability to give us real and valuable feedback over time. Like I argued before, a reverse on evolution.   
They say that ChatGPT will change the world and bring us forward to new technologies and thinking. Sure I agree it WILL change the world. Now changing it in a good way or bad way? For ""new technologies"" does not mean a better and more developed life.

AI rightnow is wrong. In all its ways, it makes errors that are very obvious, and others that are more hidden, teachers are NOT supposed to be using these sort of tools, it is inaccurate, vague and invaluable, and gives a wrong grade. It is objective, it follows a set of rules, yet it also deviates from these rules, for IA is a self learning machine, it feeds on things it sees, it tries to be as they say 'human' yet it is wrong, and it CANNOT develop its OWN feelings, only replicate, a sort of uncreative machine that is so confidently displayed to be revolutionary in its thinking. Whilst, I do agree it is revolutionary, I reject to believe that it has a more advanced thinking. For it is simply replicating our own thinking. Yes, it is evolving on its own, but it will never reach the thinking of a human, we are so conscious being unlike machines. 

This educational usage of AI, is a very dangerous spot, its a vicious spiral -> teachers use it -> they become reliant on it -> their abilities to give us valuable insights reduce -> they move away from their role as teacher, and simply a messenger. 

I am speaking towards the TEACHER's usage of this. For students, it is a valuable educational tool, not for papers or writing, but instead to learn topics, if used well, can be very valuable. But in delicate places like grading, and important affaires, like OFFICIAL IB GRADES, are NOT to be messed with. This is NOT a joke, and I urge something to be done. Yet I know this simple reddit post on the unofficial IB community will not do anything, and IB really does not care, this is an issue between Schools and teachers.   
That claim I asserted above, is without a doubt the reality that we face today. And I endorse this view, but again, it is also complicated, for this is NOT just an issue between schools and teachers, this will change the world in a couple years. Education and skill will fall, and it may never come back, excluding those are actually acknowledge this may not take part to that downfall of humanity.

I may be very drastic in my literature here, I do not deny that. I am simply stating my perspective on this very complicated matter. 

Let me reaffirm what I am saying about Teacher's using AI for IAs. This use impacts our IA grades, moderated or not, IAs can be subjective, yes there is a markscheme, but the IA itself needs to be actually READ to give a mark, and feedback. The IA can say you havent done something, when you actually have. Furthermore, it can inflate your grade when in reality you are no where near that mark. Just like my initial EE, Revision Dojo, my teacher, Chatgpt, all gave me a 27-32/34 range, when in reality it was just a 14/34. This is not just a one time case, I am seeing my classmates finally get external moderation and tutoring, in addition to Clasify, and they are all having the same issues, I hope most are able to fix it, since we are already in March. But this is a ridiculous thing to do as a teacher, you are not only putting the student's future at risk, but your own future, there ARE no benefits of using AI, apart from the short 30m-1h save of time in your life. I wish there was something the world or IB could do about this, but again, people are sneaky, they will use, and that is something that will never change, I hope the small minority of us that do not use it in a dishonest way, will succeed in life. 

Yall can clearly see what TOK has done to me. please. get me out of IB.   
AGAIN I CANNNNOT GET OUT WIT HTHESE GOOFY teachers using AI, like bro comeon, you got 1 thing to do. (Not even that, but im in a small school, please in every class it ranges from 2-7 people. Except for Eco being 20. Like the audacity some teachers have please its actually annoying).

Ever since the day I landed in the US I hear everyone complaining about how bad the market is and that no one is gonna get a job and the heavy emphasis on doing leetcode and nothing else mattered annoyed me a lot because I hated it. I am about to graduate in 2 months with no job and no knowledge. I lost my love for CS which I had in my undergrad. I used to love CS back in my hometown because I was not under any pressure and built whatever projects I felt like building but ever since I came to the US I’ve not built a single CS project during my masters journey and the only one I built was part of a course and I built it using ChatGPT. I am extremely disappointed with myself and afraid. I do not know what to do because I now I can neither sit to build a project which I so dearly loved doing in my undergrad nor can I study leetcode. I have been disconnected with this field for 2 years thereby learning nothing in the process. I have forgotten everything and also have lost the ability to sit and do anything. I recently went through a breakup (a very bad one she cheated) and that is also weighing heavily in my head and my heart. I am so used to comfort and getting things easily that I am suffering now. I’ve never really worked hard or put myself out there. I have pretty good grades (3.8/4.0) but the market doesn’t give two shits about it. I tried learning leetcode but I just can’t get good at it. I feel like running away or wishing I could stop time and just calm down. I have an interview day after which I most probably wouldn’t be giving because I spent most of my mental and emotional energy on the relationship and had no energy to prepare for the interview. I do not feel like giving the interview day after I just want to cry (although I have quite a lot). I just can’t be disciplined like my peers and I feel hollow in my chest. My ex on the other hand just needed me for emotional comfort and is extremely successful in her field. I do not know what to do or where to go. I am terrified of interviews and scared of failure. I am an international student which makes it extra hard to get a job. I simply feel like I am built for this field and the struggle and hard work required to excel in this field. ,active,2

Or cry. Or have a nervous breakdown. But maybe someone will find some humor in this shit show.

**Act One:** I caught 20% of my class blatantly cheating on a homework assignment. Just blatant. I don't have time to meet with each student so, I used a different policy: I give a zero and you can contest it in writing with an explanation as to how three plagiarism detectors and the instructor all committed a false positive. *Two of the most egregious cases had the audacity to contest.* It's a miracle. Both assignments were identical. How could this have happened?

**Act Two:** This morning I woke up to a formal complaint from one of these students sent directly to the head dean. *Strangely, it wasn't against me.* It was against a random classmate claiming that they cheated on an exam 2 months ago. There was a thinly veiled accusation that I don't take cheating seriously enough *despite having given this exact student a zero for cheating.* Chaos ensues. The dean wonders why he is involved in this drama. The student is pulled into the chair's office and seems to have been implored to apologize to both of us and they confirmed that the intention was to retaliate against me for the zero, via filing a complaint against a random student.

**Act Three:** One of my best students in another class was caught blatantly cheating. He gives me a BS reason citing using ChatGPT when the entire assignment between two students was copied. I also had to break the news that I could no longer write a letter of recommendation for them. They broke down crying. It was hard to watch. But FAFO. Come on!

**Act Four:** One woman wrote me a nasty email because I would not let her make up an in-class assignment due to an animal being sick. There was a lot of ""you"" in the message. I nicely asked her to check her tone against graduate level expectations of communication. Another guy ripped me a new one in a feedback survey about how the project was going. Lots of crying about how I didn't teach them what they needed for the project and how the workload is too much. *Had he not been laughing continuously for 2 hours every single class* with the woman next to him he may have learned something. I sent the same message about tone and responded that he wanted to meet *man-to-man*.   Interestingly, all three are in the same final project group, so I am guessing their project is not going well. *Now both have complaints against me because they couldn't take the carefully worded criticism.* 

**It is only Tuesday.**

This whole thing is a shit show of cheating, lack of accountability, lack of care from the faculty (this is an ancillary program rather than a department), inability to understand English at the most basic level, and rudeness. Arrrgghhhhh!",User_deleted,448

1ja5arf,52,2025-03-13,Worst prepped student but got the pass,u/Ar-med,step1,https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/1ja5arf/worst_prepped_student_but_got_the_pass/,"Hey everyone, before I start, I'd just like to say, please don't ever attempt what I did, it was totally stupid and planned poorly. 

I managed to pass Step 1, done Feb 27, while feeling wholly unprepared for it. Here's some stats

Uworld: 20% done, 58% average

NBME 25: 63%

NBME 26: 62%

NBME 29: 72%

Free120: 73%

All other NBMEs, UW SA 1 and 2: Not done

  
I was a slacker in med school, barely studying at all and getting by with pitiful scores, low GPA type of student. Had to repeat many failed courses. Thus, I had a pretty poor foundation in medicine as a whole, and when I started studying for Step 1, it became abundantly obvious. My first few UW blocks had averages ranging around 40%, and it stayed that way for the first 10 or so. Very demotivating. I realized alot of the problem was that I didn't sit down and properly understand the pathology of what's going on, I instead just relied on memorizing mnemonics and word connections without fully grasping what was going on. I've since come to realize that pathology is the heart of medicine, and knowing something is wrong, comes after knowing what is normal, so physiology is the heart of pathology. 

My study sources were mainly UW, FA, Pathoma, and Dirty Medicine, along with some ChatGPT. I can not stress this enough: crunch out Uworld questions. Do at least 1 block a day, and accelerate up to 2 blocks a day if you feel more comfortable with the topics discussed. I tried reading First Aid cover to cover, but realized I got bored very quickly and didn't retain much. The content I retained the best was the stuff I was tested on in UWorld. My study strategy boiled down to:

Wake up, Do Uworld block and review it. Takes about 4 hours. While reviewing it, I kept a notepad open and noted down the names of topics in the questions that I wanted to research and understand further. After finishing the review, I'd go straight to First Aid and CTRL+F and search for those specific topics. Pathoma was a once in a week thing where I would binge any specific organ systems or topics to get a deeper understanding. Dirty Medicine on YT was GREAT, for memorizing just about any topic. He won't go very deep in detail, but he's amazing when you have a ton of stuff to memorize and are low on time. Finally, ChatGTP is amazing since it'll teach you concepts exactly how you ask it to. Either very easy, simplified, understandable (most trivial topics), or deep and properly explained for big topics I knew I needed to know better. 

That's pretty much it, just UW grinding with FA, Pathoma, and DirtyMedicine reinforcement. I slacked off alot during this study period, and in the 2 months I designated, I barely did 10 Uworld blocks in the first month. Despite all that, I finally locked in about 10 days before the exam, and mass studied just about any topic I came across. NBMEs were all done in the last week, I was doing 1 every 2 days which I DON'T recommend. Space out your NBMEs over the course of months and review them properly. I was entering the exam sleep deprived, memorizing stuff late into the night and early morning, regretting all the time I wasted for months prior. Powered through it, and got my pass today.

  
A little advice: Grind out questions, note down which topics come up and how frequently. You'll quickly notice that some topics, like Cystic Fibrosis or drugs that affect CYP in the liver, come up much more frequently than other questions that test very niche topics. Get REALLY good at commonly tested topics, and you can honestly ignore the niche ones since they're so rare that they're not worth the study time nor brain space. Also, if you need fast but fun learning, Dirty Medicine on 2x speed is very efficient for covering a lot of content quickly. Like, imagine learning about all the Lysosomal storage diseases in under 10 mins. Also, Melman is VERY useful, but he made alot of content. While they're all good, I would say his best work is the HY arrows, it'll take you a couple hours to read through it but the content is absolutely gonna score you maybe 5-10% of the exam. 

  
As for my exam experience specifically, I noticed that there were a ton more Ethics questions than in Uworld, so if you're doing the exam anytime soon, get REALLY good at ethics. It felt like 20% of the exam was just ethics alone. Additionally, be good with HIV, it's treatment, and potential immunocompromised infectious causes. If you guys have any questions, feel free to ask in the comments and I'll try my best to be helpful. Remember, I'm not telling you to do what I did, I think I fucked up alot and my knowledge was held together by duct tape, but what I am telling you is that even if you're a total fuck up you can still absolutely pass this exam with limited time and knowledge.

During that meeting, what do I say?  I've had students look me in the eye and deny everything in the face of stronger proof than this.  I've had a student file a complaint (thankfully dismissed) against me after a conversation that went approximately:

>Me: The prompt was \[repeats prompt\].  Why did you write what you did?

>Student: I don't remember.

>Me: That's a problem, that you don't remember.  It's also a problem that this software notes your response is more likely to be generated by an AI than a human.

This year things have not gone to plan AT ALL. I realised that I don't have as much motivation as I did in sixth form and secondary school to complete school work, and I haven't caught the hang of programming/learnt as much as I thought I would have. In fact, I still feel awful about my coding skills.

I took a big risk in applying for this course as I was always good at finance/accounting since I never had to do too much for it and always got the top grades but I found it VERY BORING and generic. So I wanted to try out CS and hopefully gain a spark and get a passion for this. However this risk is NOT going to plan AT ALL

My first semester I had to abuse chatgpt to help me do all my coding (C language) coursework and in my 2nd semester I've stopped using it now for Java, but instead I've been asking my coursemates for help. However, at this point in time I don't like programming, I feel really anxious at the thought of having to code by myself/ the thought of coursework. I also feel like I haven't progressed the way I should've.

The thing is, when I'm motivated I can sit down and watch all these videos and take in the content, but I'm never able to apply my knowledge to any of my coursework. This is a first for me as in all my school work in my previous education I used to always be able to apply my learning to my school work, now since its not working I feel hopeless at programming. It's such a shame as this has been my dream since 2022, when I finished secondary school and I feel like I've wasted my time. I keep thinking of the future, and dropping out/going into finance and accounting, however I want to trust the process as rome wasnt built in a day, and I wanna pursue this career but this dream is getting harder every day. 

I feel like I've failed my parents as I've begged them to let me move 3 hours away and join this russell group to further improve my ability to get a job in the future.

I also feel really bipolar(if thats the correct term idk) at this uni, as whenever im alone in my accom, I get thoughts of dropping out/switching course, but when i see my coursemates and people who study cs in my cohort that feeling washes away and I feel myself again. However, I get really anxious when I hear/see other in my cohort dropout as i feel like i should be doing the same, but i don't want to. This is the first time in my life where ive had mental health problems and Im going through barely anything compared to other stories which more like a weakling. Im blessed to be in this position to be studying at a RG in CS.

Im currently averaging 50%, just a 2:2 from my first semester grades.

Q: I REALLY REALLY DON'T want to dropout and set myself back so I was just wondering that if I continue and I finish and graduate with a 2:2 / 2:1(hopefully) and I still dislike programming, could i switch into a finance/accounting sector and abandon my programming or is that not possible. Please answer this question.

Im aware this is long, there may be grammar+spelling mistakes sorry, and I appreciate every single response (hateful/positive/honest). 

I hope you all never go through what I'm thinking rn and good luck to you all in your bright future.

Additionally, people in my class took the same test for their respective subjects but cheated and used chatgpt or had someone do the exam for them which i find really unfair and demotivating. In the end they pass with flying colors despite not studying at all. I feel like the education system has become really unfair recently with the use of AI by students and puts students who are honest at a disadvantage. Okay, I might've not prepared well enough for this test but at least I didn't cheat my way into university. Anyway, enough of that before it turns into a rant. I'm not sure on what to do now as there isn't really a plan B because of how difficult it is to find my major of choice in English, especially for a bachelor's degree in Europe. What can I do now? I really don't want to give up and just throw away my future, especially since my family would be pretty sad and disappointed in me. What do I even tell my mother? I know there's always a ""we'll get em next time"" but in this situation with these circumstances I think that a solution is difficult. ",User_deleted,1

I received offers to study a masters at several RG unis including some that were on the top end. Unfortunately, due to personal circumstances, I went to a lower-ranked uni for the masters; I didn't think its ranking was terrible at first (around 450 in the world). However, given that it's generally easier to get into a uni for postgrad compared to undergrad, the students at this particular uni have come from significantly lower ranked unis (think around 900 in the world or below, also with a 2:2 in their undergrad) and they're rather useless academically. I don't mean to lump everybody in the same boat - I'm sure there are clever people going to less well ranked unis. 

However, these students are extremely useless on group projects. At other unis, normally anytime there's groupwork to be done, there'll be a person or two who won't participate. At this uni, everyone in the group but me doesn't seem to have a clue what they're doing. They'll tell me to check their work, but when I do point out issues, they get offended. They tell me to give them work as they don't want me doing everything (we get evaluated based on how much we contributed) but whenever I do, they produce work that looks like it was straight up copied off of chatgpt. If I don't supervise everything they do, they'll do a terrible job that I think would be deserving of a fail grade. They contribute zero ideas in discussions. At the end when we're each asked to state our contribution to group work, they'll claim they contributed to things that I did on my own, and then get defensive and argumentative when I dispute their claims. Even the simplest and most straightforward tasks get delegated to chatgpt, almost as if incapable or too lazy to read stuff on their own. It has me wondering what they're doing with all their time. Although it isn't my business, they're also clueless in class as none of them ever know the answers whenever the teachers ask a question.

They yawn loudly through lectures, play video games, arrive when 90% of class is over, expect it to be some version of a nursery for adults. Many of my cohort are from wealthy families overseas with no intention of studying but the homegrown students aren't better and also think this is another round of high school. It's just pathetic.

Then there's the staff. The students constantly abuse them, so they're jaded and angry. Sure this isn't MIT and you know what? Maybe I'm not smart enough for MIT. But I do know how to apply myself and do more than the absolute minimum. This is supposed to be a challenge and an opportunity to improve. You do something like this because you want to prove you are capable of managing difficult problems. This is supposed to be a test. Not a vacation.

Sorry if this sounds like a rant. But it astonishes me. I don't give a shit if someone wants to come along and tell me to mind my own business. My business was to study a degree because university seemed like a good place to learn.

Now, I recognize that my professors assign too many damn readings... so I use it mostly to effectively capture the main ideas of each article/reading and cut 15 hours of reading into 3. However, there have certainly been a couple of times where I've used it to help me ideate outlines for papers, or to re-word a paragraph that I thought could be more concise. But, guys: I'm in grad school. My colleagues and I are in *graduate-level* courses. So why, in this godforsaken program, am I seeing students in their mid-to-late twenties contributing to group work with copy-pasted ChatGPT bullet points? *Especially* when the prompt was obviously barely thought out, therefore making the AI response barely relevant?

No joke: I had an end-of-semester reflection for one of my team assignments, where we all chose a question and answered it. One of my teammates, a *grown ass man*, used ChatGPT to answer, ""What was one of the most important things you learned in this course?"" and then copy-pasted the generated bullet points directly onto the document. I cannot make this up. It was an OPINION-BASED QUESTION, and you needed *AI to answer it for you?* 

At this point, using AI effectively seems like a resume-worthy ability. Like, when I'm using NotebookLM to summarize and synthesize my weekly readings, I intentionally phrase my prompts to include course concepts from my class notes. A lot of our classes are discussion-based, so I make sure every key term is defined and I have a good enough understanding of the material to make meaningful contributions to the conversation. It's a little more time consuming, but it's so effective and I'm still actually learning something. Some of my classmates are showing up with horribly rendered ChatGPT summaries, not contributing, and then projecting that same lack of work ethic onto our group projects. It's embarrassing!

If I’m being honest, I’m not super passionate about CS, I mostly chose it because I didn’t know what else to do, and I knew it was a flexible degree and also there was no degree that I would have wanted to pursue over this.

Also I know AI won’t completely replace developers, but it feels like only the best of the best will thrive, and I don’t think I’m on that level. I can learn and build things but I feel like I'm over reliant on chatgpt and I also don't enjoy coding for hours upon hours

This class has a lot of ""discussion"" assignments that essentially boil down to you asking ChatGPT questions that are given to you by the instructor and using that info to write a report. 

This rubbed me the wrong way partly because pursuing a higher education isn't cheap so at the bare minimum I would expect effort to be put in by the instructor to teach me themselves rather than out source the work to ai. It also seems unfair to those abstaining from ai to force them to use it for a majority of their final grade. 

The much more glaring issue, however, is the fact that ai often makes stuff up as I'm sure a lot of you know. For a university to cite the words of an ai as fact seems problematic to say the least. Not only are the students' ability to perform in a job in their field being harmed by the potential of learning false information but this also teaches everyone taking this class that ai is a credible source. 

I brought this all up to my academic counselor but all I got was some seemingly scripted corporate nonsense that didn't actually address my concerns at all. The most I got was that employers in the industry want their potential employees to ""be able to use ai confidently"". Even from an anti-ai perspective, I can understand why a university would need to bend a knee to the wishes of employers. That being said, I still think a fairly acclaimed school citing information from ai that hasn't been fact checked in their curriculum is totally unacceptable and is damaging to their academic integrity. 

As of right now I'm unsure of what my next move should be because my ability to get a job once I graduate could be affected if I don't have the information and skills necessary to perform but I am doing my best to find somewhere to voice my concerns so that they are heard and hopefully acted upon by the right people.

**Listen up, fellow code monkeys, future leetcoders, and CS ""majors"" who just realized O(2\^n) is bad:**  
We need to **talk** about the absolute **onslaught** of **AI-generated slop** flooding this sub.

# What Is AI Slop?

AI Slop™ is any **low-effort, incoherent, or outright wrong post** that was obviously written by ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or whatever **glorified autocomplete** you’re using this week. These posts are **barely human, devoid of soul, and usually riddled with garbage-tier advice** like:

🔹 **""Computer science is a vast and ever-growing field full of opportunities!""**  
🔹 **""The best programming language to learn in 2025 depends on your career goals.""**  
🔹 **""Internships are an excellent way to gain experience in the industry.""**  
🔹 **""Here is a 500-word essay on recursion that says nothing useful.""**

# How to Spot AI Slop™

AI-generated posts usually have:  
✔ **Weirdly formal phrasing** nobody actually uses in CS discussions  
✔ **Over-explained definitions** of basic concepts like Big-O, internships, or ""how to study for coding interviews""  
✔ **Super generic career advice** that might as well be for business majors  
✔ **NO actual human experience, struggle, or meme references**

Basically, if a post reads like **a high school essay written by a robot that just discovered Stack Overflow**, it’s AI Slop.

# Why Is AI Slop a Problem?

1️⃣ **DILUTES GOOD DISCUSSIONS:**  
Instead of seeing real posts like **""I bombed my Google interview, here's what I learned""**, we get **""To get an internship, you must network and apply to jobs""** — NO ONE ASKED.

2️⃣ **LOW-EFFORT, HIGH-VOLUME SPAM:**  
Some of you are **pumping out** AI-generated garbage just for karma. Stop it. Go outside. Touch the nearest BST (binary search tree).

3️⃣ **INCORRECT OR OUTDATED INFO:**  
AI loves to hallucinate **fake** facts about CS. Next thing you know, some poor freshman is out here believing **""Bubble Sort is used in real-world applications""** (IT'S NOT).

4️⃣ **FEELS LIKE TALKING TO A ROBOT:**  
We want posts with **real human experiences, panic attacks over OOP design, and existential crises about job markets.** Not **""Python is a versatile language often used in data science.""**

# How Do We Stop It?

🚀 **Report** AI-generated nonsense when you see it.  
🚀 **Call it out** — **""This sounds like AI Slop, did you write this yourself?""**  
🚀 **Mods should start nuking obvious AI Slop posts.**  
🚀 **If you're posting something, WRITE LIKE A HUMAN.** Use sarcasm, pain, and regret, like a real CS major.

# Final Thoughts

AI Slop is making this sub unreadable. **Do your part.** Stop the flood. Let’s keep r/csmajors full of **real**, **unhinged**, **panicked**, and **over-caffeinated** CS students **who are barely holding it together.**

Death threats are vile enough already, but the fact that these are being made because the prof of a (fairly easy!) math course didn't dumb the final down enough for you is pretty damning on the state of the current cohort of college students.

I suspect this kind of decline in general math aptitude (and increase in entitlement) has two causes: ChatGPT and SAT abolition.

The ChatGPT I believe a lot of fellow TAs/instructors can relate to: students start asking ChatGPT for all the answers to their homework, they stop showing up to lectures/office hours, they end up failing on the in-person final because most of them didn't bother to actually study anything.

In 2021 the University of California announced that SATs would be completely ignored when considering prospective undergrad applications. What followed then has been a slow but steady backslide in the baseline standards of entering freshmen. 4 years ago, there weren't courses like MATH 2 teaching college students basic shit they should already have learned before coming here. The current state of reality, where students feel so entitled that they crash out when the prof doesn't basically leak the final (to what is a very basic class) is downstream of this decline in basic expectations.

For the first thing there's unfortunately not much universities can do. What are they going to do, petition the government to ban LLMs entirely? However, the second thing can be rectified: the UCs can bring back SATs as a requirement. If you can't do basic hs math you shouldn't be let into college. Simple as!",active,219

Nevertheless, because I am so bored, I thought it might be entertaining to pursue with the application.

A few days later, I join the google meet for my scheduled interview, and lo and behold, its not an interview but more of a sales call with 8 other confused participants. We were then asked to record some videos for them which they would use for advertising. I asked why I have been invited to this call if I applied for a job directly at a school to which I didn't receive a straight answer. **Conclusion - the advert on indeed was more than likely fake**. 

To make it even more amusing, after not sending a video I received three more generic emails saying I had been offered an interview.

1jh0c1g,1,2025-03-22,"DeepSeek ""analyzes"" why cheating with ChatGPT in IB assessments doesn't work",u/FlyingFish28,IBO,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/1jh0c1g/deepseek_analyzes_why_cheating_with_chatgpt_in_ib/,"I have experienced using ChatGPT to write sections then getting a bad score in MYP. I find that DeepSeek is far better at reasoning tasks and critical thinking, and gasps the criteria better than ChatGPT, so I decided to let it roast ChatGPT cheating. The Chinese do make good stuff.

Prompt:  
I have heard about students cheating on IB assessments with ChatGPT and receiving a 4 or 5 maximum. Why?

Response:

The issue of students using tools like \*\*ChatGPT\*\* to complete IB assessments and receiving mid-range scores (e.g., 4 or 5 out of 8) is a growing concern. Here’s why this happens and why it’s not an effective strategy for achieving top marks:



\### \*\*1. Lack of Personal Voice and Authenticity\*\*

   \- \*\*Why it matters\*\*: The IB values \*\*authentic student work\*\* that reflects personal thinking, creativity, and reflection. ChatGPT-generated content often lacks a personal voice and may sound generic or overly polished.

   \- \*\*Why it results in mid-range scores\*\*: If the work doesn’t reflect the student’s unique perspective or genuine effort, it fails to meet the higher criteria for \*\*depth of reflection\*\* and \*\*personal engagement\*\*, which are essential for top marks.



\### \*\*2. Superficial Understanding of the Topic\*\*

   \- \*\*Why it matters\*\*: The IB emphasizes \*\*deep understanding\*\* and \*\*critical thinking\*\*. ChatGPT can generate well-structured text, but it may not demonstrate a nuanced or insightful understanding of the topic.

   \- \*\*Why it results in mid-range scores\*\*: If the content lacks depth or fails to address the topic in a meaningful way, it will only meet the basic criteria for \*\*knowledge and understanding\*\*, rather than excelling in \*\*analysis\*\* and \*\*evaluation\*\*.



\### \*\*3. Misalignment with Assessment Criteria\*\*

   \- \*\*Why it matters\*\*: IB assessments are highly structured and require students to address specific criteria (e.g., ATL skills, reflection, application of knowledge). ChatGPT may not fully align with these criteria unless carefully guided.

   \- \*\*Why it results in mid-range scores\*\*: If the work doesn’t explicitly address the assessment criteria or misses key elements (e.g., reflection on challenges, application of skills), it will only partially meet the requirements.



\### \*\*4. Over-Reliance on Generic Content\*\*

   \- \*\*Why it matters\*\*: ChatGPT often generates generic or formulaic content that doesn’t fully engage with the specific context or requirements of the task.

   \- \*\*Why it results in mid-range scores\*\*: Generic content may meet the basic requirements but won’t stand out as exceptional or demonstrate the \*\*creativity\*\* and \*\*originality\*\* needed for top marks.



\### \*\*5. Lack of Evidence and Specific Examples\*\*

   \- \*\*Why it matters\*\*: The IB requires students to support their work with \*\*specific evidence\*\* and \*\*detailed examples\*\*. ChatGPT may struggle to provide these unless explicitly prompted.

   \- \*\*Why it results in mid-range scores\*\*: Without concrete evidence or examples, the work may appear vague or unsupported, limiting its ability to meet the higher criteria for \*\*analysis\*\* and \*\*evaluation\*\*.



\### \*\*6. Inability to Reflect Deeply\*\*

   \- \*\*Why it matters\*\*: Reflection is a key component of IB assessments, especially in projects like the MYP Personal Project. ChatGPT can generate reflective statements, but they often lack depth and personal insight.

   \- \*\*Why it results in mid-range scores\*\*: Superficial reflection won’t meet the higher criteria for \*\*critical thinking\*\* and \*\*self-awareness\*\*, which are essential for top marks.



\### \*\*7. Risk of Detection\*\*

   \- \*\*Why it matters\*\*: IB teachers and examiners are trained to recognize work that doesn’t align with a student’s usual style or ability. Overly polished or inconsistent work may raise red flags.

   \- \*\*Why it results in mid-range scores\*\*: Even if the work isn’t flagged for academic misconduct, it may still receive a mid-range score because it doesn’t fully reflect the student’s capabilities or meet the higher criteria.



\### \*\*Why Students Still Use ChatGPT Despite the Risks\*\*

   \- \*\*Time Constraints\*\*: Some students use ChatGPT to save time, especially if they’re struggling to meet deadlines.

   \- \*\*Lack of Confidence\*\*: Students who lack confidence in their writing or ideas may turn to ChatGPT for help.

   \- \*\*Misunderstanding the Task\*\*: Some students may not fully understand the assessment criteria and assume that well-written content will automatically earn high marks.



\### \*\*How to Avoid Mid-Range Scores and Achieve Top Marks\*\*

1. \*\*Use ChatGPT as a Tool, Not a Crutch\*\*:

   \- Use ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas, improve sentence structure, or clarify concepts, but always revise and personalize the content to reflect your own voice and understanding.



2. \*\*Focus on Depth and Reflection\*\*:

   \- Go beyond surface-level analysis. Reflect deeply on your learning journey, challenges, and growth.



3. \*\*Align with Assessment Criteria\*\*:

   \- Carefully review the assessment criteria and ensure your work addresses each strand explicitly.



4. \*\*Provide Specific Evidence\*\*:

   \- Use detailed examples, data, and personal experiences to support your arguments and reflections.



5. \*\*Seek Feedback\*\*:

   \- Share your work with your teacher or supervisor for feedback before submitting it.



6. \*\*Be Authentic\*\*:

   \- Let your unique perspective and voice shine through. Authenticity is key to standing out in IB assessments.



\---



\### \*\*Example of a High-Scoring Approach\*\*

Instead of relying on ChatGPT to write entire sections, use it to:

   \- \*\*Brainstorm ideas\*\*: \*“What are some ways to improve the functionality of a school courtyard?”\*

   \- \*\*Improve clarity\*\*: \*“How can I make this sentence more concise?”\*

   \- \*\*Generate examples\*\*: \*“What are some real-world examples of successful public space redesigns?”\*



Then, take the generated content and \*\*revise it thoroughly\*\* to reflect your own voice, insights, and experiences.



\### \*\*Final Thoughts\*\*

While ChatGPT can be a helpful tool, it’s not a substitute for genuine effort, critical thinking, and personal reflection. To achieve top marks in IB assessments, focus on \*\*deep understanding\*\*, \*\*authenticity\*\*, and \*\*alignment with the assessment criteria\*\*. If you’d like, I can help you refine your work further to ensure it meets these standards! 😊",User_deleted,0

My journey from chaos to clarity had three phases:*

**1️⃣ The Dark Ages (January 2023 – April 2023)**  
My desk looked like a paper avalanche. I’d stay up until 2 AM stitching together mind maps, only to realize I’d forgotten key research studies. Students noticed. One asked, “Did you just Google this 5 minutes ago?” Ouch.  
*Stats:*

* 20+ papers scattered per lesson
* 3 all-nighters weekly
* 1 existential crisis during a PowerPoint crash

**2️⃣ The AI Experiment (May 2023 – July 2023)**  
I quit manual prep cold turkey. Tested 15+ tools. Most were clunky or off-topic (looking at you, chatbot that turned WWII lessons into baking tutorials). But three stuck:  
✅ **Elicit**: Dug up peer-reviewed papers faster than I could say “deadline.” But it couldn’t help with actual lesson flow.  
✅ **ChatGPT**: Generated debate prompts and quizzes in seconds… until it cited a fake study about “pyramid-building aliens.” *Facepalm.*  
✅ **Curipod** (or **Canva Magic Write**): Turned my messy uploads into sleek slides and predicted student questions like a mind reader.  
*Shortcomings I battled:*

* Tools hallucinating facts (RIP, my credibility)
* Robotic podcast voices confusing kids (*“Why does the narrator sound like Siri’s cousin?”*)

**3️⃣ The Breakthrough (August 2023 – Now)**  
I became an AI drill sergeant.  
*My routine:*

* 6 AM: Feed Curipod/Canva the week’s research. Let it build slides/mind maps.
* 3 PM: Run ChatGPT debate topics through three fact-checkers.
* 8 PM: Use MagicSchool.ai’s “student simulator” to grill myself on tricky questions. *Results:*
* Prep time cut from 10 hrs → 4 hrs weekly
* Student engagement up 60% (they love AI-generated role-play scenarios)
* Got my life back. Even binge-watched *Stranger Things* guilt-free.

**Tools That Saved Me:**  
🔹 **Elicit**: Academic paper hunter. Avoid for lesson plans.  
🔹 **ChatGPT**: Idea generator. *Always fact-check!*  
🔹 **Curipod/Canva Magic Write**: All-in-one wizards for slides, Q&A prep, and not sounding like a robot.

**The Lesson Here?**  
AI won’t replace teachers—but teachers who use AI will replace those who don’t. If a tech-clumsy, PowerPoint-hating introvert like me can nail this, you’ve got this too.

**PS:** 15 failed tools, 3 breakdowns, 1 viral “pyramid aliens” meme later… I’d do it all again.""",User_deleted,0

In a different course, the student submitted a paper that was, in its entirety, copied from an online source. From what I know, the student failed said courses and was able to retake them later.

Without chatgpt it feels hopeless getting to that level the effort wouldn't be worth the time put in, once I started using AI to aid me suddenly I was getting high b's like all of a sudden god blessed me with the gift of knowledge in the eyes of the teacher,""Hey maybe this kid could be the top of the class"" I kind of got lost and forgot my point on the way, I just find it so dumb how education hinders on the use of chat gpt now, the stereotypical child trying to break through the matrix yeah that entrepreneur shouting school is worthless in the real world, its getting more and more believable no wonder everyone fell for them pyramid schemes, you can see it too like some students are really strong in English legal but when it comes to tests or anything math related there skills are suddenly not there? Or when they get homework due suddenly they forgot there book and teachers don't punish at all

 It's not just that but the assignments themselves are marked with AI you can tell when reading the feedback, thanks but I could of prompted AI to mark my assignment with a rubric myself I just wrote it expecting a human would take the time to read through it. It makes me so appreciative when teachers come back with a physical copy and red pen marking everything with feedback throughout it. Too bad that teacher I'm thinking of is no longer teaching my class.

School education is so linear it's horrible no freedom in school at all not even in note taking. Devices are banned in Australia in school cause another old fasioned politician took over the country and doesn't think through any of the legislation he puts through, just completely banning devices in school over night, not regulating the use of mobile devices in school just banned all HSC students included, and the teachers talk so much skipping past everything . You can't think about it at all or pay attention to what there saying cause you gotta make your linear useless notes that don't even make sense cause you have no time to do mind maps or have time to summarise , god forgive the teacher doesn't get the lesson done shows more about how the government operates schools and the pressure they put on teachers which transfers to unrealistic expectations tbh, they wait a year before scolding you because you got a question wrong and didn't memorise it in your Own time, did you become a teacher to design PowerPoints for me to memorise in and out in my own time or to educate?? What do you mean in my own time?  , I had a question, but what's the question ,I don't really remember, just turned into a vent , this isn't your typical low education high school dropout saying school is terrible, as a debatably high achieving student, what the hell went wrong with it, this is supposed to prepare me for the real world is there even a point, I've been trying to get a part-time job for months now and haven't even gotten an interview my grades are the only thing decorating my resume there useless.

1jiumn1,1,2025-03-24,I hate it here.,u/Comfortable-Pay-8972,venting,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1jiumn1/i_hate_it_here/,"I honestly feel so frustrated and disheartened by my classmates. Most of them are academic achievers, yet they still resort to cheating, which makes everything feel so unfair—especially for those of us who actually work hard for our grades. It’s infuriating to see them claim achievements they don’t deserve, pretending that their success came from effort when, in reality, it was all dishonest and unearned.

What makes it worse is their laziness when it comes to group projects. Instead of doing the work, they drag other people into their last-minute cramming, forcing responsible students like me to pick up the slack. And when it comes to class-wide projects, it's always the same story—a handful of students do all the work while the rest sit back and take credit. During project evaluations, they give perfect scores to their boyfriends and girlfriends, even when those people contributed absolutely nothing. It’s so unfair that those who put in effort don’t get the recognition they deserve, while those who did nothing walk away with the same grades.

Even when it comes to exams and deadlines, they make things harder for students like me. I prepare and study early, yet they always beg for extensions because they are too tired, too busy, or just don’t care enough to manage their time properly. And the worst part? The teachers often give in to their requests, pushing deadlines back just to accommodate their irresponsibility—as if those of us who actually planned ahead don’t matter.

And just when I thought things couldn’t get more frustrating, one of my classmates took credit for something I did. She claimed that she had studied ahead of time using her own notes, when in reality, it was me who put in the effort to acquire and organize those notes. The sad part? I was the one who let her copy them in the first place. It feels like a complete betrayal of trust, knowing that I helped someone, only for them to use my work to boost themselves while I was left in the shadows. It’s incredibly disheartening to see people like this get away with dishonesty, receiving praise they don’t deserve while those of us who genuinely work hard go unnoticed.

Recently, there was a major project for our entire section, which was to create a film. They divided us into groups, each assigned specific tasks, but 90% of my classmates chose to be actors. I felt so bad for one of my classmates because he was completely taken advantage of. He didn’t know how to say no, so they used his car without even offering to pay for gas. On top of that, they rushed the entire production—they came up with a plot, but at the last minute, they just used ChatGPT instead of actually brainstorming. When it was time to film, there was no script for the actors, and I honestly believe they just winged everything.

I even used my own resources, the ones I normally use for my personal sideline business, just to help them. I wasn’t doing it for my grades—I just wanted to contribute and make sure we created something decent. We were given a whole month to complete the film, but in the middle of that, another huge section-wide project was dumped on us—this time, a dance collaboration with other sections. I was assigned to the props team, but instead of giving us time to prepare, they only started delegating tasks three days before the performance.

At that point, I knew we were doomed. Who in their right mind decides to start a massive props project just three days before a performance? It was overwhelming, and knowing my classmates, I could already tell that nothing was going to get done unless I stepped up. To make things worse, they were still prioritizing the film, completely ignoring the fact that we also had to work on the dance project.

On the first day of work, 90% of the props team was missing. There were only around 10 of us making props for 30 students, and there was so much to do. I called them out because it was unfair—we were left scrambling while the rest were off doing whatever they wanted. At the time, I wasn’t informed that most of them were actually actors. I had assumed they went home without contributing, and that misunderstanding led to tension. Later, I found out that they were badmouthing me behind my back while they were filming, which only made me feel worse about the whole situation.

On the second day, we had already completed the tasks assigned to us. I had no idea that we were also expected to help the other sections with their props—no one informed me until one of my classmates rudely confronted me about it. This person was not my friend, and we were never close, yet they had the audacity to approach me aggressively, throwing in profanities as if I had done something wrong.

They started pointing fingers at me because our section was called out for not helping, but in reality, I didn’t even know there was still more work to be done. Meanwhile, by the second day, most of them were still out filming, and only around 12 of us were actually working on the props. When I simply pointed out that only a handful of us were available to do the work while the rest were busy with the film, they got offended. To this day, I still don’t understand why what I said was so ""uncalled for""—I was just stating the truth.

After I sent that response, Person 1 called me out in our group chat, saying that I had no reason to mention it since it was already a ""given fact."" Then, Person 2 chimed in, saying I wasn’t the only one who was tired and frustrated. The thing is, I wasn’t even complaining—I was just explaining what happened. But instead of letting me clarify my side, they kept bombarding me with nonsense, making it seem like I was attacking them when all I did was state the situation as it was. They twisted my words, making it look like I was undermining the efforts of the actors, when I never even said that they didn’t contribute.

The worst part? When Person 2 started verbally attacking me, no one stepped in. But the moment I tried to defend myself, suddenly, people wanted to ""de-escalate"" the situation—as if I was the one who started the argument in the first place.

And to make things worse, I eventually lost interest in stepping up as a leader. How could I, when Person 2 was my groupmate? He was one of the reasons we almost missed the deadline for a project. Dealing with his unnecessary drama, insults, and complete lack of responsibility drained me to the point where I just didn’t care anymore.

At the end of the day, I realized that they had already decided to turn against me, and honestly, I couldn’t care less. If they refused to hear me out, then that was their problem, not mine.

But it didn’t stop there. Person 1 took the issue to social media, posting about how what I did was ""uncalled for."" That was the final straw. I was so agitated—where the hell was their brain? Instead of resolving things privately, they ran to Facebook like children. In response, I may or may not have vented about the situation in my notes. I also made a general shared post about people who take personal issues to social media—without mentioning any names.

The problem? Person 1 was still my friend on Facebook, and somehow, Person 2 got a hold of my post even though it was set to ""Friends Only."" He then confronted me in a different group chat, insulting me, threatening to kick me out as a group leader, and even dragging my parents and boyfriend into it—bringing up my personal life for absolutely no reason. At that point, I knew there was no reasoning with him. I responded briefly, but when he insulted me again, I chose to stop engaging.

Then, Person 2 had the nerve to say that it was ""funny"" of me to share a post about not taking personal issues to social media—when my post was directed at Person 1 for doing exactly that. I blocked and unblocked him, but I was so frustrated because I didn’t even know how he got my post in the first place. I started thinking he was the one who snitched, so I unfriended every single one of my classmates.

I knew Person 1 had a bad attitude, but I did not expect that kind of attitude from Person 2. Even the people that I thought of and treated as friends did not let me explain or hear me out. Not even checking up on me. I couldn't look at them the same. I bear animosity towards most of them now. I hope karma gets them. ",active,1

1jj9rfp,1,2025-03-24,I've been lied to and cast out,u/Logical-Artist2658,IBO,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/1jj9rfp/ive_been_lied_to_and_cast_out/,"I have been in the same school district my entire life, it has never been the best but I was too young to really understand incompetence. When I first applied to my high school's ""academy"" (my school is public) I thought that I would be able to maximize my course load take AP's and get college credit, showing that I could handle hard work.  

Then I was led down the primrose path that was the IB program, my school made it mandatory to take at least 2 IB classes. I heard IB was hard, and everyone involved with the program said it was prestigious and would be a great experience with high reward. It's our schools second year and no one knows what they are doing. I have been given busy work, I have been told that the promises I heard previously on things such as college credit and increased college acceptance are not true. I am in a never-ending battle over the use of ChatGPT. On that thought, if you as a teacher don't want your students to use ChatGPT, explain to them why they are doing an assignment and maybe, just maybe, don't assign hours of busy work bullshit for me to complete every night. They are quick to accuse anyone of AI use but for some don't think we know how to research and make a google search, so they give us assignments on how to read and research, like I haven't been doing that since kindergarten.

  
So naturally when I realized that the way my brilliant teachers thought to make this program hard was to just make it school + 10x Homework, I lost interest, projects where I could research whatever I wanted were promised to me, but I still haven't seen them. So now that I am disinterested and fed up with the bullshit and lies I am the problem. I have had my house called, emails sent, etc, because I no longer participate where it is not needed. I am lazy, I am throwing away a great opportunity, I am the problem. It's insane how when you lie and hide the truth from people they stop trusting you!

  
So as I sit dwelling in the fact that I have wasted time and effort and energy, I think back to Sisyphus and pushing his boulder up the hill. In this case the hill is non existent, it is only there if I want it to be and the boulder expects me to push it, while it rolls over me, again and again and again. While one must imagine Sisyphus happy, I beg that you do not imagine me happy, as it would be a disgrace to the immense resentment I have and to the sophomore who was so easily manipulated and tempted by prestige.",User_deleted,1
1jjok3i,2,2025-03-25,I'm pretty sure my dad hates me.,u/TheWordOriginator,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jjok3i/im_pretty_sure_my_dad_hates_me/,"Don't get me wrong, the feeling is very much mutual. He has been very emotionally abusive towards everyone in my family recently, but my mom brushes it off because he's very stressed about our financial condition right now and hanging on by a thread. She forgives him for every horrible unforgivable thing he says to her. She doesn't leave him because he is somewhat normal about 60% of the time.

It's like he's bipolar. He has these episodes where he talks so hatefully about one of my siblings or my mother unprompted. Like he has this anger building up over us just existing and lets it out randomly. He used to be physically abusive as well, but has not been so in years. Though his words sometimes hurt more than physical pain.

Now, he's angry at me that I didn't do anything major in my gap year. I've been using it to travel, do the SATs, taken some subject exams, take care of the entire household for a month when my mom was out of country, read and learn some basic skills like drawing and video editing, as well as going to the gym consistently. But most of the time, I am chilling and trying to enjoy life during this one year.

Suddenly a couple days ago he just snapped. Sat me down and told me someone of my age should know what I want to do with my life (as if every freshman doesn't constantly change their major). He said I should be practicing ONE skill everyday and make money from it. I can't express the venom with which he said these things and the jabs he threw, such as 'tell me something you want to do other than playing video games'. As if i play games all day. As if I don't help out with chores every single day and stress about admissions and constantly research different schools and have a mental panic attack every single day.

He also basically said he's not willing to fund my education even if it costs $10k a year, which is like the minimum in most countries, so I should find something else. This is directly in contrast with what he said a year ago, that we would do anything to pay full tuition if that was the last option. It feels like he wants to control my future and make it something miserable. 

Now my mom made the mistake of telling him I was trying to make a cv and that I was waitlisted for a school so I need to show what I did these past few months since I applied. He says use chatgpt to make the cv, I say i'd rather make it by myself. Then he says it's fine if you change it a bit, just use it for ideas. I say the hard part is actually thinking up what I'm qualified for, not structuring it, so thanks but I'm not using chatgpt. He goes silent. An angry kind of silent. He doesn't like people disagreeing with him despite being a self-declared free-thinker and supporter of debate and logic. Most of all he's a hypocrite. I've seen it throughout the years, the stories would take too long to tell.

Then he says that I didn't do anything these past few months even though I should have, look at what my cousins did etc. (my cousin got into stanford). I admit that i've been a bit stagnant since jan, my mental health was not doing so well. But i've still been helpful and active, not like i've been scrolling tiktok all day, i don't even have tiktok. He then continues on to say how lazy i've been, that I should have been doing something from the start, that he told me so. I leave the room and overhear him tell my mom that someone needs to sit over my shoulder and force me to make the cv, as if i'm laying in bed all day and am not the one who asked my mom for advice. 

His heart is just so hateful, I don't understand it. I've been a straight A student all my life, and he had no problem bragging to all his friends when I got a band 9 on the IELTS. It was pathetic watching him do that, I felt ashamed when he told people that had nothing to do with me that his daughter got a great score. He wants to use me for my achievements. If I don't have those, I'm nothing to him. 

I want to escape him financially. I want my family to escape him. He makes every good thing bad somehow and never apologizes for anything he did. I know that he is never going to change. The stories I mentioned here are the tame ones. Just know that he has made my mother cry several times and then mocked her for crying. I just know I can never be at peace with him in my life. He acts like nothing happened after saying the most vile shit. After a while you lower your guard, think he's normal and happy. But then he strikes again. ",User_deleted,2

I reported 8 students for AI use this week. Their references took me directly to the ChatGPT website or included “source=ChatGPT” in the URL. Obviously, there is no case or defence to be made here. 7/8 students accept their fate and receive zeros on their assignments and one strike on their academic record. Lo and behold, I receive an email from one student (why must there always be that one student) asking to meet so that they can explain the situation. We get on a Zoom call and they admit to using ChatGPT but say (and I quote) ‘just do me a favour this one time and let it slide’ (this was their second infraction in my class alone). Of course, I did NOT let it slide. Not to mention this is a first year gen ed class with pretty lax assignments and requirements. I just could not imagine behaving like such a petulant entitled child while in my undergrad. The student then mentions that being a student is hard and they’re really busy and I wouldn’t understand. I am currently completing my second bachelors degree, teaching at an elementary school, teaching night classes at the college, and working a THIRD job on nights where I don’t lecture. I tell this to the student, and they say that it’s my choice and that “I must deal with stress better so it’s different”. I simply told them that the use of AI is unacceptable as is stated in the syllabus and that our discussion was over. I am now sitting here  typing this post in disbelief.

Teaching question? ChatGPT. Looking for data sources? ChatGPT. Unsure about a concept in our field? ChatGPT. I've tried to explain that ChatGPT likes to fabricate information and use bizarre sources, like someone on the ""TAs share ridiculous things students have done"" post said ChatGPT cited ""Rudd, P."" on an article about golf courses, but it changes nothing. Everything is ChatGPT. ChatGPT is God. I could probably write an entire peer-reviewed thesis and if it conflicted with ChatGPT, ChatGPT would take precedent.

I thought it was bad enough that my students use ChatGPT to cheat on their homework all the time, but more and more professors are using it, too. One professor suggested having ChatGPT summarize my data for me/help me write my literature review for my thesis proposal. I personally hate ChatGPT, I've seen it falsify so much information and the environmental impact of using it is horrible, and I'm a good writer on my own and don't need it. But the more my professors use it, the more I feel pressured to join in, because they'll sometimes look at me funny when I say I don't use it, like I'm passing up a valuable resource. But even when I tried using it in the past to fix code, it ignores half of what I say and half the time the code it returns doesn't work anyway.

Dear mods, kindly read my post fully before taking any action. This is an extremely serious post.  
*(I also pretended to be an aspirant, a dropper, a foreign college admission applicant, a finance aspirant, and a CUET aspirant on other subs on Reddit to get some info and karma— shit hits hard. This research took months. Also, I spent a lot of time on BITS Pilani and other Tier-1 college subs with different accounts.)* 

*I hate to admit , I used CHATGPT in some parts TO REFINE MY STORY AND MAKE IT EASY FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND , I hope you y'all comply.*

**Also Long post ahead so kindly cooperate!**

I'd suggest aspirants/ readers to carve out **15 minutes of their life** to read this. Although a TL;DR is there!

# This post mainly discusses three things:

1. **Why IITs are shit and the reasons behind IIT suicides**
2. **My story**
3. **The ending**

**Hi y’all, I'm an IITD alumnus.** I graduated in 2017. I was a dropper. Got **93%ile in my first attempt (didn’t clear the cutoff).** I got around **4xxx rank in my drop year and joined a lower branch for the tag.** I came to **IIT-D with high hopes**—either to create a startup, maintain good grades, or crack **CAT and get into a top IIM.** 

Maintaining grades was **permanent.** During my time at college, I did the following things:

✔ Maintain **good grades + extracurriculars**  
✔ **CFA till Level 2**  
✔ **Competitive coding, SQL, JAVA, PYTHON, C++** (you name it!) **( Codeforces : 2350 at college )**  
✔ **Did every possible thing->research interns in finance at Ivy leagues, top IIMS + 9+ CG + networking with alums in IT, Consulting and Finance**

 **Learnt deceiving and manipulating to get ahead**

Everybody here at **IITs—not just Delhi but all old IITs—are snakes.**

It’s not that people **don’t manipulate.** They do. But, **please don’t mind, IITians are relatively smarter, with relatively high IQs, so they are able to manipulate much more efficiently.**

Oh man, I remember **the beef with CS grads.** They are **masters of manipulation and college politics.** And they **BITE!!!**

They **hiss at you to the extent that ultimately, the weaker ones end up crashing** . They pull the weak ones so much down , and demotivate themselves to the extent that they lose self worth and confidence and themselves and at life. From there onwards its a downward spiral of low grades, low self esteem , high societal expectation. And when they are not able to cope up , Then they are left with one option. (the reason for **suicides at IITs**).

Heck, I read **some extremely unethical books** (*48 Laws of Power, The Prince, Robert Greene’s books,  many other books which I can't name them here.*) just to **learn their tactics to survive.**

Manipulating was not my **cup of tea,** but **reading these books helped me protect myself and stand up for myself when necessary**

It’s a common saying:  
**“Power is a game of survival.”**

# Placements Came—And As Expected, I Could NOT Land Even a Single Offer.

For **Day 0, 1, and 2 companies:**

* **Girls from lower branches slept with recruiters.**
* **Guys from rich backgrounds in lower branches (They were literally able to BUY top coaching batch seats during JEE prep without giving tests. Once they got admitted they started working hard) used their family connections and influence which was bought through MONEY**
* **Some took recruiters and HRs for dinners , engaged in excessiveness , debauchery and drugs in exchange for favours. Then later threatened them to leak their tapes and secrets in return for JOB OFFERS.**
* **Others straight-up bribed them with their daddy’s money. Some with lower CGPA, and minimum skills passed all screening tests and landed 30 lpa jobs**
* **They generated false rumors about me and other middle/poor-class competitors.**
* **Lots and lots of politics were involved.**
* **As per my observations and research around 70% of iitians are from affluent or upper class background and 30%  are from Middle class backgrounds. Affluent ones do politics and get placed who make headlines the next. Rest 30% are left unemployed or with 6-10 lpa salaries.**
* **The reason is pretty simple! First we did do some consensus in 2nd year. But if you simply use your brain , top coaching with most selections charge hefty fees (3-5 lakh) for 2 years. A mere fraction of the Indian population can afford this education. Even out of them , the smartest + affluent ones make it to top batches , who later get good under 500 ranks in JEE** 

Guys with **6 CGPA from CS branches** or **those with great political skills from lower branches** ended up **easily landing consulting, finance, and coding profiles.**

I **tried to save myself.** I **tried to manipulate too!**

But just like those from **poor and middle-class families, those at the bottom of the food chain (3-4 students in every batch) either ended up committing suicide or barely survived or DROPPED OUT**

**No one even cared to carry their bodies.**

**External parties, bureaucrats, and professors covered it up.**

Ever wonder why **placement reports by IITs/BITS/NITs** are **so vague and straightforward?**

Because the **placement committee members** (mostly **under-500 rankers from Electrical and CSE**) **are master manipulators.**

They **release very selective data to lure students in.**

After **all the grind, learning, and whatnot,** I believed in myself:

**""My time will come. Hard work + smart work pays off. It’s not the end of the world. Opportunities are available. After all, I graduated from a top college.""**

I took up a **₹6 LPA job at a WITCH company.**

**Same Game of Thrones all day long.**

✅ **10% work**  
❌ **90% politics**

I **gained an edge in the beginning, switched to IB, and rose to Associate level.**

Then, **my political skills and privilege hit a saturation point.**

To **rise above,** you either need:

* A **CSE/Electrical degree**
* **Influence bought through MONEY!!!**

Love the saying:  
**""Money is the root of all evil.""**

Then, I **decided to apply for CAT.**

Got **99.9xx%ile.**

Got **all A/B/C calls.**

I had **good grades.** But there were **insecure seniors, scared that I might climb the corporate ladder faster than them.**

They **spread rumors about me, labeled me ""unprofessional.""**

The **professors believed it.**

I **fought my very best—and again, I failed.**

I **tried everything** in my journey.

Worked **16+ hours from the age of 15.**

And all I got was **disappointment.**

My parents **constantly compared me to well-doing peers.**

They **only looked at the results, not the shady process.**

I wasn’t invited to any **weddings, functions, or parties** because people **were jealous + had influence + money + privilege to overthrow me.**

The **few people vouching for me?**

They **themselves got busted for being honest and fair.**

And as I said, they were **hardworking but from middle-class/poor backgrounds.**

# Wanna Know the Real Reason Behind Successful BITSIANS?

Their **fees.**

✔ **High fees = Rich + Smart + Privileged kids.**  
✔ **They use their influence in college and corporate life.**

**Deepinder Goyal** (Electrical)  
**Binny Bansal** (CSE)  
**Sachin Bansal** (CSE)

Even **Sundar Pichai's ""not being able to afford a flight to the US"" story was made up.**

He **did reach there, right?**

Few people know this, but **his father made good money by rising through the corporate ladder using HIS father’s influence in GEC as an Electrical Engineer.**

As for Sundar, he was **smart.** He **memorized telephone numbers as a child and later worked for one of the most corrupt, manipulative companies—McKinsey.**

That’s where he **mastered the art of deception** and used it to **rise in Google.**

**Satya Nadella?**

His **father was an IAS officer.**

I **don’t even need to explain further.**

All these guys were from **rich or sufficiently upper-class families.**

✔ **Smartest minds + hard work + mastery in deceiving and manipulating = Destruction.**

NOBODY AMONG THEM WAS A DROPPER.

**Droppers are failures—just like me.**

Even if they **clear the exam, they end up failing in college despite good grades and hard work.**

If your **AIR is >500, you are cooked** and **end up with a ₹6 LPA package.**

Society **won't respect you.**

You’ll be **depressed, watching your privileged friends dominate while you struggle to make ends meet.**

Ultimately, **anxiety and mental health issues will consume you.**

# Ways to Become Rich in India

✔ **A) Get an IIT rank under 500**  
✔ **B) Be born rich and do business. Influence through money.** *(Some kids don’t take over their dad’s business but still get financial support—like Jeff Bezos getting $300K from his parents.)*

Hi, I'm an IITD ALUMNUS.

Dear mods, kindly read my post fully before taking any action. This is an extremely serious post.  
(I also pretended to be an aspirant, a dropper, a foreign college admission applicant, a finance aspirant, and a CUET aspirant on other subs on Reddit to get some info and karma— shit hits hard. This research took months. Also, I spent a lot of time on BITS Pilani and other Tier-1 college subs with different accounts.) 

I hate to admit , I used CHATGPT in some parts TO REFINE MY STORY AND MAKE IT EASY FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND , I hope you y'all comply.

Also Long post ahead so kindly cooperate!

I'd suggest aspirants/ readers to carve out 15 minutes of their life to read this. Although a TL;DR is there!

# This post mainly discusses three things:

1. Why IITs are shit and the reasons behind IIT suicides
2. My story
3. The ending

Hi y’all, I'm an IITD alumnus. I graduated in 2017. I was a dropper. Got 93%ile in my first attempt (didn’t clear the cutoff). I got around 4xxx rank in my drop year and joined a lower branch for the tag. I came to IIT-D with high hopes—either to create a startup, maintain good grades, or crack CAT and get into a top IIM. 

Maintaining grades was permanent. During my time at college, I did the following things:

✔ Maintain good grades + extracurriculars  
✔ CFA till Level 2  
✔ Competitive coding, SQL, JAVA, PYTHON, C++ (you name it!) ( Codeforces : 2350 at college )  
✔ Did every possible thing->research interns in finance at Ivy leagues, top IIMS + 9+ CG + networking with alums in IT, Consulting and Finance

 Learnt deceiving and manipulating to get ahead

Everybody here at IITs—not just Delhi but all old IITs—are snakes.

It’s not that people don’t manipulate. They do. But, please don’t mind, IITians are relatively smarter, with relatively high IQs, so they are able to manipulate much more efficiently.

Oh man, I remember the beef with CS grads. They are masters of manipulation and college politics. And they BITE!!!

They hiss at you to the extent that ultimately, the weaker ones end up crashing . They pull the weak ones so much down , and demotivate them to the extent that they lose self worth and confidence in themselves and at life. From there onwards its a downward spiral of low grades, low self esteem , high societal expectation. And when they are not able to cope up , Then they are left with one option. (the reason for suicides at IITs).

Heck, I read some extremely unethical books (48 Laws of Power, The Prince, Robert Greene’s books,  many other books which I can't name them here.) just to learn their tactics to survive.

Manipulating was not my cup of tea, but reading these books helped me protect myself and stand up for myself when necessary

It’s a common saying:  
“Power is a game of survival.”

# Placements Came—And As Expected, I Could NOT Land Even a Single Offer.

For Day 0, 1, and 2 companies:

* Girls from lower branches slept with recruiters.
* Guys from rich backgrounds in lower branches  used their family connections and influence which was bought through MONEY (They were literally able to BUY top coaching batch seats during JEE prep without giving tests. Once they got admitted they started working hard)
* Some took Recruiters and HRs for dinners , engaged in excessiveness , debauchery and drugs in exchange for favours. Then later threatened them to leak their tapes and secrets in return for JOB OFFERS.
* Others straight-up bribed them with their daddy’s money. Some with lower CGPA, and minimum skills passed all screening tests and landed 30 lpa jobs
* They generated false rumors about me and other middle/poor-class competitors.
* Lots and lots of politics was involved.
* As per my observations and research around 70% of iitians are from affluent or upper class background and 30%  are from Middle class/Poor backgrounds. Affluent ones do politics and get placed who make headlines the next day. Rest 30% are left unemployed or with 6-10 lpa salaries.
* The reason is pretty simple! First we did  do some consensus in 2nd year. But if you simply use your brain , top coaching with most selections charge hefty fees (3-5 lakh) for 2 years. A mere fraction of the Indian population can afford this education. Even out of them , the smartest + affluent ones make it to top batches , who later get good under 500 ranks in JEE .
* This is not Bollywood , Shit like this happens irl. Infact such movies , feed young minds new strategies and methods for manipulation.

Guys with 6 CGPA from CS branches or those with great political skills from lower branches ended up easily landing consulting, finance, and coding profiles.

I tried to save myself. I tried to manipulate too.

But just like those from poor and middle-class families, those at the bottom of the food chain (3-4 students in every batch) either ended up committing suicide or barely survived or DROPPED OUT

No one even cared to carry their bodies.

External parties, bureaucrats, and professors covered it up.

Ever wonder why placement reports by IITs/BITS/NITs are so vague and straightforward?

Because the placement committee members (mostly under-500 rankers from Electrical and CSE) are master manipulators.

They release very selective data to lure students in.

After all the grind, learning, and whatnot, I believed in myself:

""My time will come. Hard work + smart work pays off. It’s not the end of the world. Opportunities are available. After all, I graduated from a top college.""

I took up a ₹6 LPA job at a WITCH company.

Same Game of Thrones all day long.

✅ 10% work  
❌ 90% politics

I gained an edge in the beginning, switched to IB, and rose to Associate level.

Then, my political skills and privilege hit a saturation point.

To rise above, you either need:

* A CSE/Electrical degree from old 5 iit
* Influence bought through MONEY!!!

Love the saying:

Then, I decided to apply for CAT.

Got 99.9xx%ile.

They spread flase rumors about me, labeled me ""unprofessional.""

Even Sundar Pichai's ""not being able to afford a flight to the US"" story was made up.

He did reach US, right? Now where did the money come from? Did it suddenly started raining $$$$ for them? NO!!!

Few people know this, but his father made good money by rising through the corporate ladder using HIS father’s (I mean Sundar's Grandfather's) influence in GEC as an Electrical Engineer. Later used his earnings to support Him and his wife and his  + 2crore Stanford Masters +2 CRORE Wharton MBA feeseducation (Net 4 crore lol). Those who don't know. Wharton and Stanford are even more presitigious than iits .

As for Sundar, he was smart. He memorized telephone numbers as a child, built electrical circuits at young age and later worked for one of the most corrupt, manipulative companies—McKinsey. As a Management Consultant

That’s where he mastered the art of deception and used it to rise in Google.

Satya Nadella?

His father was an IAS officer. If ever free , ask any UPSC aspirant for their motive for preparing for such a competitive exam (Hint: Corruption Money pay after year few years is 10cr-100cr)

I'm an international South Asian student studying Computer Science in the United States. I'm in my junior year right now. My situation is:  
  
1. I have spent my father's fortune (close to USD 80k) to fund my education and accommodation here. We're a middle-class family, and this USD 80k so far is bleeding my father dry.     
  
2. I don't like what I'm studying in CS. I realized it early but was scared to change my major and disappoint my parents, so I went ahead and carried on. I don't like coding at all, so I ChatGPTed my way through the coding tasks. Needless to say, coding-wise, I've learnt nothing. I enjoy anything and everything but coding. From the beginning, even in the introductory courses, I never understood the gist of coding in general. 

3. I have zero research experience, projects, internships, and leetcode practice. 

4. I must get a job after graduation or pursue higher education to stay in the US. I can't afford not to get a return on my investment through a job or by staying in the US, as the money I've spent on this degree is too much not to get anything out of it. 

I do not know what I want to do or need to do. I have one summer and two semesters left before my back hits against the wall. I can't afford to disappoint my parents. My father is investing his life in me. 

I'm lost.

the tariffs are a way to tank the economy on purpose, his justification is that democracy is an outdated, non dominant, strategic way to operate a country



he is not dumb, but boy is he speed running bankrupting the country



steps for democracy -> dictatorship:



1. First, destroy labor unions, so people have no way to bargain for higher wages and less capacity for political organization.



2. Crack down on college students, so they won’t oppose you (hint: burden them with so much student debt and make it so hard for them to find good jobs that they won’t dare rock the boat).



3. Undermine public education, so people are less able to think critically for themselves.



4. Cut deals with rich business executives and billionaires that if they back you you’ll reduce their taxes, slash government spending on the poor, and eliminate regulations that impinge on their profits.



5. Make most people economically anxious, frustrated, angry, and insecure.



6. Convince them their problems stem from “them” — foreigners, immigrants, racial or ethnic or religious minorities, intellectuals.



7. Make them cynical about democracy.



8. Convince them all they need is a strongman who will fix everything.



9. Fill the airwaves with big lies.



10. Get elected, and then take over.

1jn5s9k,1,2025-03-30,How I made an AI tool that boosted a GMAT student’s score by 80 points,u/Danyuchn7,edtech,https://www.reddit.com/r/edtech/comments/1jn5s9k/how_i_made_an_ai_tool_that_boosted_a_gmat/,"I’ve been teaching GMAT for 10+ years, mostly focusing on Verbal and the absolute nightmare that Taiwanese students have with reading. Seriously, these kids struggle hard with academic-style sentences—not just vocab, but the whole sentence structure mess. I used to have no good way to fix this, but then generative AI came along, and I built this thing called Sentence Cracker to tackle it. Figured I’d share how it went down and what it’s done so far.

# What’s the Deal with Reading Struggles?

So, I’ve pinned down three big reasons Asian students can’t crack sentences:

1. **General Words**: Stuff like “probably,” “therefore,” “however”—not tied to any subject, but students just don’t get them. I had this one kid stare at “nevertheless” like it was alien code, no clue it means “however.”
2. **Fancy Terms**: Think “photosynthesis” or “inflation.” You can’t just memorize these; you need the backstory. Knowing the word alone doesn’t help if you don’t get the concept.
3. **Sentence Chaos**: Long modifiers, parallel clauses, subjects miles from verbs, inverted stuff—it’s a brain twister.

It’s like when someone says “I feel sick.” Cool, but is it the flu or allergies? Students go “I don’t get this sentence,” and I’ve gotta dig into whether it’s vocab, context, or grammar screwing them up. They’re clueless where it’s breaking down—I’m the one who figures it out.

# Old-School Fixes Were a Slog

Before AI, my solutions were straight-up clunky. General vocab? “Go hit the dictionary, copy some synonyms.” Specialized terms? I’d sit there explaining photosynthesis—CO2 to oxygen, the whole deal. Structure woes? I’d break sentences by hand, like turning “The scientist, renowned for his discoveries, published a paper” into “The scientist published a paper. He’s renowned for his discoveries,” and find more examples to drill. Worked okay one-on-one, but man, it was tiring.

There’s this book, *Yang Peng’s Tough Sentences*, that everyone in GMAT land loves. Peers hype it up, students grind it. But here’s my beef: everyone’s “tough” is different. Parallel clauses might be cake for you, but long modifiers? Total blackout. You end up practicing a ton of stuff you don’t need while your real problem sits there.

# AI Stepped In and Changed Everything

Then generative AI hit, and I saw my shot. Built **Sentence Cracker**, and it’s all about customizing. You toss in a GMAT sentence you can’t figure out, it simplifies it (long to short), you get the gist, then check the original to see what tripped you up—words or structure?

Here’s what it does:

* **General Vocab**: Type a word, get an explanation plus synonyms (“however” → “nevertheless”) and antonyms (“however” → “similarly”). These have a set range—learn ‘em, and you’re set. One student put in “consequently,” got “therefore” and “as a result,” and locked it in after a few goes.
* **Specialized Terms**: More than translation—context too. “Inflation” comes with how it jacks up prices, plus related words like “deflation” and “GDP.” Another kid got “ecosystem,” learned about food chains, and later nailed “biodiversity.”
* **Sentence Structure**: Breaks down grammar—subjects, verbs, modifiers—and spits out similar examples. “The book, written by a famous author, is on the table” turns into “The car, repaired by a skilled mechanic, is in the garage.” Five or six of those, and they’re good.

# Real Results?

One student’s my poster child. Started at 80 words per minute—Verbal was a disaster, guessing the last 5-6 questions, freaking out under time pressure, botching stuff he knew. Hit an economics passage with “inflation” and “recession,” blanked, and gave up. After a few weeks with Sentence Cracker, he’s at 150-180 words per minute. No more stalling on long sentences or weird words—he thinks through every question, stays chill. Score went from 565 to 645—80 points up. It’s not just the number; he owns the test now.

# What’s Next for This Thing

I’ve got ideas to make it crazier:

1. You write what you think a sentence means, AI checks it against the real deal—vocab or structure issue?
2. General vocab gets difficulty ratings from a word bank, suggesting extras beyond synonyms.
3. Specialized terms trigger mini reading passages—like an economics blurb for “inflation” haters.
4. Mixes tough words with scary structures, like “She studied hard; however, he relaxed all day” for parallel-phobes.
5. Saves everything to a dashboard—I can pull data, run AI analysis, and whip up custom study plans.

This level of tailoring used to be one-on-one tutoring only—scaling it was a pipe dream; teachers don’t have infinite time. Education was a grind. Now, with AI, every student gets what they need, no slogging through generic books. It’s not just for them—it frees me up to do data-driven coaching. I’m not just a GMAT teacher anymore; I’m building education tools.

1jnfltr,34,2025-03-30,English teacher doesn't english as an english teacher who should be englishing,u/probablychloe_,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1jnfltr/english_teacher_doesnt_english_as_an_english/,"Everyday is a great day until there's english 🥀. 

Whenever we had essay assignments she would take FOREVER to mark finish our work or just NEVER. Before our MOST IMPORTANT EXAM ON THE GRADUATING YEAR where ENGLISH AFFECTS OUR CHANCES OF LANDING INTO A GOOD SCHOOL (superduperimportant if I didn't mentioned ❤️), she decides to NOT mark our summary writing because she was sick and busy at a wedding in Malaysia 🤗. Mind you she had a full 2 weeks+ to mark our paper. Even my other teachers can do that in a snap even if they are sick. And when someone decided to call her out in class she literally looked so nervous like I could see her eyes quivering bro. LIKE GEE U CAN'T EVEN ACT INNOCENT. 💔

Including that, she would use ChatGPT to create essay examples instead of writing samples. PLUS, whenever we ask her questions she answers one by one slowly and it's so incompetent that a 1h 30mins period goes by so fast. Like i'm sorry but her english lessons are so fricking ineffective that I just open up my Ipad to watch youtube. Even my self-study sessions are way more useful than her yappertronminigunnermouththatspewsoutnothingbutnonsensicalwords.
 ADDITIONALLY, she literally took an hour JUST TO TEACH US HOW TO WRITE A TITLE. HELLO? IT DOESN'T EVEN COST MARKS IF NOT WRITTEN. And on the DAY of our oral examinations, it was so obvious that she was rushing to cramp us all with an overload of information on how to answer this and that. AND CAN I JUST SAY, the whole time prior to that moment, she just focused on ONE oral topic instead of a variety. And guess what? The topic indeed came out BUT THAT ONLY BENEFITTED ONE STUDENT. Like bro this is unfair 😭. And FYI the whole class probably thinks she's the worst english teacher to exist. ts pmo ts pmo ts pmo ts pmo ts pmo ts pmo ts pmo TS PMOOOOOOOOOOOOEURUEUIEDHJSI",User_deleted,41
