In short, as I understand it. Until you tell me how professional you are in coding, it will only give out the base of the base

Because he does not know your work experience and does not know how to work with you

Even if you told him to write some kind of complex project, he will still give a basic example, because he is not sure if you know exactly how the code works or not. And he is forced to do so.

Well, Gemini specifically found the problem, or rather the problem is ourselves. Google is a company that makes technologies that adapt to us. Right? And there is no doubt that the same story will happen with AI. We do not tell Gemini anything about ourselves, silently about our experience, work experience, etc. So how can we expect some amazing results if he doesn't even know what to do? He can only be a teacher and that's it, because he is not a telepath to read our minds and understand who is who, how old someone is and so on.
People, it's time to understand that Gemini is a completely different model and it has different ""views"" on us.

Each section has specific types of questions that need to be formatted clearly for student responses. I require: Listening Section: Fact file completion based on a radio show, and multiple-choice questions about the company discussed. Reading Section: Comprehension questions that require filling in names based on the text, and matching advice to given problems. Vocabulary Section: Completion of sentences using a provided list of verbs. Grammar Section: Filling in blanks with grammatical structures such as 'used to', indefinite pronouns, conditional sentences, passive voice, and reported speech.

1f93p99,1,2024-09-04,Rampant cheating at my school,u/CakeDeer6,school,https://www.reddit.com/r/school/comments/1f93p99/rampant_cheating_at_my_school/,"In the past year or two, competition for valedictorian has gotten crazy (classes of \~500) especially in the junior class. As a senior, I have no stake in the game, but it really sucks to see all the cheating having an impact my friends, who are competing for class rank, and the fact that the school is doing nothing about it. Our school has strict policies on cheating with well outlined punishments and required reporting, but these guidelines just aren't upheld very well.

First off, everyone knows someone who's cheated on a test. Teachers will catch these cheaters and hold them accountable within the class, often failing them on the test, etc. However, these students at the top are smart enough that failing a test doesn't usually end up changing their grade, so there really isn't much punishment for them.  Even though the teachers are required to report all ""academic dishonesty"" they rarely end up doing so because they just don't care enough, or feel that they can teach the student a lesson on their own. The issue, though, is that these kids end up doing this in all of their classes, and none of their teachers are communicating with one another, leading to rampant cheating with no consequences. 

On top of that, AI usage has been through the roof, not just with low performing students, but with top students as well. These kids are signing up for tons of dual enrollment credits, more than any normal person would have the time of day to take, and instead of learning anything from their classes, they just ChatGPT everything, dual enrollment, AP, you name it. A number of students have been caught using AI, just like at any school, I'm sure, but nothing gets reported, and everything gets swept under the rug. It pisses me off; none of the ""top students"" really even deserve to be at the top, they just game the system harder than anyone else. 

Those aren't the worst offenders though. One junior in particular was the reason for me making this post. He's had his fair share of AI usage and test cheating, but what sets him apart are the events of this last week. He was caught sending fake transcripts from summer programs and dual enrollment colleges to the high school in order to boost his GPA. The credits were completely fake and he never took at least 5 courses that he said he did. By the way, these courses remained on his OFFICIAL HIGH SCHOOL TRANSCRIPT for over a month, and he only outed himself when other people started reporting him. 

This isn't the end of his story though. The school launched an ""official investigation"" in which they pulled up 100s of pages of documents, finding clear evidence of him falsifying a number of courses. However, instead of punishing him heavily (our school's policy should call for him to be expelled), they gave him a measly two day out-of-school suspension. To make matters worse, they've said that when he goes to apply for colleges, they won't report any of his past incidents to the colleges he applies to. This kid got off virtually scot free for something that easily could've turned into expulsion and potentially felony charges (falsifying official records). Right now, he is in the race for valedictorian, and he will likely end up getting it, because he's paying extra money out of pocket to take extra dual enrollment courses beyond what the school is willing to cover. 

All in all, I'm really frustrated with this kid because he's a bully, manipulator, and sexually harasses people, but I'm more fed up with my school system than anything. They've proven time and time again that they don't care about preparing their students for the future; all they care about are their stats, and they're willing to let anything go on right under their noses so long as it makes them look good to the state.

I haven't \*really\* tried any actual ""jailbreaking"", yet - just logical (legit) rationalizations included with prompts - but it takes an unreasonable amount of effort just to get it to include a single obscenity in a 500 word chunk of content.

Kudos to the red team and all, but just because a thing can be done, doesn't mean it should be done. I feel like in the future, this is the version of ""AI"" that the general population is going to be stuck with.

As far as it being more capable (of anything beyond finding ways to stay dead-center between the safety guardrails), I'm not seeing it. I haven't tried coding, but the quality of writing fictional content is the same, the quality and content of stock/financial analysis and info is the same... 

And, speaking of fiction writing; there's no way this thing would ever even create a \*paragraph\* in the style or tone of the content I've been working on with GPT-4o. Let alone create any of the actual content/events that take place in the story. Which is fictional, not smut, not gore, not illegal, and is completely legit and acceptable in every regard. I haven't tried, but I can see already that I'm going to get ""I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that,"" as soon as soon as I give it so much as the overview of the story.

30 mins of messing with it, and I know I won't be using it for anything other than a substitute for Googling things. And even then, I'd better not ask it about horror movie suggestions, if they're rated R. Best I'll get is a M. Night Shyamalan flick.",User_deleted,3
1fkaya5,1,2024-09-18,How is school funding affected by suspensions and expulsions in North Carolina?,u/CoffeeAmor,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1fkaya5/how_is_school_funding_affected_by_suspensions_and/,"I have several misbehaved students in one of my 8th grade math classes. Three girls and a boy. 

1 girl brought a 7 inch switchblade to school. No idea what for. 

1 girl brought marijuana to school. And smoked it in the bathroom. Threw it in the trash can in the hallway. 

1 girl and the boy, both siblings, beat up another student to a bloody pulp in the hallway. It was horrific.  

All of these students are in my class and daily disrupting in every way imaginable. 

I've now been teaching a few years. Rather than rage that admin has not removed these students permanently from the school, I am trying to figure out administration's reasoning for keeping them in the school. 

It must be money, right? So I ask the all knowing (I know it is not) chatgpt about how expulsion affects funding for a public school in North Carolina. It tells me this. 

""In North Carolina, if a student is expelled from public school, the school does not lose funding directly due to that specific expulsion. However, state funding for schools can be influenced by overall enrollment numbers. If a school sees a significant drop in enrollment because of expulsions or other factors, it may impact their funding in the long term. Schools are generally incentivized to keep students enrolled and provide necessary support to prevent expulsions""

Another more specific question says the school can lose an average of $8,000 for expelling a student. 

So I am trying to look at this from admin's perspective. They have a boss somewhere telling them to get as much money as possible I am sure. So it is not in admin's best interest to expel a student? Is that what I am learning? Is that correct and how it works from their view?  
  
It also isn't lost on me that I am researching this after 10:00 PM when I should be unwinding and that is unhealthy. I need to develop better coping strategies. I am scared of my own classroom. ",active,1

I thought I was good at/interested in programming but when I attempted the lab assignment for Operating System, I was dumbfounded at what I was looking at.

But lo and behold, I get bombarded by so many files from system.h, thread.cc, timer.cc, timer.h, interrupts and so much more. The whole lab manual was pretty vague about what to do, like Initialise timer in system.cc and activate timer in timer.cc. So like most students, I turned to ChatGPT for help and I was willing to accept my fate if I got caught for plaigerism(for using ChatGPT). Even with its help, It took hours of guesswork to make something work, I think managed to complete 70% and the final part, I was completely stumped. NachOS being in C++ didn't help either because I hated pointers and it makes things so complicated to understand. After the whole ordeal, I realise that I'm probably not going to make it through uni and even if I did, It'll probably be with bad grades. Looking back at my experience, I wished I had made friends with my coursemates so we could study together or even approach lecturers to consult with but I'm just so scared that they might say that I should already know this by now.... I have social anxiety and a general lack of trust in others which probably makes me unpleasant to deal with in the first place. So it's just me and ChatGPT to salvage my degree.

As was posted recently, aA has had yet another round of layoffs, completely decimating the career placement team. This is the beginning of their replacing their staff with AI.


Now on paper an AI instructed bootcamp model could theoretically work to fulfill it's purpose of teaching you to code. However, what reason are you even going to a bootcamp then? They'll be cutting down on instructors next and they already have the TA's spread too thin to where they're operating via tickets and messages now so you're getting minimal (if any) direct attention or assistance.


Next, there's the fact that if you're operating on an AI bootcamp model, do you really think you're going to outperform Claude or GPT when you can't possibly have a similar amount of GPUs or training data? Their new CEO had founded an AI tutoring company prior to starting at App Academy, but even if she's bringing proprietary technology from there, it won't be able operate to the degree of the free technology that's currently in rotation. (Excluding a lack of rate limits)


Finally, will students who are new to learning to code be able to use AI resources responsibly in order to chase comprehension rather than memorization? There's a completely real chance that they're just weakening their graduate pool in an already highly competitive market.

Here's my take on all of this:

I understand, we literally all went through this. Now yes some are having a blast at uni, but if that is not you, it doesn't mean it is gonna be like this forever.

When I was in my 1st year, I did stupid shit that led me to getting severely depressed in the middle of UK's gloomy winter. Somehow, I decided to stay on my course and guess what? Can't be happier now. 

There is so many things that might go wrong it's impossible to address them all, but unanymously working on yourself is what it comes to it. If you are struggling with budgeting, this is what you need to learn. If you are struggling with socialising, this is also what you need to learn. Or maybe you are a massive procrastinator and leave everything till last minute? Well, you have a whole 1st year to figure out how to overcome it, and even if you fail it's only like 10% of your final grade. Many many problems of students at uni are really just problems of being in a situation where your self -regulation is still high school level, but your freedom is much more like that of an adult. So you need to grow this ability. In fact, you could argue that all that undergrad really is for is showing your future employer that you are somewhat able to keep a regular schedule and hand in things in due time. The skills you develop only really become meaningful after master's, unless in your profession you can work right after bachelor. And this sounds incredibly anticlimatic but it's not bad news at all, you will learn plenty of very useful skills, academic and non-academic. But just know that things take time, and sometimes they make get very bad before becoming great. 

It's corny but as humans we struggle with managing our freedom, and when granted some more we don't quite know how to navigate it. However, mistake after mistake and hurdle after hurdle you become more and more convinced that certain ways to do things work better for you than others. It's just very important to stay strong and not let it all break you, so find yourself the support you need, be it your parents, friends, colleagues or whoever you can think of who's ever been supportive. If there's nobody like that, use reddit and ChatGPT. Good luck!",active,287
