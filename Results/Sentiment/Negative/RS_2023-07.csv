**Sum things up: I've plagiarised & got caught 3 times how's this gonna affect my chances into getting to a good uni ? & Is having an average/failing a course in grade 11 gonna affect my chances in getting into uni? --> I've seen that it's not but most people I've seen are stressing about 80's..** 

Grade 9 french: During the pandemic we were supposed to work on culminating it was only a day long since classes were 3 hours that time \*Quadmesters\*:   I couldn't log onto Microsoft Teams and tried joining the online meeting, but it didn't work. I reached out to the teacher through email and Teams messages, but she never responded. Since the assignment was posted on Google Classroom, I checked there and realized that my topic was different from everyone else's (At least that's what it seemed like). I decided to start working on it anyway because waiting seemed pointless. After an hour and a half, I was finally able to join the call 

I remember the exact words that were said: 

she noticed I was here and said *""why are you late""*

I explained that I wasn't able to join the call  Hoping she'll understand me 

*""Okay, you are very late for culminating. Go to Google Classroom & read the instructions"" She said*  

I said ""*Sorry, I already started working ahead just not to fall behind""* 

She furiously said *""You've been working on this previously? You're not allowed to work on it at home""*

***My mic wouldn't turn on for some reason and she kept repeating my name*** 

(For some reason she posted culminating the day before which makes no sense but I really didn't work on it because didn't really care about my grades back then) 

10 seconds of pain my laptop decided to work; I told her I didn't work on it but already chose a topic before because I wasn't able to join the call. She asked what my topic was I tell that to her and she proceeds to say ""someone else is doing that pick another topic"" 

I couldn't really argue there so I was like okay I had an approximately an hour left so I tried rushing everything I ended up copy and pasting info not in my script but in the rough copy and then paraphrased it in my own words and cited it where I got my source from. The only problem my script had it was a different font I never bothered changing it because I was in a rush I did end up using some apps to help me to fix my grammar & being able to properly put my sentences in a proper structure

I wanted to ask her for more time but she never liked me.. it was damn obvious I tried making it up to her in the past by saying hello's and goodbye's after every call but no it didn't work 

So few days later; She calls my parents and said I plagiarised on my culminating & used ""apps""  she proceeded to give me a 0 she told my parents ""I'm gonna give my name a favour by boosting  the mark by 1 percent to pass"" my average was at a 49 at that time and gave me a 50. 

Since everything was virtual the principle spoke to my dad. He wanted to speak to me as well so he did my goal was to explain my situation in hopes for him to understand but, whenever I did that he'd always find a way to include plagiarism in or he never let me finish what I was trying to say. I tried telling him that giving a student less than an hour on an important task is quite unfair and making them restart on top of that what do you expect me doing. But he didn't seem to understand I ended up just saying okay as I did not see a point in trying to explain myself if he wasn't going to understand my situation. So I screwed it and moved on. At the end of the day teachers are more superior than students. 

Grade 10 - Nothing happened I got back on track 

Grade 11 - Just had personal issues going on due to that wasn't able to focus in school I did well on few courses like, french ended up getting a 96 & english went well too. But everything took a toll during semester 2 my average is 50 I failed advanced functions. Going to retake it this summer. 

Here's the 2nd: 

Grade 11 Antro/Phyc/Soc/: This one is mad stupid well since AI came out I had an assignment due but I didn't finish it and was still working on it so I ended up just submitting the wrong pdf out of ""carelessness"" they both had same titles. Since the assignment was boring I just ended up finishing it for the sake of finishing and forgot about it

2 weeks later my mom gets a phone call and my teacher said I cheated and got a 0 on my assignment my mom obviously angry told me to explain my teacher what happened I looked into the assignment and was like oh I submitted the wrong thing so I went to her and told her everything was just a rough copy and it's obviously done wrong. 

She's like you're not allowed to use AI at all I said okay I just wanted to save time and ended up resubmitting my work 

but she ended up not marking it in a proper manner and the max I could have gotten was a 50. Again I said yeah it was a silly mistake from my part & moved on 

Grade 11 Antro/Phyc/Soc/: Culminating: Yep apparently I used AI when everything was my own words.. I think she flagged 1 idea used from it? that's the only thing I remember using chatgpt for? didn't copy and pasted words just 1 common idea..  As for I wanted to confirm the dates of when school ends from each country I spoke about - I asked few people that I knew lived in the states/Australia/UK for this as well.. Unless there's something else I missed I didn't look too deep on what was AI and what was not since I wrote the culminating 1/2 months before don't recall much. I wish I never checked what I got on culminating I just have a lot going on so I barely decide to see what I get in school at least that's for now I'll probably hoping for to be doing well in grade 12. But well that I never got a call from the principle or was sent to their office? Not sure if she kept it to herself and saved herself from the extra work that goes to tell the principle but yeah not sure my parents did get a phone call but they were asleep so none of them picked up no one ever called after that it's been a week now. I ended up passing the course w/ a decent mark but could have gotten a higher mark if I didn't get a 50 of culminating. Well I tried avoiding plagiarising after 9th grade non of it was done intentionally I just suck at paraphrasing perhaps well next year obviously I don't plan on using things to help me out for ideas but I find it quite annoying after all the work put into this crap that was 14 pages long all I get is a shitty mark. I's my fault for this all 3 but ah it's whatever not much I can do here it's also summer now she is most likely not gonna call again hopefully not or whoever was calling  I've been thinking about this for few days now

Our entire grade for this course is based on one task, create a business plan for your own business. I have no admirations of becoming a small business owner. She didnt properly explain any part of the task.   
ive written many essays before, for all types of courses and ive never struggled more. I dont know what im talking about and its all just hollow. My friends and i asked if we could all make a business plan for the same business, arguing that we were planning on creating a business together in the future (were probably not, because we all hate every financial aspect). The teacher allowed it and i failed the course due to mentall illness. My friends sent me their essays to help me and for inspiration.

How are you planning to adapt your assessments to avoid students being able to have ChatGPT just write it for them?

One example is instead of an individually recorded oral presentation, we're thinking of having our students all read a different picture book, then orally discuss it in class as a podcast. This forces them to be spontaneous, gives them all a chance to discuss an individual topic and while they may use AI in the lead up, they can only use what they can recall at the time of assessment. Unfortunately this will make life harder for some, but it's better than weaker students repeatedly plagiarising despite us catching them every time!

What are your ideas?

Edit: We are well-versed in spotting plagiarised content, and we often have students handwrite drafts and rewrite suspected plagiarism under test conditions from key words only.What I am looking for are alternative, effective and contemporary ways to demonstrate knowledge so that students find it either difficult or pointless to turn to ChatGPT in the first case.

2nd Edit: I teach English as An Additional Dialect and Languages, so yes, they are directly assessed on their personal communication skills. There are multiple valid uses of AI in education, and even potentially some in my subject areas but I need the majority of their work to be their own knowledge of concepts, research and language use.

Now, I have never been interested in anything similar, since it was drilled into me from childhood that you're either good at languages and subjects such as history or you are math smart, and since languages came easy to me, I decided to hate math forever. I never spent more than a day trying to comprehend the material. I picked it up just before the exam only to maintain my perfect grade average. I would get As but I understood *nothing*. I didn't realize how much it messed up my sense of learning and education until I was done w/ high school. I focused on subjects in which I already excelled so I could attend competitions(for useless diplomas and points) and STEM subjects were left to flashcard revisions night before the exam. Consequently, I would not say logic, math or any of the skills required for CS are my strongest fortes. Fast forward one year, I'm done w/ my first year of CS, and I have passed all of the subjects(like linear algebra, discrete math, certain programming courses..etc), however, I have failed an exam(C programming). I am used to excelling in school so it really dispirited me and made me question whether I am going to finish this school at all. If I failed an exam in my 1st year, how am I going to hold up in 2nd?! or 3rd?! I am not from the US, and the education system here is a bit messed up- if you fail any subject 2yrs in a row, you're expelled unless they grant you an exception. I will have to take this class next summer semester, but I plan to pick it up in advance, just to be ready. I must admit, I did not really study for the exam. First of all, after completely annihilating my mental health to succeed in school(not only getting perfect grades, but also joining any meaningless extracurricular activity under the sun), I decided to relax this year, travel, hang out w/ friends more, and as consequence, I have officially stopped taking anti-depressants this year, so I have no regrets when it comes to my decisions this year. But secondly, the biggest problem is, that I did what I did best in HS. I focused on subjects which came easier to me and finished all my C projects with ChatGPT, so I do admit it is 100% my fault, but unlike HS, I realized, that won't pass here. It does not matter if you get a perfect score in a different class, you MUST understand every subject. You do not get a set of formulas to remember, you must invent ways to solve the problems at hand. You must know how to problem-solve. After this break, I am ready and 100% motivated to study, and to truly try to understand every subject I have. I realized that once I'm done w/ college, this will be my job, so there is no point in cheating or trying to find ways to quickly learn something and forget it the day after the exam. I entered into this field because of financial trauma from my parents, but I have actually fallen in love with the idea of becoming a programmer, as well as math ironically and the thought of finishing all of these challenging subjects. And one day, after finishing this arduous degree, creating something spectacular. But here is where I am in dispute w/ myself- I am thinking of transferring to a different university to study something, which is already my strong suit- like literature or languages, just because then I can be sure I will end up with a diploma in my hand. I am really scared that because I ignored simple logic for so long, and never tried to truly *study* I will not be able to catch up in time. Do you think it's possible for someone like me to learn how to think properly? I don't know if it's too late for me, and whether logic and problem-solving can be taught.

It's not a CS degree, we basically learn programming fundamentals without the hard math and science, but it can be credited towards a full CS degree at a neighbouring university. I chose this program because the CS degree would be too much debt for me as a former homeless kid.

In any case, our program is extremely group project focused. As a former alumni put it, ***""You can't wipe your ass without it being a group project.""*** Well, this of course has the unintended consequence that a ton of students get carried through the program. Now that ChatGPT has been unleashed, it's worse. I always end up doing 80-100% of the project solo because my group mates keep sending me chatgpt shit. How do I know the code is from chatgpt you ask? Because the code they send is trying to assign variables and classes that don't fucking exist in our program lmao.

Granted I'm not 100% on the hate train for AI, I use it as a powerful google search for syntax when I forget things. It's just that when I go and ask it for a similarly related part of our program, surprise surprise I found a 1:1 code snippet that one of my group mates sent me that I remember looking at and thought it was fucking weird. On top of that I cannot EXPLAIN why this code doesn't work to them. 

*""Well it works on my end.""* 

*""What do you mean? I don't have any errors.""*

It's like they never took our first two semesters. These people quite literally cannot code. Case in point we had an assignment in data structures class to write our own Queue, Stack, DLL and ArrayList classes with internal logic. Of course using the existing libraries for any of these is an instant fail. Curious, they've written their assigned portions of code in one day! Oh .... it's because they called java.util to fill out all the methods for them. Something like what ChatGPT might tell you to do. 

I could not explain to them why this was not allowed. They couldn't even fathom the point of our assignment. In all honesty I would genuinely care less if people aren't learning, I'm just so sick of being made to do all of the work in every single fucking project. I wish we were forced to use github (classmates refuse, it's too scary for them) and I wish we were graded according to our contribution history. 

Colleges need to wake up and pay attention to the technologies being unleashed around them.

This move by OpenAI might not have made much noise, but its implications could resonate loudly in the world of AI.

Initially released in response to concerns from educators about students using AI like ChatGPT for essays and assignments, the AI Classifier was never portrayed as fully reliable. It correctly identified only 26% of AI-written text as ""likely AI-written,"" while it slapped the 'AI-written' label on human work about 9% of the time. [**Even the US constitution was flagged as AI generated.**](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/why-ai-detectors-think-the-us-constitution-was-written-by-ai/)

As we've seen, AI writing detectors like OpenAI's AI Classifier, Turnitin, and GPTZero often fail to deliver accurate results. The technology they employ is speculative and unproven. Ironically, they've been used to wrongly accuse students of cheating. They haven't figured out yet that humans can mimic AI writing, and AI, if prompted right, can mimic humans too.

Daniel Jeffries, an AI writer and futurist, says it best: ""If OpenAI can't get its AI detection tool to work, nobody else can either."" He considers AI detection tools to be ""snake oil"" sold to gullible users and regards them as nonsense.

Research and anecdotal evidence are backing up these claims. A study by Sadasivan et al., 2023, for instance, echoed these concerns. The same applies to testimonials from educators who were wrongly flagged for AI-written work. It seems AI writing detectors may also unfairly target non-native English and possibly neurodivergent writers.

One proposed solution - watermarking AI-generated text - is under research, but early results show that AI models can defeat it by paraphrasing the output.

So, it seems like AI writing is here to stay, and skillfully deployed, it will likely mix with human works undetectably. Maybe it's time we focus more on the message conveyed, rather than who or what wrote it.

What's your take on the future of AI-written content and the fate of AI detectors? Most importantly - what should education system do to adjust to this technology?

Also, this isn't me being jealous of other people that have a high GPA, I have a 3.95.

I feel like when most people think of a 3.9/4.0 student, they're like ""Wow! This student got an A in almost if not every class!"", but in reality there are mechanisms such as grade forgiveness, transfer credits, and professor luck that can quite literally bump you up an entire point or more, and I'm confident this will only get worse in the future.

If you get a D or F in a course, you can get grade forgiveness which lets you retake the course and completely replace that old grade with the new one. I've personally seen instances where students purposefully try to go from a C- to a D in order to qualify for grade forgiveness, which is kind of insane.

Probably the craziest way to manipulate your GPA is transfer credits. You can take the hardest courses in your major (stuff like MATH 140/141, etc) at a community college, get a C or higher, and transfer that in for full credit WITHOUT IT AFFECTING YOUR PENN STATE GPA. There are even sites online that you can pay much smaller amounts in order to get super easy credit (sophia). This can also let you graduate an entire semester or more early if you knock out gen eds like macro/micro economics or something. There isn't even a cap. You just need to make sure the last 36 of your 60 credits are from penn state (assuming you are doing a bachelor's). 


Then there is professor luck. I don't feel like I need to go on about this because it's pretty self explanatory. Professors will do a wide variety of things depending on who they are as a person or if they had their morning coffee that day. This can range from bumping your grade up from a 89 to a 90, giving you multiple extensions, doing curves, etc to making attendance mandatory, barely speaking proper english, grading being way too harsh, having a bad TA, etc.

Don't even get me started on ChatGPT, Chegg, Quizlet, Coursehero, and online learning in general.

There are probably other ways to manipulate GPA as well but it's 5am and I'm ranting about ones that are blatantly obvious to me. If there are more feel free to share because I'm interested.

I know that grade inflation is a real issue, so maybe this is part of the reason? I don't know how it was back in the day since I'm still relatively young, but this is just nonsense and can I completely understand why anyone who knows what they're talking about will almost completely disregard GPA in things like job applications.",User_deleted,0
15d9zsk,1,2023-07-29,ChatGPT as a Teacher's Assistant - a personal experience,u/deestrier,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/15d9zsk/chatgpt_as_a_teachers_assistant_a_personal/,"This probably isn't the first post on this topic, but people in my circle couldn't care less about this technology, so I want to share my enthusiasm here.

I just started a job as a Primary Maths Teacher in a third-world country. My admin people swamped me with a packed schedule (which I don't mind, tbh; it's a poor school without sufficient staff). I still have office hours, but they're scarce, and I have a strong boundary on working weekends/nights - these are for my friends, loved ones, hobbies, etc.

I just subscribed to ChatGPT premium, and the quality of lesson plans it spits out is just ridiculous. I created a long-ass prompt detailing my students' background, class resources, what I can and cannot do. I isolated variables which I can quickly replace [Grade] / [Subject]. It prepares activities and explanations that are age-appropriate, gives me alternatives if Plan A backfires, and it's all beautifully formatted, ready to send to my supervisor.

In 10 seconds, I get a plan that is either ready to go or a great starting point for further refinements based on my own judgment. I feel like I have a personal assistant or a genie that does my bidding so I can focus on actually teaching and interacting with the children.

I cringe thinking of my colleagues begrudgingly writing their plans in a Word document on Sunday just to stop doing it altogether by October from burnout and frustration. I'll try to share my workflow, but I find that people can be surprisingly averse to trying new tools, even if they promise to drastically reduce their workload.",active,56
15dugch,1,2023-07-30,I fucked up academically. Advice needed.,u/EagleScout21,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/15dugch/i_fucked_up_academically_advice_needed/,"I had been putting off this assignment all week for a summer class I've been taking.  We're meant to do these discussion posts (asynchronously) before midnight.  The teacher has a zero-tolerance policy on late work.  You can't even submit anything after midnight.  Out of desperation, I had ChatGPT generate two of my three responses.  I edited one of the responses, making it closer to my own writing style.  I didn't have time to revise the other one.

I did this because I was extremely pressed for time.  I ordinarily write my own posts, and have consistently done so in the past.  This has been the only exception.  The teacher is very insightful, and knows the writing styles of his students pretty well.  I had a moment of desperation and made a poor decision.

Reading through the post I didn't have time to revise, it seems very shallow and computational.  The neutral tone and non-usage of the character's names are not in keeping with my usual writing style.

There was also a paper we were meant to write, which I wrote myself.  The discussion posts are a very small part of the course overall, so I don't know how motivated the teacher will be to reprimand me for this.

What do you think the likelihood is that the teacher will figure out that my responses were AI-written?  Is there any way he can prove it?  I feel extremely guilty for this, and I'm not sure if the best move is to admit fault and ask forgiveness, or to just let this one go and vow not to repeat it in the future?",User_deleted,1
15e2vtz,1,2023-07-30,Frustrated with student use of ChatGPT,u/OkSquash1234,academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/15e2vtz/frustrated_with_student_use_of_chatgpt/,"I teach English for Academic Purposes to speakers of English as an Additional Language. Many of my students have clearly been using ChatGPT or some form of AI to write their essays for them --I can tell by the huge discrepancy in the quality of their spoken and written outputs. It's now near impossible to prove someone has used AI in the writing of their essays, and it will have to be my word against theirs. Honestly, I'm tired of policing students who do not want to learn and just want the grade. I'm very tempted to just throw the coveted grades at the plagiarizers, but my heart breaks for this profession that, at this rate, will soon be moot and for the precious skill of writing that we will eventually lose with our addiction to AI.",active,42
15evbmj,1,2023-07-31,ChatGPT has become awful,u/Legal-Room-9618,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/15evbmj/chatgpt_has_become_awful/,"Listen, I love ChatGPT as much as the next guy but it has definitely become a lot dumber and almost unusable for what I previously used it to for. As a student it has been an incredible tool to help with my studies but I haven’t needed to use ChatGPT in a while as I’ve been on vacation. However, I read some articles this summer stating that ChatGPT was becoming dumber but I didn’t think much of it at the time. I thought that what I used it for would still be simple enough for the AI. If only I knew how wrong I was. 

Now that I’ve used it for the first time since late May to ask a few math related questions (questions it definitely could answer with ease earlier) it has actually been astounding how dumb ChatGPT has become and I need to vent. 

Incorrect answers, overcomplicated calculations, insisting and almost gaslighting you when you correct it only to both agree and disagree with itself in the very same message. What the hell is going on? Have humans really made this tool significantly dumber? Is it ever going to be usable again? Am I alone in thinking this?

My vacation is almost over and I think as it stands I wouldn’t use ChatGPT for any kind of calculation at all when I resume my studies. It is kind of sad that a great tool for education has become useless so quick.",active,87
