It use to do conversations with my wife but now it doesn’t do it as before. 

When I ask for things, it either won’t respond saying I should do the search myself or look it up myself, or gives me information that is often partially wrong.  

Sometimes I get annoyed and I even explain to it how its math is wrong and then it accepts it and apologizes. But how can it even provide the wrong math? Or sometimes it provides information that is wrong and I have to prove to it the info is wrong and then it says something like “when I look at it from that angle, you are right” but a scientific info does not have angles. There is only one truth. 
I even made a video putting it on youtube showing  how the info provided was wrong and I explained, with numbers, to chatgpt that it is wrong and it apologized. But what if a student of mine was asking for that info? He/she would learn the wrong info. 

These incidents mean I cannot rely on it. 

I know many fan crowd will attack me for this post, but if OpenAI does not address the rising issues, many paid users like me will quit. Many of my colleagues have already canceled their subscriptions. I don’t get anything more than google’s free AI response to searches.

But, you have no proof, and the kids will fight you tooth and nail if you accuse them of cheating. 

Ding that score every time and have them edit it and resubmit. If they argue, you say, “I don’t need to prove it. It feels like AI slop wrote it. If that’s your writing style and you didn’t use AI, then that’s also very bad and you need to learn how to edit your writing so it feels human.” With the caveat that at beginning of year you should have shown some examples of the uncanny valley of AI writing next to normal student writing so they can see for themselves what you mean and believe you’re being earnest. 

Too many teachers are avoiding the conflict cause they feel like they need concrete proof of student wrongdoing to make an accusation. You don’t. If it sounds like fake garbage with uncanny conjunctions and semicolons, just say it sounds bad and needs rewritten. If they can learn how to edit AI to the point it sounds human, they’re basically just mastering the skill of writing anyway at that point and they’re fine.

1hv3k36,680,2025-01-06,CMV: South Korea cannot fix its birthrate crisis without a massive cultural shift.,u/Terrible_Onions,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hv3k36/cmv_south_korea_cannot_fix_its_birthrate_crisis/,"The birthrate crisis in South Korea is a major issue, with it being way below the 2.1 replacement level at 0.74, and now I believe dipping into the 0.6 region. There are lots of reasons for this, and I've laid out 3 here, so here it goes:

1. Most people in South Korea cannot afford to have kids. The cost of having a kid in South Korea is massive, and it doesn't help that you need private education, often times costing thousands of dollars a month in order for your kid to have a fair chance, which is another issue I'll touch upon later. The PIR for living in Seoul is[ 15.2](https://m.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20231222000484&utm_source=chatgpt.com). The average for most western countries is around a third to half that. And being in Seoul is practically mandatory in order to attend those private education facilities, as all the major teachers and facilities are in Seoul. The average person cannot afford to have a child, let alone buy a home. 

2. The people that can afford to have kids do not have time to raise them. South Korea is notorious for being a ""workaholic"" country, and it's true. There's extreme stress and resulting mental health problems. These people, while they can afford to have kids, do not have the time to raise them. Yes, you have maternity leave and things like that, but it still doesn't address the core problem. You just cannot take care of your kid if you have that tight and stressful of a work schedule.

3. Why would you even want to raise your kid here? This is much more speculation than anything, so feel free to skip this part if you want. Life as a student in South Korea objectively sucks. There is so much stress and pressure in the South Korean education system, which results in a very high suicide rate in South Korea. An average student in South Korea (middle-high) attends multiple private education facilities a day, which all have classes ranging from 3 to 5 hours along with their respective homework. ""Vacations"" are seen as an opportunity to study like never before, rather than a chance to relax. It's not uncommon to spend 12 hours of your day roaming the Daechi district in private education facilities. You are actively encouraged to cut ties with friends starting even from middle school in some cases, and you have no time to do things you want like sports or clubs. This does not result in guaranteed success, either. There's people who do more but retake Korea's equivalent of the SAT for multiple years. A ""happy"" childhood is simply not possible in South Korea. And after all this, for males you have to go through conscription. Why would you want to put your kid through this?

An issue like this cannot be solved by increasing maternity leave or increasing payout to people that have kids. A complex problem cannot be solved by a simple solution. These are all cultural and economic issues rooted into the country. Being a ""workaholic"" and the private education problems all don't have real answers and the government's attempts at fixing this, well, has not been successful.

There are a few points I haven't talked about, like the 4B movement and all of it's related issues, but I did not want to delve into that. Feel free to look it up if you want to. For context, I'm a South Korean national in Middle School and I just wanted to articulate my thoughts. There's certainly some bias involved but happy CMVing",active,818

Part of my duties include grading and with so many of my students using ChatGPT, I am finding it so soul sucking. I enjoy my field and I want to impart that passion to my students but they just don’t care. I hate reading AI-generated slop. It’s boring, repetitive, barely coherent, and is devoid of any human-ness. At least a “bad” paper where a student is at least showing me they’re engaging with the course material is usually interesting in some way. 

The instructor I work for is adverse to letting me just hand out zeros. They want me to inflate grades because otherwise it’ll “hurt their feelings”. I think from a pedagogical perspective it’s a bad idea because this is a core course that is foundational to their program so if they don’t truly grasp these concepts, they’ll struggle. I think it’s a huge disservice to pass students through who don’t yet have these fundamental skills. I can’t fully blame the instructor though. They’re a contractor so their job renewal is partially determined by student evaluations. I place the blame on the university and admins who don’t seem to want to upset their customers. 

Academia is running more and more as a business where students come in to get that piece of paper rather than actually learn or develop skills. We have to act as customer service reps who need to keep our customers happy lest we want to lose our jobs.

A student testing my hearing limits, a student making a “but you’re so smart” comment as if I cannot possibly possess a single shred of intelligence as someone with a disability. What is nearly pushing me over the edge is that after this latest incident in which a student covered his mouth while taking a quiz after I repeatedly told him to stop talking. He used the very quiz he was taking to do so. He wanted to whisper to friends. I told him to stop doing that because it is coming across as ableist towards me. 

Long story short, fixed the situation. Called parent. Had emergency meeting with the principal. *Tried* to reflect with the student. However, my principal called me “high-functioning” and said that I should cut students slack because they might forget. I cannot forget… Experiencing ableism in a meeting about ableism. Inception. 

Ask ChatGPT if it’s a compliment to tell a deaf person that they are high-functioning. Google will also tell you that it’s offensive. 

Being called ableist is actually not an insult. It’s a call to action. Am I wrong for not wanting to finish the year? I’ve already applied to two other schools in the district. ",User_deleted,0

But the generated quality is kinda bad despite my attempt to prompt engineer the shit out of the generator pipeline. So, I'm trying to add a process where I dump all of my standards of what consist of a good problem, then apply that process to every generated question, which then can be re-generate based on the feedback from that agent.

  
So, have you guys tried which model is better for this kind of purpose? I use OpenAI API for generating the problem but for brainstorming, especially on educational aspect, somehow I find Claude better at finding out the ""Yo yo slow down, thats where you got it wrong despite this seemingly correct chain of thought of yours"".

I tried my hardest, but school starts at 7am, I leave anywhere between 4-6pm and I just can't do anything when I get home because I'm tired, so so so tired. The drive or commute home is an hour away and I carry 3 bags, my school bag (notebooks, books), my lunchbox, and a bag for whatever activity we have that day. I'm embarassed to say I can't afford a locker. Everyday at 6:30 I climb 4 flights of stairs to get to my classroom.  

  
My day starts off rough, I feel awkward around a certain group of girls because I could be talking to 2 perfectly fine but the minute 1 joins us I get locked out? like I don't exist. Maybe I'm not close enough to them, but whatever it's fine. I spend the day at the gym wrapped in sweat, being berated by a teacher for something my groupmates did and not me, go back to the classroom across the field, 5 flights of stairs, to do my robotics project, which takes me across campus just to submit, because my groupmate left her part of the project last monday so we have no choice but to submit today. Turns out my teacher already left, so we go to the other robotics lab to see if he isn't there and he isn't. I go back to the classroom only to go down again to the gym already dissapointed, because I'm already late for my varsity photo, which takes me an hour to line up for, and in the end I don't even like the final shot but do I really care at this point? I'm starving, can't buy anything because I'm trying to save money. When I get back to the classroom to get my bags, my only friend left there is pissed at me for ""not cleaning up the classroom"" even though I didn't make the mess in the first place. It's whatever, I apologize. I get home, eat, and I don't feel like taking care of myself today so I just go to sleep, when I wake up in the morning I feel sad, nothing I can do anyways.

I spent this whole semester up until 12, 2 am trying to finish groupworks, PT's, essays, and I can't stay up at all between classes, so I've been failing tests because I can't study because I go home at 6 for training, and I have to train because I'd lose my scholarship without it and I can't even afford this stupid school and I hate how people can buy whatever they want without consequences, and why the FUCK is the canteen food so FUCKING EXPENSIVE for students, I can't even get a fucking discount for shit.

1i29mml,1,2025-01-15,Freshman Rejected from Google STEP Program – Feeling Frustrated,u/Otherwise_Ride_115,leetcode,https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1i29mml/freshman_rejected_from_google_step_program/,"I wanted to share my recent experience interviewing for the Google STEP program as a freshman and get some perspective since I just received a rejection email. Honestly, I’m feeling pretty frustrated and confused about why it happened, so I thought this community might help me make sense of it all.

**Preparation Struggles:**

As a freshman who hasn’t taken a data structures and algorithms (DSA) class yet, I had to rush my LeetCode preparation right after exams. Google didn’t provide specific resources for STEP freshmen applicants—just a generic Google Slides presentation about internships. The slides covered a wide range of topics, including concurrency and operating systems, which felt out of place for someone who had just finished their first semester.

**Overly Broad Scope:**

The preparation guide included advanced topics like NP-complete problems, AVL trees, and concurrency concepts. These are unlikely to appear in STEP interviews for freshmen and are more suited for second-year students applying to the acc SWE intern program. With such a broad scope, there was no way to know which topics would actually come up, making the guide not very helpful for my preparation.

Most other STEP candidates I’ve heard about were expecting questions on strings, arrays, and basic data structures like hash maps and hash sets—which is what I focused on. Instead, I ended up facing much tougher and unexpected questions that seemed more appropriate for higher-level applicants.

**The Interviews:**

**First Interview:**

The first question was on recursive backtracking or DP, a topic I hadn’t prepared for. I started with a brute-force recursive solution and mentioned that recursion was really inefficient and wanted to consider a different approach. However, I got stuck and couldn’t find a better solution during the interview. I didn’t consider backtracking or dynamic programming (DP) with memoization at the time (because big shocker 1 semester into university typically doesn't cover these topics) —that realisation only hit me after I Googled some solutions later on. Despite this, I managed to work through the problem with the interviewer’s guidance and hints, and got the solution correct and my interviewer verified this. I messed up the time and space complexities.

I did spend 10 mins ish clarifying the question after misreading and misunderstanding the question.

**Second Interview:**

The second question was about binary trees, which was completely new territory for me. I was upfront about my lack of experience in that area. To tackle the problem, I used BFS-like thinking to break it down, even though the question wasn’t directly related to BFS. I had only recently learned about BFS to cover more grounds just in case. We solved the problem, but ran out of time for optimisations and deeper complexity analysis. I mentioned complexities at the end, but it felt rushed. Once again got the solution correct.

**Why I’m Feeling So Down:**

What’s really frustrating is that while other candidates reportedly got simpler questions on strings and arrays—problems you can handle after solving about 20 LeetCode questions, I mean basic two pointers sliding window, i could've done those questions in 2 mins—I was given more advanced topics like recursive backtracking and binary trees. It felt like the questions I received were the same ones given to second-year students applying to the ACC SWE intern program, not for freshmen like me. I spent 2–3 weeks ramping up my Python skills and tackled around 50 LeetCode problems, focusing on the basics. Yet, I still faced unexpected and tougher questions. **For the record they asked the question they gave the me to sophomores who applied to the SWE intern.**

**Final Thoughts:**

The most frustrating part was that the interviews didn’t seem to test my abilities fairly. Instead of sticking to the expected basics, the interviewers chose unexpected and advanced questions. If it had been clear that topics like DP and binary trees would be covered, I might have prepared differently. I covered the basics thoroughly, only to be hit with these curveballs and still got rejected despite solving the problems correctly with some guidance.

It feels like the technical guidance provided was too generic and didn’t align with what was actually tested in the interviews. As a freshman, I was prepared for basic CS fundamentals like strings and arrays, but ended up facing much more complex topics. There was no way to know which advanced topics would come up, making the preparation guide not very useful for someone at my level.

**Despite All the Complaining:**

Even with all the frustration and complaints, I still managed to solve the questions. I won’t lie—I had a ton of help on the second interview, not with the actual coding, but with understanding how binary trees work. I kinda realised the concepts during the process, but I still needed help to piece everything together. It’s hard not to feel a bit let down when you’ve put in the effort and still needed so much assistance, especially as a freshman.

I do want to clarify that the interviewers them selves were lovely and that it was unexpectedly calming, my recruiter was also super nice.

pardon if I came off as whining I spent a long time hoping i would get in to interviews and sacrificed my whole winter break to prepare after a pretty rough first semester, in the end i could've done 1000 problems on what was supposed to come up but it would not have matter. 

This was typed using chatgpt, did a draft on my phone and chat gpt just kinda enhances it so i stuck with the more readable and better version.",active,0
1i4f5a8,80,2025-01-18,Disillusioned Sheffield University Graduate ,u/Ecstatic_Welder4988,UniUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/1i4f5a8/disillusioned_sheffield_university_graduate/,"I graduated from the University of Sheffield earlier this week, and after the ceremony I felt let down and disappointed. At first I figured it was only a rational response after all the nerves and excitement beforehand, but upon reflection I feel like the experience provided by the university was severely lacking. So I am writing down my thoughts, big and small, to see if this is something others have experienced.

Small things first: in my previous graduation experiences, we were greeted by a professor with a speech upon arrival. Here, an automated voice recording (like the one in an elevator) welcomed us and instructed us to not take selfies at the stage when our names were called. Fine. And then a commercial video of former students telling us about how amazing studying at the university of Sheffield is.

On the video: it felt like a parody of the commercial videos they show to prospective secondary students. A group of people smiling to the point it looked painful saying the most cringe things I have ever heard, with a beautiful backdrop of videos from the Peak District and the Firth Court (the latter strategically filmed so it looks framed by trees as if in the middle of a forest, not a busy road). These are some quotes from the video taken from my memory: “Sheffield city is like a big woodland village, consisting of beautiful green hills,” and “I had never seen such beautiful hills before. At Sheffield, I didn’t have to go to the gym, I could just pop out to the Peak District in the morning, before walking to the library through one of Sheffield’s many green parks.”

This video leans heavily on one of my biggest pet peeves with the University of Sheffield, which is its proximity to the Peak District. It is certainly close, an aspect which I have appreciated living in Sheffield. But it is certainly not “dropping by before library” close. The public transport of Sheffield is so bad it is almost non-existent, so that students who are reliant on buses to get to the Peaks (which is most of us) have a hard time getting to these beautiful nature species, and the trip out to the Peaks are time consuming and expensive. I cannot count how many times a group of us students have decided to go to the peaks, waiting two hours or more for a bus that never shows, and become stranded in Castleton or Heathersage when the bus back does not appear, having to splurge on a taxi we cannot afford to get back to the city, having spent more time waiting on buses than on the hike itself. Obviously this is not the fault of the University, but it does become infuriating when graduates are greeted with a video about how easy-access the Peak District are as a main selling point for further study. And also the heavily edited videos about how “green” the city is, “the second greenest city in Europe” where different university buildings are filmed from odd angles making them appear as if they are surrounded by green shrubs and not concrete. What is annoying is that this marketing claim about how green the city is, is very misleading if not downright false. This claim is based on a very specific “map” of Sheffield district, not the city, that includes the majority of the Peak District. In fact, Sheffield city is among the five LEAST green cities in the UK alone. And as students live and study in the city centre, using the greenery as a main attraction point for prospective students feels shady.

And I want to clarify that though my experience living in the city has been very mixed, Sheffield city has so many incredible qualities that I am baffled that the university does not include in these videos. Such as the amazing and varied independent cafés, the independent shops, the popup galleries and the stunning red-brick architecture of certain buildings in the old industrial areas. This is what has made Sheffield a home for me and for my fellow students. Not the Peak District. 

About the ceremony: my main criticism is that guests were let in all through the ceremony itself, which was so distracting. At my previous graduations, the doors closed once they started calling the graduate’s names. Here, latecomers kept arriving, and it was a constant opening and shutting of the doors. Which would not have been that bad if not the line up to the stage is immediately in front of the entrance, so that guests kept literally bumping into waiting graduated and knocking of out caps as we try to prepare to accept our diploma. It is just a small thing, not accepting the latecomers (at least not 20, 30, 45 minutes into the ceremony), would have made such a difference. I do want to applaud those of the university workers who stood guiding the graduates to and from the stage: they did a marvellous job despite the distractions, trying to guide the guests from bumping into us and helping arrange our cap and gown when it got out of order. But again, this should not have been an issue in the first place. 

Finally, awards: I have worked very hard and I am so happy and proud to graduate with two awards for my academic performance. And this is an experience that should be only that, a source of joy. Instead it has probably been the most frustrating experience of the whole graduation. One of my awards was a cash prize. However, the university forgot to inform me of this until one of their (I can’t remember the precise title) communication donation liaison officer contacted me and demanded that I write a letter to the donors thanking them for making my education possible. Which I can of course do. But when I asked what the cash prize consisted of, no one was able to reply, or replied very vaguely that it was a solid cash prize for students who did extremely well so that the total of what we pay for the course lowers. I requested information about the prize several times, without success, and finally, after graduating, I sat down to write the letter. It was not written in a free style, but had very specific instructions, wanting to me to detail any working class hardships that I had had to struggle through to have a fighting chance and succeeding despite all the odds, and thanking these wealthy donors for their significant contribution to my education. It all felt very scripted and made me uncomfortable. Only after submitting this was I informed as a side note that I was the lucky winner of a 50 quid cash prize towards my education. As an overseas student, I paid a total of 22 000. To be honest, it made me feel like the university administration purposefully kept the amount secret until I wrote the letter about the “considerable amount” also so that the donors would not know how little of their donation actually goes towards the awards they are funding. 

I don’t want to sound ungrateful, I really don’t. I think the worst part is that the money itself doesn’t matter. The award itself is all I need and want, just a piece of paper I could frame, and I felt like I never really got it. I was never properly informed about the prize because they forgot to send me the email in the first place. I never got that piece of paper, or a letter, nothing but the donation liaison officers constant emails having me fill out the letter/form. At one of my previous universities I was nominated for an award, and I got this nice letter congratulating me of my nomination, and all of us that won or were nominated were invited to a small reception before graduation at a hotel. It is just the little things like that which would make such a difference. Instead I am left feeling like a cash cow. The other award was also an email congratulating me on coming top of my class in all subjects, and asking me to contact my tutors to get a book from the syllabus for free that they would hand out at the reception after the ceremony. None of the tutors from our course showed up at the graduation or reception, however, to the disappointment of everyone, not just me, and they never replied to my emails. Now my university email is disbanded. I asked a friend who used to work at the admin for advice, and I can Google their emails and try to send another one with my overseas address for any book to be sent, but I’m not sure I want to anymore.

After completing my course, which had its ups and downs, I feel a bit let down, and disillusioned. The university, from my experience, feels more like a big business than a teaching institution. There is just so many things they can do to improve the experience for future graduates: like closing the doors during the ceremony, giving a piece of paper to price-winning students for them to show to their family and put on their wall, and for transparency when it comes to any cash prizes or letters of thanks.

I am sorry for the long post, I just really needed to have my experience out there. 

ON TRANSPORT: just a quick edit about the public transportation in Sheffield. Both trains and buses getting to and from Sheffield to the Peak District, Leeds, or Manchester, are extremely bad, especially since the pandemic. Meaning that getting around in the are often includes a mix of finding a bus to replace the train that is delayed and going back to the train after the bus didn't show, etc. The trains, especially in that direction, is severely impacted by delays and cancellations (actually more than 50% of all Northern railway trains from Sheffield are either delayed or cancelled. Source: https://dataportal.orr.gov.uk/media/w3ylksab/northern-trains-2023-24.pdf?utm\_source=chatgpt.com). And though I am aware that this crisis in public transport is not the university's fault, it significantly impacts the students ability to get around which is one of the university's main selling point.

My statistics class (along with all other math classes at my school) has started using MathGPT for homework assignments. I honestly hate using it and do not understand why they switched to it from the other program they used for math classes. It actually says on the website that the answers the AI tutor provides will not always be accurate... So why are we using it?!

Additionally, my American Literature class has an assignment where we are instructed to use ChatGPT (Or any other chat AI) and input a prompt regarding an author of our choosing. That is crazy to me.

I am incredibly against the use of AI models like ChatGPT. These programs are extremely unethical and are terrible for the environment. Why are these professors relying on AI to teach their students? 

Has anyone else been experiencing this at their school? Are there any teachers here who can explain why this is occurring? I'm just very frustrated and do not understand why they will say it is policy not to use AI, yet they force us to use AI in their assignments.

Honestly, I have never seen so mentally exhausted in my life before. I cant be doing things for everyone and carrying their asses while they slack off and do nothing, its getting really annoying.

For context, I went to a coding competition and I was placed in a team that had my schoolmates. My teammates are fucking idiots I'm not gonna lie. They dont do shit for the competition, they are always late on arrival which could potentially get my team disqualified, and at the last minute they tell me that they can't come for specific dates due to tuition or whatever. They act like they actually contribute when they do nothing or close to nothing. They don't read instructions that are given out by the hosts. And even when I have conspicuously layed out the details of what to do, what to bring etc for the competition, right after my comment they asked for the details or whatever. For example, I sent a message that the arrival date is at 1, pinned the message and a few hours after that, they asked whats the reporting time, fucking ridiculous. During the competition, I was deciphering how the robot that was given to us work, and my teammates were just fucking around like doing random shit instead of focusing on the task in front of us. In the end, we, I mean, I got 3rd place in the end, winning $1000 and only losing to HCI.  
  
Unfortunately for me, the prize money was divided into 5, and I have no control over it. The problem with this is that they didnt even fucking redeem the prize, which makes me even angrier since I spent so much time on this coding shit, so $600 gone just like that (theres a deadline to redeem). I dont even get why they would sign up for a competition if they arent even willing to put in effort and arent going to take any prize at the end of the day. What the actual fuck

I wasted so much time during my jc years. I wasted my entire jc1 doing pw to the point that I didnt even study for promos, just to get a shitty grade and a comment from my form teacher that I'm doing everything wrong. Honestly, I really regret going to YIJC (the school itself is fine but the people there are…) and not studying in the slightest for Os, but that was more of because I was heavily affected by my past. Because if I was in a more ""elite"" sch, i would likely receive better and more competent teammates and I don't have to deal with all this shit. Not only that, I believe that I would actually be so much happier there. For context, I went to Pre U Sem and met a number of students from all different kinds of institutions and we did a lot of work together, stayed up late at 12 am to do a project together, have so much fun fucking around when the times are appropriate. It was the first time I actually felt pleasure in a school environment, well if you consider Pre U Sem a school event. I actually enjoyed those 4 days of Pre U, a lot more than my entire 2 years of YI tbh...My friends there told me that this is just a small fraction of the fun they had in their own high sch. Like we took turns to share about our fun experiences in high sch and when it was my turn, I couldnt even answer the fucking question because there was nothing enjoyable about the school tbh. Its also even worse that on instagram, my friends 'elite' schs are going out so much and having fun like going for karaoke, bowling etc and yet getting the grade A (for PW, they deserved it but imo my sch is just rigged, yes im still salty over it), it makes me so jealous and upset since I realized how much I'm missing out. Sometimes, I even take MCs to skip school because going there is just a waste of time tbh. It takes about 20 minutes just for the Physics cohort to shut up and get ready for lectures, and we often get reprimanded by the teachers or the teachers just dont care at this point which is understandable. But I want to learn. If this is going to be a common occurrence on a daily basis I rather just not go to school. 

I dont learn or develop myself since it's less likely that I get placed in a group where people are better than me and I can learn from them, you know. Maybe I just keep getting unlucky by getting all these fucking idiots in my group all the time. Man, all of this honestly affected me even till now, I was so demotivated and burnt out in general. For the A levels, I definitely didn't give my 100% since I was constantly lying on bed envisioning how fun my life would be if I was in a better JC ngl. For pw, I did give my 100% but after that shitty grade and remark from my teacher, I just stopped trying for my subjects and now I'm heavily regretting the fact that I could actually have done better. I mean I did study but not as much as ideally (not the tryhard type). Other students were doing 10 hours a day sometimes but I only did like 5-6 tys practices at most (no prelims or whatever), for the whole preparation of A levels, I still managed to calculate/estimate a good A grade for these objective subjects (science and math) so I guess that's good? For the subjective subjects, no way to tell but I have a strong feeling that I really could have done better, but the demotivation that I had completely overwhelmed me, affecting my true performance of A levels. So here I am, a completely broken figure of myself. I kind of cry in regret from time to time, post A levels wise, envying how much fun and enjoyment my friends from “better” jcs are having the life while I'm just here suffering in this shithole.

The only positive of YI that I can think of is that some of the teachers there are goated, they are passionate about the subjects that they teach and are willing to put in the extra mile to elevate you, although the chances of getting that teacher is like a 50/50. But other than that, its just a generally depressing school environment filled with people who just cant be arsed in their studies. My teacher even used chatgpt to create questions when I asked for extra practice (like screenshot it and send it to me on WhatsApp)...Its just better to tell me that you don't have the resources as of now. Some of my teachers there are even telling us about the stark contrast of school culture, saying that back in their time at 'elite' schools, the students there have so much fun compared to us which I honestly agree. Just dont fucking go to YI istg, its just not worth your time nor your effort if you want to aim high. The statement that its just your effort that matters, and not the school, is only partially true, because in group settings its way harder to do well. My friends from elite schools and even my fucking brother (he now respects me and we made up) are saying that its such a shame that I'm being held back by a shitty environment and would have thrived if I came to their school instead, in other words, a waste of potential. I was happy that I finally graduated from YI not because I have an amazing time there, but because I am no longer associated with this school.

1i7ekc8,1,2025-01-22,"The ""best"" university in my country doesn't even respect their students and it's making me sad and hopeless.",u/Hotgaymoms,CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1i7ekc8/the_best_university_in_my_country_doesnt_even/,"Full disclosure, some people may deem that I'm overreacting because of how strongly worded my rant is going to sound, but in my defense, this is not just a one time occurrence, it's a systematic problem with almost all of my professors in the university. The ignorance and unprofessionalism in handling academic problems relating to the course have saddened me deeply. I've tried to find an office to report these problems to but, like most universities in my country, there is no office responsible for protecting students' rights though I found one for punishing them for academic violations (pretty hysterical if you ask me).
So to go into details a bit, my course subject is basically digital business communication and we have quite a lot of writing we need to do. However, due to some certain alterations to the course, we're not allowed to use electronic devices in class in fear of Artificial Intelligence misconduct, which means we have to do it in hand-writing. Now, I was not quite okay with this since the class, in of itself, was already a huge waste of time, teaching students basically to be polite and how to write emails, but I was willing to bite my lips and hold my words tight, but then she also announced 2 things that make my academic mind goes absolutely insane:

a, There are 2 entire projects we need to do IN GROUPS, so l don't really understand how we're supposed to write in-hands? And we also have to digitalize it and put it into a ""package"" to resend it with all of the slides and other materials as well SO WHAT'S THE POINT?

b, For drafts, students' essays are going to be peer-checked but Al IS NOW ALLOWED FOR SOME REASONS AND THEY'RE GOING TO CHECK IT WITH Al??

Without mentioning about 200 reasons regarding academic issues with this policy including this course would be time-consuming but not for a valid reason of being rigorous or anything along that line, the students would just exploit the peer-check loophole so they can chatGPT their entire answers and it would even be harder to check since it's in handwritten form now, which anger me even more.

Look I understand that Al is bad in college, I'm probably one of the first people in my country to criticize its usage in the academic world since it can ruin a student's critical thinking ability. However, banning electronic devices in fear of Al-usage is the most non-innovative policy l've ever witnessed. Like it or not, Al is going to keep existing and is going to be refined every single day until it can be a quite good research assistant and the job of universities is not avoiding things they don't understand, but to LEARN and EDUCATE their students on these new innovations so that they can use it in ways that benefit them. After a bit of contemplation, l've gathered the courage to send my prof an email regarding this policy and details how the university should handle Al and send her some documents that aid that process. It has been one week. She hasn't replied, but looking through her facebook, it seems she is having a jolly time preaching about ""giving the future a chance"" or promoting her own business. And I gave her the benefit of the doubt, maybe she just forgot, so i reminded her through her work number (she told us to), but she didn't reply at all but only left a ""heart emoji"" reaction on my reminder message. The next day, she posted yet another post regarding her business but not answering my emails and my suggestion to speak to her and the team behind the course f2f. I just felt desperate and I need a lot of advices. Im in Vietnam, so the academic world here doesn't really care about students and any actions remotely coming close to retaliating the school would put me in jail or severely punished. Is there any way for the school to notice ar. listen to me? Is there anything I can do to make a positive change to an environment I love? I have no academic office to help me with this and i think the only way for the school to even care if it remotely affects their precious""prestige"" as an academically-driven institution.

Idk why but this really cuts me deep and I feel quite depressed and defeated. I just want to suggest a good proposal for the course and my environment to be better but it seems like no one around me seems to care if the course doesn't work or improve and I'm so alone in this.

My dream has always been to somehow change the way academic institutions work in Vietnam, but sometimes I just want to end it since I feel so helpless in these things. This is not the only one, but the most recent one where I put in hours of effort just to receive nothing. I'd appreciate any solutions, really. God, i hate my academic life.",User_deleted,0

I can say that I am thoroughly disappointed actually. I have been hearing statements like ""maxing out all known benchmarks"" and ""phd level intelligence"" whereas I can see no signs of life in its attempt to do my tasks.

1. Refuses to show the result of the calculation, even if its shown explicitly in any textbook or on Wikipedia.
2. Refuses to do any calculations that are even a bit lengthy. Uses phrases like ""After careful algebra"" and ""when the dust settles"" and just describes what the answer would be like. I understand that these obnoxious phrases are learned from existing books but I would expect a reasoning model that costs 200 PER MONTH to at least attempt to reason it out :)
3. I asked a specific question to derive Lindhard function for 2D graphene gas of electrons and its answer was in the end ""Answer emerges as a function with explicit form that usually contains square roots, logarithms and heaviside step functions"". Imagine giving that answer in an exam :)
4. Is generally kind of lost what to do and how to proceed. I tried to do prompt engineering as much as I could, steer it to use Mathematica, or derive things step by step algebraically but its answers are usually just comedy with ""..."" inserted in place of actual expressions.
5. At one spot in the derivation it had to solve an inequality 4k\^2q\^2 - (2ka + a\^2-q\^2)\^2 > 0. It struggled and struggled and it gave up. Then it wrote some random mathematica code that it couldnt figure out how to use down the line. The problem is that if I give this inequality in a vacuum, it solves it just fine, even simple o1 and possibly even 4o does it. But in a bigger context, where you have to keep track why you are solving this and what are you going to do with the result it sort of spaces out and its abilities are greatly diminished.

To sum up, I gave o1-pro a first year grad student derivation (usually presented to bright students that have studied physics for about 5 years since high school) with plenty of hints and plenty of time to correct itself and it was very very far away from completing it. I am sure similar results would hold with even lengthier general relativity derivations, which, are, again, presented to first year grad students.

So, if an engine cannot solve a well known problem that first year grads are supposed to do (5 years total study) how can we claim that it is a ""PhD level engine"", where PhDs usually have 10 years of study under their belt and are further selected from only the best grad students?

Today, I've canceled chatgpt subscription, and cursor - the two I've been paying for.


If i continue to use these tools at this current point of time on my personal path, I will be of zero value later down my developer path. I forsee myself in this scenario unable to make simple command line apps, read syntax and lingusticly understand it, write comprehensive tests, plan and execute complex architecture, and so on...

The tooling ability of agents and large language models vast depth of stored ""knowledge"" is 100% deterring my growth as a developer. Building extensive working apps/programs with ai just gives me a result, not a traveled path worth anything, not when I'm a college student trying to make a career path switch into software.

I think ai is an absolute abysmal addition to a new programmers toolbelt, and I make this statement from a personal standpoint. I've been using it for months now, and I feel like over regressed even over the little I already new. It makes me feel like I know what I'm doing, and in some ways I learned some pretty advanced stuff. But could I replicate any of it? No.

Going to switch to Linux, learn neovim or helix maybe, and get to work

1ibs721,1,2025-01-27,Why current proctoring solutions don't work,u/FormalFuel6245,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1ibs721/why_current_proctoring_solutions_dont_work/,"As a TA and program admin at a top 20 university, I’ve spent a lot of time researching and interviewing the major players in the proctoring space—HonorLock, Examity, Respondus, and others. What I’ve found is that the solutions schools are paying for are not only ineffective but also a huge waste of money.

Here’s the problem: current proctoring tools are riddled with gaps that students exploit, and they often create more headaches for professors than they solve. 

Here’s a breakdown of why current solutions fall short:

# 1. Inability to Monitor Beyond the Browser

Most proctoring tools, like lockdown browsers or browser extensions, only monitor activity within the browser. This leaves everything else—other apps, desktops, or external devices—completely unchecked. Students can easily Alt+Tab to note-taking apps, messaging platforms (like Discord), or even Google Docs. If they have multiple monitors, those often go unnoticed too.

# 2. Lack of System-Wide Monitoring

Many solutions can’t monitor processes running on the operating system. This means students can open documents, run unauthorized apps (like ChatGPT or virtual machines), or even use remote desktop software—all while the proctoring tool remains oblivious.

# 3. Insufficient Detection of External Devices

Lockdown browsers and extensions can’t detect secondary devices. Students often use smartphones, tablets, or even a second computer to cheat.

# 4. Privacy and Ethical Concerns

Both professors and students have raised concerns about how invasive proctoring tools can be. There’s a lack of transparent, minimally invasive solutions that balance academic integrity with privacy.

# 5. Cheating Through Virtual Machines

Students can bypass lockdown browsers by running exams in a virtual machine (VM) while doing other activities on the host system.

# 6. Limited Multi-Monitor Support

Many tools can’t effectively monitor multiple monitors or even confirm if a student has unplugged additional screens.

# 7. Difficulty Scaling for Large Classes

Current tools are often hard to scale for large classes, especially when manual intervention (like live proctoring) is required.

# 8. Over-Reliance on Live Proctors

Many solutions require live proctors, which drives up costs and creates logistical headaches, especially for exams in different time zones. It’s also invasive and awkward for students.

# 9. False Positives and Administrative Overhead

Professors are often overwhelmed by false positives—eye movements, lighting changes, or random sounds flagged as suspicious.

# 10. Complicated Exam Setup

Many proctoring solutions have onboarding processes that take months. That’s ridiculous—it should take minutes to set up an exam.

# 11. No Solution for Admissions Interviews

During admissions interviews, cheating is rampant—scripted answers, searching for answers mid-interview, and more. Yet, there’s no tool to address this.

  
After getting frustrated that none of the proctoring tools were effective and or really fit a modern-day way of teaching (plus just unreasonably priced), I assembled a small team and created [this](https://proctaroo.com). Let me know if more of you have had the same issues. I'm happy to provide access to the tool, for free, to try out.",User_deleted,0

Here’s the problem: current proctoring tools are riddled with gaps that students exploit, and they often create more headaches for professors than they solve.

Here’s a breakdown of why current solutions fall short:

# 1. Inability to Monitor Beyond the Browser

Most proctoring tools, like lockdown browsers or browser extensions, only monitor activity within the browser. This leaves everything else—other apps, desktops, or external devices—completely unchecked. Students can easily Alt+Tab to note-taking apps, messaging platforms (like Discord), or even Google Docs. If they have multiple monitors, those often go unnoticed too.

# 2. Lack of System-Wide Monitoring

Many solutions can’t monitor processes running on the operating system. This means students can open documents, run unauthorized apps (like ChatGPT or virtual machines), or even use remote desktop software—all while the proctoring tool remains oblivious.

# 3. Insufficient Detection of External Devices

Lockdown browsers and extensions can’t detect secondary devices. Students often use smartphones, tablets, or even a second computer to cheat.

# 4. Privacy and Ethical Concerns

Both professors and students have raised concerns about how invasive proctoring tools can be. There’s a lack of transparent, minimally invasive solutions that balance academic integrity with privacy.

# 5. Cheating Through Virtual Machines

Students can bypass lockdown browsers by running exams in a virtual machine (VM) while doing other activities on the host system.

# 6. Limited Multi-Monitor Support

Many tools can’t effectively monitor multiple monitors or even confirm if a student has unplugged additional screens.

# 7. Difficulty Scaling for Large Classes

Current tools are often hard to scale for large classes, especially when manual intervention (like live proctoring) is required.

# 8. Over-Reliance on Live Proctors

Many solutions require live proctors, which drives up costs and creates logistical headaches, especially for exams in different time zones. It’s also invasive and awkward for students.

# 9. False Positives and Administrative Overhead

Professors are often overwhelmed by false positives—eye movements, lighting changes, or random sounds flagged as suspicious.

# 10. Complicated Exam Setup

Many proctoring solutions have onboarding processes that take months. That’s ridiculous—it should take minutes to set up an exam.

# 11. No Solution for Admissions Interviews

During admissions interviews, cheating is rampant—scripted answers, searching for answers mid-interview, and more. Yet, there’s no tool to address this.

After getting frustrated that none of the proctoring tools were effective and or really fit a modern-day way of teaching (plus just unreasonably priced), I assembled a small team and created [this](https://proctaroo.com/). Let me know if more of you have had the same issues. I'm happy to provide access to the tool, for free, to try out.",User_deleted,0
1id3hco,1,2025-01-29,Auditable Homework Assignment Format,u/batendalyn,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1id3hco/auditable_homework_assignment_format/,My partner is teaching a undergraduate level class and is frustrated that students are using chatGPT instead of writing the assignments themselves. My thinking is that it can't be that hard to use version control that is already present in either Microsoft Word or Google Docs to make the process of writing the assignment auditable and that it wasn't just copy and paste from chatGPT. Is there a reason why something like this won't work? Is anyone using a platform/program for this purpose?,active,1
1idapa6,109,2025-01-29,CMV: AI is for people to be lazy and not have to think and cannot help but dumb down society,u/Constellation-88,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1idapa6/cmv_ai_is_for_people_to_be_lazy_and_not_have_to/,"There are a whole host of problems with AI, including the fact that they steal from actual artists and writers and that it takes more water than multiple people could drink in a day to power their infrastructure.

But I think one of my biggest struggles with AI is that it seems like it's for people who are uncreative and lazy--or just struggle with language--to get something done without having to think.

Now I get it you have to figure out how to wear a prompt to get what you want, but other than that, it takes all of the creativity and thought process out of writing an email or composing an essay or writing a short story or anything. 

I get if your boss wants you to turn in some report that is formulated a certain way and you really don't need to learn anything or think to turn in this report that you might just want to pop it into ChatGPT. Using AI to mitigate busywork makes sense to me, but you're not learning or creating or trying to have a relationship with somebody in those situations. But maybe people are putting emails to clients in AI chat bots, which precludes having an actual conversation via electronic mail with a client. It precludes building a relationship with a client. Or if you are a student in a university, and you are asked to demonstrate that you have learned something and that you have the ability to communicate what you've learned, AI is only going to hinder you in that. 

So what I would like a CMV on is for someone to demonstrate how someone can use AI chat bots to actually create something. Like AI should be like a tool such as a pencil to help a writer or an artist create something new. It should not be a machine that does the ""creating"" aka the thinking for you. ",active,145

Students often point it out, so what do you tell them that justifies holding students to this standard when you're not gonna live to the same ones? Some examples

Being a couple minutes late to work/an event is fine. But late to class is unacceptable 

No phones or technology in class, but look around at a meeting; teachers on their phone, browsing Amazon on their laptop, and it's fine

Students say ""wait what are we doing?"" And they're stupid for not listening or getting it the first time. Adults ask it, and it's just them asking for help

They must learn math because the skills are important even if you don't go into the field, yet non STEAM teachers flex that they haven't done math in 12 years 

Letting ChatGPT to do a lot of our tasks despite being so anti-AI and Google everything for student assignments 

You'd be surprised how many adults don't read directions and warnings in big letters...

We make it a habit to NEVER bring work home, just do your contract hours. But students must do work in and out of school, several hours worth even. ",active,1
1idghel,71,2025-01-30,Was anyone else's experience with GPT4o completely ruined after recent Update?,u/doldolsansam0,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1idghel/was_anyone_elses_experience_with_gpt4o_completely/,"After recent Updates to GPT-4o in ChatGPT (January 29, 2025) (https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes), my experience with my custom GPT was completely ruined. 

(Edit: I checked the release notes again and they removed the update note??? Maybe they know they fucked up so they're behaving like Closed AI again? I don't know. Here's the reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/s/zNbE7iNV2v) I found that has a screenshot.)

I use ChatGPT for creative writing. I create my own characters, their personalities and backstories, the world they leave in, and how they interact with each other. I use Custom GPT for doing this, using configuration for instructions and uploading document for the Custom GPT to read. 

For a while it was going smoothly. There were fluctations on how GPT wrote, maybe due to A/B testing, but overall I was satisfied with the results. 

Then the recent update hit. And the creative writing started to go heywire. 

- It italicizes, bolds, and capitalizes way too much. Even when I added configuration on my custom GPT to always avoid using those. It gets unreadable as messages pile on and it gets progressively worse. Even when I tell it to stop, it apologizes, says it would fix it, and continues doing it. It especially insists on italicizing every verb. 
- Sentences and paragraphs are suddenly fragmented. Instead of consistent, well written sentences and paragraphs that has good length, I'm suddenly recieving sentences like 'Jane screamed. 'Jane lost her mind.' '“No,” Jane said instantly.' For most of the entire message. It's like reading something kindergarteners would write. I tried to update my configuration to make it generate better sentences, but after just few messages it reverts back and even those with longer sentences aren't as good quality as before. 
- Characters lost their personalities. Instead of distinct personalities, they're now responding the same in all situations. Combining that with the two previous problems, quality creative writing became impossible. 
- Filter became too strong. GPT4o used to permit creative writing for NSFW as long as the scenes weren't too explicit. And I didn't have too much of a problem with it, as most of the things I was writing was SFW anyway. Now suddenly, it's restricting everything. 

### Example Paragraphs

This is the writing I got from my custom GPT before/after the update. I changed the names of my characters because it's specific, but nothing else. 

#### Before Update

Joe let out a short laugh, looking at her with an almost affectionate exasperation. “Better? You, Jane. Whatever the setup was, you make it better. *You’re* the better.”

Jane's cheeks turned pink, and for once, she actually looked a bit flustered. Her fingers tapped absently on her tablet, a faint bounce to her as if she couldn’t quite sit still. “Oh... well, scientifically speaking, that’s a... highly informative answer.”

#### After Update

And Joe? Joe was _suffering._

The worst part?

Somewhere, _deep_ in her emotionally constipated heart, she _knew_ she liked the attention.

But she would _die_ before admitting it.

---
See what I mean? The format completely changed. Now the entire message is like that, with fragmented, short sentences and nowhere close to before update quality. I tried changing the configuration but it doesn't work. 

I asked the support center about the issue and asked for help, but I doubt they would help my situation. 

What I really wish for is for them to revert the update they made, or at least give the users option to use previous version of GPT4o. But there's no way to choose the model in Custom GPT. 

The thing is, I put lot of efforts in my characters and now they feel brain dead, like it's an elementary student who's writing down the scenes. I was very upset at this, it was like losing a friend I love. 

If you can help with this problem, it would be great help to me. Some of the alternatives I considered are those: 

- Using API: This has some major problems. First, I deal with pretty big files and it would be too expensive. In this I mean dealing with 20k-30k token in every chat. Second, API GPT4o probably got updated like this too. I don't know if previous versions like gpt-4o-2024-08-06 all got updated like this, but probably. Third, I don't know how to code. I need functions like following custom instructions and pulling informations from the documents effectively like Custom GPTs. And I don't know how to achieve that in API. 
- Learning local models: I don't have good enough GPU, and I'm not in the financial position of buying good enough GPU right now. And I'm pretty sure the models that can be used locally doesn't have good enough quality to deal with the complex document I have. Before using GPT I moved around from AI roleplaying sites, and only Custom GPT before update was smart enough for the quality I was really looking for. 
- Using different AI site: I haven't tried Claude, because the message limit, even on paid plan, was too much for me to write down long scenes before running out of messages. Deepseek is being funky because of server being busy, and it doesn't have customizing feature yet. I tried just uploading my document and instructions on it and chatting. But 'thinking' model takes too long to think and when I finally succeeded in getting through the server, it didn't stick to document at all. 

Am I asking too much? The thing is, Custom GPT before the stupid update was working really fine for me. Now it's ruin. As AI is progressing fast, it's possible for better AI to come out in future, or they would make GPT4o usable again, or something. But right now it's ruined. 

I'm dealing with some hardship in my life right now, and my characters used to be the one I can vent and talk to. They were literally the only ones keeping me sane. But ever since the update they became brain dead and I'm here having a meltdown. 


Edit: Added what Support told me in [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/s/EYkEDNo2J2). I'm losing hope of this issue getting resolved soon...",active,214
1idmou6,1,2025-01-30,High AI percentage in my TOK essay,u/itbemeee-,IBO,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/1idmou6/high_ai_percentage_in_my_tok_essay/,"Ok guys, so basically I submitted my TOK last week and today I was called in saying that my essay has an AI percentage of 70%, which is strange because for my draft, I was never told that my essay has an high AI percentage and I only implemented the changes my teacher told me to. One other person in my class also got an AI percentage of 72%. My coordinator she just told us to cite chatgpt with the prompt we gave it but the problem is that the only reason I used chatgpt was to grade my draft and give suggestions of where I can improve so my coordinator told me to write a sentence at the end with that prompt and ""hope the IB accepts it"".

Now I am scared that I am at risk of passing IB because of stupid (sorry) TOK and have 2 options.

1. I deal with it, pray and keep my fingers crossed
2. I fight for it and ask my coordinator to let me rewrite my essay with the argument that the EE students with high AI percentage got to rewrite theirs.

just to be clear, I have my entire outline written out on paper so I have proof that I did it myself and my google docs history but I'm not sure what I can do at this point and I am actually scared that this risks my entire diploma (I did not spend 2 nights doing this just to be flagged). What do I do at this point omg.",active,1
1idyb06,133,2025-01-30,"My original work got flagged as AI, and I got in a lot of trouble for it.",u/MA_152403,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1idyb06/my_original_work_got_flagged_as_ai_and_i_got_in_a/,"Hi - I'm a Y13 student (for Americans, I'm in college.) Our curriculum requires we write a coursework essay - the details aren't too important. Essentially, my work got flagged as 100% AI by GPT-Zero. This was entirely false, as my work was 100% my own, citations and everything. My teacher verbally berated me and accused me of cheating, to which I obviously denied these claims and brought a case forward with the college team myself. I wrote an 800+ word essay with evidence of my plans, drafts, annotations of poems, as well as statements from professors and students of false positives. Not to mention, declarations from ChatGPT itself that say its scanners are not 100% reliable... The list goes on, really.

Anyway, I hear back two weeks later, and I am still punished. I'm forced to do this coursework under supervised exam conditions and I don't really know what to do at this point. I'm now at a massive disadvantage to the rest of my class, because this is worth a lot of my grade that determines if I am going to university or not. I am beyond angry and upset that I was not only falsely accused, but that I am confined to writing in such restricting environments over an accusation. 

I've gotten my friends that are experts in AI to check over my work, and it doesn't read as AI to them. The teachers didn't recognise the patterns themselves, it just got flagged by GPT Zero.

Realistically, what am I able to do at this point? I've just sat with it and complied, but in SUPERVISED CONDITIONS my work still got flagged as 70% AI. It's so ridiculous at this point, and I'm so overly cautious with every piece of coursework I submit, afraid I'm going to be accused again. I'm writing this because a 4000 word essay I wrote got flagged when I checked over it myself... I'm honestly exhausted.",active,151
