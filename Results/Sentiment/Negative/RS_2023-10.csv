171z5t1,1,2023-10-07,This course is making me anxious…,u/yg_mofugga,usyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/usyd/comments/171z5t1/this_course_is_making_me_anxious/,"Hi everyone, the past month for me in uni has just been a bit of a blunder and I felt like I needed a space to release my thoughts and emotions regarding my experience. 

I’m an international student currently on my First Year, First Semester taking Bachelor of Advanced Computing, but I shifted from BEcon for the purpose of having a better chance of maybe getting a PR in the future. To be honest, I am like the worse in mathematics and most of the foundational knowledge needed for math was not built throughout my high school years (due to some lapses in the education system I went through). I found it hard to adjust to all the assumed knowledge and prerequisites needed specifically in terms of math for economics and also for AdvComp. Now, I really am struggling towards catching up and relearning the topics of each unit in my AdvComp degree as I am really slow in absorbing advanced mathematics and also have been overwhelmed by the pace and the teaching style of each unit. 

It makes me anxious to see and hear my lab mates discuss topics and like I can’t even follow on what they’re discussing because I am far behind the topics because it’s been overwhelming for me with all the study load and the expectations for each unit especially info and elec units which makes me reconsider of transferring into another degree again but this time with aligning it to what i think i’m good at which is anything social or communications based. 

I’m struggling to decide upon this as well because being an international student at USYD has been a big blow to my family’s savings and I felt like it’s super uncalled for to transfer again and restart after wasting a year of overall expenses for nothing. However, it’s a dilemma as well because as much as it’s hard for me to bring it up to my parents, I also don’t want to keep punishing myself to push through with a degree that I am totally not confident in doing. 

I have been trying my best to catch up and be at par with the expectations of this course, but it’s been so exhausting and I can barely get anything done efficiently or even write my own code without having to get hints from chatgpt. On top of that, I haven’t really had a support group or anything to consult my learning with such as a group of friends from the same cohort. It’s basically been just me all alone. 

I’m trying to push myself to keep going, but the farther I go, the more lost I feel and it feels like it’s just gonna keep getting worse as the semesters go by to the point that I feel like i’ll fail all my units. 

On the brighter note, I’ve been looking into courses such as Bachelor of Social Work or even Bachelor of Psychology wherein I know I will be doing the best in based on my strengths, but just don’t know if it is worth wasting a whole year of expenses again. I just want to get on the right track and do something that feels attainable for me based on what I can do, and at the same time be practical with these big changes on my uni life. 

I’d appreciate if someone would share their thoughts or even share if they have the same dilemmas, or even if you have recommendations like on what might be the best decision, or some ideas and choices as to what course fits the communications and social skills i can build upon then that would be of great help for me moving forward.",active,9

17c99jc,1,2023-10-20,Handwriting is Killing my Grades: Any Advice?,u/R0ckRabb1t,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/17c99jc/handwriting_is_killing_my_grades_any_advice/,"I've struggled with poor handwriting all my life. The trauma goes back to 5th grade, being the student without a ""pen license"" because of my illegible scribbles, dreadful spelling, and slow pace. Though this likely impacted my 12th-grade standardised test scores, I was smart enough that it didn't matter.

My undergrad years were a breeze in this regard, with hardly three exams requiring handwritten responses. I thrived in the digital realm, where typing was my strong suit. Then COVID hit, and I silently thanked it for shifting everything to online assignments, boosting my grades. This digital trend continued during my initial years at a traditionalist and Prestigious law school.

However, with ChatGPT booming, there's been a pivot back to handwritten assignments, throwing me into the deep end. Suddenly, my grades are suffering, and my handwriting is haunting me more than ever.

I tried to anticipate this in my 3rd semester, investing in a fountain pen, learning proper handwriting techniques, and forcing myself to take handwritten notes. But these efforts fell flat, further hampering my note-taking efficiency. 

Is anyone else in the same boat? Have you found strategies that worked? I'm in urgent need of advice before my academics take a more significant hit.

They can’t multiply single digits to save their lives. I have put together classroom data that shows that this fluency has been dropping since 2017.  Whoopee - everything has become worse, right?

Here’s the catch:  The new push is to understand WHY 7 x 8 = 56.  You can’t simply memorize it anymore because that kind of fluency leads to “math anxiety”…and it hurts their math feelings. 

While I agree that number sense and concepts are crucial, figuring out a multiplication fact in fifth grade is like sounding out every damn word in a sentence.  At some point, D-O-G simply means “dog” - now move on.

This smacks of the “data-driven,” primary instruction of whole-language-over-phonetics fiasco that was championed in the 90s.  How did that turn out?

17f1hl9,1,2023-10-23,"UBI is economically incoherent with any level of scarcity and cannot achieve its intended result in the interim between now and total post scarcity, which may be hundreds of years away—if it even happens.",u/flossraptor,singularity,https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/17f1hl9/ubi_is_economically_incoherent_with_any_level_of/,"I asked ChatGPT to ""explain in several paragraphs why government subsidies ultimately fail to produce their intended results. Talk about college subsidies, home loans, and agricultural subsidies."" (Then I selectively edited the response to remove all the fence-sitting weasel words.) Don't skip. Read it.

&#x200B;

>Government subsidies might be implemented with good intentions, aiming to address various economic, social, and political issues. However, they ultimately fail to produce their intended results for several reasons. Let's explore this by examining subsidies in the context of college education, home loans, and agricultural industries.  
>  
>College subsidies are designed to make higher education more accessible to a broader range of students. However, they inadvertently lead to exploding tuition costs. When the government provides subsidies to students through grants or loans, colleges and universities respond by increasing tuition fees. This is because they anticipate that students can afford higher costs with the help of government aid. As a result, the intended benefit of making college more affordable is eroded as tuition expenses rise, making it an ineffective tool for addressing the issue of access to education.

Why are many of you $xx,xxx in school debt? 🤔

 

>Similarly, home loan subsidies, like those offered through government-sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, aim to promote home ownership by making mortgages more affordable. However, this leads to artificially inflated home prices. When individuals have access to subsidized loans, they are willing to pay more for homes, driving up demand and consequently increasing real estate prices. This results in higher costs for all home buyers, including those who do not benefit from the subsidies, thereby achieving the opposite of the intended goal of increasing home ownership.

Why is impossible for many of you to own a home? 🤔

&#x200B;

>Agricultural subsidies are another example of how government intervention fails to produce the desired results. These subsidies are aimed at supporting farmers and ensuring food security. However, they can lead to inefficiencies and overproduction. When farmers receive subsidies, they have less incentive to innovate and produce efficiently. As a result, agricultural markets can become oversupplied with certain crops, leading to surpluses and lower prices. This harms not only consumers, but also small-scale farmers who may not benefit from the subsidies as much as larger agricultural corporations.

Why are so many of you struggling to maintain your health with GMO corn sugar in everything? 🤔

&#x200B;

>In all these cases, the unintended consequences of government subsidies leads to market distortions, increased costs, and inefficiencies.

**State subsidies are the Monkey's Paw of economics. THEY NEVER DO WHAT YOU WANT.**

When you pour money into a segment of the economy, demand increases, and people naturally *bid up* the price. You can think of prices as the result of a bidding war. If you give everyone $1000/month toward rent, for example, all of the available properties in that market/price range would be immediately rented. Property owners would find that they can raise prices to reflect the new demand. Within a few weeks every property in that market would cost about $1000 more.

UBI will instantly raise the price of food, consumer goods, rent, real-estate, and thus achieve the opposite of its intended goal. In the process it will introduce all sorts of wild, unpredictable market distortions. In reaction to the resultant chaos, price controls will be introduced, which historically 100% result in shortages.

Human beings cannot be treated like economically inert objects. Thomas Sowell calls this the chess-piece fallacy. People react to policy decisions to optimize their situation.

Perhaps this changes if/when we achieve total post-scarcity, but scarcity will exist for quite a long time. If we want to see the prophesied leaps in quality of life AI might bring in our lifetimes, we cannot offset the gains with catastrophic policy. We need to start thinking about how people *earn* rather than indulge in the unicornian fantasy of economic *distribution.*",User_deleted,0
17gam3n,1,2023-10-25,I just quit my PhD and my supervisor Said he expected it,u/CHB5BR,PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/17gam3n/i_just_quit_my_phd_and_my_supervisor_said_he/,"I decided to quit my PhD because:
1. I don't have enough free time. I am working on the weekends, during my PTO on a vacation, during state holidays, and even when I am on official sice leave and I have high fever. Why? Well, because deadlines.
2. It is making me so stressed I started to lose my hair and my immunity is significantly affected.
3. I no longer care about our topic and I am not excited to be a part of the team that is trying to solve it. It is not making me happy.
4. I feel like my supervisor doesn't appreciate anything I do and he prefers this other student, who is, in fact, better than me, but mainly because I switched my field of study and he already studied it before. So he will obviously know more and be better, since he actually has 6+ years of experience in this topic, which I don't. 

When I started, I could feel my supervisor respected me and cared about my opinions. Since one of my experiments didn't result the way he wanted, I felt a weird energy shift towards me. He doesn't want me to present my work on our bi-weekly team meetings, because most of it are failed experiments, that he himself came up with. I remember the last time I had freedom in choosing what and how I wanted to be working on - it was in the first semestr of my study. Since then, I always had to work on what he came up with, or I had to prepare study materials for a bunch of courses I was co-teaching. 

If the other student's experiment fails, my supervisor is reassuring and motivates him very much on his next task. When something of mine fails, he looks disappointed and doesn't acknowledge the time I had to spend on it, he's just like ""Well, anyway, you can try this other thing, which also nobody believes will work..."". When we are discussing something and He is showing something on his computer, he shows it only to the other student and moves it away from my sight sooner than I manager to look at it. I spend one month of asking him to show it to me as well, but than I just gave up. And wanted to see, if he is ever gonna show it to me as well. He won't.

When I told him that I no longer want to continue (and I was extremely! polite... and I didn't even use ChatGPT to generace the formal e-mail, I wrote it from heart..), he said, he expected it and that it would get even harder in the future, and if the current state is already too hard for me, it would be the best for me to quit. Like what the hell? What am I doing wrong? 

I discussed it with his former student (they switched supervisor) and they all reassured, that the problem is not in me, that working with said supervisor is just that stressful. The only person who doesn't say that is the other student, who for whatever reason doesn't see, that the supervisor treats him differently.

TL;DR: My supervisor was stressing and didn't appreciate my work. When I told him I quit, he said that he expected me to quit.",User_deleted,1

I started strong, but once ""college life"" and homesickness hit me, I got distracted and started to fall behind, so I turned to the internet for solutions and ended up finding GitHub repositories from past students, as well as making frequent use of ChatGPT.

I want to turn this around because at the end of the day, this is still my passion. I feel extremely guilty because this is not something that I would have ever pictured myself doing at this point in my life. I have not cheated in my other classes previously, and I was a straight A and B student all my years in high school.

I am using this as a plea to the greater internet. Is there any good strategies or resources that y'all have for maintaining focus and getting stuff done? Does anybody have any good C learning resources that I can catch up with, and maybe learn in a way that makes things ""stick"" for an ADHD brain? I can be all over the place sometimes and I really want to be able to make this work.

I guess I really just want advice or to hear if anybody else has been in this boat before. COVID really messed up my ability to think how I used to, and I am struggling to recover from that for sure.
