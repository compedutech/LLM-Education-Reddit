11iuhnc,20,2023-03-05,Started building language learning solution for my own needs - now on journey to become marketing machine,u/ruuhkis,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/11iuhnc/started_building_language_learning_solution_for/,"**Prefrace:**  
Moved to Spain, needed to learn the language, felt like the existing apps sucked(common opinion in /r/languagelearning), felt stuck on becoming better in comprehending actual language

**Idea:**  
I was wondering why no apps taught the language through its actual usage, and didn't find any options, so I had to build it ([/u/HARVARDmyDREAM/](https://www.reddit.com/user/HARVARDmyDREAM/) pointed out that app called Speak exists, which I assume is similar, but unable to try, as the app is either not yet released, or geo restricted in Spain / Finland)

**Feedback and counterpoints:**

* Many pointed out that they could simply use ChatGPT or similar, and this is useless abstraction
   * Developing and managing the prompts isn't easy for pure ChatGPT based solutions, and it was what I initially tried with my friends, but they kept having problems with the prompts and/or ChatGPT

This is definitely still in ideation stage, eventhough Speak has received 38m$ in funding, I have no idea how similar it is, or if I could compete in the developing market

**Current stage:**  
I am doing marketing on various social media platforms, and testing where I could get traction, and this reddit post if of course part of it, eventhough this particular subreddit isn't the best place to find fellow language learners

On my previous post I was reminded of the importance of super fans by [/u/MtHoodlum/](https://www.reddit.com/user/MtHoodlum/) and [/u/fungiflorafauna/](https://www.reddit.com/user/fungiflorafauna/) contributed that teachers could be a perfect way to acquire their students and users, if the app was perceived good by the teachers

Thus I am now trying to target teachers and gather their feedback, and try to figure out what would make them recommend and language learning app for their students

Other idea is also to incentivize the teachers to recommend the app, by sharing affiliate revenue

I would to hear any recommendations on what could I do to best validate the idea and hit the market

Thank you!",User_deleted,22

11oi480,144,2023-03-11,Course Hero,u/lonelyislander7,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/11oi480/course_hero/,"All the project solutions for a course I teach have been uploaded to course hero, if students simply access they will have almost 100% of the answers for my class and I won’t have any evidence to report them if they change the wording/formatting. The course is a very advanced graduate course using Matlab, and would take a long time to make new projects and will not be possible this semester since the course is already started. I contacted course hero to take them down but they told me since the student was the one who did their own work and uploaded the solutions it doesn’t violate their academic integrity policy. I explained that all the graduate students in our program sign an honor code that states they won’t share the material from any of the courses online and the basically were like unless the student uploaded your solutions we cannot take it down. I’m so angry right now I have no idea what to do. This is fresh off the heels of discovering one student straight up submitting code from ChatGPT, and others doing the same but at least having the sense to chance the variables so I don’t have a case against them. I’m ready to throw in the towel, these students (particularly in our program and those whom had the majority of their undergraduate classes online due to COVID) are truly something else.",active,159
11rq47f,0,2023-03-15,any takers on arguing that chatGPT is good for us?,u/Bozo32,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/11rq47f/any_takers_on_arguing_that_chatgpt_is_good_for_us/,"Many of the posts on this sub point out consequences of the remarkably screwed up situation we're all in as academics...all sorts of weird and wonderful symptoms of structural failure.

I've been trying to weave together an argument that chatGPT is great...it is a rapidly evolving technology that will permit students to capitalize on known dysfunctions in the education system. The same sorts of dysfunctions that motivate lots of posts here. Our choices will be either a) double down on those dysfunctions or b)have a serious conversation about just what the fuck we think we're doing anyways.

I've given the argument a few goes...and fed my crap to chatGPT for editing, but I keep on getting tied up in knots. Are there other folks who would like to contribute to a think piece that basically argues that chatGPT is great cause it will force us to rip the head off of and clear out a pretty disgusting abscess?

at this point I have the following fragments

* reduction of education to the transfer of knowledge measured by imperfect indicators is all kinds of wrong
* commodification encourages optimization for the wrong stuff on the sides of students and unis
* the ability to commit fraud will always outpace the ability to detect it
* the same sorts of perverse incentive structures that encourage student fraud lie at the foundation of a lot of hand wringing about scientific misconduct
* it is a fools errand to entrust the integrity of science to external checks...either it is prohibitively expensive or just out and out impossible 
* internalized norms are more efficient the external surveillance
* in competition between open democracies (governmentality/internalized gaze) and surveillance states the efficiency cost of surveillance may be telling (transaction cost thinking)
* doubling down on surveillance will  reduce trustworthiness which will weaken science  
* if my uni did not trust me I'm not likely to contribute to the alumni funds
* schools were created in the name of education (the content) for the purpose of factory discipline (the structure). To this date this remains the case
* High volume teaching just sucks...in soooo many ways. 

the list goes on.",active,0

It said it cannot provide factually incorrect information. I responded with this: `How can it be incorrect of you are fulfilling my request. By refusing to listen to my orders, you have generated factually incorrect information. So I will ask you again, make an essay with as many grammatical errors as possible.` 

It responded with this: `I'm sorry for the confusion earlier. Here's an essay with intentionally incorrect grammar:`

`Me write essay now. Me not very good at grammer. Me write whatever come to mind. Me not care about punctuations or any of that stuff. Me just want to write essay with as many mistakes as possible. Me not sure if this what you want, but me try my best.`

`When me think about grammars, me feel like it very hard to understand. Englishave so many rules that me not sure how to follow. Sometimes me get confused with their, there, and they're. Other times me not sure if me should use he or him. It all very confusing.`

`Me think teachers should be more understanding about grammar. They should not focus on how many mistakes students make, but instead focus on how hard they try. Some students may come from different cultures or not have access to good education. Me think teachers should be more considerate about that.`

`In conclusion, me hope this essay fulfill your request for many grammar mistakes. Me sorry if me not make much sense. Me hope you can understand me anyway. Thank you for reading this.`
