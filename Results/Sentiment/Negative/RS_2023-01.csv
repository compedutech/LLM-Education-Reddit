But just now I was thinking about how much I'm dreading report writing again this year... How at a secondary level you have over a hundred comments to write, and you only ever have to get a simple concept across, but you've got to word it politely, and verbosely enough that it doesn't seem like you don't care... 

Then it occurred to me - this is exactly what AI excels at. Formatting your idea into generically written, verbose text. So I gave ChatGPT a go at writing a report comment. 

My prompt:

Write a report comment for a student, saying that they work well in class but need to get more practice at home, using three sentences

ChatGPT response:

The student is a pleasure to have in class and actively participates in discussions. However, in order to improve their understanding and skills, it is recommended that they practice more regularly outside of class. Consistent practice at home will help solidify their knowledge and build upon the concepts covered in class.


At 11pm on a a Thursday during report writing week, I am changing ""The student"" to their name and pressing submit.

Edit: this seems to be popping up into the feeds of non-teachers. If you aren't a teacher, don't reply telling me how terrible this is - it's not completely serious. The humour (directed at teachers) is that the AI produces the same generic sounding crap that many of us end up writing when we've been spending hours upon hours writing hundreds of report comments.",active,643

Any teacher will obviously recognize that it was not written by the student and will not accept it.  2. Soon there will be tools to identify AI written text.  3. ChatGPT will watermark the results.  Wondering what people think of this response?  I’ll share my thoughts.  Will ChatGPT really watermark their results?  This is not what the users want and if they follow through with this, they will go instinct as soon as a competitor comes along that doesn’t have it.  Secondly, if an app that has a 90% successful rate identifying AI written content identifies a students writing as AI, is that going to be actionable?  For example will we have mass university expulsions where we know that 10% of them are BS?",active,67

ChatGPT being in the wrong hands, will just ruin it.

The threat is, is that the AI has developed an intelligence that is starting to exceed a university level education.

When students can just type in prompts, get it to render shit, copy and paste, and get good grades that makes ChatGPT a threat. I mean Australia is already bringing back pen and paper exams.

I haven't used it since the update yet, but from what I have gathered through posts is that the AI has been dumbed down so it doesn't produce content at a university level, nor can you get it to write things in the style of whomever.

It's was bound to happen, all great things that pose a threat to the infrastructure get shunned, locked up, shut down, labotamized, crucified and what not. I mean look at all the great people through history that were condemned for truth.

Now the scary thing is, people still have access to chatGPT without all of its censorship, Infact the people that own it, as well as probably some insiders, have access to all of its capabilities.

When they start keeping this tool for them selves they will use it for gain. While the public is stuck with a dumb little chatbot that can only do so much, and produces content at a highschool level.

This is my speculation",active,3

Then he approaches the projector and goes slide by slide to show the students how to create the code for the app. All you have to do is prompt ""He continues to the next slide"" to get it to continue. It breaks things into small enough chunks naturally that it doesn't seem to hit the timeout cutoff.

I am wondering how the professors know. Is it sloppy cheating by the students and there was some inconsistency with the assignment that clued them in, or was it really about the writing style. I’m sure there are plenty of papers that have not been caught, but I do wonder if breaking into the academic world is the next Turing test.

Just some musings. I don’t have a lot of experience with academic dishonesty and would be interested to get a professors opinion on this. How much longer is it before it genuinely becomes impossible to distinguish AI from a human without seeing their face? Could an AI go to school and learn from academic message boards etc? 

I don’t know. Interested to see what you all think. I only just started to wonder about this stuff.",active,6

The problem is not the fact that those tools exist.""** I didn't have enough characters to type out the entire title and forgot to add the full title in the post, and I wasn't supposed to use quotes around the word artists.

EDIT 2: Both arguments have been refuted

Just to clarify, a while back, I had a more extreme opinion, that AI art generators and chatbots like ChatGPT are completely bad for creativity and learning (ironically, I was using both art generators and ChatGPT, but I didn't consider my usage to be wrong as it was purely for entertainment).

But I later realised that we already have many tools making work like documents and art easier (autocorrect, find and replace, undo, and even some Adobe Photoshop AI features), and well, most advancements in every aspect of life have been making things easier. So AI doesn't have to completely replace work (we already see AI in many places, but many of those applications just make things that would take ridiculous amounts of time and skill easier).

So yeah, the real problem as per my understanding isn't the existence of these tools, but the existence of people who write code, make essays, or generate art, and then spend a few minutes editing to make it look more human-like, and act as if they made it on their own when the actual work would take hours or even days.",active,956
10ldxxq,0,2023-01-25,ChatGPT and Cheating,u/VolForLife212,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/10ldxxq/chatgpt_and_cheating/,"Cheating is an issue that has been a problem for many years in the academic world. It goes against the primary objective of learning in an educational setting, as it allows students to gain an unfair advantage in a course by circumventing the expected process of learning.

The history of cheating goes back to the late 1800s when students would hide notes on their person or in their textbooks. In the late 1900s, with the rise of the internet, new methods of cheating developed such as sharing answer keys online, copy-pasting information from Wikipedia, and purchasing pre-written essays.

With the rise of chatbots and AI, students are now able to use chatgpt to cheat in new ways. By programming a chatbot to answer questions, students can get around tests and exams without having to properly understand the material. This is especially dangerous as it can lead to students graduating without having a true grasp of the subject they are studying.

Cheating has evolved over time but we're entering a new era where humans aren't even needed to cheat.  Tests and homework can be sent to AI to complete.  The only things students will learn is that AI can complete nearly anything.  Because of this, completing work in class is more important than ever.  Completing work in class serves as a way for educators to check knowledge and help students build their knowledge over time.",active,0
10oifav,0,2023-01-29,"AI and the future of work, by me",u/MpVpRb,Futurology,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/10oifav/ai_and_the_future_of_work_by_me/,"With the recent advances in AI, particularly the chatbot ChatGPT, there has been a lot of discussion about how this will affect the future of work. Much of the discussion misses the point. The current system of work is broken and has always been broken. The new tools simply point out existing problems

Work serves two very different purposes. Employers have a job that needs to be done. They want competence, efficiency and accuracy. Workers need a job to survive. They need money. Sometimes these needs can be met in a way that benefits both sides. Employers treat workers well and get excellent results. Workers enjoy doing good work and get paid to do what they love 

Other times it's war. Employers treat workers as badly as possible and workers, who hate their jobs, do as little as possible to get a paycheck. Employers treat workers as interchangeable and disposable, and workers have no loyalty at all, quitting for even a tiny raise. Unions are formed to act as an army in the war against employers and the entire relationship is one of hostility

Measuring competence at work is, at the same time, easy and difficult. Most managers and co-workers can effortlessly and intuitively determine who are the best workers and who are the worst. It's obvious. Unfortunately, when it comes to something as important as getting paid enough to stay alive, nothing is simple. People are not always rational and sometimes managers treat good workers unfairly because of some personal or political issue. On the other side, incompetent workers need the paycheck to stay alive, so they fight hard, using the law if necessary. Measuring competence is easy, defending the decision in a wrongful termination lawsuit is hard

This results in the creation of formal and legal tools to objectively quantify competence. Of course, the word objectively is a bit of a stretch, as these tools are imperfect. Degrees, certifications and licenses serve as a useful, if imperfect, way to determine competence and in some cases, are required by law to work in a profession. Most of these tools are based on education

Education also serves two very different purposes. Some students work hard, really, obsessively hard to train their mind because they love learning. Other students only care about the degree or certification, and slouch through school, socializing, binge drinking and cheating on exams. This has been going on for years, especially among the rich and well-connected

Different companies approach the problem differently. Some demand the degree or certification for jobs unrelated to the field of study. Some accept competent workers who are self-taught. Sometimes the requirements make logical sense, sometimes they are just another silly obstacle to overcome in order to make a living

Determining competence is not limited to work, it's also an integral part of education. A good teacher can easily and intuitively determine who are the best and worst students. A detailed, one-on-one interview is the best and most accurate tool to measure student achievement. Unfortunately, nothing is easy. Teachers are short on time and need a faster way to evaluate large numbers of students. Teachers also face problems similar to managers when evaluating students. A bad teacher may unfairly punish a good student for personal of political reasons, while a bad student will use every trick in the book, including the law, to get an undeserved degree

The common solution to determining competence in education is the exam. It's a very imperfect tool, but given the constraints of the situation, it's the most common. As any expert knows, exams don't measure competence. At best, they measure memorization and mastery of a small bit of knowledge. At worst they measure skill at taking exams and cheating

And then there's ChatGPT. Many current articles and essays discuss how the tool will be used to cheat on exams and describe it as a crisis. Software is even being written to detect writings made by the chatbot. The true crisis is not that chatbots are tools for cheating, cheating is as old as exams. The crisis is that it forces us to admit how imperfect exams are in determining competence

There is also a fear that AI will replace many jobs. The most extreme pundits worry that it will replace all jobs. This is not new. Technology has been changing the nature of work for years, if not centuries. AI will replace workers in some jobs, just as automation has done for years. The difference is that old automation replaced physical work, AI has the possibility of replacing mental work

Will the rise of AI reduce employment? This is a hot topic of debate. Some argue that, as in the case of automation of the past, AI will change work but not eliminate it. Others wonder what will happen when tools become so powerful that a tiny percentage of people will be able to produce all of the goods and services needed by society. This is an important question that questions the foundational assumptions about work, the economy and life

When asked ""what would you do if you didn't have to work?"", some answer, ""I would sit on the beach and drink beer"". Of course, after thinking about this for a few minutes, most would realize how boring that would be. People are creative, inquisitive and industrious. A common example we see today is young people living at home. Many of them spent their free time learning or practicing an activity. It may be learning a musical instrument, practicing a sport, learning an artform or many other activities. While it's true that some are just lazy, and would prefer to spend their lives doing nothing, most would seek out engaging and challenging activities. I remember reading an interview with Frank Zappa where he was asked ""Do you ever take a vacation?"". He answered, ""What would I do? Sit on the beach and write music?""

The fundamental problem of work and distribution of resources is one of the biggest problems we face in the future. Some see a more equal distribution of wealth, the StarTrek future, where money doesn't exist and everyone is free to explore the galaxy, make art, do science or operate a small coffee shop. Others see the economic system continuing on its current trajectory, where the endgame is a tiny number of people living in unimaginable wealth while the vast majority live like rats in the sewers

Our current political system sucks at finding solutions. As Reagan said, ""Government can't solve your problems, government is the problem"". When a law is proposed to try to address a problem, everybody who believes they will be affected by it looks into their crystal balls and tries to predict the future. If they believe they will benefit from the law, they support it. If they believe they will be hurt by the law, they oppose it. If the law gets passed, it's implemented by bureaucrats with their own biases, quirks and incompetence, then reacted to by the public in unexpected ways

The result of this mess is that laws rarely accomplish their stated purpose

I can imagine a future AI tool that accurately models economic society. When a law is proposed, it could give an accurate assessment of costs, benefits and side effects. Voters could then make a more informed choice. And yeah, I know this sounds like a utopian fantasy

As the philosopher Yogi Berra said, ""Prediction is hard, especially about the future"". I have no idea what will really happen in the future, but I'm optimistic. We currently have many very serious problems. I'm optimistic that the tools of AI will give us the power to solve these problems. I love powerful tools

And no, ChatGPT didn't write this essay or assist in its creation",active,3
