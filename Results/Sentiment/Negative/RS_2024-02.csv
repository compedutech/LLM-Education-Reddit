I have zero friends, no job, and I stay home pretty much 90% of the time when I'm not in class. I had a nice group of friends in high school, but they all started to hate me by senior year (I don't really know what I did or why they didn't like me but I feel like this happens to every friend I had) and none of them talk to me now. I have trouble meeting new people since I think I'm really weird and have dumb niche interests that nobody else could possibly care about, so I don't open up to people because I don't want to embarrass myself. I feel like all I ever do is get mocked by everybody. When I leave the house I go out and spend money (that I barely have) on stupid shit that makes me feel happy for about a day until I realize I don't have money for gas now.

I did not want to go to college but my parents told me ""I have to"" because they think a degree is a golden ticket or something (neither of them went to college and they both have pretty nice jobs now). I don't want to live with them anymore but If I leave I feel like I'm going to ruin the rest of their lives because I'm all they have. But being the only child I feel like I have an extreme weight on my shoulders that I have to succeed because they don't have anyone else. I think school is a waste of time. I'm in the lowest level courses I can possibly be in and I use chatgpt to do all my homework assignments, I'm not learning a single thing. (I guess I should mention this is a cheap commuter college, therefore I go home every day after classes) I don't have a fucking ""dream job"" and I have no clue what I'm working towards. The only thing I'll be happy about after college is never going back.   
All my parents do is bug me. They don't let me do a single thing on my own because they don't trust that I'll do it. They are extremely wrong, I can actually get things done on my own but the second they try to ask me about it or remind me to do it I lose any and all motivation to do it because I no longer feel like I want to do it, It makes me feel like I'm doing it for them. I don't know how to get motivated.   
 I just want to be away from all of this and start a new life somewhere else, I feel like I'm an embarrassment to everyone who knows me and I want to disappear. ",User_deleted,1

And I don’t mean planning content/lessons for them, or even grouping students, I mean the literal scheduling of groups due to logistical constraints. We have tons of interventionists and pull-out services at my school, which is awesome, but makes it near impossible for me to plan my own groups because all the kids I need are gone at different times that usually directly conflict with the block we have open in our schedule for small group. My admin has stated that they expect that we do small groups but has not really given any guidance as to how. Every time I think I’ve found a way to see everyone, I discover that a student in that group is being pulled at that time and wouldn’t fit into my other group, so either I just decide that kid doesn’t get seen by me or have to restructure all my groups. Our specialists also gave us a “flexible scheduling” template and told us we’re expected to be completely flexible with our groups and change them up each week. 

I don’t know why this is so hard for me. This feels like an impossible math problem. Is there any tool I can use to make this easier? ChatGPT or some other AI? Please help. I’m so overwhelmed.

Thus, it's easy to catch and confront. That was last semester's battle though.

This semester?

I'm teaching content that is admittedly tempting to chatgpt (dense text stuff), and to be fair, ChatGPT can do a fairly good job of summarizing key ideas—this stuff has been around for, IDK, a few centuries and is taught in every iteration of this course in the English speaking world, so... I get it. I tweaked the assignment so that summary is a mere fraction of the grade and put many more points on open-ended questions/application/etc., so even if the student summarizes the text with chatgpt it wouldn't be enough for an A, or even a B really.

BUT, I'm finding that some of the ""summary"" portions are really good. Like *really good*. Like, *holy shit this is grad student good.* To the point that I find myself second guessing my students! No I'm putting things into chatgpt to summarize, and I'm finding my students' answers are better than chatgpt's! 

In essence, AI paranoia is making me second guess student excellence, and that makes me sad. It's one thing for low-effort students to try and slide by via mimicry, but to make me doubt students who are actually excelling, that's criminal IMO.",active,67

I'm currently a computer engineering student, and I've been feeling incredibly lost lately. It's a strange sensation because on one hand, I'm surrounded by so much information and technology, yet on the other hand, I feel like I'm not really learning enough or grasping the core concepts in my major.

Firstly, I've been grappling with this feeling that I'm not gaining enough from my university education. Don't get me wrong, the classes are challenging, but it feels like there's a disconnect between what I'm learning in school and what's actually relevant in the industry. It's frustrating to spend hours studying concepts that might not even be used in real-world scenarios.

Moreover, the constant barrage of news and videos claiming that ""IT is dead"" or that certain programming languages are becoming obsolete has been really getting to me lately. I used to brush it off, but now it's starting to make me question my career choice and whether I'm investing my time in the right field.

On top of that, I feel like I'm spread too thin across different programming languages and technologies. I know a little bit about JavaScript, React, Java, Python, SQL, but I don't feel confident enough to actually use them in a practical setting. It's like I know a little about everything but not enough to truly master anything.

One of my biggest struggles is understanding the learning path. Why should I spend hours learning the basics of a programming language when tools like ChatGPT can generate code snippets in a matter of seconds? It's hard to see the value in investing time in foundational knowledge when automation is becoming more prevalent.

Overall, I'm feeling lost and unsure about my future in computer engineering. Has anyone else experienced similar feelings? How did you navigate through it? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for listening.

TL;DR: Feeling overwhelmed and lost in my computer engineering major. Not learning enough from school, bombarded by news claiming IT is dead, and struggling with learning multiple programming languages without feeling confident in any. Unsure of the value in learning basics when automation tools can generate code quickly. Seeking advice and insights from others who've experienced similar dilemmas.",active,22

So far, I've only submitted my French B HL IO, English A L&L HL IO, and Psych SL IA. I'm currently failing Visual Arts HL, having only a bunch of writing for my comparative study with no comparison, no piece of my own, and barely any images. I'm technically not failing Math AA SL, but the deadline has long passed for the final IA, and I have yet to even write a draft. Same with ESS (SL).   
My idea for math was that I would model the Spiderman logo (specifically Miles' one) simply because I know I have to pick something that I like. But my teacher said that I needed to go further with it and that I couldn't just model the image (even though that's what another one of my classmates did and I based my idea off of an IA on [clastify.com](https://clastify.com) where a student modeled the Starbucks logo). Can someone help me find a way to either further my investigation or help me pick another topic? (hopefully still Spider-Man related).   
As for ESS I originally wanted to run an experiment to investigate the extent to which oil pollution affects the photosynthetic rates of aquatic plants (like elodea) but none of the equipment was working as it should've been, so my teacher suggested that I switch to secondary data instead. After talking with my mom, she suggested that I investigate the extent to which air pollution contributes to child mortality rates in certain countries. I think its a great idea, the only problem being that what my mom wants me to write conflicts with what my teacher wants. Tbh I'm more inclined to follow what my mom wants, because she has a masters in public health and I honestly trust her experience way more than my teacher rn (long story short we had a fucking fantastic teacher for DP1 and this new one we have is sub-par by all means both in teaching styles and in the grades that students achieve in accordance). My teacher said I should use the gap minder site to gather all the data on this, and that I should do it using countries of similar economic development. My mom said that since the site does not let you narrow down the data based on the reported cause of death, I should use other sites like WHO to gather data specific to child deaths based on respiratory diseases and I could also limit the age range as I don't think gapminder provides me with that information. She also said that it would potentially be better to compare an MEDC to an LEDC as opposed to multiple LEDCs. I tried to explain this to my teacher but he just said that it doesn't matter how in-depth I go, just that I should get it done (and this, to me, seems like he just wants it over with and could care less about the grade that I get) but to still use just LEDCs from the same region. I'm thinking about maybe combining the two, have the first part of my IA using just gapminder data and then as I go through I would change my method to make it more accurate. Is that a good idea or am I just overworking myself? Should I stick to what my teacher said? Or what my mom said?  
Lastly, does anyone know of a way to easily compare and contrast ""The Monk by the Sea"" by Caspar David Friedrich, ""The Great Wave off Kanagawa"" by Haruki Murakami, and ""Impression, Sunrise"" by Claude Monet? Or have any similarities/differences they can think of off the top of their head that I can then further develop on? Or of an idea of what to do as my HL piece?  


I'm sorry for the long text but I just need some help right now because my IB coordinator's idea of advice is ""you just gotta do it"" and that's not helpful whatsoever.

1auxc7h,36,2024-02-19,Disappointing Experience with IB302 Evolution Exam and Course Structure,u/No_Chip7848,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/1auxc7h/disappointing_experience_with_ib302_evolution/,"Hey everyone, I wanted to ask if anyone also had a wildly disappointing experience with a course before.  


I wanted to share my experience with the IB302 Evolution course (CRN 48172) and see if anyone else is feeling the same way or has some advice. Today, we were supposed to have our first exam at 1:00pm in room 114 of David Kinley Hall. It was a 30-question multiple-choice test on a scantron, but things didn't go as planned.  


First off, there were no proper seating arrangements made in advance, which was surprising given the importance of the exam. But what was even more shocking was that the professor dismissed half the class at 1:16pm because he failed to provide enough exam forms. We've been discussing this exam for roughly two weeks, yet the detailed structure and number of questions were only communicated last week, with a vague promise that it would align with the ""Learning Objectives"" outlined since the beginning of the course.  


These Learning Objectives are supposed to guide our understanding of evolution, but the way they've been presented has left us with more questions than answers. The lectures have been a mess of hastily put-together Google image slides, often skipped over or rushed through, and any attempts to seek clarification are met with deflection.  


And don't get me started on the labs - they feel like a complete waste of time. We've spent hours playing with marbles and toy chemistry sets, supposedly to demonstrate phylogenetic trees, but it all feels so trivial and disconnected from the real substance of evolutionary biology.  


Looking back on the past 5 weeks (with three one-hour lectures and a three-hour lab each week), I'm struggling to see the value we've gotten from this course. It's disheartening to realize that nearly everything ""covered"" so far could be condensed into just two slides from IB 204 Genetics, a prerequisite for this class.  


Additionally, the Interactive Reading Assignments (IRAs) on Moodle have been a source of frustration. These quizzes seem to be thrown together hastily, with answer options that often don't align with the minute content we've discussed in lectures. It's gotten to the point where the Professor had to retract two questions from our last quiz due to their blatant inaccuracies. In one particularly infuriating instance, a question on the definition of evolution presented two identical answers as options, yet choosing one was marked correct and the other incorrect, with no rationale provided.

  
The course's re-invention of the Canvas discussion forum through Perusall has also been perplexing. Instead of facilitating meaningful engagement with the material, it's become a platform for reviewing papers that we've never discussed in class. While the initial assignment, which placed us into randomized groups of four, was manageable, the most recent assignment lumped half the class into a single ""randomized group."" It's impractical to expect productive dialogue or note-taking when over 150 students are all trying to discuss the same paper.  


It's important to note that the lab TAs seem just as lost in this chaos. They're doing their best, but the lack of clear instructions from above limits their effectiveness. Moreover, the professor's failure to elucidate the relevance of these papers to our study of evolution only adds to the confusion. His endorsement of using ChatGPT for quiz assistance is concerning, to say the least. It wouldn't surprise me if he had, in a last-minute scramble, tasked ChatGPT with creating an exam based on the learning objectives. The course materials feel recycled and disjointed, with slides borrowed from Google Images, lab activities taken from other institutions without proper context, and outdated lab worksheets that leave us groping for relevance.  


This disjointed approach to teaching, coupled with the lack of coherent course materials and structure, is not only frustrating but also detracts from the learning experience. Has anyone else encountered similar issues in this course or with other courses in the department? How have you addressed these challenges, and do you have any suggestions for navigating this situation? Any insights or experiences shared would be greatly appreciated.  


Is anyone else in IB302 feeling the same way? How are you coping with these issues, and do you have any advice on how to approach the professor or the department about these concerns? I'm all for constructive feedback, but after 5 weeks of this mess I'm done trying to be polite.  


Thanks for letting me vent, and I'd really appreciate any guidance or shared experiences from you all.",active,39

I'm back with an update on the IB302 Evolution course situation, and unfortunately, it's not looking any better. After my last post, some suggested banding together or speaking to the professor individually, but it seems like many of us have lost the drive to even try. Those of us who didn't get the exams on Monday finally had the chance, and to put it mildly, it was underwhelming. Condensing five weeks of supposed ""evolution"" knowledge into 29 questions felt a little weird. Crafting exams is no small feat, granted, but the basics like seating arrangements and printing enough papers shouldn't be this challenging.

The exam was filled with questions that felt more like riddles than assessments of our understanding, asking us to choose the ""truest"" statement among truths. I take back my comment about the professor possibly using ChatGPT for the exam creation; I genuinely believe even an AI would've done a better job. I've seen more work be put into Quizlets, and I'm not joking when I say that giving a teenager access to Wikipedia would result in a more focused exam. Directly asking about the exam's phrasing of certain questions - at least on my part- was met with evasion, leaving me more confused than clarified.

A professor mentioned in my last post that maybe this instructor didn't have enough material or support, yet I've seen footers on lab materials showing that they're reusing old lab materials from 2020. Even still, I'm sure there's no effort involved in asking the previous instructor or lab coordinator for help writing an exam. I understand the feeling that you need to implement creativity when designing assignments, but given the repeated confusion across all of the class work, would it not be best to resort to referencing classical examples (e.g. Darwin's finches, tortoise shells, bacterial antibiotic resistance), rather than scavenging for the most random scenarios for the exam (hare fur dependent on region, allele variation of elephant hide color, sexual selection on a robot's code to navigate a maze, etc.)?

At this point, I strongly feel like writing a petition asking the IB204, IB150, or even MCB150's professor to teach the class. There was nothing on the exam about epistasis, pleiotropy, genetic assimilation, conserved DNA sequences, phenotypic plasticity, coevolution, tradeoffs, or phylogenetic trees. There was one question vaguely related to polygenic inheritance, one question whose choices debated between synonymous substitutions and frameshift mutations, a few questions about genetic drift, and only 2 questions which I recall that dealt with divergent/convergent evolution.

Moreover, I feel like the professor has, for lack of better terminology, a compulsion for insisting upon asking questions with the premise of why evolution is true. All of the students in this class have taken 3 or 4 courses which directly discuss evolution, yet it seems that this professor is somehow under the assumption that one of us is an ""imposter"" believing in divine biological modification, or that we would simply respond to a fact-based framework with ""nu-uh"". Of course it is important to discern between hypotheses/theories/laws, but at some point students become disinterested with the minutia which have been discussed ad nauseam across courses and now seek to learn the finer points about evolutionary biology.

I'm here to learn and engage with the material, but this course seems to be an exercise in futility. Being offered a meager 4 points of extra credit hardly compensates for the time and effort wasted. It's disheartening to encounter such indifference towards teaching from someone who's supposed to guide and inspire our academic journey. It's really depressing when your 4 credit hour course covers less material than the Amoeba Sisters or CrashCourse. On a personal note, I might literally combust into flames if I have to read another 30 page document for a 5 minute quiz at the start of lab, or if the content of the next Perusall homework is summarized in 2 slides during lecture. 

I can't be the only one feeling this way. Has anyone else reached their breaking point with this course?  Apologies for the rant, but it feels like we're dealing with a level of neglect I've never seen before in an academic setting.

1axsy1o,56,2024-02-23,I'm starting to suspect that my Professor writes fake RPM reviews,u/Independent_Peace144,CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1axsy1o/im_starting_to_suspect_that_my_professor_writes/,"Context is that my professor is the professor for Discrete Math. Her class is notorious for being horrible, but since she's the only professor I had no choice. I tried to keep an open mind that maybe she is just bad at teaching, and a bit harsh on grading. I didn't score very well but I was always around 20% above the average, so I'm doing alright. She punished you for guessing and there was no MCQ, because she said that you don't really understand it if you guess. Okay, that's harsh but fair enough.

However, she seems to be extremely paranoid about cheating. For homework, you could either submit solo or do it with a partner, she straight up said that those who do partner, if both partners submit, they will be subject to violation of Academic Integrity, because the two papers are technically identical so it's technically cheating. (even though she literally allowed them to work together) Luckily, I did mine solo. 

She also made us fill out a survey that I swore was trying to get us into ""admitting"" we cheat. The survey kept asking if you use ChatGPT, blab blah blah, did you use chegg. Obviously, I answered no, because well, I really didn't, but imagine if someone answered yes, they would've been banished to the shadow realms. 

Also apparently, she heard that someone was using their phone during a quiz (no proof someone was), and she straight up threatened to give us all zeros. Good thing that didn't go through because I studied my ass off for it, and got a 90 on that quiz.

Welp, last class, she tried to coerce people into admitting they cheated on their code. (There was a homework that required you to write C++ code for prime numbers and stuff). I swore she's trying to gaslight people into ""Admitting"" that they cheated even though they didn't. She says that if she THINKS you cheated, she will give you a zero and yknow the academic integrity thing. Apparently, she was freaking out about codes that have as little as 3% match, but there's only so many ways you can sort prime numbers, like bruh, there's bound to be some similarities. I know I did all the code myself, so if I do get written down, I'm gonna fight it, but it's absolutely inane that she goes to such great lengths for this type of shit. 

So onto the RPM thing. My friends in the class have decided to report her because of her ludicrous behaviors, and apparently she has been reported in the past too, but then she would always huge curve to save her job (which is comforting news because I'd probably get an A). I decided to check on her reviews, and realized that all the 5 star reviews sounded too professional, too weird, and had inconsistencies. One of them said that ""said"" student had her for X class, but this X class, last time she taught it was like 3 or 4 years ago, nobody just suddenly decides to leave a review after they already graduated for a class they took 4 years ago. Most of the reviews are along the lines of ""most people fail because they don't lsiten"" ""they have the audacity to leave bad reviews because they do horrible"" ""i once had office hours with her till 11pm"" Please, no one is staying till 11pm. ""She gives due date extensions and lots of hints."" Hell nah she doesn't. Her TA office hours are amazing but like her actual office hours are really not that great. Other reviews are like ""if you wanan pass this class without using ur brain then drop this class"" ""shes a gem"" ""she's great she's amazing"" Like it's possible some of them 5 star reviews are students, but I find it hard to believe now. Showed it to my friends and they seemed to agree too. All the 5 star reviews have perfect grammar and punctuations while the real student reviews are filled with crappy english spelling and slangs. All the negative reviews have like at least 3 thumbs down, which I bet is her inflating it, and she reports the negative reviews as well. It's worth noting that she is AWARE of her rating on RPM, because she acknowledged it during first day of class.

My god, it hasn't affected me yet, but her pettiness is really making me dislike her. ",active,58
1ayc2vu,69,2024-02-23,Can someone explain what motivation parents have to neglect their children's education/future?,u/cravingblueberries,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1ayc2vu/can_someone_explain_what_motivation_parents_have/,"I'm a second-year teacher, young and thus have no children. After recent posts in this sub about how far behind students are academically and the lack of coping skills to overcome both minor and major challenges, I'm left wondering why more parents are not teaching discipline, taking education seriously, etc. (I know not all parents are like this, just asking in regard to those who are.)

I'm (23F) only 5-7 years older than my students and things are drastically different from when I was a student in high school myself. With chronic absenteeism, frequent attempts to cheat using AI, and their inability to read, I'm calling home nearly every day. Our district isn't necessarily well-off, but we aren't too shabby either. Still, I'll tell parents about their child who has turned in an assignment using ChatGPT for the 50th time (it's obvious since they can't write complete sentences nor spell basic words on our paper tests) or has 10 missing assignments and many will tell me to not call them again. Why? What is it that's causing a decline in the degree to which parents care about their children? Your daughter can't read at a 7th grade level despite being a senior and you aren't concerned?

I can't help but wonder if all the issues in society (e.g. high inflation with low wages) are connected to the issues we see with parental involvement today. Does anyone have any thoughts as to what's going on here, especially those who are parents themselves?",active,71
1b17d6l,2202,2024-02-27,Please. Don't. Cheat. I'm begging you. It really hurts.,u/sgcsthrowaway,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1b17d6l/please_dont_cheat_im_begging_you_it_really_hurts/,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. As a lecturer, I just finished grading my first take-home assignment of the semester. The amount of cheating blew me away. It is so brazen this semester, I can't even report it unless I really want to end up failing a quarter of the cohort. Colleagues tell me it's a waste of time; why create lots of trouble and paperwork for myself? Why earn the reputation of being an unreasonable ""bad guy"" among students?

Submitting identical solutions with identical errors without so much as a change in formatting. Submitting work with a high degree of similarity even after some strategic re-wording. Submitting identical code with changed variable names. Submitting identical code where the only difference is the number of newlines. Straight up indirectly admitting to cheating because ""I only changed up my friends code a little bit, why am I marked wrong?"", like WTF. Literally sending me a screenshot to prove that they shared their code with a friend. Some people seem to have remembered nothing from the slides on academic integrity from the first class of the semester.

It's taking a mental toll on me. When I see students who get things wrong, it really hurts me to take marks away from them because they actually took the effort to attempt the question honestly and it shows. I can't even look at students in the eye during lecture anymore because I can't help thinking that I'm doing them a disservice. Some of them aren't learning much and sending them off to employers when they graduate will just tank the reputation of our department. 

It is painful to have to put up a smile while students who quite obviously cheated come up to me after lecture and demand extra marks for the same error they copied from one another. It is painful when I hear whispers when I walk out of the lift ""Hey isn't that the prof you complained about... Shhhh!"" It was painful when a colleague told me ""This is a service industry and we have to keep our customers happy"". It is painful to sit in a faculty meeting discussing replacing take-home assignments with in-person exams because of such issues. It is painful and unhealthy in general to be in such a low-trust environment. 

No matter your school or stage of education, please understand that your teachers are human too. I can't speak for others, but when cheating happens it creates a massive moral dilemma for me that almost makes my brain explode. I don't want to fail anyone. I don't want to be a monster in the eyes of students. I don't want students to think I've got an attitude problem. I don't want to have an adversarial relationship with my students. I've developed a healthy fear of my students that I might never be able to get over. But I really am getting mired in depression and the next lengthy, polite ChatGPT-generated email with 10 bullet points asking for more marks might just be the thing that does me in for good.

1b1nvk6,3,2024-02-27,Is ChatGPT making my classmates dumber?,u/stir-fried_cabbage,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1b1nvk6/is_chatgpt_making_my_classmates_dumber/,"I'm a college student and while I do welcome the convenience brought by ChatGPT, I'm beginning to think that it may be too convenient.

Students are now capable of just typing in prompts and copy pasting the answers the AI provided and thats it. They learned nothing. These people are going to be future teachers by the way.

I miss the days where my classmates would go and complain about how difficult the homeworks were but still manage to complete it after combing through various sources. At least they're learning something.

Now, they'll just go to ChatGPT, prompt the keywords, then get good scores because of how well the AI wrote that essay. 

The professors can't even tell the difference between AI made and human made homeworks so studying just feels empty and unrewarding now.

I'm really just ranting here, but I am still curious as to what you all think.",active,2
