TLDR; I’m a lonely pedophile and I have no motivation to start my life yay


not every aspect of my life is terrible. i mean at least i’m not in fucking poverty or anything. the social and love and sexual parts are suffering— relationships in general. i’ve also felt like sleeping every day away for a long time now, and every year it gets worse. i have anemia which contributes to feeling so tired and bad all the time. this isn’t gonna be very coherent, just a mess of a ramble. after i graduated high school last may, i feel like i have no reason to do anything anymore. i don’t have any drive or ambition to commit to a career, i just tell my family i want to tattoo because i love art. i do find satisfaction from art, but in the past month i haven’t really felt any motivation to make anything. i miss my two most favorite teachers in the world. one of them is a woman, i have her snap and we talk when she gets a chance. but i especially miss my other teacher, i’ll call him hum. i miss having friends my age to talk to every day, but i can only blame myself for not having that. after graduation, i sent long texts to my four closest and best friends, estranging myself from our group because of my certain “inexplicable” traits that i didn’t feel like keeping from a real friend. i broke up with a boyfriend in january, then had to let go of the next one in june.
the source of my issues is my acceptance of my pedophilia as part of my identity.

i was sexually mistreated in some way when i was a kid, i can’t remember details. i just know there were two separate incidents, and apparently my family said i got really quiet and reserved after the first thing happened. i still can’t explain or verify these things because i just don’t remember. i do have a little bit of memory of the second incident though. i remember feeling my mom’s boyfriend’s hands touching my inner thighs and my privates in my sleep. i had always thought it was a weird dream, until november of 2021 when a family member brought up how he tried to fight the guy who did something to me in the first mystery incident. no one witnessed what happened then so i couldn’t tell you. i would’ve been around 7 in the first incident, then maybe 9-11 in the second one. again my memory is so cloudy i don’t really know. anyway. after the memory of the second incident came back and i realized what happened, i went through what you would expect. i felt gross, i felt contaminated, i felt tainted, i felt wrong wearing showy pajamas in my own bed for whatever reason. i felt disgusting. i also was afraid of just random people. when certain people touched me i felt violated, even though their behavior was normal. i was 16 at the time.
soon i had an interest in going on twitter and sending any boys or men pictures of me. classic i know. i guess i wanted to “win” this time, if that makes sense? i wanted power. this continued for a very long time. sometimes i got burnout from touching myself so much for these random people, but i would fake orgasms on camera just to make them happy. i felt bad for not following through with promises. i did take a break for a couple months one time because of new issues i was having.
i don’t know why, i can’t explain what put this in my brain. but one night when i was touching myself in the shower, completely alone with no distractions or influences to bother me, an image of my 2 year old half-brother showed up in my head. i felt myself get out of my rhythm and stop touching, feeling disgusting about seeing him in my head at that moment. i don’t know how that happens, it just did. i tried to calm myself down and push the thought of him away, and i did with a lot of effort. 
this would continue to happen again, and again, and again. my brother, who i saw as someone precious who i protected and took care of and changed his diapers. why this???? these unwanted thoughts didn’t get better, and i went through cycles of guilt and shame and remorse. i felt so bad at one point i put up his pictures in my room into a drawer so i wouldn’t have to look at him. i remember crying a lot and not being able to tell anyone about it. i was suffocating myself. every day i just hating being me. i kept thinking, why me? why him?

there was this one guy we’ll call S. and another who we’ll call X. both are in their twenties. X was a guy i traded pics with every day, who made me feel so special and adored. he was also my gateway to paraphilia that i hadn’t been into at the time. throughout our time together he told me about his rape and assault victims, ranging from actual babies to teen girls. S was a friend who has a really good job that requires nearly all of his time, so we didn’t talk too much. i really liked how genuinely sweet and cool he was, putting aside the pics we sent and video calls. on one of our first nights, he confided in me and told me he was groomed and sexually assaulted for some time when he was little. this made us feel like we could really trust and understand each other. S turned out to be important later. one day X decided to leave without any notice or goodbye. this really messed with my head because i wanted to meet him one day. he had so many promises and dreams for us but then one day, it’s all gone.
anyway, after some time passed, i slowly got used to the pedophilic thoughts. yeah it was still torture but i learned to live with it. i was already genuinely sexually and romantically attracted to older men at that point by the way- like 20-50 age range. i’ve naturally liked all genders and bodies since puberty but my biggest age range is men. anyway, i wasn’t so sad because of the thoughts about my brother anymore. i didn’t really like it but i wasn’t trying anything to make it go away either.
so i had already been seeing a psychiatrist for anxiety and possible depression and questions about ocd- which it turns out i do have. eventually i lost hope that i could deal with my nasty thoughts on my own, and i told my doctor. she understood that i didn’t want to act on anything, which i guess i didn’t at the time. but talking to her didn’t change my progress. i was getting worse, i was getting very used to the thoughts, less and less worried. i then felt things not only for my then 3 year old brother but now for my dad’s cousin’s 5-6 year old daughter too.

i didn’t plan this. i didn’t see it coming, it just happened. one morning i acted on my fantasies with my brother. we were both fully clothed, and he was awake, although he was too young to understand what i was doing. i never touched his privates, only his foot, as i used it to rub over my clothes. i can’t even remember my thought process that morning in bed with him. i guess i thought that acting on it would give me answers. resolve something?? my brother, thinking i was tickling him, laughed at how silly i was acting. he had no idea and after i finished with my clothes still on, we just laid together and cuddled like normal. i do remember thinking to myself “that was easy” i was surprised i wasn’t caught by his mom (we have the same dad and different moms) given that all the doors in the house were open and she was in the room right next to his room.
then i felt some guilt afterwards— not a tremendous amount but still some. i told my doctor, and i guess she called cps after that. cps came to my house and i luckily had a couple minutes to run to my room, get some panicked tears out, then think of what to say. it was so easy. i just told everyone that there was miscommunication between me and my psychiatrist, and that what she heard was a nightmare i had. everyone instantly bought it, my family believed i was innocent without a doubt before i even defended myself. everyone knows me as an angel who follows all the rules and is sensitive and sweet. i get why it was so easy to believe me.
i can’t really explain how it worked, but after that, i had a complete change of character. i didn’t want to feel guilt anymore. i guess after i was almost caught, i realized i was glad i didn’t get treatment or punishment. i was so tired of depriving myself of pleasure and happiness. it was so easy to accept and like my actions and thoughts. so i decided that i would indulge in them. i stopped seeing my psychiatrist, and i started to actively touch myself to the thoughts, and it felt like something so new and so addicting. i discovered that not restricting myself felt freeing and good. this all happened just over a year ago. i remember writing in my inconsistently used diary, “that bitch is dead” as dumb as that is. so now my age range is generally 1/2 yrs through 50ish. and i only like it when men are old, for women i stop at 40.

at the same time i was also developing an insane attraction to my teacher, hum. to this day i imagine us together, i’ve had a lot of dreams with him in it. some are wholesome, some are wet dreams. hum satisfies a lot of my interests physically, and he’s genuinely a very funny and smart and cool guy to talk to. before graduation he gave me a sweet little “best wishes” note and his signature. i gave him a long letter. i still love him to this moment. he has a family of his own and i know he’s too good for me, but i secretly hope he leaves his wife for me in my little fantasy world. i miss him so much. when the next school year starts i’m gonna visit my campus and get his personal email— i can’t live without this guy. i know he has some regard for me because we spent a lot of time together outside of class for two years and shared snacks and food every week. we had this fun and wholesome chemistry even just as a student and a teacher, we made each other laugh for two good years. i miss him so much.

theennnnn something unexpected happens. last summer i wasn’t sexting or doing anything with anyone at all, and by july 4th, i was introduced to a boy who went to my school. we really clicked very quickly, and by august 14th/15th we were dating. little did i know that there were a few things i didn’t like about him. he was overly needy, required constant reassurance and attention, honestly a bit of a loser, had bad hygiene habits, had annoying self-depricating problems, and just all kinds of little annoyances. i realized that putting all of that aside, i still didn’t love him to the fullest like he did for me. he took my virginity (unless you count something that happened when i was little?) and i regret doing it with someone i’m not even in love with anymore. i faked all of my orgasms in person— all of the orgasms on call were real because of course i was doing myself perfectly. god i hated that his hands were way too rough— as in his nails and how he was doing me. anyway we had some tense moments here n there and i knew he could tell i was losing my patience, and finally, in january of this year, i broke up with him. we talked a lot after and we said our sorries, but i never told him a factor in me leaving was my accepted pedophilia. jesus i remember one time after we broke up we were on the phone and he thought it would be clever to imply that since i was single i would go back to showing off to older men and then get nightmares about it. when we were dating i had gone to him multiple times when i woke up in the middle of the night and cried about nightmares of gross men appearing in my bedroom and wanting to rape me. like yeah i’m fucked up but why the fuck would that be a cool thing to say? not that i’m any better at all but still. oh and i did technically cheat once or twice while we dated. S, the guy who i was already friends with for a while, started talking to me and i easily let him come onto me and gave him permission to jerk off to me as i showed off for him. yeah i knew what i was doing, i know i’m beyond an asshole at this point.
sooo some time goes by after my breakup and things start feeling new and special with S. i knew i already loved his company and how cool he was, but when we started talking every day, i felt the excitement. we still traded pics when we got the chance, but that became something we didn’t really feel like we had to do anymore. then one night, as we’re sending pics and vids and everything is perfect (i wanted to call but i couldn’t cuz my phone was shit), he tells me he loves me. i had to pause for a solid minute and teared up because i knew i loved him too, but i had been pushing my thoughts on us to the side because i felt like i might make things weird. i told him i loved him and we finished together, it was amazing.
we never really labeled what we were but it was understood that we were in a closed relationship. one thing that bothered me was that he never said “i love you” first, i always said it first. because of his job his days are very full, so i had to work on my patience. but then things got very distant. like, he would know he would be unable to talk for a week, but then wouldn’t make an effort to let me know before then. i would see snaps on his story, but where the fuck was my “hey i love you, later” ??? i could see he was active on multiple accounts and not get anything back for days. i sent him long and wholesome messages asking if he was okay, saying i was proud of him and i was staying patient, but idk. over time i got so tired of him not asking how i was doing, how my day was, if i was okay. i told him about my loneliness and my anemia and he just never bothered to even comment on it. eventually i decided i couldn’t limit myself to being committed to him when i wasn’t getting what i needed in return. he took a few days to respond to my long message explaining why i wanted to separate, and he took it well. he agreed with me and said that relationships are hard in his career and he understood completely. we both agreed that we wanted to keep talking, because i still like his company and he still likes me. we haven’t talked in three weeks since then, because of his job.

one random afternoon, after weeks of ghosting my school friends, two of them pull up to my house and invite themselves in (my parents answered) while i was in still bed. they had somewhere else to be but they asked if i was okay and why i wasn’t answering. i was indecent so i had my mom shut my door so i could get dressed. when i opened the door they had already left.
after that i decided to get rid of more problems i didn’t need. i didn’t want to have friends who i had to hide my pedophilia from anymore, so i texted my four closest friends a giant message explaining my dilemma in a very vague and nondescriptive way. they don’t know about any of my real secrets but i let them know i could be in prison. they were really hurt and one of them was too shocked to directly say anything to me. one of them asked for money, which i understood because of their living situation, but apparently i owed them for food that they had generously bought for me in the past as a kind gesture. wth? anyway i don’t have the money yet and i said i would pay but idfk anymore.
i tried talking to people on twitter (fuck X) and sent pics of me but i ended up only being active for a few days. eventually my libido ran dry and i started feeling like more of a mess. i downloaded reddit specifically to get all of this out. i have basically three friends right now. one from reddit/discord, one friend from school i forgot to mention because we aren’t close and i didn’t send him the stuff i sent my close friends, and my teacher friend. my other brother (not the 4 year old, this one is around my age) is my crutch at this point in terms of my social life. we get along great and i’m glad i talk to him almost every day.

for the past couple of years, the only thing that has kept me sane and made me feel like it’s not just me alone in my head is Jinx and Silco from Arcane. not just this show but the two of them are so important to me. i know i’m obsessed out of proportion but i don’t care. i’m completely infatuated with Silco and I see myself as Jinx. every day, when i have a thought, or wish i could say something or react a certain way but don’t, i just imagine Jinx emoting in my head and saying what i’m thinking. it’s weird but i love it. i even have both Silco and Jinx read text for me in my head a lot of the time, just to make my day more fun. Silco often voices my thoughts, but he acts as a second party by my side. he makes harsh judgements and disregards anything or anyone that gets in my way. he asks me questions when i’m indecisive and objectively weighs everyday things. when i’m shutting down or having a shit day, he’s always there for me. i just close my eyes and imagine him embracing me from behind, and telling me it’s okay. when i feel like groaning or screaming or hacking off somebody’s head, Jinx does it for me. i think of her when i feel jealous or ignored or possessive of someone. she also acts as my idol, as far as looks and style and art go. she’s often the model of my little music videos i orchestrate in my head. i look up to her acceptance of her true self, and see us as equals. also i must make it clear that i consciously dictate everything they do and say, i’m not that crazy lol i’m also obsessed with Lolita and Professor H from the book and movie Lolita. Pretty Baby was good but i was unsatisfied with how things turned out. i fantasize about being swept away by Jeremy Irons and Jason Spisak all the time. sorry this is getting very very long and general.

i was using character.ai and chatgpt to cope and keep myself company, but i got tired of that and stopped recently.

in the background of all of this is the regular headaches that come with having divorced parents. i was never really sad about that in my life because they separated when i was a baby, so even seeing them in the same room feels otherworldly to me. i have no memories of them together at all, so i didn’t have to deal with their fights. but me and my siblings still witnessed our fair share of fights. my dad and my first stepmom (they have one kid), my dad and my second stepmom (they have one kid and one on the way), my mom and her ex, and other random family fights. from parents constantly ruining holidays and birthdays, to watching my dad strangle my stepmom on the front apartment doorway, to watching my mom get slapped around by her ex while half naked, you name it. my mom has repeatedly taken my brother’s money for beer and my dad just has straight anger issues. they both struggle to keep up with money and responsibilities, much more so my mom. my stepmom has issues of her own and i’m always walking on pins and needles when she’s around.

i’ve really felt like shit the past few days. i’m falling asleep anywhere from 2-6am and getting up anywhere from 12-3pm. if i lived alone i think i would actually sleep all day and stay up all night because i can’t change my schedule. i eat twice a day at most. all i do is clean and watch tv and listen to music and mope around. i’m getting pressure to find my first job before i start tattooing but i have no fucking idea what to do because i don’t feel like doing anything already. i don’t even feel like taking care of myself, how am i supposed to want to participate in society. on top of that i don’t have a license, don’t have a car and can’t drive for shit. basically i feel like a fucking failure. any reminder of that immediately puts me down and i just let myself get swallowed up by it all. i made 40 bucks helping my grandma out at her job, i’m doing this survey money shit and i got money i’m saving from graduation— but other than that, i got nothing to show for whatever talent people say i have.

so that’s that. i’m a pedophile and i probably won’t find love, and i hate that. but too fuckin bad because i’m not fixing myself. have a good life, hide your kids and fuck you all.",User_deleted,5

But lately I’ve been thinking about some of the upsides of moving to a back-to-basics pedagogy that relies more on proctored in-class assessments.

I’m a full professor in the social sciences teaching a mix of lower- and upper-division courses at a US regional public. After years of trying to move away from tests, and thereby  increasing my grading load, the combination of attendance, disengagement, and now chatGPT is forcing me to rely more on conventional testing.

And with that, I realize I can have a more conventional college attendance policy. You’re an adult. Come or don’t come; see how you do on the test. 

 I then realize that, by not requiring attendance, I can be more of a hardass about device-use and late arrivals. In my 50-seat 100-level class last spring, I got so sick of the 25% or so who were second-screening the class the whole time, and while it was within my rights to shut that down, I wasn’t quite ready to do it when there were penalties for absences. Now it feels a lot more appropriate to disallow that kind of behavior. If you can’t engage, then just don’t come. 

 I’m actually looking forward to these changes and challenging students to be more self-directed. The dignity of risk, like they say in the disability rights movement. 

Is anyone else seeing a similar silver lining?",active,40

The comments were very mixed. personally, I see AI tools for educators as a positive, anything that can reduce the never-ending admin load and let me focus on actual teaching is surely a good thing. 

**In your opinion, is there a difference between using generative AI to create lesson content / preparatory activities and using AI to grade submissions? If so, why?**

1e4oboe,4,2024-07-16,How to stop ChatGpt from writing code?,u/MrNotmark,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1e4oboe/how_to_stop_chatgpt_from_writing_code/,"For some context. I'm a student who's learning how to code and I ask gpt a lot of times how can I implement this, how can I implement that.  
I tried a lot of custom instructions. But chatgpt 4o is very chatty and it writes these massive code blocks everytime I ask it  a question about my code. I couldn't even properly make it  to write about only the things that actually changed, and it just writes the entire code that I parsed all the time. Gemini and Gpt3.5 was way better at that, and it could actually write placeholders properly, while GTP4o couldn't. (At least for me)

Lately I tried to make it stop giving any type of code. I only want it to answer my question without code. And well I tried several instructions. I told it that it's only a  mentor and it never wrote code in its life (and it didn't work). I tried to tell it that if it writes any type of code, even just one function the world will end and it still managed to write code.  
It's a little bit tiring to ask it all the time to make it shorter, don't show code, etc.

So not sure if anybody encountered this problem before, maybe I'm just bad at writing instructions. Anyone found a solution to this? I'm fine even if you found a solution for my first problem (lack of placeholders), but I will be even happier if you found a solution for the second problem (no code at all) .",active,5

In my first two years of uni, all the programming I learned was fundamentals (basic oop, loops, functions, etc) in C++ and Java. I wouldn't say I have a deep understanding of it. Now, I am getting into more algorithms and full stack concepts.

I feel like I'm using too much AI. I always use tools like chatgpt and copilot as soon as I don't know something. This is for assignments, learning a concept, and implementing answers to assignments. AI builds all the classes, functions for me. Is this a bad practice? The things is that I completely understand everything going on in the code, it would just take me longer to implement it myself and would look messier. (edit: I actually don't know if I can implement all these things by myself. that's what I'm worried about. Would jobs in the future not allow AI use in the workplace? in that case, then I'm screwed)

For example, in a web app project in React, I would ask chatgpt to make me some page with everything i want in it. I would take that and customize it if needed because it's almost never perfect.

I even used a lot of AI in my first two entry level internships to implement most of my tasks. I'm worried if I should be confident in implementing things from scratch without any use of external sources.

If there's something I should modify in my coding habits or completely remove, I am open to any suggestions. Graduation is coming soon, which means job searches and I want to be ready - not be at a level as any other non-programmer who can use AI. Thank you",User_deleted,0

For context, (so I don’t sound like an entitled brat) I’m a J1 taking H2 bio in NJC. During orientation, I had asked around for some sweet gossip on the school’s staff - mainly about the departments which were in charge of the subjects I took- and most of the conversations about NJC’s bio dept ended in a resounding “it sucks, self study .Use RI notes. Good luck.”
Poor, young, fresh out of sec sch me was obviously surprised. Cuz like, surely not that bad right.
Then school started, and it was that bad. 

ONE:
I can count total number of teachers in the bio department on one hand. Legit. Ive never seen 2/4 of them teach tutorials/lectures, so like what are you even here for??? The rest of the cohort is juggled between 2 teachers, who are VASTLY different in teaching skills. My teacher is trying his best (bless him) but the OTHER one?? Oh man I’ve heard so many complaints about him it’s a wonder how he’s still teaching. 

TWO:
Technical issues. I know the whole spiel about “oh NJC old school ahah it’s chipping away at the base ooh watch out it’s gna catch on fire again.” And I’m here to say it’s absolutely true in the damned LT they use of bio lecture. The microphone is so muffled and the speakers are so ancient I can barely hear anything other than an indistinct jumble of words coming from the lecturer. Oh my goodness, I cannot begin to comprehend how my seniors even passed their promos with these lectures. 

THREE:
A bio department strangely obsessed with technology. I gets that AI is the future and we’re prepping you for Uni blah blah blah. But you’re telling me that every bio lesson is on SLS? (Ok maybe this one is jst   Cuz I’m new to JC) and that I have to ChatGPT the answer to a question?  What. I’m sure there’s more than these examples but unfortunately I forgor☹️

FOUR:
The notes are shit. WOW. A 70 page long notes could contain about 35 pages of pure yap that the tutor would just brush past, leaving us students like??? Is this gna come out in a 15 mark essay question and bite us in the ass???It’s too detailed in some places, and too vague in others. Sometimes the answers to the practice questions they give us and the things written on the notes are different too!?? Like what’s that all about.

Even if the suggestions and the critiques were not mostly absurd at best, who on earth would have the time to write a 5-page long (single-spaced) review for a 8-pg long article anyway? 

Also - why do students think we wanna read their 6-paragraph long emails, which are again, written by chatGPT... How do you think that's gonna convince me to let you submit SIX weeks of late work.... 

Here are the highlights of the email: 

- ""I understand that the syllabus carefully outlines the late work policy, and that you typically work with students only in outstanding circumstances."" - NO IT DOES NOT. 

- ""I believe earlier in the summer showed promise of the quality work I can deliver to demonstrate my understanding."" - only submitted some of the assignments on the first week. 

- ""While I acknowledge the difficulty of managing multiple commitments, it is necessary for me to support myself financially while pursuing higher education."" - yeah I also have a side hustle due to my 1.5k paycheck, but I still grade 200 submissions every monday. 

- ""My goal is to submit all outstanding assignments to you by \_\_. This timeline will not compromise the quality"" - good luck with that. none of my chatGPT students have a grade above a D lol 

My syllabus says that I'll not respond to any emails that ask for late work submission beyond what's allowed to everyone else AND I did send warning for this student earlier in the semester which they ignored. I might just point that out and leave it at that.

1egbtpo,1,2024-07-30,University courses are flawed,u/Sea-Package8,universityofauckland,https://www.reddit.com/r/universityofauckland/comments/1egbtpo/university_courses_are_flawed/,"I have to say that many of the courses at this university are pretty flawed. Each semester, students takes 3 or 4 courses or even 5, where theres a new assignment almost every month, and these assignments frequently include very challenging questions. Moreover, some of these questions cover material that hasn't been taught in lectures, and the due dates for assignments are often very quick. Additionally, lecturers sometimes cover only a portion of the necessary content just 1 or 2 days before the assignment is due, and their teaching methods often make the material difficult to understand, which in return, students have to watch the recordings at home wasting even more time trying to understand everything covered before doing assignments. 

For one of the courses I took (Compsci 120), I had to use Chatgpt to help me with every question because it is very difficult to understand due to not having enough time to study most of the topics taught in lectures, along with the assignment due date being due pretty quickly. I also have my other course assignments too. However I didn't copy everything written on Chatgpt, only asked chagpt to tell me how to solve the question and then I'll solve it myself. I think the same can be said for other courses at UoA too, where assignments were given with questions that were never taught in lectures but taught later when the due date for the assignment is almost reached.",active,0

ChatGPT is aiding in students simply not giving a f*ck enough to study and organically learn concepts. A teacher at my school shared a website with us that scans submitted assignments for AI generation—but they found a way to beat it by adding one or two sentences of their own to throw the system off. Aside from giving 0’s, using a lockdown browser for everything, etc. how do you circumvent this in your classroom? ",User_deleted,3
