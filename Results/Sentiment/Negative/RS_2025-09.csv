1n61jtt,0,2025-09-01,SOLUTION? Stop teaching literature in high school,u/Midwest099,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1n61jtt/solution_stop_teaching_literature_in_high_school/,"I teach comp at a CC and the biggest complaint from faculty in every department in every college and university where I've ever worked--students can't write. Why? Here's why:

* In the 70's, grammar schools stopped teaching phonics and moved to whole language. 
* with the focus on standardized testing, primary and secondary instructors stopped teaching grammar; they teach it once in 4th grade and move on.
* with behavioral problems and huge influx of IEPs, primary and secondary instructors, again, don't teach grammar.
* helicopter parenting and glad-handing administrators who bend to parents' wishes in primary and secondary schools get their children excused from doing any writing (or grammar study).
* in high school, instructors are encouraged to teach ""fine literature"" to students who don't give a rat's butt about ""broadening their horizons."" 
* in high school, ""butt in seat equals a D"" which is passing
* our colleges often base admissions on GPA which is heavily inflated in high school--so no guarantee that they have any skills at all
* TikTok, social media, and constant distraction substitutes for any kind of scholarship
* parents don't read to their children and don't encourage them to read, write, or do any homework
* large language model AI has taken over as the ""go to"" for high schoolers who can't write (and weak adm at high schools means they get away with it)

The end result? These high school kids are weak readers and writers--and they get into our community colleges and universities unable to identify a subject or verb. Their writing SUCKS and because colleges answer to the Higher Learning Commission and to our accreditation boards, we're suddenly the ""buck stops here"" folks and end up failing more and more of these traditional age students.

Yes, I refer tons of students to our tutoring center, but I do everything I can to break up each writing assignment into tons of ""stages"" to spoon feed them, but it's a losing game.   
\-----------  
One solution? Get high schools to change their curriculum and STOP TEACHING LITERATURE to students. Instead, teachers should review grammar, get students to write paragraphs and essays, and most importantly, help these students to learn editing and proofreading skills.  
\------------  
It's a drop in the bucket, but I'd rather be teaching traditional age students who have an inkling about how to write rather than be able to tell me why ""Catcher in the Rye"" is important. I have degrees in English, but the only thing I remember from that book is that Holden shouts, ""Sleep tight ya morons"" when he leaves. Valuable? Not as valuable as someone being able to write a sentence.",User_deleted,0
1n687sp,1,2025-09-01,Repeatedly failing calc 1 is sending me into a spiral,u/mouse_________,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1n687sp/repeatedly_failing_calc_1_is_sending_me_into_a/,"Hey, i really need advice to determine what is the best course of action right now. Please do not yeall at me in the comments i already know i shouldn't have done it. (This became a vent of sort)

I'm currently a student studying CS. As expected there were a ton of math courses which are not my forte and i have struggled with it since highschool. I had to repeat a year since i failed a ton of classes from my first year (which did include calc 1). This was ny 2nd time taking calc along with some other classes i failed in the summer semester. I managed to pass every mandatory class except calc 1 so, in the last session, i opted out for cheating. 

I'm aware this is not how it's done and i shouldn't have done it but i think i got caught. I recived the results as 0 points although no disciplinary action announced yet. The did not caught me in the act obviously but the solutions probably seemed sus since i did use chatgpt/deepseek on the practical problems part which is 50% of the exam. The review is tommorow and i haven't recieved results from the theoretical yet so i don't know if i should try to fight it in the review session at all.

The reason i'm writing this here is because this has caused me severe emotional distress as well as financial burden for my parents. I've struggled with anxiety for many years and have not gotten therapy due to taboo topics being not accepted where i live so i did not want to further ask for money from my parents for ""money that you could spend on fun actvities with friends and food"". I'm shaky as i'm writing this but i do want to acknowledge that my parents have been very giving and i have been spoiled with my semestar and rent being paid by them while i'm a different city that has high expenses and i do value my education since i'm first in the family to pursue university so the pressure is real and i can't help but feel incompetent. I couldn't land internships in the field either but i do want to work.There are other areas in my life that i'm also struggling socially so it's def an ego hit since i got a ton of validation from passing exams as in ""i'm progressing as an adult"" 

It's defenetly a lot of mental stress piling up as well as pressure but i genuinly think i'm too dumb for this course i just could not do limits or integrals for the life of me. I also had a very delayed reaction from the time i recieved the results i felt fine like ok im failing again but i woke up just now because of another exam i have in couple hours and went straight into a panic attack for nothing. I don't even know if i should go to todays exam at all (its an elective). What is the best course of action here, am i cooked (how severly)",User_deleted,1
1n6c5y9,41,2025-09-02,I tried all the popular AI lesson planning tools so you don't have to,u/DMsWideOpen69,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1n6c5y9/i_tried_all_the_popular_ai_lesson_planning_tools/,"okay so I've been that teacher frantically googling ""AI lesson planning tools"" at 11pm on Sunday nights for the past year. burned out 5th grade teacher here, 60% ELL classroom, and I was literally drowning in differentiation requirements while trying to maintain some semblance of work-life balance (spoiler: there wasn't any).

The Problem

Let me paint you a picture .. I was spending roughly 8 hours every weekend on lesson plans. Not teaching. Not grading. Just... planning. My district requires differentiated materials for 3 reading levels, ELL accommodations, and everything aligned to state standards. By Sunday night I'd have bloodshot eyes from staring at my laptop, creating multiple versions of the same worksheet.

My AI Tool Graveyard

I tried EVERYTHING:

-ChatGPT (fast but pedagogically questionable…. gave me a lesson on photosynthesis that completely ignored misconceptions kids have)

-MagicSchool (feature overload, still had to rebuild most things)

-Eduaide (better but felt like it was just remixing the same templates)

-Diffit (good for reading levels but thats about it)

-Various others that shall not be named because they were genuinely terrible

Most of these tools are what I call ""Wikipedia summarizers"" .. they can regurgitate information but have zero understanding of how kids actually learn. Like, none of them caught that teaching fractions before establishing number sense is a recipe for disaster.

Enter TeachShare

I was very very skeptical when I found TeachShare because their whole pitch is ""tiered instruction"" and I'm like yeah sure, everyone says that. But I found this through a Leslie Fisher webinar, so I figure it was worth giving it a shot.

The first thing that caught my attention…. it asked me about my specific classroom demographics. Not just grade level, but:

-How many ELL students

-Reading level distribution

-Cultural backgrounds

-Previous units covered

Already different from the ""one-size-fits-all"" approach I'd seen everywhere else.

The Game Changer

Here's what actually shocked me … I gave it my standard test: ""Create a lesson on the water cycle for 5th graders with mixed reading abilities and 40% Spanish-speaking ELLs""

Not only did it generate differentiated materials, but it:

-Included cognates for Spanish speakers (evaporación/evaporation)

-Flagged common misconceptions (like thinking clouds are made of water vapor)

-Suggested formative assessment checkpoints based on actual research

-Created materials that scaffolded FROM my students' prior knowledge

I literally sat there staring at my screen because it incorporated things from Marzano's research that I learned in my masters program. Like... an AI that actually knows instructional design theory?

Real Numbers

My Sunday planning sessions went from 8 hours to about 90 minutes. But here's the thing .. the quality is BETTER. My admin actually complimented my differentiation strategies last observation, and my ELL students are more engaged because the materials actually speak to them.

The Multilingual Magic

This deserves its own section because holy shit. It doesn't just translate…. it adapts culturally. When I create a math word problem, it adjusts contexts for different cultural backgrounds. Instead of ""Johnny has 10 apples,"" it might use ""Maria visits the mercado"" for my Spanish-speaking students, with vocabulary that bridges both languages.
Being honest here:

-Sometimes I still need to tweak things (about 20% of the time)

-I have lost my design once or twice

-Sometimes has overlapping content

The Verdict

Look, I'm not saying AI will replace good teaching. It won't. But TeachShare is the first tool I've found that seems to actually understand that teaching is both an art AND a science. It's like having a teaching assistant who actually studied education theory.

Who This Is For

-Teachers drowning in differentiation requirements

-Anyone with multilingual/multicultural classrooms

-People who care about pedagogy, not just speed

-Teachers who want evidence-based practices without reading 50 research papers

Who Should Skip

-If you just need basic worksheets, this might be overkill

-If your district has zero flexibility in lesson formats

-If you're looking for completely hands-off (still requires teacher judgment)

Happy to answer questions or share specific examples. Also created a sample unit if anyone wants to see what the output actually looks like.

And before anyone starts pointing fingers…. no, I'm not affiliated with them. Just a tired teacher who finally found something that works and figured others might be in the same boat. We deserve tools that actually understand education, not just automation.",User_deleted,34

I am a senior at a public high school in New York, and these tools are everywhere. I do not want to use them in the way I see other kids my age using them—I generally choose not to—but they are inescapable.

“During a lesson on the *Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass*, I watched a classmate discreetly shift in their seat, prop their laptop up on a crossed leg, and highlight the entirety of the chapter under discussion. In seconds, they had pulled up ChatGPT and dropped the text into the prompt box, which spat out an AI-generated annotation of the chapter. These annotations are used for discussions; we turn them in to our teacher at the end of class, and many of them are graded as part of our class participation. What was meant to be a reflective, thought-provoking discussion on slavery and human resilience was flattened into copy-paste commentary. In Algebra II, after homework worksheets were passed around, I witnessed a peer use their phone to take a quick snapshot, which they then uploaded to ChatGPT. The AI quickly painted my classmate’s screen with what it asserted to be a step-by-step solution and relevant graphs.

“These incidents were jarring—not just because of the cheating, but because they made me realize how normalized these shortcuts have become. Many homework assignments are due by 11:59 p.m., to be submitted online via Google Classroom. We used to share memes about pounding away at the keyboard at 11:57, anxiously rushing to complete our work on time. These moments were not fun, exactly, but they did draw students together in a shared academic experience. Many of us were propelled by a kind of frantic productivity as we approached midnight, putting the finishing touches on our ideas and work. Now the deadline has been sapped of all meaning. AI has softened the consequences of procrastination and led many students to avoid doing any work at all. As a consequence, these programs have destroyed much of what tied us together as students. There is little intensity anymore. Relatively few students seem to feel that the work is urgent or that they need to sharpen their own mind. We are struggling to receive the lessons of discipline that used to come from having to complete complicated work on a tight deadline, because chatbots promise to complete our tasks in seconds.

“... The trouble with chatbots is not just that they allow students to get away with cheating or that they remove a sense of urgency from academics. The technology has also led students to focus on external results at the expense of internal growth. The dominant worldview seems to be: *Why worry about actually learning anything when you can get an A for outsourcing your thinking to a machine?*”

It's not even close anymore.

My cousin went from barely passing math to scoring 95% in boards. Didn't get a tutor, didn't join coaching. Just started using PhotoMath and ChatGPT consistently for like 6 months. The difference was insane.

Here's what's actually happening. CBSE changed their whole game in 2025. They're not asking you to memorize anymore - they want you to actually understand and apply concepts. Traditional rote learning students are getting wrecked, but AI-savvy kids are thriving because these apps teach you to think, not just remember.

The apps that actually work aren't the flashy expensive ones everyone talks about. Khan Academy is still free and better than most premium coaching. Socratic by Google solves any problem you photograph. Physics Wallah costs less than a pizza but covers everything you need for boards plus competitive exams.

What blew my mind was seeing kids use these tools strategically. They're not cheating or getting lazy answers. They're using AI to identify exactly where they're weak, then drilling those specific areas. It's like having a coach who knows precisely what you need to work on.

The crazy part? These apps are starting to predict exam performance weeks in advance. Some kid in my building said his AI study assistant warned him about chemistry topics he'd struggle with before he even knew it himself. That level of personalized learning was impossible before.

Parents are still skeptical because they think it's ""just using technology to cheat."" But the students using AI properly are actually understanding concepts deeper than traditional methods ever taught them. They're seeing multiple solution methods, getting visual explanations, and building genuine comprehension.

The gap between AI users and non-users is only going to get wider. By the time everyone figures this out, the early adopters will be so far ahead it won't be fair.

If you're still grinding through textbooks the old way while other kids are leveraging AI, you're basically bringing a knife to a gunfight. The game changed, and most people don't even realize it yet.

As per the title, I'm not sure how I passed. For context: I'm a Canadian med student and gave myself 2 months to study not realizing how in depth the step 1 exam actually is (and my medical school's teaching did not align with that). If I were to redo it, I would give myself a lot more time.

My resources: Sketchy Micro + Anking for micro, Bootcamp, ChatGPT, Pathoma (Chapters 1-3). Bought FA (didn't use it), did \~300 uworld questions because I didn't have time, did 1.5 NBMEs (again because I didn't have time, but scored around 60%).

My focus became purely to try and understand the material as much as I could (ChatGPT helped a lot). I did not have a pre-dedicated period of studying. But for 2 months, I studied 8-10 hours per day, somedays even 12 hours. I went into the exam fully expecting to fail but with the mindset to try my best, which is probably why I didn't panic (and to be fair, I currently have no plans of moving to the US, I wrote the exam just to write it and have it in my back pocket if I ever need it).

I really would not recommend this strategy (stress levels were high), but what I will say (and some might resonate with this, others won't, which is totally okay - everyone is different), I felt that having a stronger understanding of the material was more important for me than doing questions with the limited time that I had.

I don't have much advice other than: 1. don't do what I did, 2. really try to understand the content first, and 3. do questions!! I wish I did more.

I'm currently still in highschool, grade 12 from 13 (germany has often 13 years of school), and I'm just sick of everything. I'm aware, that because of my age these feelings could come, teenage angst and so on. 

But everywhere I go I see overconsumption, every day I step into school I see kids doing TikTok dances, the people out of my classes talking about social media drama and so on. They film in drama class, thank god not me since they don't care about me, but some people I like and make fun of it.   
At the train station, I see people filming themselves, not caring if others are in the picture. I probably was in so many videos and pictures without me noticing, my only comfort is, is that it's unlikely people will recognize me from these posts. 

People expect me to be lots on social media, I heard more and more that sentences like ''Since you all have instagram'', ''You probably have all Instagram..'' from teachers, People who collect donations, a university president, and politicians. It's just annoying at this point, I know, I'm an expections with not being on Instagram, but I'm just sick of it. 

It's all an algorithm designed to keep us hooked. YouTube, Netflix, and even Spotify. I started buying DVDs and using an MP3 player (which unfortunately broke recently) to feel like I was in control, which works.

In school we work Ipads and smartboards, in like every class. There isn't a way around it, since the worksheets are all online. The only exception would be my math class, where we have a book.   
Then lets not forget these sites over which schools can contact students and upload work sheets.

And oh god let's not forget about ChatGPT. I see my classmates use it all the time and not being able to think on their own or come up with ideas on their own. They use it for the most easiest task and then complain that they failed an test (NO SHIT IF YOU USE CHATGPT FOR EVERY ASSIGMENT AND DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION)  
I don't even begin by the teachers who use AI to detect AI, the day were I get a 0 because someone thought I wrote an essay or assignment with AI I'm dropping out of highschool (or go to my tutor and complain about it lmao)

With everything I do I give someone my data. I wear a fitness tracker on daily basis because of health issues, I have my phone always with me when I'm out in case something happens.   
But like, it's no secret that the phones pretty much listen to us and track our every movement. It's just scary to me, I don't feel like I have any privacy left.

1nh9ps8,0,2025-09-14,For students applying now: what’s the single biggest pain point in researching and applying?,u/Capt_Levi900,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/1nh9ps8/for_students_applying_now_whats_the_single/,"Hey Folks,

I was recently helping my younger brother research universities, and honestly it feels like the process hasn’t evolved at all since I went through it 7 years ago. Back then I even hired a consultant because I wanted to explore options abroad and had no context. I figured with tools like ChatGPT things would be better today, but it’s still chaos.

He has tabs open for rankings, school websites, scholarship lists, Reddit threads, tuition calculators… and nothing lines up. At one point he had dozens of programs bookmarked but still didn’t know how to compare them. He also almost missed a deadline because there’s no single place that keeps it all straight.

**The Problem:** Current tools are either static (like QS rankings), generic (like ChatGPT even when you explain everything), or purely organizational (like spreadsheets). None of them actually understand the student, explain tradeoffs, or guide you step by step. That’s why so many still rely on counselors, who often don’t have enough personalized time for each student unless you’re paying top-tier fees.

**The Solution (concept):** I was thinking of something that works more like a personal guide. It would learn about you, your goals, and your priorities. It could compare programs, tuition, and scholarships side by side, build a personalized roadmap that adapts as your situation changes, send deadline alerts, and help you understand why one option might fit better than another. It wouldn’t just stop at academics either. If factors like permanent immigration, city life, job prospects, or lifestyle are important to you, those would be built into the recommendations as well. One place to track everything, ask questions, and stay on top of progress.

**My Questions for You:**

* What do you currently use to keep track of everything?
* What feels like the single biggest pain point?
* Would a more personalized guide actually help, or do most students prefer relying on counselors?
* If you could add one killer feature to make this worth using, what would it be?

Would love your honest take. Does a more personalized solution feel valuable, or is it just adding one more layer to an already crowded space?

I had been hoping for full-time, and honestly, I had a bad feeling about the place. It was a rough school but I took what I could get. Because it was such a last-minute hire, I was told my contract would be delayed.

After two weeks of teaching, I was called into the principal's office. I assumed it was finally to sign my contract, but instead I was told, “You’re doing great, the students and staff like you… oh, and by the way, today is your last day.”

No explanation. Just a handshake and a “good luck.”

Later I found out that the teacher I was “replacing” had a back injury and had applied for long-term disability, which ended up being denied that very same day. Since I never signed a contract (lesson learned), I had no recourse.

Just over a week later, I got a call from another school I had applied to. They were suddenly in urgent need of a full-time teacher in my exact specialization (the position opened when a teacher unfortunately became very ill and did qualify for long-term disability). This happened to be my dream school—the one I had attended as a student. Since I was available, I took it.

Fast forward 30 years, almost to the day of my first “last day” at school #1. I can honestly say that getting fired was the best thing that ever happened to me. If I had been locked into a contract there, I don’t think my career would have been anywhere near as rewarding as it has been.

I felt inspired to share this (for the first time online) after reading other posts from teachers who were recently and suddenly let go. If that’s you, my message is this: as hard as it feels, accept it and dive in. Consider yourself lucky—you don’t want to teach at a school that treats its teachers like that. There are great schools out there.

So many arguments against ai art could be used against ai music, yet… there is one artist that I used to really admire who was anti-AI who literally made some AI music and went “hey y’all this sounds so good.” What do you mean? I thought you were anti AI, I thought AI was “disgusting” and “shouldn’t exist?” What the fuck is this?

I am not anti AI, but I’m not pro either. I think ppl should be able to use AI if they want but I don’t.

Also, for homework, the whole point is to test what students can do. Homework is not given to test the capabilities of AI. Homework is also good consolidation work — consolidation for YOU, not AI. And for school projects, this is supposed to be YOUR grade, not AI’s. And especially for essay writing, AI is horrible. There is so much criteria that your teachers will have told you that ai doesn’t know. Sure, you can tell the ai the criteria, but it still wouldn’t be YOUR WORK.

I have a gen ed course full of first year students, many of who have no idea what to do when they can't AI their way through an assignment. Some simply don't submit it. Some submit an AI assignment that it can do that absolutely is not what was in the prompt and say ""I was confused."" And I also keep getting requests for my PPTs from students who were in class and I've finally figured out that it's becuase they want to upload it to ChatGPT so it can do the ""comparison of course material"" portion of the assignment for them. Given this, I will not provide PPTs anymore at all.

It's ... not fun.

I assigned a video of someone at our university talking about something from a few weeks ago. I asked students to compare it to my lecture and point out specific concepts in it.

In a class of 22, I got: 

1. 3 requests for PPT from students who played games on their computer the whole way through class and thought they could just upload the PPTs to ChatGPT (which they could have if I had sent it to them). One at least pretended like there was a reason (""I want to check it against my notes"".... I promise you this man absolutely did not take notes. He wasn't even hiding that he plays Fortnite every day in class and I have no idea why he comes to class to begin with). 

2. Three students submitted a vague analysis of another thing that ChatGPT can actually addresss (one was a book, one was a TED Talk, one was a YouTube video with a similar name) that VERY losely correlated to to the topic and compared to something that was vaguely close to our classroom material but included terms that I absolutely did not teach them and that I promise they did not know on their own. All claimed confusion and they thought they could compare it to anything (I assure you that the directions were very clear). 

3. Several more ignored the prompt since AI couldn't do it and did their own version of the assignment and submitted an answer provided by ChatGPT with vague (incorrect) guesses about the lecture and/or video and/or just one or the other. Some of these were a mix of their own writing and ChatGPT, and in some cases, the font was even different, making it easy to see where they added it.

For heavens sake, have they ever considered just doing the assignment? Some of them aren't even trying to hide it anymore. ",active,393

i have tried pomodoro for a few days, i studied and watched instagram for five minutes which turned into half an hour or an hour, so i restricted it to just 30 minutes, to get a reward, i watched youtube or news, and got hooked on them too, no because tell me why do i know that the first Asian American addition to white house was done by melania trump or why Mormons are the richest church on this planet, because i researched on them for like 2 hours individually as a coping method because of some news or documentary title, :/, im writing and asking here as a coping method too

i got economics, geography and english language. my mind stops and internally implodes whenever it sees a graph or any sort of equation, and unbeknownst to me, economics is filled with graphs of all kinds in micro and macro & equations like PED, XED and bleh, i learnt thru jacob clifford, khan academy and many more but still, it wont fit in my mind, i repulse and throw it out of my mind.

i got claude as my mentor and it went well but i got lost in translation and maybe it was too much, i had this schedule made where i was supposed to do flashcards and start unit 2 day before but i got distracted with france makes old color pencils still in the same ancient way and hardly wrote any cards, yesterday i was supposed to do unit 2 in depth but i didnt do shit and got hooked on a new series (i cant help it), and today is unit 3 day, tomorrow is supposed to be unit 4 day which requires unit 2, 3 as like a prerequisite, but i still havent started unit 2 let alone unit 3, i just dont want to look at them at all

Also, yes, I know I am talking about the Business school and that it's not the best example of ""academia"", but please take this seriously. 

I am studying a BCom (in economics) and a conjoint. I love economics and love the challenging side of this degree. However, Business classes are quite possibly the worst courses I've had to take at this uni. 

There is such a large amount of AI slop being used in this class. Last week, I had a 2-hour lecture where my ""teachers"" played AI videos of a robot telling us what our next task was. As well as the teachers encouraging us to think of AI as a companion (more than an Alexa). Encouraging us to think about whether our grandparents who live alone would want a literal robot to talk to, and consider factors like how much they would pay for it, where they would buy it from, etc.

Because of the stupid lecture almost entirely taught to me by an AI, accompanied by horrific photos also generated by an AI that is unable to spell correctly and can't generate a concise background, I have compiled an email to send to the course coordinator.  

\*It becomes increasingly more and more difficult to defend the bad reputation that Business and commerce students get. I want my degree to have value and be worthwhile, yet every time I go to a lecture, there is a growing use of AI, to the point where I am considering not attending going forward. 

This week, we had a robot tell us what our next task was. Four different videos of an AI saying, ""Your next task will..."" or ""Now we will do...""

I don't understand what part of this couldn't be said to us directly. We have two teachers who are totally capable of reading off the same slides to tell us what we need to do next. 

This is ignoring the absolutely useless photos generated that add nothing at all to the lecture slides or the pre-workshop tasks. 

On top of this, for a university that is so keen on its image and use of the SDG goals, AI violates multiple of them! It is widely known that water pollution results from using sites such as ChatGPT, as well as the global effects it has on climate change and direct addition to rising sea levels and global warming. 

It is less well-known that there are geographical issues with using AI. We are lucky in New Zealand not to have so many of the issues of those in the Global South. People are losing access to water due to the pumping of water into AI warehouses. Generating one email with 100 words uses litres of perfectly clean drinking water, just for my teachers to have 5 more minutes to themselves. 

The university has a responsibility not only to us students, but also to those who are affected because our teachers are too lazy to write the lecture slides themselves. 

My teachers have an obligation to provide me with a worthwhile education. You are required to give me what I pay for. I do not pay to be taught by a robot; I do not pay months' worth of my paycheck to go to a class that is taught to me through gross slides with photos generated by AI that are unable to spell or generate words correctly. 

This is the only course in my 2 years here that has done this. That is 18 classes, and yet Business 112 is the first to teach me using a robot. Business 112 is a core class every commerce student has to take. It is not fair to subject thousands of students to 12 weeks of AI slop that stole all their information from people who spend decades of their life actually studying Business, plus years more to write the books and chapters the AI steals from. 

I should not be told to use AI on any assignments. I should not be told to use AI to come up with a prototype. I should not be encouraged to use AI in a university-level course where innovation and thinking for yourself are key components. 

My teachers tried to justify the videos by stating, ""Sorry for the monotone voice"". That could so easily be avoided by just one of the lecturers reading the same script given to the AI. 

This is also not the first time that AI has been used in this course. Since week 1, horrible AI photos have been added to the slides, with no purpose, costing litres of water that could go to literally anything else. Some weeks, our pre-workshop videos are presented to us by an AI voice with poorly animated slides also done by AI. 

This is not adequate for what ""The highest ranked university in New Zealand"" should be giving us. The students at this University do not deserve to have to put up with this slop to gain their degree.\*

  


And then I continue with Goodbyes, and that I'm ""eager to hear their opinion""  
Anyway, I have complained to both class reps and in the ed discussion, only to receive others complaining about AI use too, and zero response from class reps.

Am I being too harsh? I have not yet sent the email and won't until I get some feedback. Also, if you are in this course, DM me if you wanna complain with me. One student complaining is annoying, but a few of us might actually get a response back.

not to mention the CHATGPT PROBLEM. OHHHH my god you would expect actual creative people under school of arts and social science. even those 5 mins thinking questions lecturers throw at you to keep the class going, most of them turn their laptops to me and all i see is the question typed into chatgpt with a bunch of answers. this also happened in a FILMS CLASS. what do you mean we're following a ai-generated script??????? i had to do a film analysis in a media studies class and NO ONE IN MY GROUP WATCHED THE MOVIE AND RELIED ON CHATGPT FOR ANSWERS.  PLEASE. WHAT HAPPENED TO USING OUR BRAINS AND BEING ACTUALLY CREATIVE?????  i don't know what to do anymore. this problem seems inevitable and is a constant complaint of mine whenever people ask me about how's it like studying in monash. with the money we pay you would've taught we would have top-tier education and experience.

Total fail. They’re faster than me and honestly I was spending more time playing detective than teaching.

Last week I thought, screw it — let’s try flipping it. Instead of banning it, I told them: use ChatGPT, but as a rehearsal partner. We’d just done a lesson on AI bias, so I said: “Explain it until the AI believes you. Connect it to something else we studied. And add your own take.”

Cue 25 kids with phones in hand. Ten minutes in (I am being generous), attention gone. Chaos creeping in. I thought: “Okay, this was dumb.”

But next day… surprise. The debrief was 🔥. Even my usual zombies had opinions. I was like… wait, what?

Now I can’t stop thinking: maybe the trick isn’t fighting the tool, it’s reshaping the homework. So I thought about the following cycle:

1. Teach new stuff in class.
2. At home, kids talk to AI (voice, not typing), until they can explain + connect + add personality.
3. Back in class, we use their struggles/mistakes as fuel for discussion.

AI at home, humans in class. Simple.

Not sure if this is genius or just me overhyping one lucky lesson. So I’m throwing it to you:

Is this worth exploring or just wishful thinking?

What would make it actually useful in your subject?

1nplxp6,1,2025-09-24,Bad Internship Experience,u/Chance-Window4978,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1nplxp6/bad_internship_experience/,"I want to share a **typical red-flag bullying experience.** This is a painful lesson I think everyone should learn before going into an internship.

The story starts with my mentor and manager, **Di He**. Because he was both my mentor *and* my manager, he could fully control my work and threaten me about my final evaluation. His manager (my skip), **Yuan Zhang**, clearly supported his behavior instead of addressing it.

The painful lesson is this: they will always say everything is your fault — even making up facts to shift the blame. If they can’t make something up anymore, they just say *“it’s secret,”* or *“I’ve already been good enough to tell you something,”* or accuse you of *“wasting my precious time.”* I did try to ask for help in the middle of the internship, but his manager supported him, leaving me with no support.

👉 The quick lesson here is: if you sense something is wrong — if your manager seems to know nothing, keeps changing direction, and constantly blames you — **call it out immediately. Escalate higher, even directly to the Student Program.** Otherwise, you might end up with the same horrible and traumatic experience I did.

**Key behaviors I experienced**

# 1. Constant Shifting Blame & Lack of Support

* In one-on-ones, **he always** **framed everything as my fault, with no room for discussion****.**
* He gave no useful suggestions, often promised to “unblock” me but never did.
* He criticized me for using vague words like “somehow” or “I guess” even though our conversations were in Mandarin, not English.
* He frequently dismissed my explanations as “excuses,” saying I was wasting his “precious time.”
* Whenever I asked for details (e.g., review process, bar raiser), he would say “it’s secret” or “your call” to shut me down.

# 2. Contradictions & Manipulative Instructions

* Told me to align only with him, but later criticized me for not talking to others.
* Said I should chat with colleagues in the morning and work at night, even though I was already working long hours, including weekends.
* Criticized me before proposal review for calling the problem “cold start,” then later blamed me for not defining it clearly as “cold start” at midterm.
* **Constantly changed his stance, creating confusion and blaming me for not keeping up.**

# 3. Data & Technical Work Issues

* Expected me to “be precise” in my proposal without giving me any data or context, even though I had been requesting the necessary data for a long time.
* Promised to pull data for me but later admitted he couldn’t, gave me broken code, and told me it was “L5’s duty.”
* Asked me to list all my own actionable items, showing he didn’t actually want to help me and was pushing responsibility back onto me.
* Couldn’t even understand the OOM (out-of-memory) issue caused by the large dataset. Instead of helping, he just asked me *“why does that take you time? It shouldn’t be a problem.”*
* After I pulled the data and solved OOM issues myself, he dismissed my work as having “no novelty.”
* **Told me results didn’t matter and I could** **“just fill in any number” because nobody would check****.**
* **Suggested I use ChatGPT instead of Amazon’s internal tools, putting me at risk of violating policy.**
* Called my models “simple” and claimed he could build them in 30 minutes, yet he didn’t even know how to properly train a model himself. He directly asked me what hyperparameter values I used, rather than how to tune them — showing **he had never actually tuned a model in the team.**
* Repeatedly dismissed my work as “simple,” but he couldn’t even run the existing model to produce baseline results. By the end of my internship, it only seemed that he was finally able to run it.
* Ideally, as the mentor, he should have owned the ranking model, but in reality he had very little knowledge of it. When he had to meet with the original model owner team, he asked me to prepare questions for him so that he could ask them. **He relied on my effort to cover for his lack of understanding.** Then, when he realized my understanding wasn’t fully correct after talking with the model owners, he turned around and blamed me again.
* Could not discuss any technical details. His responses sounded like they were generated by an LLM — very superficial and lacking depth. When I asked to deep dive together, he immediately said *“your call.”* He only used terminology to scare people without actually understanding the content.

# 4. Reviews, Evaluations & Process Manipulation

* Claimed everything about final evaluation, apart from the wiki, was “secret.”
* Because I was nervous about the final evaluation, I asked him in advance about the bar raiser, midterm presentation, and final presentation. He told me he would find a bar raiser he knew and that the presentations were all just 10 minutes, so everything would be under his control and I didn’t need to worry. But obviously, **none of that was true**.
* Refused to say when bar raiser meetings would happen or which leadership principles I needed to improve on.
* **Said at midterm it was “good I at least listened” (even though he gave minimal feedback) — threatening that not listening to him would be “another issue.”**
* Insisted I add irrelevant keywords (like “mixture of experts”) into my work just because it was popular, even though he didn’t seem to know the details. When I tried to question this, he accused me of “not wanting to adopt his feedback.”
* Told me I didn’t need to do anything because he had collected feedback from my providers — but one provider later told me he hadn’t written anything.
* **Said he had given me “everything about the process” at the start and used this to PUA me, even though he constantly changed details.**
* Whenever I reminded him how other interns were treated, he told me I shouldn’t compare with others — which was another form of PUA.

# 5. Workload & Preparation Deadlines

* During the offsite week, I asked if I should wrap things up. He told me I should work more that week, but the following Monday afternoon he immediately changed his stance and told me to prepare a full wrap-up by Tuesday at 3 p.m. — giving me less than 24 hours.
* Claimed I should always have everything prepared already, ignoring the time required for proper organization.
* Criticized me for spending time on embeddings or slide preparation, saying those were “useless” and should not take time.
* **For midterm/final, told me to expect short meetings, then added new requirements at the last minute, and blamed me again for “not preparing in advance.”**
* Whenever I said I needed more time to prepare, he would just respond with “why?” and then immediately follow with “that’s your fault — you should have prepared everything already, nothing should take extra time.”
* **He told me that if I felt anything was infeasible, I should discuss it with him. But whenever I actually tried to discuss feasibility, he dismissed me by saying it was just an “excuse” and ended with “your call.”**

# 6. Professionalism & Behavior in Meetings

* **Publicly apologized once in a group meeting, saying he was busy and would improve. But this was just another excuse — he blamed being “busy” instead of admitting that he was constantly bullying me in every aspect. He said it in public in a way that made me feel awkward, as if everything was my fault and I should just accept it. Nothing actually changed afterward.**
* Often contradicted himself in technical discussions: gave wrong answers about existing models, then blamed me for “not deep diving.”
* Said he only cared about “results” and did not want to discuss approaches, despite being my mentor.
* At times, I doubted whether he put genuine effort into guiding me — his comments often sounded like surface-level terminology without real understanding. Whenever I tried to discuss further, he immediately cut me off by saying “your call, I’ve already spent time on you.”

# 7. Overall Impact

* He repeatedly told me I had “no contribution,” even dismissing my cold-start ASIN model, despite the fact that existing models do not handle ASINs. This directly contradicted the truth, and he often used non-facts to accuse me unfairly.
* I was constantly criticized while he never presented or produced results himself.
* His behavior left me scared, powerless, and unable to be honest in Connect check-ins for fear of retaliation.
* Even when I tried to ask Yuan (his manager) for help, I was told “it’s your fault.” For example, when commenting on my deep dive document, he said he had Googled a picture and claimed it didn’t look like mine. It seemed he didn’t actually know the details and was relying only on Google or LLM outputs, yet he immediately blamed me. This made me feel like his manager simply supported him, and I had no one I could turn to for help.

There was a previous post on this, but they are continuing to use it diabolically. Honestly, this course is an embarrassment to the university.

The so-called “workshops” are a joke. The lecturer just reads directly off slides, then tells us to discuss in our teams. Half the class doesn’t even show up because the content and presentation are so poor.

AI-generated images are used everywhere. It’s not that hard to source royalty free images from Shutterstock, yet they’ve chosen to slap together low effort AI images that can’t even render text properly.

The Makerspace assignment was terrible imo. However, a huge shout out to the Makerspace staff who were so kind, patient, and supportive.

Marking has also been statistically questionable. For our team assessment, the grading felt kinda arbitrary. For instance, our group lost points on referencing format even though our references were exactly in line with APA 7 and the university guidelines.

The use of AI to voice over pre-recorded lectures is terrible. Why can’t someone just read it? We have voices for a reason. I would rather hear a human, not a non-sentient program. It also takes away the personal aspect of learning, since there are no little anecdotes or natural drop-ins, just a cold, monotone voice with a fake hint of emotion.

As bad as that is, I am 99% sure some of the lecture content itself is also being written by AI. Definitely not all of it, since I can tell some parts are real, but there is a huge contrast in certain weeks. Sometimes it feels like I may as well be asking chatgpt to explain the concept, because the poorly stitched-together AI output is not worth my time.

The whole thing feels incredibly disingenuous. How can they expect us to take learning seriously when the course itself is cutting every corner possible?

I really hope they take student feedback seriously before the next semester. We deserve better than this low-quality excuse for a course from a university that prides itself on being top ranked.

Would love to hear if others feel the same.

Do you guys know any step-by-step instructions for this kind of thing? I feel like I’m dumb in a pitiful way, so I need something clear.

They keep pushing me to try, and I don’t mind trying. But my problem is: how? What’s the first step? I can’t seem to find proper instructions anywhere.

I hit 1500 hours on August 31 while I was on vacation, then didn't return to my Spanish studies after I got back until the 20th. I ended up taking almost three weeks off from Spanish, but I was tired from the pace I'd been going at (8+ hours a day), so I needed the break. Some people have said that a break improves your Spanish, but I didn't experience that. If anything, I had to slow videos down to .9x for the first week. In any case, here are my results with various skills after 1500 hours as well as my impressions of this method and what I would do differently.

**Speaking Results:**

I joined Worlds Across on July 1 and completed 114 lessons (41 individual lessons and 73 group lessons), which worked out to around 100 hours of talking. I want to stress that I had taken Spanish a couple of decades ago during college, so it wasn't the first time in my life I'd tried to speak Spanish. Also, I'm a middle aged woman who gives zero fucks, so I don't have any nerves or shyness getting in the way. My progress went something like this:

* Class 1 (individual session) - I could randomly throw out nouns and verbs and >!mucho/muy!< and hold a conversation with someone paid to listen to me. It was not remotely fluid. I struggled a lot. I stubbornly refused to switch to English for practically the entire time. They probably hated their whole life while I fumbled along and they likely deeply questioned their life choices. And I mean... same. But they were very nice and very patient, and I could talk for pretty much the entire hour. But I'm using the word ""talk"" very loosely.
* Class 10 - I was a little better at throwing out random nouns/verbs and trying to figure out a way say things before just nodding and saying ""Si."" I was occasionally even conjugating a verb in the present and past tenses. The person who had been paid to listen to me probably hated their life a little less than my first tutor as they were still forced to hear me badly butcher their beloved native language. In a coaching meeting, I was told that I should be taking Beginner classes, not Super Beginner classes. Oops. I was also reminded that adjectives and adverbs exist and that I should think about using them occasionally. My bad.
* Class 15 - I actually had a conversation that kind of flowed. I still struggled a lot to figure out how to say things and often could not, but I am still shocked. Shocked, I tell you! I also tried to pull out the word >!lugubre!< (which I've seen many times in HP and seems to be similar to >!gloomy!<, but my tutor did not understand and directed me to another word. I'm not sure if my pronunciation was so bad or if she just hadn't heard it before, so I don't know how to feel about that one.)
* Class 30 - Maybe I was just sleeping better, but at this point I finally stopped being so exhausted or distractable at 30 minutes into a lesson. Previously, I'd get very tired and distracted, have trouble paying attention, and my brain would just shut down basically.
* Class 50 - By lesson 50, I was consistently no longer getting distracted at around 30 minutes into a group or individual session, and I could take multiple classes in the same day without getting tired (although two in a row is too much sitting, so I've stopped doing that without a good reason).
* Class 68 - I had a second 1x1 with my very first tutor. Even though I was having a terrible day at remembering anything, she told I'd improved a lot since my first lesson (about five weeks before). So even on a bad day I had still improved a lot. That was nice to hear!
* Class 103 - After this class, I finally had a meeting with my coach who told me to stop taking Beginner classes and move to Intermediate.

I should have moved to Intermediate classes sooner, but I was kind of hiding out in Beginner classes toward the end because it was easy and my days were very long. But I was also frustrated because everything in class was mostly present tense, and I could only practice the other tenses (except for the >!subjuctivo!<) during my 1x1s.

Having said that, I want to be very honest about something: I am 99% of the time translating from English to Spanish in my head when I'm speaking. I'm disappointed, but it is what it is. I'm not sure if that's common or not because I don't remember people stating it in their updates.

**Writing/Grammar:**

I'd intended on not studying grammar during my first 1500 hours since the roadmap is based around not having to do that and I'm lazy (and didn't want to). But I already knew this method wasn't working out for me, meaning I'm unlikely to ever understand grammar just from input. For instance, I didn't pick up verb conjugations with this method, and that's coming from someone who took two years of Spanish in college eons ago. By around week three of eight with Worlds Across (around 1300 hours?), I started to actively study grammar on my own (not with Worlds Across if I can avoid it).  

How did I study? Basically, I started reviewing my tenses one by one and began using ChatGPT to draft practice sets for me each day. I also began to write back and forth with ChatGPT to practice my writing and conversation skills. I have set ChatGPT to always correct everything I write, and it's been extremely helpful. I still make lots of very simple/basic errors, but I'm starting to make less of them. And before someone chimes in to say that ChatGPT sometimes makes mistakes or over corrects and blah blah blah... yes, I'm very aware of all that. 

To be very honest again, I am 99% of the time translating from English to Spanish in my head when I'm writing. Again, I am disappointed.

**General Conclusions about Speaking/Writing/Grammar:**

The one bright spot of finally speaking with tutors is that it's confirmed that I actually really do understand what I hear and that I understand better than I think I do. I've learned that even when I think I haven't really understood something and I guess at it and ask for confirmation, I actually had understood it just fine 90% of the time. I've actually stopped asking unless I really have no idea.

Currently, my biggest frustration with speaking (and writing) is that I have a relatively large passive vocabulary from reading, but I cannot remember most of it when I'm trying to speak (or write). I keep using the same very limited number of verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. In a fit of irritation, I actually spent the last week in August collecting all the words I liked and would want to use in a conversation from the last half of the book I was reading (a middle school level book) and threw them all into a spreadsheet by topic. I'll be reviewing a topic's word list each day, then launching a conversation about that topic with ChatGPT and trying to use the words from my lists. I'm hoping this will help push more of these words from my passive vocabulary into my active vocabulary so that I can access them when I'm having a conversation.

I should also add that reading significantly improved my listening comprehension when I added in that skill. Speaking and writing (and grammar practice) also has improved my listening comprehension, but it wasn't the huge bump that reading was.

**Reading Results and General Conclusions about Reading:**

In my second million words, I finished reading the Harry Potter series, read Sapiens (a non-fiction book intended for adults), then began another series for middle schoolers that turned out to be a bit easier than Harry Potter. I rarely look up words anymore because even if I remember the word I looked up, I'm not going to be using it any time soon. I will look up a word that keeps repeating or expressions. That's about it.

I'm still subvocalizing a bit (reading aloud in Spanish in my head) while reading in Spanish. I do not do this when reading in English. It slows me down and is annoying, but I'm working on breaking the habit while also not stressing about it. It might be helping me somehow. In any case, I was reading Harry Potter at around 128 words/minute at 1 million words. I just timed myself with a random passage from the last HP book and I'm reading around 150 words/minute now after 2 million words. So I've made some small improvement in my reading speed.

My general conclusion is that I think reading is amazing to help your listening and speaking. However, I don't think massive amounts of reading is the best use of my study time at this point. It doesn't do me a lot of good to keep learning and storing words in my passive vocabulary when I need a more solid base in my active vocabulary. I'm still going to be reading, but not at the expense of writing with ChatGPT (and speaking/listening).

**What Is My Current Level in Each Skill After 1500 Hours:**

Writing: I'm guessing I'm firmly intermediate. I haven't started using >!subjuctivo!< yet because I've been focusing on the other tenses/mood. I'm not thinking in Spanish when I write. I'm translating virtually everything from English to Spanish in my head, which isn't good. 

Speaking: After 100 hours of speaking, I'm definitely an intermediate Spanish speaker. I can hold a conversation with someone patient. I make tons of errors and still struggle with the basics, but I can also make vague attempts at all the tenses (sans >!subjuctivo!<). I can understand tutors and get my point across. However, I'm not thinking in Spanish. I'm translating virtually everything I say from English to Spanish, which isn't good. To be high intermediate, I would have to be using >!subjuctivo!< more or less correctly and have tenses and basic errors more buttoned down. As far as the roadmap is concerned, I'm definitely not ""speaking fluently and effortlessly, without thinking about the language."" 

Reading: Popular non-fiction, news stories, and juvenile fiction (like Harry Potter) are 98% comprehensible. That means for each normal 250 - 300 word page, there are usually only around four or five that I don't know (but might be able to understand with context clues). That doesn't mean I always understand every expression. I haven't picked up any fiction intended for adult audiences at this point, but I can catch the gist of most comments on YT videos. I'm not sure what level that would make me, but I'm guessing intermediate.

Listening Comprehension: I thought I'd be better, to be honest. Everyone speaks at a normal pace. While I can follow along and catch the gist of pretty much any YT video, I don't understand 100% and it's not automatic. It's not effortless, but it's not NOT effortless either. I'm sure others can relate. I have a rather blurry understanding of everything I hear. If I'm not paying at least some attention, it just becomes noise instead of words. When I am paying attention, I can sometimes understand several sentences perfectly, super clear 100%, then not understand the next at all. But I can catch the gist of pretty much anything. I'm not catching all the nuance or every word obviously. I don't watch a lot of TV shows (and I need to work more in), but I can understand the gist of each scene and most of what's going on, especially if I turn on the subtitles. But sometimes, when there's a line or two where I get lost and have no idea, that line or two is the important part of the scene. I also can miss lots of nuance.

So yeah, I'm going to echo what a lot of others who reached 1500 hours before me have said: I'm disappointed at my results after 1500 hours because the roadmap set some unrealistic expectations. I feel like (and this is a terrible analogy) an iceberg. Above the surface, I'm a solid intermediate Spanish student. Below the surface, I have a LOT of potential/knowledge from listening/reading. But at the end of the day, I'm still an intermediate student. Luckily, I was well-prepared by reading other people's updates that I wasn't going to end up where I thought I'd be. So thank you to anyone ahead of me in their journey who posted an honest update about their experiences. I've also read that most people report feeling a lot better about their level at 2000 hours (from all the 2000 reports I've read), and I do intend on continuing to that point. I'll just be moving at a much slower pace because Spanish is no longer my first priority. 

Again, I'm also disappointed that I'm inputting in Spanish, but outputting by translating from English to Spanish.

**If I Had to Do It Over Again:**

In my opinion, comprehensible input is probably the best way to study another language (as traditional methods did very little for me). However, I believe the Dreaming Spanish version is a marketing gimmick. I agree that holding off on grammar and reading for awhile is a great way to stay motivated and for it to feel easy (and probably does help your accent a ton), but I feel like waiting until 1000 hours to read is overkill and slows down your progress. When I start on my next language (French), I'll do comprehensible listening input only until I can understand beginner/learner content reliably, then I'll start taking a look at some basic grammar. At the point were I start understanding at least some native level content, I'll start reading. I believe not reviewing/studying grammar earlier and holding off on reading until 1000 hours was a waste of my time because I believe I plateaued/stalled somewhat in my progress around 600 - 1000 hours. Don't get me wrong, I still improved, but when I introduced reading and then later grammar, I made leaps in understanding in a short time both times. I think the 600-1000 hours would have been more useful and I would have gotten more out of them had I been studying grammar and reading a little at the same time. I'd never really had those sudden jumps previously. Having said that, I don't think speaking or writing gave me much of a jump in my listening abilities, so I don't think there's a need to make that an early priority (at least for me).

I also don't think more input is the magic solution that solves everything. I think actively studying whatever it is you're struggling with while engaging with input that is most likely to feature that topic is the more correct answer.

In any case, I will come back and post another update when I hit 2000 hours.

I was good at studies but idk i just got one offer and i have been applying off-campus but I'm not getting any interviews. I have heard a lot of negative things about capgemini that how they are blindly hiring and don't have any real projects. I'm afraid i would not get to learn there. My parents are saying go for higher studies like masters in abroad but honestly I am not sure what should i do ? ,active,0
