It *is* hard, especially for students who have never had any experience with grammar. I have built in a lot of support — no late penalty, reviseable assignments, written and recorded lectures, links to other websites explaining the concepts. I also am SO flexible this term cause I’m only teaching online. 

One of the assignments is a summary and response essay. The quote in the title came from a student who I suspected used ChatGPT and didn’t even bother to revise the nonsense it generated. Throughout the term, she’s gotten low marks on her regular grammar assignments, and I’ve invited her to have a meeting with me on almost every one. It is now the end of week 8, and she has never taken me up on my suggestion to have a conference.  

I gave her a zero on her essay (not only because I think she cheated; it was horrible), and now she has responded for the first time, telling me this is the hardest class with the most work she’s ever had, and that she has hired a tutor because it is so difficult. In my response to her, I asked her why she preferred to pay a tutor than to meet with me, who she has already “paid” to meet with her. I told her it is literally my job to help her. 

And she hasn’t responded. 

I am so exhausted with these students.

Me — HEY!!! I want to meet with you!! I’m free LITERALLY anytime you are available!!! 

Student — this class is hard. I will cheat, then complain that the class is so hard and blame the teacher making the class hard. 

Wtf am I supposed to do? If I make the class any easier, it won’t be upper-division work. 

But my college is “struggling to enroll students” (like everyone), so we’re tasked with “retention” at all cost.

The context is that I am a student from Germany which means that IB is additionally to my normal classes. Now, we have a concept here that you can write a ""Facharbeit"" which basically is the EE but with slightly different rules. 
The good thing is: I was told that I’m able to write my Facharbeit and hand it in as my EE as well. 
I was told that I should not focus on the EE guidelines but on the Facharbeit ones instead and just slightly modify the text for the EE in the end. 
I did that, only planned for the Facharbeit and never checked the EE guidelines. 
But on Fridays, my teacher told me that I could not receive my essay!
 This is because as you guys know, the EE has to contain some sort of cultural artefact or else. The problem: I write about how students in German schools use ChatGPT and why it’s basically the fault of the education system. 
That means that I do not have such an artifact and my teacher, who told me that I should not care about the EE rules AT ALL now told me how it is. 
It is just so incredibly frustrating because the teacher really told me that it would not be a problem and now that…

I have no idea why I wrote this, I guess I just wanted to let that out.

I don't want to turn into a professor that does uninspired subpar teaching in retaliation to apathetic students, so part of me wants to quit and find another role if this is going to be it. 

I had a student that I taught last semester come to me a few days ago and tell me that he really appreciated my class a lot because it's helped him in other classes: ""It was really challenging, but really good.

I’ve been baffled many times by some of the odd things students do, but this is a whole new dimension of baffled.

1bffrdk,23,2024-03-15,Does anyone actually believe in asynchronous online courses? Especially now with AI?,u/Anonphilosophia,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1bffrdk/does_anyone_actually_believe_in_asynchronous/,"**TLDR - Asynchonous courses do NOT qualify as education.  They are basically 70's style correspondence courses (online before internet - where you mailed in your assignments for a degree) utilizing technology.**    
**Now, with ChatGPT, asynchonous online is complete and utter bullshit.**  
**Academia has truly, rightfully and justifiably earned its decline in enrollments by allowing this shit to become ""education.""**

As a philosophy prof (adjunct), I NEVER believed in them.

I started college as a Poli Sci major - to go to law school.  I had to take two required Philosophy courses as my school was Catholic, and I was DREADING THEM. Most of my friends were science majors, and that curriculum had them earlier than mine and they told me Philosophy was AWFUL (I think they disliked the fact that there were no ""exact"" answers - no offense, STEM people.)

I LOVED PHIL.  It was almost like ""coming out.""  O.M.G.  To read so many different beliefs over the same ideas (ethics, knowledge, reality, god, etc.).  To know that no one was actually RIGHT (but some were dead wrong) was SO FREEING.

It was everything I'd hoped poli sci would be - heated debated and discussions about abstract ideas (there were no ""heated debates"" in our version of poli sci - just theories and memorization.)    
**I, a die-hard introvert, became one of those students who had to be told, ""OK - let others speak.""**  My ex and I (also poli sci - also changed to Phil) would literally get in shouting matches in class.

I changed my major after three courses, still with the intent to go to law school.  Then I realized, I wanted to give the freedom of philosophy to others (and I do - when I teach LIVE classes) and decided to go to graduate school to teach full time (and I don't - I choose corporate and teach on the side.) 

I entered a PhD program, dropped out after 3 years with no degree.  I didn't care about reasearch.  I  just wanted to teach 101 to people who don't even know what philosophy is and watch their heads explode like mine did.

I was working full time and realized I missed teaching and was able to get adjunct gig at a CC (I had more credits than required for an MA, but no degree).  Funny, when they hired me I signed all of the paperwork without knowing the salary.  When I finally asked HR at the end of the process, she said, ""HONEY!!! That should always be the FIRST question you ask.""  I replied, ""I missed teaching, I would have done it for free.""  I was doing it for my love of philosophy, not the money.  I had money from my other job.

I taught after work and on Sunday afternoons.  WHEN I TELL YOU THAT SUNDAY IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST TIME TO TEACH PHILOSOPHY!!!!   The students weren't tired from working, they were awake and aware and, after a few weeks, ready to fight! (and sometimes - when they realized their beliefs were not valid - admit defeat. My favorite was when a student wrote on a paper, ""I know now that it doesn't make any sense, but I'm going to believe it anyway."" LOL.)    
I love watching them think - you can literally SEE them trying to fit their beliefs into what they just learned. Both times were good, but that SUNDAY CLASS.... I could recreate the same classroom dynamic that caused me to change my major!

As they started offering online courses, my course enrollments dropped.  Then one semester, my Sunday class didn't make.  I knew it was the beginning of the end.  **But I vowed, I WOULD NEVER TEACH PHILOSOPHY ONLINE as that was against my ""teaching religion"" based on EXPERIENCE.**

Because here's the deal - I actually went back to school to earn my masters.  I needed the letters to move up in my career.  And **I took an asyncrhonous online course.**  My degree program was ""philosophy adjacent"" meaning I went in ready to continue the heated debates and discussions we had during my undergrad and first attempt at grad.  But when I took that online course, this is what I learned.

**It does not matter that you care about the subject, if the teacher says that you need to ""post once and respond twice"" then just do that, and don't put to much thought into your responses**, because

* NO ONE is going to read your response (if they met the quota)
* NO ONE is going to respond to your response (if they met the quota)
* NO ONE is going to respond thoughtfully to your post - When you post, no matter how good it is, at best you get bullshit responses from your classmates (""I agree with you.""  ""That's a good point"" etc - responses that I do NOT allow in my online courses.)

My instructors LOVED my posts and papers (note, my first school was MUCH more intense.  I could tell by the comments that they were so happy to see this level of work.  **And I get it - it's like seeing an actual written work after grading three discussions of ChatGPT - that level of appreciation, y'all know what I mean...**)

**So I basically knew asynchronous online was NOT what education was supposed to be - at least not for Philosophy/Philosophy-Adjacent courses - and continued my vow to NEVER DO IT.**

Eventually, I had to stop teaching due to work travel and the fact that my classes kept not making as the online was increasing.  I couldn't commit to in-person, but I still REFUSED to do asynchronous online.  

But then came the pandemic.  My company took a hit (it's back now) and I decided why not try... I could use the cash, I knew I would dislike it.  For the first time, I was teaching for the money, not the love of the subject.

I WAS CORRECT, I did dislike  I went from engaged students (and yeah, it starts as ""engagement by force"" since you have to come to class - but even the most ""determined to be bored"" student had that one topic that brought them in) to students who did the bare minimum.  I didn't want to read discussion post (that ONLY met the requirements, never more) I wanted to discuss, debate, WATCH THEM LEARN.

**And when I started, I'd only heard of ChatGPT - but didn't use it (Why would I?  If there is one thing studying philosophy taught me, it is HOW TO FUCKING READ, WRITE, and THINK CRITICALLY.  I don't fucking need ChatGPT.  And these students wouldn't either if they were actually fucking LEARNING.)**

But one day I started noticing that the level of discussion responses and test answers were NOT in alignment.  How are you writing like you read MORE than the assigned readings but getting all of the questions on that topic incorrect?  Someone told me to check outChatGPT.  OMG. THERE IT IS!!!!!  

That dislike of AO turned into a **WHITE HOT HATRED**.  I hate asynchronous online more than I have ever hated anything.  It is absolutely NOT what philosophy is supposed to be.  **IT IS NOT WHAT EDUCATION IS SUPPOSED TO BE.**  I do not believe it has ANY educational value whatsoever.  The only person gaining in this is OPENAI - for the number of users it is getting.

To the powers that be, those who endorse it because it increases enrollments (and dropoputs - but who cares about that????), those who write research articles trying to give it validity (and probably earn tenure/meet research requirements - because you cannot POSSIBLY believe what you are writing), I want to say a loud FUCK YOU.  You are doing far more damage to academia than you could ever imagine.  And if academic keeps believing this bullshit - it has truly earned its decline.

I actually hire recent undergrads.  I don't work in academia; I work outside the bubble.  And some of these children are LACKING.  I know there are many things that are leading to the decline of critical thinking - social media, thought-bubbles, overprotective parents, blah blah blah.  But if you think that asychronous online is doing anything but ADDING to the decline - you are deluding yourself.

**I hope the full-time faculty get together soon and start a revolution.**  Because AO needs to be abolished immediatly.  Zoom/Remote is fine, but asychronous online is COMPLETE AND UTTER BULLSHIT.

There’s a lot of comments how AI is useless and stupid—someone even wrote that it has not use at all. I can not tell you enough that you are sounding like the old dinosaurs who wouldn’t use the internet and thought it was worthless. And now they can’t add an attachment to an email or make a pdf.

ChatGPT is an incredible digital editor. It is very useful when you have written a paragraph and done all the research, but you’re having issues getting it to flow, it’s too wordy, could be more concise, or has “loopy logic” (the paragraph seems cyclical). Just give the paragraph to ChatGPT, tell it to make it more concise or clear, and/or more instructions (change only what you have to, keep the same tone, use academic language). It will spit out something that then itself can be edited and tweaked through 2 ways, 1) reprompting, and more importantly, 2) editing it yourself. It’s an incredible time saver and can help get you past writers block. In this way it’s also not plagiarism; it is the same as using a friend to read and help edit.

ChatGPT is incredible at producing code. If you work in statistics or anything that requires code, ChatGPT can double, triple + your output. Yes you need to make sure the code works and gives you what you need. But you need to do that anyway with code you yourself write. If the code ChatGPT gives you results in an error, just give the error to ChatGPT and it will correct. You may need to do this a few times, but 9/10 it will get there. But we need to teach students HOW to use it. Like giving ChatGPT the appropriate inputs needed (variable names, how to explain properly the procedure that needs to be done).

ChatGPT is great at brainstorming and organizing thoughts. It can make outlines, help to clarify thoughts one might have, and just give starting off points. ChatGPT is like Wikipedia. You can’t trust what it says completely, but most of the time it’s right, and it allows you to go out and better find that info.

ChatGPT is great at making (non scientific) figures in presentations. Like when you want a little funny photo of something specific (a scientist who is also a cowboy studying bugs). It can not make scientific figures obviously, but it has uses!

This is mostly because I think new developers don't want to hear certain truths and more senior devs are too tired or don't care enough to tell you how it is. Here is my list of things new devs don't want to hear but you should if you want to go anywhere in this field.

- Leetcode sucks, it's an archaic way of testing someone's abilities, it won't be a useful skill on your day to day job and you should learn it anyways. Stop complaining about leetcode, it may not be a useful skill for when you actually get a job but if you're good at it, it will make your job search drastically easier. All complaining does is waste your time that could be spent grinding out more leetcode questions. In fact by the time you finish this sentence, you could have used merge sort ten times over to solve a leetcode question instead of your basic ass bubble sort that is not even halfway through your array

- ChatGPT is an amazing tool that can help you code, it's a great tool for learning, you will probably use it a lot once you get a job and you should stop using it if you are in school. Learning through ChatGPT while in school is like telling a student to read the textbook for help with an assignment but the answers are also in the back of the book. Sure you can use the textbook and read it to help you learn the material but most of you will just jump to the back of the book and get the answers. This will not help you learn and if you get in trouble that's on you. Remember all that code that is being generated is out there somewhere in some repo. Tools can find those obscure codes and call you out for cheating. If you are new, I would stay away. It will make you a weaker developer if you rely on AI. Or maybe this whole post was written by AI, you'll never know.

- Projects are a great, there are plenty of tutorials online on all sorts of projects you can build, this includes step by step instructions on getting huge projects built and you should ignore all of them. The amount of people applying to jobs nowadays with their React websites that are essentially copy and pasted from some tutorial on Youtube or a weather app or a calculator, this won't make you stand out. Projects are supposed to display your ability to go deep into a topic and show you are capable of building software on your own not your ability to follow a tutorial. The best projects are those that only you can come up with. Not because others can't build them but because only you would want to. And before you ask, no an AI waifu is not a good project.

- Being passionate about computer science is absolutely a great reason to pursue this career and so is doing it for the money. One of my biggest pet peeves in this subreddit is the amount of people that think that the only reason to pursue CS is for passion. The truth is that money is a huge deal to a lot of people. The world is harsh and not all of us can do the thing we are passionate about. Joining this field for money is okay and following the path with the biggest check is absolutely okay. Whatever reason you chose to do this for, it's a valid reason and we should stop gatekeeping our field. Unless you code in Java.

- Coding is a huge part of what this field is about but so is reading documentation, debugging and lots of staring a blank screen wondering why you do this. Many new developers picture themselves solving problems and typing cool code into their computers but the reality of the job is much different. For many of us our daily jobs only requires a handful of lines of code, and mostly it's just debugging, planning, reading other people's code and meetings. Trust me I am writing this at work because anything is better than having to look through pages of poorly documented code in order to center a div.

- Lastly, the more you code the better you will get, eventually after years of doing it over and over again you will go from being bad at it to maybe being okay. The truth is that most developers are not geniuses. Not everyone can be Sam Altman or John Carmack. Most of you will never be good enough to be great at coding. Despite what anyone has told you, coding is hard. The better you get at it, the more you'll realize how bad you are at it. While this may sound discouraging, It really isn't. The way i look at it is that anytime I think I am stupid for not knowing something, it's always reassuring that most people in my field probably don't know it either.

**“The Future of Academia: Glasses for Everyone, But the Game Relies on the Player”**

The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has some academics worried, fearing these ""glasses"" granting everyone access to information will diminish their value. However, the analogy breaks down. Unlike eyesight, knowledge is constantly evolving. LLMs need continuous updates, where public access with diverse perspectives becomes an advantage.

The true differentiator lies not in having the ""glasses"" (LLMs), but in how well you play the ""game"" (conduct research). Critical thinking becomes paramount. Can you analyze LLM outputs, identify biases, and formulate novel research questions that these AI assistants might miss?

Furthermore, weaving a compelling narrative from the information gathered is crucial. Just like baseball, academia will see a rise in specialization. A biochemist and a literary scholar might both use LLMs, but their critical thinking skills will differ. The future likely involves collaboration, with academics and LLMs working together, each leveraging their strengths.

In essence, LLMs democratize access to information, but success hinges on human strengths – critical thinking, unique perspectives, and the ability to interpret and communicate effectively. The future of research lies not in everyone having the same ""glasses,"" but in how each player uses them to contribute their unique perspective to the game of knowledge creation.""

Students are going to use LLMs… they are using LLMs. And the boring students are all going to use the LLMs in pretty much the same way.

Boringly.

Professionals are going to use LLMs. Professionals are using LLM’s.  Professionals are NOT using LLM’s in all the same boring ways, because knowledge is not actually the true heft professionals bring to the game anymore. Professionals are using creative expertise… critical thinking, analysis… and yes specialized knowledge.

But in general knowledge is the LLM’s job now.  Gemini “knows” more than any one person ever will. LLMs learn differently. Knowledge is now copied/disseminated differently, learned differently. Interacted with differently.

Professors will adapt and begin more closely identifying and training the heft of creative intellect instead of having to instruct students in the various forms.

Wanted to ask everyone’s opinion to see how I should move forward or if I should forget about this nonsense. I’m a 23F, junior at a public university studying psych and needed to take a Western Religion class to fulfill the literature req. i love school, always have but this professor is dreadful - reads directly from slides and will make changes to them in class, doesn’t share the lecture material, requires 25-100 pgs of weekly reading, didn’t get grades until week 6 and dqs are based on material that isn’t reviewed until the week after. He is a nice guy and was highly reviewed on ratemyprofessor but the problem is the dqs. 

Since we don’t review the matieral until the week after, it is very difficult to respond to the discussion questions without guessing if you’re being PC. i was looking through other students responses for insight, and 7/15 responses were using chatgpt to fully copy/paste!! No citations or basic changes, just blatantly stole a robots work. I couldn’t believe a human wrote it, so i individually copied their responses and pasted it into chat gpt asking “did chat gpt write this” and it said yes!!!!!! 

So, i took pictures and recently asked the professor if “i missed something during class” to see if we’re allowed to use AI (since his syllabus says he’s strongly against it and students will be reported to the provost). He said no we are not allowed, and asked why… to which I responded that I noticed students using it within discussion posts and I wanted to see if i could too. 

He was surprised and a bit defensive. I jokingly stated i had proof, in case he would like to see it and he said “no there isn’t much he can do to address it or way to fully prove it anyways.” (Although I was standing there with proof) I know im kinda a jerk for “snitching” on fellow students, but I’ve worked my ass off to get into this school and to pass this class and others are succeeding only because they’re cheating. Yes that’s life, but I don’t want to do nothing. 

Granted, they will be the ones to lose later on in life but it undermines academia and my grade itself. Even if i get a C+ I will be proud bc I have earned it, but im upset knowing others are excelling and curving the grade making this man think he’s a brilliant prof. I’m disappointed that he didn’t even acknowledge how serious this is, and it makes me believe he is either incompetent or doesn’t care enough to defend academia or his material. 

He’s an older gentleman who’s studied religion for 40+ years, you’d think he’d be more interested in preserving his life work and academia itself considering America is one of the only places we have the privilege of openly discussing/comparing religions. 

Do I leave this info with my professor and do nothing? Do I directly confront the students? Do I start cheating too to get a better grade? Should I figure out how to contact the provost directly and report the students AND the professor? Have you dealt with a similar situation? Please leave your feedback. I am so frustrated because I have no prior knowledge in any religion and was truly interested in learning more but now I resent it. I also resent paying 2k for a class that is taking up 70% of my time and is still going to tank my gpa, because the prof has no interest in “teaching”",User_deleted,0
1bjn27b,113,2024-03-20,ChatGPT basically makes our TA work useless especially when professors just don't seem to care about students cheating and expect us to mark all their easily cheat-able little assignments,u/Practical_Ad_8802,PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1bjn27b/chatgpt_basically_makes_our_ta_work_useless/,"I was pretty angry yesterday when I read in my university's student newspaper interviewing undergrad students who had (apparently) used ChatGPT for their assignments. Obviously some students use ChatGPT but one student mentioned (under fake name) confessed to using ChatGPT for his courses in my discipline, courses that I, as a graduate student (first year PhD) TA have to mark. He said ""ChatGPT is essential for writing my philosophy essays,"" like, are you kidding me? Using ChatGPT for writing assignments ultimately only cheats the student of learning how to write properly, so before this I didn't really care...most of the time assignments that are obviously ChatGPT (in the humanities) are pretty bad, superficial, vague etc. so do not warrant a good mark anyways, so the student is already being penalized by a bad grade even if we can't prove it.

 But this makes me so frustrated because I'm currently working my butt off to get through endless marking for this one TA course I've been assigned to this semester, and spending MY time going above and beyond in trying to provide students feedback/comments etc, while this student (who may very well be in this course) is just wasting his TAs effort by submitting work he didn't even do himself, and smugly calling ChatGPT ""an essential resource"" bragging about it in the student paper. If these were multiple choice exams I wouldn't care, but marking essays--as anyone in the humanities know--is so time consuming (reading it, providing annotated feedback, detailed comments, correcting spelling and grammar ect.) Even more infuriating, while I would hope that he would be getting a bad mark if I was marking him--presumably he is not since he's pleased with ChatGPT-so one of my fellow grad students is clearly giving him and his garbage ChatGPT work a free pass, thereby rewarding the behaviour.

 Additionally, the proff for this course is next to useless, does not answer student emails (so they all come to me), does not give us (the TAs) any guidance or support on marking assignments (which is fine but then students complain to me about marks and I have no rubric or anything to justify myself), and worst of all, has SO MANY little endless assignments ( 3 1500 word exegetical essays, 3 1000 word short answer tests, and 5 discussion posts) that have taken up almost all my entire semester in marking (I have 52 students in my cohort). I have courses this year as a first-year PhD, and I've only finished one of my four for this semester...I still have so much of my own research and writing to do for my own essays but that has all gotten shoved to the end of the semester due to this endless marking. On top of this is my leading tutorial every week for this class (which is an hour a week but took me about 12 hours to prepare all of the materials and do the readings), and I also tend to host a weekly office hour because students come to me to ask/complain about their grade or want support (since the proff is never around), and I genuinely want my students to succeed in this course and give philosophy a fair go (since is a 100 level course). I make no extra money for this extra work since I am on a fixed salary, so it really depends on the proff you get...last semester I only had 1 essay and 1 exam to mark the ENTIRE semester for less students (about 30 in my cohort). 

I'm just angry because it seems professors have not clued into the fact that most students may very well be using ChatGPT to do their assignments, especially when all of the assignments are take-home open book tests or these mini essays that just require you to respond to a prompt. Some proffs also just don't care...last year I got assigned to TA a course that was almost as bad since the proff told the class ""nobody would get less than 70%"" in her class, and then got mad at me when I failed students who had clearly not done the work/answered the question and it was probably ChatGPT. Working for shitty proffs is always a risk as a TA I know that, but essentially all our (underpaid) effort is made to feel even more worthless with ChatGPT now, especially if proffs won't investigate these claims or make assignments more cheat-proof, and especially when proffs cram the course full of little assignments that take endless work to mark and easy to cheat with ChatGPT. 

Ugh. Sorry just had to take a break from marking my 52 essays for this week to rant. ",User_deleted,118
1bjv4k2,90,2024-03-20,This semester the quality of student work is awful!,u/Lumicat,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1bjv4k2/this_semester_the_quality_of_student_work_is_awful/,"This has been the worst semester I have had in almost 20 years. The writing quality was awful and on the first written assignment I caught 10% of my class (class has 140 students) either plagiarizing, using direct quotes in correctly, as in writing what you want and then putting it into direct quotes, or using AI.

I teach cognitive psychology which does deal with AI so I outlined how to cite AI which includes the AI model used, what prompts were used and then AI output. Under no circumstances is AI to ever be used for the student's own writing. 

So I create assignments with what I call traps. For example, if there are 7 questions, I will make sure 4 can't be answered with AI like having to cite a video. So then I have a nice writing sample comparison right in the assignment. I also use ChatGPT and created a bot, kind of a virtual TA, and fed it several hundred anonymized writing samples from previous classes so it knows what college writing looks like. In other words, it's easy to catch students. If I suspect a violation of academic integrity, I always meet with them on Zoom before I decide what's going to happen.

In the end, it took me almost 40 hours to grade 1 assignment because when I grade, I feel compelled to provide feedback on what lost them points and how to correct it.

A lot of students don't follow directions, their writing quality is so much worse, and they don't understand the basics of writing in science fields.

I am legit disturbed. I explained to the class that even university presidents could lose their job and career over this stuff and they are seniors at a University. After awhile it started to sink in, but it took way too much of my time and effort to get seniors in college to understand why writing properly and citing correctly is a good thing.

And I wonder if anyone else has noticed this in their students.",active,105
1bmsikd,1,2024-03-24,How can you fail an academic paper while using chatgpt anyways?,u/r1308t,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1bmsikd/how_can_you_fail_an_academic_paper_while_using/,"Recently, i saw on social media how professors/teachers say they had to fail their students bc they used chatgpt. How is that possible? I mean in academic papers, don't you have to cite academic sources and come up with arguments based on them anyways? Or like do actual research? I mean i would get it, if you use it to write an essay, where you simply type in the prompt and copy the result, but academic papers? I would use chatgpt to ask it, if the wording (of the content i researched) sound clear or how they improve the lines so the flow is better, does that already count as written by chatgpt and therefore being a reason to let you fail? 

Sorry if that's a dumb question xx",User_deleted,0

I’m a public relations major, so I was really excited for this class and hoping to learn a lot, but the readings and resources seem to be unrelated to the assignments for the week and everything is very vague and confusing.

I’m strongly considering dropping this term entirely and trying to retake it with a different professor, but I’m worried I’m going to have the same experience.

At this point I feel like giving up the whole amath subject bruh idk how I managed to get a grade 1 (na btw) people see that I'm good at amath on the outside but actually there's many dark shit is happening to me rn there's someone close to me pass away recently and I feel like just crying it all out and now amath is making me feel nasty.

I work with students 3 days a week, and there is always this group that complains all the time about “When am I ever going to need this?” “ChatGPT could just do this for me.” I do realize it is like talking to a door when they aren’t in a mindset of actually talking about how this class is useful, I do respond with something like “well someone decided for your major you need to be able to do precalc” or “this is more than just doing the math, it’s about problem solving” and “ChatGPT is actually really bad at math, and I’m sure in whatever career they don’t want someone who just uses AI.” I was wondering if anyone has anything else I could say when they start complaining to me about math.

I dread teaching and feel disconnecting from my students.

It’s everything: the CHATGPT, the tardiness, the phones, the indifference, the rudeness, and the continual and unreasonable demands.

They don’t read the assignments, and they do their work improperly. They just don’t care. 

One class thinks I’m rude because I’m no longer polite when I tell them to stop talking or get off their phones.

While I realize this critique is gendered  (as I am a young woman), I’m worn out. 

Last week a student said she thought I was rude when I told I get off her phone, and “that’s why [she] continued to use.” I said that that was her choice, but I was fuming inside.

I realize I’m not alone in this expensive, but 95% of them have no curiosity nor a desire to learn.
