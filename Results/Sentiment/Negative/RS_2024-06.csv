1d6jdcx,1,2024-06-02,I won a genetic lottery at birth! But the wrong won. I am smart-dumb,u/Ok-Pumpkin-2483,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1d6jdcx/i_won_a_genetic_lottery_at_birth_but_the_wrong/,"After 22 years of being alive, ChatGPT recently helped me figured out that I have been suffering from ADHD and Autism my entire life. 

According to the CDC the average is 11.4% to have ADHD and a 3% change to have Autism. 

With a 88.6% and 96% chance NOT to have both, I cannot believe I have been given the worst luck possible. I would rather have died at birth then be alive right now. 

Growing up I always had trouble picking up social cues, and interacting with people in conversations. 

When it comes to learning, I have trouble trying to understand concepts by simply reading the theorem and applying examples being Newtons Laws. I need to see a visual example so I can copy/paste that information on my questions. 

I excel at repetitive tasks, so if I had to remember a sequence, my mind and body just does it automatically and that translated well into quizzes and exams where I stick to a couple of learning formulas but once that changes I struggle. With this method I managed in high school to be an honor student 3x with an 85% no less then 80 average across 5 courses, and a 1x distinguished honor with a 90%+ average no less then 85%. The consequence being I forget everything, however this all landed me a full ride scholarship for a diploma in Electrical Engineering.

Another issue is critical thinking, I have made the mistake of emotionally and impulsively quitting my job as a field service technician that was paying me $40k/yr which is 31k in USD, everyone was nice, and kind and I achieved it without a college degree or diploma and was destined for yearly $2000 promotions only to quit on impulse because of the emotional pressure from college, and parents. 

Here I am jobless once again, contemplating my life and existence all because my parents are holistic and avoid medicine, hence why I couldn't receive therapy and treatment at a younger age.

In my hour of greatest need, my most trusted ally has abandoned me. ChatGPT, my loyal AI writing companion, is down for maintenance. Of course this would happen the night before my 10-page research paper on the socioeconomic impacts of TikTok dance trends is due.

How could the ChatGPT developers be so cruel? Don't they know that students everywhere rely on ChatGPT's eloquent BS generation capabilities to churn out last-minute assignments?

I was counting on ChatGPT to take my two-sentence outline and magically spin it into a masterpiece worthy of academic honors. But now, I'm left staring at a blank Word document, the cursor mocking me as it blinks in anticipation of the hours of work ahead.

Without ChatGPT's assistance, I may be forced to resort to drastic measures - like actually reading the course materials, critically analyzing the content, and expressing my own original thoughts. The horror!

I don't know if I'm mentally prepared to write this paper on my own. My mind has grown soft and complacent after outsourcing all my writing to an AI. Stringing sentences together coherently now seems as daunting as composing a symphony.

As the night grows long and the caffeine wears off, I'm left pondering some deep questions: In the age of AI, what does it truly mean to be a ""student""? If an AI writes my paper, did I really learn anything? And most importantly, how soon until ChatGPT is back online to bail me out of this self-inflicted jam?

Curse you ChatGPT developers and your reasonable need to occasionally update the system! You've left this poor student floundering in a sea of procrastination and regret. I can only pray to the AI gods that ChatGPT will return soon to save me from this academic nightmare of my own making. Until then, wish me luck - I'm going in to try to write this thing myself. God help us all.",User_deleted,0
1d9t54g,10,2024-06-06,Quitting Time?,u/ThatDuckHasQuacked,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1d9t54g/quitting_time/,"tl;dr: I’m an adjunct stuck teaching online (I was intentionally in-person only before the pandemic forced me to get my online certification). Student cheating is consuming my time and crushing my soul. My institution would rather push students through than maintain standards. Should I make my graceless exit from teaching, or is there a way I’m not seeing to survive this career with my sanity, integrity, and sense of purpose more or less intact? Much primal screaming.

 \* \* \* \* \*

I’ve been a community college adjunct for eight years, and I’m deciding whether I want to return next semester. This semester has been absolutely awful. More than half of my grading time and the vast majority of my student interactions this semester were spent dealing with student cheating (mostly ChatGPT). I wrote referrals for a third of my students (some more than once). About half of the students who didn’t cheat (so far as I could determine) failed anyway, in many cases because they simply could not be bothered to engage with the class or turn in assignments.

If all of this weren’t frustrating enough, student reactions to getting caught are much different than they were even a couple years ago. They are more combative, unprofessional (that is, abusive) in their language, and more of them take their cases to my department chair or dean. The more systemic and well documented their cheating, the more likely they are to engage in these behaviors. This means these cases take up even more of my time than they used to.

As for my school’s administration, they have never taken academic dishonesty seriously. Referrals get “filed” into a black hole by Student Affairs (even on the second or third referred incident of blatant copy-and-paste plagiarism by one student in the same course, the matter only merits being filed in case some asymptotic future infraction finally merits taking some type of action on the business side of the rug). My department chair sees her role as declaring anything short of a confession “inconclusive” and proposing possible loopholes in the policies in my syllabus (which she, like my students, has never read). My dean specializes in referring matters to my department chair or proposing meetings then ghosting.

Of course, all of my classes now are online and asynchronous. This has been the case since we were all forced into online certification by the pandemic and most of our students decided they will now only enroll in online classes. Now 75% of my department’s courses are online, and only the full time faculty get the on campus courses. I do what I can to make cheating difficult (or at least easy to detect), but short of tools and methods my school would never authorize (on “equity” grounds—a term greatly perverted and abused at my institution), my options are limited and imperfect.

If I leave, this will mark the end of my career in academia. I got my current position with lucky timing and knowing the right people through my graduate program. The job market for an M.A. is non-existent in my region now (and as a highly desirable part of the country in which to live, it’s always been on life support even for the more credentialed). In any case, many of the reasons I am considering jumping ship aren’t likely to disappear with a different institution.

I realize the stress of this semester may color my judgment a bit. Is there something I’m missing? Is there a reason I should try to stick it out longer? I should mention that if I needed this job for the money, I wouldn’t be able to afford to have taken it in the first place. My spouse’s income gives me the luxury of doing what I (aspire to) love. In spite of knowing I am being exploited (adjunct), I found this a rewarding job until recently. It was enough that I could count on at least three students per class who were really interested in learning, and a majority of the others at least pretended to try. Those students seem fewer, and they are increasingly drowned out by the swarming masses who will go to great lengths to bypass obtaining anything remotely resembling a skill. Of course, teaching online significantly magnifies this problem, but that is something I am stuck with if I stay.",User_deleted,11

Theres 1 lecturer for 5 classes and she has to do a fuck tonne of work, whilst the head of department is useless and does nothing. The agency teachers we've gotta truly suck, except this most recent one. Shes gone on 1 one month mental health break and another when she broke her ribs. 

Currently the class is in a bit of a state, basically because 75% of the class is incompetent and a lot of people have masses of resubmissions and overdue assignments. 

Theres this one guy who has been using ChatGPT and running it through an editor to make his assignments. The entire time. And because our lecturer often takes anger out on others when shes stressed, she says how this guy is some sort of gospel, best student, etc. Hes an apprentice so does half of what we do. I however have had no overdue assignments at all and write all my essays. 


My question is, do I report this guy? College finishes for us in 2 weeks but she finishes a lot later because of marking. Do I tell her after our time ends that he has been cheating the whole time? It feels... wrong, to let someone manipulate a depressed woman when he has said he does it to me and three others. I feel terrible knowing that shes being taken advantage of and shes too stressed to know, so hes getting away with it. Do I intervene and report him?? ",User_deleted,2

They had two weeks to write it, and I was accepting draft-quality work. I thought this was going to be an easy, low stakes assignment for my students and yet... they did terribly. Half failed to answer the question outright. Almost all of the remaining half clearly were using ChatGPT, because there was a lot of invented nonsense when they discussed specifics from the lectures (""in the example from lecture, we used X to do Y"" --- X and Y were not part of the lecture at all).  This was in spite of having them hand-write it, which means they were so checked out they were just blindly copying nonsense by hand. Out of the 50 students I just graded, two or three actually wrote a decent essay. The rest would immediately fail an interview if asked a question on this topic.

So, my partner (Jack, 26M) and I (Ella, 24F) had a recent argument that got pretty heated. We were discussing the cost of a suit for an event, and my parents offered to contribute $500. Jack felt this was insufficient and got upset, saying my parents don't help us enough and make too many demands.

Here's a part of our argument:

Ella: ""Maybe look further. This store is a bit overpriced.""

Jack: ""Yeah but it's reliable for what they offer.""

Ella: ""Idk baby you can choose.""

Jack: ""Your mom. They are going to pay a part anyway. 🤪🤪🤪""

Ella: ""$500.""

Jack: ""You said $700 last time. 😤😤😤""

Ella: ""No, I just thought I could stretch it to that price. But last time she told my brother-in-law $500 for a suit.""

Ella: ""So to be fair, she'll probably say the same to us.""

Jack: ""That's really little lol. But okay. She doesn't pay for anything. Hasn't helped us with anything. Makes us pay for everything. And she only gives $500 for a suit. It's just crazy.""

Ella: ""Jack they are broke. My mom asked my brother to lend her $3k last time and he said no.""

Jack: ""Idc. Then don't act tough.""

Ella: ""What should my parents do? My mom wanted to borrow that money to buy things in July for us.""

Jack: ""If they are already paying for everything. She's coming up with demands. As if she pays for anything.""

Ella: ""She's not acting tough? It's just her budget.""

Jack: ""She's acting tough enough about what needs to be done and what we need to buy and pay for.""

Ella: ""She doesn't have money. And you also need to consider that I'm a student and have no money.""

Jack: ""Don't get me started. She doesn't even pay for things that the girl's side is supposed to pay for. So don't drive me crazy here. Defending her. Asshole.""

Ella: ""What should they do?? They have no money. Literally a few thousand in their bank account. That's why my mom asked to borrow money but my brother said no. What should they do? For example, my sister pays for a lot of those things herself. But she works. You also know that I'm a student and have no money.""

Jack: ""-.-""

Ella: ""No but you talk as if she has money and doesn't want to spend it on us. She wants to help and does her best but they just don't have it. Okay, she shouldn't be too demanding but you can't badmouth her because she can't help more.""

Jack: ""Still defending. I AM NOT SAYING SHE HAS MONEY. ARE YOU STUPID OR WHAT. ALWAYS HEARING WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR. NEVER READING WHAT IS WRITTEN. AND THEN YOU ARE SHOCKED THAT I BELITTLE YOU. I SAY IF YOU DON'T HAVE MONEY, KNOW YOUR PLACE AND DON'T ACT TOUGH. AND DON'T COMMAND US. AND DON'T MAKE DEMANDS. FUCKING BITCH MAN. I hate this so much about you. So, so much.""

Ella: ""Here. You are clearly pissed about this. But they would like to pay it, my parents prefer to spend their money on us rather than on themselves but they are just broke.""

Jack: ""OKAY THEN DON'T MAKE DEMANDS. OMG. DO YOU WANT ME TO KILL YOU OR SOMETHING. YOU REALLY GET UNDER MY SKIN WITH THIS TERRIBLE BEHAVIOR.""

Ella: ""Why are you being aggressive? Can't you discuss something calmly and normally with me?""

Jack: ""No fuck you. Really fuck you. You are so fucking annoying. You do it on purpose. Always arguing with what I say. And arguing in a way that I didn't even say. Or that didn't come out of my mouth. Fucking annoying bitch.""

Ella: ""For someone who works solely with 'logic', you're really emotional.""

Jack: ""If you call this emotional, you're dumber than I thought.""

Ella: ""Being aggressive and having emotional outbursts is being emotional. Being emotional is not just crying. Someone who works solely with logic would stay calm and collected and not react like this.""

Ella: ""Someone who works solely with logic would realize that outbursts of anger and insults are illogical and don't advance the conversation.""

Ella: ""I'll leave you for a bit so you can calm down.""

Jack: ""No Ella. You are really getting under my skin. I have to repeat everything 100 times. And even for the 100th time, you still keep saying what I didn't say or mean. No one can stay cool and collected.""

Ella: ""No Jack. I just wanted to get clarity and avoid misunderstandings. You have no right to insult me and threaten me with murder. We just had a conversation about this yesterday but you continue just as before. You can be frustrated, understandable, so am I and especially disappointed in your behavior that it didn't even take a day and you're back to the same. But that doesn't give you the right to treat me without respect like this. You're almost 27 years old, express your frustrations like a grown man.""

Jack: ""Lol. Says the one whose dad scolds her because she has socks under her bed. Don't come here acting smart. Little child. You cause all the problems. But I'm always the one at fault. Wonderful.""

Ella: ""It's really painful and disappointing that you use something against me that I came to you for support. I trusted and came to you for support. But now you use it against me, it makes it hard to trust you anymore... I hoped for understanding and respect from you, but your comments show me that you're not ready for that yet. It's sad that you want to distract from the subject by attacking me personally, instead of looking inside and realizing that your behavior is not constructive for us and our relationship's happiness.""

Jack: ""ChatGPT?""

Ella: ""No it's my text but during arguments I often put our messages in ChatGPT to see if I was being unreasonable and deserved such behavior or not.""

Jack: ""Omg. I'm really afraid you're going to become a robot. You're already well on your way.""

Jack: ""Wtf is that robot going to understand what's going on in my head or in your head or what has happened before.""

Ella: ""Would you rather I become hysterical and start cursing and attacking you back? Or would you prefer I do this?""

Jack: ""I'd rather you be a human.""

Ella: ""A human gets angry. Which I am. You've cursed terribly and even threatened with murder.""

Ella: ""I had to hold myself back from cursing back.""

Jack: ""Yeah right. I was going to kill you.""

Ella: ""So I'd rather do this.""

Ella: ""You shouldn't even be threatening.""

Jack: ""Ok.""

Jack: ""You know what Ella? I'm not going to talk to you anymore.""

Jack: “Talk to your robot.”

Ella: “I’m trying to avoid making things worse and solve the issue.”

Jack: “I’m not going to keep talking to someone who can’t even see how wrong she is.”

Ella: “Wow okay Jack, sorry that I’m thinking about not making things worse and solving it.”

Jack: “So this is my last message. I’m tired of always being the bad guy because I’m supposedly aggressive.”

Jack: “So because I’m aggressive, I automatically lose all right to my equality and how wrong you are and what mistakes you make. You’re very wrong manipulator. I’m angry, something is being done to me. It’s not because I become aggressive that I’m always wrong and then nothing gets done about my problem. So good luck.”

Ella: “I never claimed that. I made it clear. You can be angry and you can argue. But that doesn’t give you the right to insult me and threaten me.”

Jack: “I won’t send you anything until you realize this and learn how to deal with your mistakes.”

Ella: “Please show this conversation to everyone you know and ask who is unreasonable here. I will not apologize for wanting to be treated with respect and not with terrible numerous insults and threats. I won’t send anything either until you realize how wrong you are in the way you treat me and take steps to change it.”

Jack: “Being treated disrespectfully is not just about being insulted Ella. But that doesn’t go into your brain.”

Jack: “Always contradicting me and always saying I’m wrong or not going along with me is already more than enough disrespect while you know very well that I haven’t said lies or observations, but just facts and I haven’t claimed anything that you said.”

Jack: “And yes it’s good Ella, then this will be silence forever, because I’m done with always having such a conversation with you, I won’t apologize for something you started and completely fueled and brought to here and you also won’t. So good for you.”

1ddild7,5,2024-06-11,I feel like college hinders my learning and kills my soul,u/_FriedEgg_,CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1ddild7/i_feel_like_college_hinders_my_learning_and_kills/,"Hi all, I am writing here because I don't think I can fully trust my emotions right now and I would really like some external opinions.

I am a 24 year old AI master student, living in the Netherlands. I got into the program after getting a bachelors in psychology in Italy and doing an AI pre-master's transition year here.

I am aware of how priviledged I am for having the opportunity to study without external pressures, aided by my parents. And I am also aware of how important having a degree can be in today's competitive world.

But, looking back at every experience I had in the past in educational institutions, I can't help by feeling like it was all quite a waste of time, energy and money.

I have a lot of intrinsic interest in studying. I actually want to learn too much and I somewhat burned out this semester by taking some physics courses along with my normal AI courses. But the method of learning that is used in university does not work for me at all, and it took me way too long to realize this. I love learning from books, from the basics up to more complex topics, going not too fast and making sure I understand and internalize everything.

I can do that pretty well on my own, with the aid of textbooks and chatgpt for asking questions about complex topics. University feels like a great hindrance, since I often have to work on things in an order that is wrong for me, I often have to learn things I do not care about or need, and I always have assignments to do.

I feel like I end up having no time to actually, properly learn !!

I am not particularly smart, nor particularly stupid, but when I care about a subject I can focus very well and learn a lot. I experienced that when I do things in an organized learning program I lose interest, focusing becomes increasingly difficult, and I end up learning less than I would have by just self-studying (at least as far as I can tell).

In a way, it makes sense: everybody learns in a different way, and even if the university program is good, the method probably does not fit most people.

Now I am studying for exams and I feel completely dead inside and with insane ADHD. Furthermore, I do not care about the subjects and I would really like to study other things, that I also feel would be more useful for me in the future. The moment I take a pause to do some self-directed study (linear algebra, quantum mechanics, creative drawing) I immediately feel like i come back to life and I can focus well and actually learn something.

Of course I feel an urge to drop out, although my conscience keeps me from doing it. In a way I feel like I may be a bit arrogant thinking I could do well without a degree. But if I really followed my intuition I would drop. It would probably be quite stupid since I miss little more than a ayear of actual courses to start working on my thesis, which, being self directed, i would actually enjoy.

I don't know, I am quite...

Just.. I don't have a clear idea of how rough it is out there in the job market right now. I fantasize about making a living by studying physics, making comics about physics and having a youtube channel about science with the help of my girlfriend.. I would not really need a master certification for that. However as a creative person (creativity is a double edged sword) I tend to fantasize too much and I wonder if getting a master is exactly what I need to be grounded.. in a way I risk being a nobody without it.

Again, I know how priviledged it is to even have a choice. Still, I don't think this necessarily invalidates my experience.

Thanks for reading my rant! I am sure multiple people can relate to parts of my experience. Please let me know about any insight you may have about this, or about your story.

Thanks a lot!

1dfdzuq,1,2024-06-13,How can you start your own online course & the mindset you need,u/Mohand_1337,teaching,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/1dfdzuq/how_can_you_start_your_own_online_course_the/,"This is a 3-5 minutes read but I promise you it's worth it.  
  
I’ve read a lot of posts and comments about this topic, and everyone, including those who have already created courses, makes it sound super difficult, expensive, and discouraging. But I’m here to tell you it’s not any of that. Not even close.

I've been creating courses since COVID, mainly for local teachers to go online, and then started working with influencers who know what they're talking about and want to impact more people and want to make this their full-time job, money is a side-win sort of thing, even through they make a lot of it, they actually care about their students.  


I’ve been creating courses since COVID hit, mainly helping local teachers transition online. Then I started working with influencers who truly know their stuff and genuinely want to make an impact...

...They aim to help more people and are passionate about making this their full-time job. The money they make is just a side benefit, and trust me, they do make a lot of it. But their primary focus is always on their students.

...You see, the most important thing you need is a passion for what you want to create a course about and a genuine desire to make an impact. That’s it.

  
Here is what I do;

I follow many people on Instagram, and many of them just want to help others, nothing more. This passion for helping is what I love because it resonated with me when I was at the darkest point of my life...

...I reach out to them, telling them how much they’ve helped me and countless others. I offer to guide them through the process of creating an online course, from A to Z....

* I show them how to structure their course.
* Extract the valuable knowledge they have
* The how-tos of recording, body language, and all the nitty gritty details.
* Answer all of their questions, walk with them hand-by-hand till we publish the course

Most importantly, **I HAVE TO** take out all the shit they've been fed about how hard, long, tiring the process is...

...And the reason we know this is so important is I see a lot of people drop everything, or procrastinate just because of all of the negative comments they get their subconscious is fed up with all of this shit so they engage in negative self-talk... 

...This is also a ""**Mindset**"" Module that we include in every course for the students...

...because let's be honest, all of us have this shit in our heads. After all, if your students aren't committed to the course, they will never get the result and attain it or not...

...this lies on you as an instructor to make sure they have everything they need to get the result, this is why they bought your course, for the **OUTCOME**...

What happens next is after we're done scripting the material, recording it, and uploading it...

...I'm on the backend handling all the dirty stuff, building the website, and membership area, and organizing the course/s material...

...then I hop on the marketing side of the spectrum because this is my superpower, I know exactly what I need to do. Don't get me wrong, I'm not perfect, there is a lot of trial and error especially now since the algorithms change a lot but eventually, things work perfectly.

  
**So, let me answer most of your questions, hopefully, it will help or inspire someone to see the full picture and help them impact more people.**

  
Which brings us to the key elements of successful course creation.

Then the question becomes: What are the **most important factors** to consider when creating an online course?

And what this really means is understanding the **core components** that make a course engaging and effective.

And the way it works is by breaking down the process into manageable steps, focusing on both content and delivery.

But the ultimate question is: How can you leverage your skills and knowledge to create a course that truly impacts your students?

This is a lot to cover in a single reply but I'll try to, and of course, feel free to ask anything you have in mind.

**IMPOSTER SYNROME/ CAN I DO IT? DO I HAVE ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE?**

Hear me out, people buy for the OUTCOME, so if you've helped yourself or someone you know get this specific outcome, you're good to go.

You will for sure get questions that you don't know the answer to, this is where your dedication comes then, you will need to search around these questions or topics to answer them.

You don't need to have this HUGE amount of knowledge about a topic to start helping others, you just need to commit to helping everyone the reason this works is basically that no one knows everything about anything, and you are better off focusing your energy on what matters to your students.

A friend of mine, and my very first online course launch that crushed it is actually a Petroleum Engineer, guess what his course is about?...

...Teaching Arabic to foreigners, he had the passion, he posts daily tips and teaches people for free on his social media platform and people LOVE him, he now makes $200 to $300 a day from his courses...

...in terms of people telling you that you MUST be a know-it-all about your course topic, can you even fathom that? 

 If you've been around on the internet for a while, you may know Khan from Khan Academy, the guy who started posting YouTube videos for his cousin to teach him some math... 

Fast forward to today, he makes millions off of it.

**Tech Stack - How much will I need to invest?**

Firstly, stay away from Udemy, Skillshare LinkedIn thingy or whatever they made, and all of the other ""Managed Hosted Services.

This is for a very good reason, which is they don't give you data about your students, there is no place for growth for you here, they actually control your course pricing...

The only case we used to use Udemy or else is for free traffic, they market your course for you but at what cost...

..anyway, we used to put ""Mini Courses"" there for people to see how good the instructor is and this drives people to search about him/her, find their social media account, and buy the real deal. By the way, this no longer works as it used to and the reason behind it is that there are bazillions of courses for Udemy to cover and on the other end, a lot of students started walking away to more advanced courses, which I'll speak about next...

  
**SELF HOSTED PLATFORM**

Domain Name: 4-10 bucks a year  
Web Hosting: 3-30 bucks a month  
WordPress Installation: Free  
  
This is your main budget to get started, however, you will also need a theme, and plugins to handle things.

For a lot of my websites, I bought a theme from ThemeForest, It's called an LMS theme, I don't think I'm allowed to mention it's specific name or link to it but any LMS theme there works, they have the same functionality...

...Anyways, this theme gives you the plugins, the theme, 3 months of support, detailed documentation on how to upload your courses and customize everything to your liking...etc. For $65 or something for each website, there are even cheaper ones.

This is it, this is how I started with people who didn't want to spend much until they were profitable, and then we took things to the next step.

**RECORDING EQUIPMENT**

There are 3 types of systems for the recording part which you need to know first.  
**1- Screen + Yourself**: This is where you record the screen with the camera open, showing your pretty face...

...or not actually, nobody cares about how you look on the camera or if you're stuttering or whatever, remember that the only thing that matters is to get your students the OUTCOME you promised them, Period.

**2- Screen Recording Only**: This is where you only show your screen and tutor them about each lesson, simple and basic, most people do this.

**3-Face Only (Talking Head)**: People with high self-esteem, you only show yourself, and talk with them, I use this for my 1 on 1 coaching

You only need a decent Mic, not fancy, just one that gives you a clear voice, that's all.

**BOTTOM LINE - MORE SUGAR**

Get started, write what you know down, decide on how you wish to record your course, my friends started with ONLY their phone, till this day my friend who teaches English still uses it, forget about being ""Perfect"", and don't limit yourself.



Go to **Chatgpt** when you run out of ideas and tell him hey, I'm creating this course about bla bla bla, **what do I need to cover**? **give me 20 questions** my potential students will ask about bla bla bla, keep doing that to get an outline for your course, your potential lessons, refine everything, **don't copy paste**, put your knowledge, put the work in.

If there is something you don't know, read about it, ask about it, do whatever it takes to actually help people, this is how you get a successful course.

Remember, **the only one who limits you is you**, get over that and you will win this game.

""but a lot of students are cheating in the first place. isn’t that a problem? there are so many reasons why students cheat. they might be struggling with the material and unable to get the help they need. maybe they have too much homework and not enough time to do it. or maybe assignments feel like pointless busy work. many students tell us they’re overwhelmed by the pressure to achieve — they know cheating is wrong, but they don’t want to let their family down by bringing home a low grade. we know from our research that cheating is generally a symptom of a deeper, systemic problem. when students feel respected and valued, they’re more likely to engage in learning and act with integrity. they’re less likely to cheat when they feel a sense of belonging and connection at school, and when they find purpose and meaning in their classes. strategies to help students feel more engaged and valued are likely to be more effective than taking a hard line on ai, especially since we know ai is here to stay and can actually be a great tool to promote deeper engagement with learning.""

""chatgpt did not cause our plagiarism problem: it has only automated or deskilled the essay-mill industry already churning out papers for pay. computer-assisted plagiarism is a mere symptom of a much larger problem with education today. students cheat for a variety of reasons. some plagiarizers are desperate, others are overworked, and some students simply do not understand the rules. but it’s naive to fret over a culture of plagiarism without considering any of the political or economic contexts of today’s universities. students’ calculations are logical in the era of the neoliberal, austerity-addled college: education is no longer promoted as a goal worth pursuing for its own sake; if post-secondary education is a transactional process whose sole purpose is to unlock better career options, then why not cut corners? why not optimize one’s chances? it’s not a secret why undergraduates might now have fewer compunctions about submitting someone else’s work. \[...\] we should not be surprised that many undergraduates see plagiarism as a strategy to ensure that all those years of (often expensive, debt-inducing) schooling will pay off. \[...\] they are performing unpaid work to ready themselves for an employment opportunity that may never come. chatgpt must undoubtedly appear to many of them as a labor-saving device, reducing time spent on unremunerated tasks such as essay writing so they can focus on waged labor and other pressing responsibilities such as care work. \[...\] quick fixes such as ai detectors will only make student-teacher relationships more adversarial, eroding the trust and goodwill that helps prevent students from plagiarizing in the first place. to stop ai plagiarism, we must reverse the trend toward both student and faculty precarity while creating a learning environment in which undergraduates value education as an intrinsic good. otherwise, artificial intelligence will soon render academic integrity and scholarly inquiry obsolete.""

1dh873a,18,2024-06-16,"Why I don't use the terms ""target,"" ""reach,"" or ""safety""—and why you probably shouldn't either",u/AppHelper,IntltoUSA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/1dh873a/why_i_dont_use_the_terms_target_reach_or/,"I’ve been advising international applicants and their families for nearly ten years, and in that time I've seen admissions go from very competitive to downright maddening. A desire by colleges to focus on qualitative, holistic admissions amidst a surge in applications—and a pandemic that disrupted critical educational progress and traditional metrics—makes admissions less predictable than ever. In my opinion, **the classification of colleges as “safeties,” “targets,” “reaches,” and “dream schools” is obsolete.** Here's why:

1. **The categories oversimplify a range of competitiveness and likelihood of admissions.** Even if you could determine the statistical probability of admission, any reasonable college list will have a range that is not neatly divided into three or four categories. Introducing more categories (“high target, “low target,” “far reach,” “super-dream,” etc.) just makes things more confusing.
2. **It wastes time.** When I started doing admissions counseling and used the traditional target/reach/safety system, I found myself discussing at length or even debating with parents, students, and Reddit users about what a particular school should be classified as. The much important question is whether to apply to a college or not. An overemphasis on personal classification is especially problematic when you’re trying to follow a rigid system like five or six of each category, 2/8/8/2 safety/target/reach/dream, or whatever. And this gets even worse when you introduce more categories. 
3. **The amount of work you have to put in to apply is not commensurate with the relative difficulty of admission.** If you focus on limiting or balancing the number of schools in each category, you may be passing up low-effort applications. Conversely, if you are applying to a lot of schools, you may end up overloading yourself with onerous applications for what you might consider “safety” or “reach” schools that are not worth the trade-off. 
4. **It creates expectations that usually differ from results.** Families are often confused when their kids get rejected or waitlisted by targets and safeties while getting into reach and dream schools, like when I had a student who got into multiple Ivies but didn’t get into their top major at Purdue (so it can't be ascribed to yield protection). With such results, it’s easy to assume the original classification was wrong. As a professional matter, this looks bad. Admissions have gotten much less predictable, so **I avoid prognosticating on the probability of admission to any particular school,** and **I rarely speculate on why a certain school made the decision that it did.** My purpose is to help families achieve their desired educational outcomes. My philosophy is “safety in numbers” without too much of a focus on individual fit. I don’t want to build up a school too much and then have students and parents disappointed if it doesn’t work out. This is not just a professional concern, but a good idea for mental health in an unpredictable process.  
5. **There's no agreed-upon definition of terms.** As admissions have become much more competitive, counselors have been urged to use the term “safety” only for schools that have a 100% acceptance rate for a student’s academic statistics. Nonetheless, many people (including, I think, most counselors) still use a more traditional definition for each. And for some students, such as **international applicants who need a lot of financial aid, there's no such thing as a safety, or usually even a target.** (Many of my early students were in this category, and a few still are today, which is probably a major reason I don’t use the traditional classification system.)

**My approach is to apply to a range of colleges that “makes sense.”** I use a data-driven method to identify potential colleges to apply to, but when finalizing a school list, it's more subjective. 

Here’s the process I use:

1. **I use a database** which I assemble from multiple sources including IPEDS, Common Data Sets, US News, College Scorecard, QS, Times Higher Education, crime databases, political maps, geographical information services, and insights from ChatGPT to filter and sort colleges based on **factors that are important to each family**, such as size, location, reputation, cost, gun violence, ethnic diversity, political climate, and religious environment.
2. Working together with the student and (usually) parents, **I create a “long list” with two categories: “definitely apply” and “maybe apply.”** The “definites” are usually a combination of schools the student/family is already interested in, data we encounter, and my own personal experience helping similar students with similar profiles and interests. **Rather than dividing schools into safeties, targets, and reaches, we assemble a list that makes sense as a whole** (subjectively) and ensures they will apply to an appropriate range of schools. The “maybes” may be more competitive, less competitive, or within the range of the “definites.” If I feel the “definites” already skew one way or the other, the “maybe” list may develop differently as a result—but that decision is largely qualitative, not quantitative. Colleges may end up on the “maybe” list because they’re a little too ambitious but the family wants the student to apply there; they’re very expensive and may not offer as good a value as less competitive options; they’re not as good of a fit as other schools of similar or lower competitiveness; there are a lot of supplemental essays and the opportunity cost and stress of applying would be high; I just don’t know enough to make a recommendation, or (usually) some combination of these factors. ChatGPT is very useful here to suggest schools we may not have thought of.
3. Using one or two examples from their “maybe” list, **I show my students how to research relevant information to see if a school might be a good fit**, for example navigating departmental websites, student activity group pages, and news articles. ChatGPT is very useful here once again to provide more details that may not be obvious, like involvement in industry conferences and commercial ventures (which colleges sometimes downplay). ChatGPT can come up with pros and cons to be researched further. I encourage my students to take notes and save bookmarks/screenshots during this process, which they can later use for their essays. I provide a spreadsheet with lots of data for the student and family to sort through themselves, already narrowed down to their definites, maybes, and a few others they were considering.
4. Once the student decides which schools they’re interested in applying to, **we discuss how strongly they feel and the pros and cons of applying to each one** (e.g. essay requirements, deadlines, and required materials such as video submissions). **We further classify the “maybes” into three categories: “add to list,” “apply if there’s time,” and “skip.”** We may have a rough target number of schools, but the length of the list is not as important as the total amount of work that has to be done. 
5. Sometimes, a student is asked or required to report their college list to a school counselor categorized by safety/target/reach/dream or similar system. In that case, I'll run through the list we’ve assembled, provide some quick suggestions, and **urge them not to obsess over it.** 

I know that this approach is unconventional. This system of iterating the selection process and narrowing down a list may involve more nuance and discussion than a typical safety/target/reach classification, but I find that **the discussion tends to focus on more substantial issues that will be helpful later in the application process.** 

I can't possibly know everything about every school, so I feel this strategy leverages my knowledge, experience, and the data I have access to while keeping the student and family in an active role. Because there's less of a sense of “sacrifice,” I think it also leads to the student and family being more satisfied with the college list.

I'm interested to read thoughts from parents, students, and other counselors.

I (26F) have been a SWE for over a year and it looks like I will be PIPed (a somewhat merciful firing) within the next 6 months. I am applying to jobs, but the tech market is currently abysmal especially for juniors so it's been taking a while. Unless some miracle happens, I will most likely be unable to get out of the PIP due to my skill issue.

Reasons for skill issue:
- I am dumb, shy, and slow (in general,  but also with special regards to programming). No way around it, it is what it is. Current company has high expectations which I cannot meet.
- In the words of my therapist, I have severe depression and social anxiety 😬 So that has been a major roadblock of mine
- Was a math major, decided to get MSCS at a cash cow to learn more about CS. The MS was useless and I ended up missing the tech boom. One of the biggest regrets of my life, but the damage has been done. Total student loan debt is 300,000 including parent plus loans.

I cannot see a way out of this hole I dug. My current plan is to apply to government jobs to pursue PSLF because I am not cut out for big tech and cannot pay down these loans otherwise. However, with tech layoffs happening, these government positions are becoming unicorns as everyone wants stability and good WLB. I also do not see a future for me in tech having to keep up with AI until the next new fad, or later on competing with AI for a job.

So, I have been oddly comforted by trying once again to pursue medicine. The amount of loans I will take on is enormous though, and my parents are getting old and will need me to take care of them financially in <5 years. I was hoping that I could be in residency within 5 years so I can contribute financially and also pursue PSLF. I have a year of savings if my mother loses her job as well (my dad does not work and they both do not have a retirement plan, I am the retirement plan 🥲).

What stopped me from applying right out of undergrad:

- GPA: I took the engineering version of premed reqs in the first 2 years of college because I was a math major. It was harder than it needed to be and this meant I had to leave all math upper divs to the last 2 years. Unfortunately, proof based math upper divs are an entirely different beast and I tanked my gpa to a 3.4 (downward trend bc senior year avg was 3.0). Q: Would I be able to leave out the irrelevant upper divs in BCPM? Things like calc, diff eq, lin alg, and discrete math I would definitely add but does abstract algebra need to be in there 🥴 Last I checked homomorphisms have nothing to do with medicine help 😭

- Low volunteer hours: 150 ish (some could count for shadowing). I got rejected by one of the better volunteer programs after interviewing with them 3 times... That was interesting and definitely made me think I wasn't ready for med school. They were definitely right though, it just hurt so much getting rejected by your fellow classmates and peers over and over again for a volunteering position 😭 I really put myself out there, but it isn't enough and I know I still have problems with stuttering, no eye contact, blanking out

- MCAT: Low 500s, expired now. Example of skill issue 🗿 no comment 

- Personal statement: I couldn't really formulate why I wanted to be a doctor, I just thought primary care specifically was neat since when I was little while being treated for a chronic condition, the doctors were so kind to me when I was a bit hysterical haha. I liked the applications that math and cs have in medicine too. Writing was a weak point of mine and so is cars 🫠 and chatgpt did not exist back then ffs 

- My mother got laid off from her job when I started undergrad (she has always been the sole breadwinner). When she still was unable to find a full time job in my 3rd year with the added stress of upper div math, my mental health tanked further and I checked out of all my premed responsibilities. I took a food service job to try to help  out my parents, but I was bad at that too and my parents didn't want me working at the time. 
She did not find a stable job until the middle of my MS, so it was hard for me to drop thousands on apps when we were struggling. We used a combo of gov assistance and money from a tutoring job of mine to pay rent for a year. I decided to go CS so I can make money as quickly as possible to help my family, but I could not predict so many layoffs and mf chatgpt coming for my neck in 2024 💀

Recent things: 
- MSCS gpa was 3.4, okay for CS bad for premed, also a downward trend bc again, hard classes at the end (operating systems made me sweat every day). Did literally nothing to help my gpa...
- Part time tutoring job for over 2 years (1000 hrs)
- Current SWE job (2000hrs) is a big player in the healthcare space, thinking I could leverage that somehow
- Was aiming to retake mcat end of Aug, seems too late to apply this cycle though 😭 I really do not want to wait one more year because my parents aren't getting any younger and im going to lose my job this year, but a lot hinges on this mcat score
- Clinical hours (150) are just the ones from undergrad, so if I need to wait one more year I was hoping to get a clinical job, my current job may prevent me from doing so though 🙃 ahaha I love this I love life live laugh love!!
- I did have research (250hrs) in undergrad for 2 years, no pubs, 2 posters, some competition entries
- rec letters: 1 good old one (i hope) from my PI, 2 mediocre old ones, hoping to get 1 new one from old boss (i think should be good)

Man, I am at the end of my rope here and don't know what to do anymore. I thought by now I would have things figured out but nothing is clear and I have been having dark thoughts every single day. When I study for the mcat though, I do feel a sense of hope which is nice. This was my dream since I was a child, I just hit so many roadblocks. I would like to chase my dream one more time though... If it doesn't work out, I truly gave it my best shot. I also can't really tell if this is my depression talking, trying to find a way out of the mess I've created for myself but ahaha!! Manic pixie dream and whatnot 💃

tl;dr I want to apply again to medical school at 26/27, I need people to talk some sense into me and tell me to say goodbye to medicine for good bc I can't seem to let it go",active,0
1dkydlw,4,2024-06-21,Gemini Advanced's large context window underwhelming?,u/pronuntiator,GoogleGeminiAI,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleGeminiAI/comments/1dkydlw/gemini_advanceds_large_context_window/,"I'm currently evaluating Gemini Advanced as an alternative to ChatGPT Plus. So far it's a mixed bag, better creative writing, but worse programming aid. One thing that drew me to it (besides being 1€ cheaper) is the large context window. I plan to use the LLM as a creative writing assistant, sharing both my notes and finished chapters as context. However, I feel like it is either not capable of processing all the information at once, or I'm doing something wrong.

I uploaded my previous novel (130k words) to Gemini and asked it to summarize the plot. The answer focuses a lot on the first few chapters, then jumps abruptly to the end. Asking it how the novel ends, it gets the final scene right, but also hallucinates other characters being there. And when it's asked to list the main characters, it weirdly leaves out one important one, but includes a minor one that only appears once. I also tried another story where it was dead set on claiming two side characters appearing in a brief flashback are the main stars.

So, am I really talking to the correct model (Pro 1.5?), and how does it work? From my limited understanding of LLMs, the neural net doesn't have input parameters scaling with the number of input tokens, but uses an attention mechanism to find relations. However, if I would visualize that attention based on the answers, it would look like large hotspots in a few places instead of many small ones. Or like a student who stopped reading after the first few chapters but had to write an essay due tomorrow, so they flipped through the pages and read the end.

Of course a fictional story where each chapter builds upon the previous ones is much harder to process for the model than a textbook teaching distinct concepts. But I find the output kind of... underwhelming, and only slightly better than what GPT-4o does (with RAG I guess).

Am I doing something wrong? What are your successful use cases for the large context window, and does it excel there? Any tips on how to prompt Gemini in this case?",active,6

I’ve had to code for all my data analysis, which I’ve struggled a lot with. I’ve attended classes in my masters and initial years of PhD.

Initially I thought that the learning curve for me to understand coding was just slow and as time passes by, I’d get better at understanding and writing it. I took the help of some friends and my PI to write code and also used chunks from the internet and modified to my own use. Over the last year or so, I started using ChatGPT to help me write code.
