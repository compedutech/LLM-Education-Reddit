1ifdsi0,338,2025-02-01,Rejected from UMD with a 2.1 GPA and 870 SAT… what more do they want??,u/broke_boy_jorge,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/1ifdsi0/rejected_from_umd_with_a_21_gpa_and_870_sat_what/,"I honestly don’t know what UMD is thinking anymore. I poured my blood, sweat, and tears into my high school career, and they had the audacity to reject me?? Like, excuse me, but last time I checked, college is supposed to be about learning. So what if I didn’t do that much of it in high school? Isn’t the whole point of college to, I don’t know, improve??

Let’s break this down:
	•	GPA: Okay, so a 2.1 isn’t great, but have you seen how hard school is these days? I showed up (most of the time), and that should count for something.
	•	SAT: 870 might not be Ivy League material, but let’s be honest—standardized tests are outdated anyway. You’re telling me UMD really thinks knowing how to do algebra without a calculator is a necessary life skill??
	•	Extracurriculars: I had so many activities. I played Call of Duty religiously, had a thriving TikTok account (500 followers, no big deal), and was an integral part of my school’s lunch table debate team (we had some heated arguments about if water is wet).
	•	Essays: I wrote a passionate, heartfelt essay about how UMD’s dining hall food looked kinda fire, and I even used ChatGPT to make sure my grammar was decent. What more do they want?

And let’s not forget: they accepted some kid from my school with a 3.9 GPA and a 1520 SAT. Yeah, okay, nerd, we get it—you studied. But did he ever grind in Warzone for 12 hours straight? Does he know the true struggle of trying to get through high school on 4 hours of sleep because he was up late watching MrBeast? Didn’t think so.

UMD seriously needs to reconsider what they’re looking for in a student. Because last time I checked, college should be about potential, not just numbers. Smh. I guess I’ll just take my talents to community college and bless them with my greatness. UMD’s loss.",active,425
1ihzbe1,26,2025-02-04,How do you handle obvious cheating that you can't prove?,u/Professor-Jackass,AskProfessors,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProfessors/comments/1ihzbe1/how_do_you_handle_obvious_cheating_that_you_cant/,"This is a bit of an off-my-chest journal entry kind of post but I am hoping for some advice as well.

I am currently teaching an introductory programming course that I have taught five other times in the past. In every section, without fail, there is one specific homework assignment in which 10 - 15% of the students turn in what I call ""the wacky solution."" The solution is *technically correct*, but it employs really bad techniques that no one in the field would ever teach, including me.

The first time I got this solution, I was absolutely bewildered, doubly so because more than one student came up with it. Then, I put the question text into ChatGPT and it provided a nearly identical implementation of the wacky solution. So, the students are obviously copy/pasting from ChatGPT and just submitting it as their own work, which is explicitly defined as cheating in both my syllabus and the school's academic integrity policy.

I'm looking at four submissions from my current students and about a dozen submissions from the past year that all implement the wacky solution. In every case, no two students have *exactly* identical submissions. If you know anything about programming, the subtle differences are in the comments, variable names, spacing, that kind of thing, but the ""sameness"" between submissions is obvious.

To me, and probably to other people who read and write code for a living, it's clear these solutions are ripped off from the same source, but I don't feel like there's enough proof to instigate an academic integrity incident. Even if there were sufficient evidence, I don't think I would want to; I am an adjunct teaching at a community college, so I don't feel like such a response is proportional.

Having said that, I am super annoyed at the blatant cheating. I don't really know why I feel so insulted about it to be honest. I feel like I'm a good teacher and I am always responsive to emails from students about the homework, but the fact that there is cheating so often makes me question how good I really am.

Today, I showed an example of the wacky solution and then typed the question into ChatGPT and watched it generate the same exact thing four different students turned in. I told them this is considered cheating and I would be within my rights to fail them from the course. I did go through and explain what was wacky about it and why I bothered to investigate this solution in the first place. I was grumpy today and went through lecture pretty quick, dismissing them early. I'm a little embarrassed at how I acted in class today and I want to get a handle on how I'm feeling about this.

Can anyone relate? Any general tips or advice?",active,31

Feel free to delete if it does.

I'm an active sufferer of a certain disease and read a book back in 2021 on the subject after I was laid off and couldnt find work after covid.

I've gone back to school for a nursing degree and currently writing a paper on said condition. I remembered the contents of the book enough to write a vauge summary. I remembered it had the name of the condition but couldnt remember if it had any subtitles and couldnt remember the cover/exact year but did find the book properly today...ha 🤦🏽‍♀️) anyway, my dumb idiotic boomer self thought ""Hey everyone praises chatgpt as being super thorough, let me use it to find the book."" Everything else revolving the content of the book was summarized in my own words. I didn't use chatgpt for anything more than attempting to get the source, and yes I completely forgot to include page numbers, they didnt even enter my mind. I am TIRED. Insomnia.)  but idiotically I didnt double check to figure out if it was the correct book.

Long story short I gave it more faith than I should have, and it generated a bogus source that seemed familiar...of course it seemed familiar, the title was partly correct to the book and the authors were from peer reviewed articles I had scanned by and considered when using my school's database but skipped over because I really wanted to vary up my source types and include that book since I wouldnt have to go through and skim another book.

I caught the error but only after I submitted to turnitin. I realized the grave error and opted instead to quickly google scholar a quote I could use from a peer reviewed article and replaced it and resubmitted, but ultimately it ended up being 10 minutes late after deadline.

Whats the damage done here? Should I bring it up with my professor and let her know it was a lapse of poor judgement? Let the assignment ride considering I changed it to an appropriate properly sourced alternative in an updated resubmitted version?

I'll stress again that it was all 100% my own work in writing the assignment (I can prove this with timestamped document on googledocs) as its a personally relevant topic I'm passionate about, it was just the one source I absolutely screwed up with and I can own up to that. I got lazy, put too much faith in the capabilities of chatgpt and then also failed to double check sources and I am literally never doing that again. All other 5 sources in my paper are from my school's database. Peer reviewed. And most of all, real. (Gah. I'm such an idiot.)

Anyway, mainly looking for guidance on how you would want a student to approach this situation. My teacher is such a great person and I feel genuinely awful about the situation and so disappointed in myself, but also terrified that a single lapse could mess up my life as I attempted to better it after covid.",active,0

The revolution, it seems, is having some collateral damage.

**Automation Apocalypse: Fact or Fiction?**
Grab your tin foil hats, folks. Automation is the latest villain in the workplace saga. From city-sweeping chatbots to AI scheduling systems, it seems no job is sacred. Habib El Kettani of Solidaires Informatique laments ChatGPT's rise as the final torchbearer burning his IT career to the ground. It's like watching Skynet in a more sophisticated, less cyborg-y form. But here’s the kicker: AI isn’t just upgrading tasks; it’s leaving old professions behind in record time.

Move over, calculators. Today's educators are grappling with something way more insidious. Stephanie de Vanssay, from the UNSA, paints a picture that could make any teacher cringe: students relying on AI tools could spell doom for critical thinking skills.

Before you down vote me we got rid of our attendance=failure policy and the majority of these students just don't come to class especially first hour(I had two on my roster that showed up to fewer than 3 classes). 



I really want to pass more students. We have a study hall where they can get help from me twice a week. They can redo assignments for full credit if they mess up. They can retake quizzes as many times as they want. They can use notes on all their assessments. Lectures are kept to a minimum and we do a lot of inquiry based real world case studies with guided discovery and hands on activities.



Today we had an all staff meeting with a big focus on supporting students and getting them to passing. My administration is really pushing that I chase students down and get them caught up but I feel that students should be responsible on some level to at least ask for help. A lot of my colleagues do assignments with students/go over all the answers with them and let them do test redemption if they fail. I went home feeling kinda confused I don't think my expectations are unreasonable but I do fail the most students so obviously I need to change something. Maybe I was acting more like a college professor and less like a highschool teacher dealing with brains that have not fully developed.



Like my students I pulled out chatgpt and asked it how to be a better teacher. I had it give examples of what was developmentally appropriate for a 15 year old and what was above/below with examples of classroom applications. 10/10 would recomend as it was very helpful. I did also look up real articles about developmental expectations. Anyway I realized a lot of what l am being asked to do is not at all developmentally apropriate and a lot of the practices I see are what is recommended for 5th grade......I see this come up a lot in elementary/kindergarten in regards to potty training but l didn't realize how wrong I was about what was developmentally appropriate for highschoolers. Maybe I will print some of these articles out the next time admin asks me to accept an assignment that is 3 weeks past due. I am also curious if the developmental guidelines will be significantly changed in the next 5 years to match what is happening in the real world.

1inecso,1,2025-02-11,"Stop Debugging, Start Defending: The Military Wants CS Majors",u/Throwaway921845,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1inecso/stop_debugging_start_defending_the_military_wants/,"Alright, listen up. If you're a computer science major grinding through endless algorithms, debugging code at 3 AM, and questioning whether you even like programming anymore—I've got an alternative for you. You don’t have to be another faceless software engineer churning out CRUD apps for a corporation that sees you as a disposable asset. Instead, you could be on the cutting edge of cyber warfare, securing national defense networks, operating with elite teams, and making a real impact.

Drop out of computer science and join the United States military.

Sounds crazy? Maybe. But hear me out.

### 1. **You’ll Be Working on the Real Future of Technology**
Sure, you can spend the next few years sitting in a classroom learning about theoretical models that will be obsolete before you graduate. Or, you can be in a classified environment, working directly on cyber defense, ethical hacking, cryptography, and network warfare—all on the government’s dime.

Cybersecurity is no joke. State-sponsored hacking, cyber terrorism, and digital warfare are some of the biggest threats today. The military is investing heavily in cyber warfare, and they need sharp, technically-minded people to lead the charge. Instead of writing another e-commerce site, you could be preventing real-world cyber threats and stopping attacks before they happen.

### 2. **Skip the Student Debt, Get Paid to Learn**
A CS degree is expensive. Tens of thousands in student loans, years of stress, and by the time you graduate, you might realize you don’t even love the industry. The military flips that equation on its head: you get paid while you train, you earn benefits, and if you still want a degree later, the GI Bill will cover it. No debt, no stress, just real-world experience.

### 3. **Hands-On Experience Beats Sitting in a Lecture Hall**
Let’s be real—most CS majors spend years in school before they even get their hands on something meaningful. The military throws you into real-world tech work from day one. Want to learn ethical hacking? Cyber defense? Encryption? It’s all part of the job. You’ll get hands-on experience that makes civilian tech jobs look like a joke.

And if you think the military is just about carrying a rifle in the desert, think again. The modern military is built around technology. From cyber command units to advanced AI and machine learning, the armed forces are leading the way in tech innovation. You’ll be working with high-stakes, cutting-edge systems that actually matter.

### 4. **Your Resume Will Be Unstoppable**
Think about it. What looks better on a resume: a generic CS degree, or four years of real-world experience in military cyber operations, ethical hacking, and securing critical infrastructure? When you do eventually decide to go civilian, companies will be lining up to hire you. The military doesn’t just teach you how to code—it teaches leadership, discipline, and problem-solving under pressure. These are skills that make you stand out in any field.

### 5. **You’ll Be Part of Something Bigger**
Let’s face it, sitting behind a desk pushing updates for another ad-serving algorithm is soul-crushing. In the military, your work has real consequences. You’re defending national security, stopping cyberattacks, and working with a team that actually has a mission beyond maximizing shareholder profits. You’ll form bonds with teammates that last a lifetime, and you’ll know that what you’re doing matters.

### 6. **The Benefits Are Unmatched**
Forget corporate perks like free snacks and ping-pong tables. The military gives you real benefits: full healthcare, housing allowances, retirement plans, and job security that tech layoffs can’t touch. Plus, when you eventually transition back to civilian life, you’ll have access to veteran hiring programs that give you an edge over every other CS grad drowning in job applications.

### 7. **Adventure, Not Just a Desk Job**
Want to travel? Want to do more than just sit in a cubicle? The military offers opportunities you won’t find anywhere else. Deployments, international training exercises, and experiences that take you beyond the typical 9-to-5 office grind.

### **Still Think You Need a Degree?**
Here’s the truth: Most of what you learn in a CS degree can be self-taught or learned on the job. Tech is a field where experience outweighs credentials. And in the military, you’ll get the kind of experience that makes degrees irrelevant. Some of the best hackers, engineers, and cybersecurity experts in the world never stepped foot in a traditional classroom. You don’t need a piece of paper—you need real skills and experience.

### **Final Thought**
So here’s the choice: Keep pushing through school, racking up debt, and hoping for a cushy tech job that might be automated in a decade. Or, take the leap, drop out, and join the military, where you’ll gain elite skills, make real-world impact, and set yourself up for a future that’s far more exciting than debugging someone else’s bad code.

The choice is yours. But if you’re tired of the grind and want something more, maybe it’s time to think outside the box.

Join up. Serve with purpose. And let the rest of them chase their corporate dreams while you make a real difference.

Over the years, I’ve struggled with a lot: a difficult parental divorce, emotional and financial abuse, coming out as queer, mental health challenges, and significant life setbacks. It feels like I’ve been surviving for the last 15 years, not thriving.

At 18, I attended a great college, aiming for a career in biology—maybe as a doctor, veterinarian, or geneticist. But I fell into a deep depression, missed semesters, and wasted a lot of potential. I dropped out after three years, still saddled with student loans, and moved to NYC to pursue a dream. I worked at a PR firm for a year and a half, but the toxic environment burned me out. I moved home, tried community college, and developed a weed addiction that derailed my goals.

I briefly studied music, almost completed an associate’s degree, then moved to NYC again for a high-paying job at a recruiting agency. I earned a good salary ($90k in my first year) but burned out again and was laid off. I moved home again, worked in restaurants, and eventually got a steady office job. It’s fine, but the pay is low. I’m facing the possibility of moving home again to pay down my $16k in personal debt (credit cards and Sallie Mae loans), and once again try to rebuild. But I’m terrified of failing again.

I know I’m not dumb—I feel like I’ve wasted my potential. The curious, driven person I used to be still wants to learn and help others, but it feels impossible to get back on track.

Some positive steps I’ve made recently: I’m a year sober from alcohol, four months sober from weed, and I’ve been working out regularly (lost 30lbs and gained some muscle). But I still feel lost when it comes to my larger life path.

I’m interested in a lot of things: singing, plants/gardening, animals, protecting the environment, biology, mythology/spirituality, reading. I want a meaningful career that aligns with my values and gives me financial stability. Ultimately, I dream of having a house, a garden, maybe doing sustainable farming, and being part of a good community. But all of that feels far off, especially given my financial situation.

My mom thinks I should return to school and pursue environmental science, which I do think I’d enjoy. But I fear wasting more time and money, especially since I’ve already struggled with education in the past.

So, my questions are:

1. How can I get on a path to stability and meaningful work *now*, while also planning for a long-term vocational path?
2. What are immediate steps I can take to begin earning money and tackling my debt without feeling overwhelmed?
3. How do I stop my brain from rebelling against my best intentions and get myself to take consistent action?
4. How can I tap into the skills and experiences I’ve already developed—like my communication skills, music background, gardening experience, and love for animals—while building toward financial stability and a fulfilling career?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I’m happy to answer any clarifying questions!

I could not possibly be more upset with the school. I am working a full time job, related to my field, with great pay. I am incredibly lucky to have found this job, no thanks at all to WaterlooWorks. Unfortunately, this job was denied for a co-op credit due to a failed policy 70 petition.
Those of us in the co-op program spend nearly $1000 per year extra to experience the “top co-op school in the country”, and they give us a site that looks like it hasn’t been updated since 1994, with no help whatsoever. I have been clawing myself through the job application process with the university actively shutting me down, including instances like:
Cancelling one of my two interviews,
Telling me to “check WaterlooWorks” whenever something was wrong,
Pawning me off to an advisor who had to play therapist when all I had to say to them was “I don’t have a job yet, and I’m frustrated”,
Making me write 17 pages of a technical report in my limited free time after my FULL TIME JOB,
And now this very upsetting news, THAT I DIDN’T EVEN KNOW WAS POSSIBLE, that my job was denied for a credit.
I am appalled that the university thinks that our $1000 should go towards useless courses like PD, teachers who don’t care enough to write non-ai emails, and a site that witnessed Y2K. I could design my own co-op program, and it would still suck less time out of my day than PD11. 
I am sick and tired of this school using my success for their credit. I got a job despite the co-op program. Not because of it. They tote that they have the best research co-op programs, and won’t even tell me how to connect with professors. 
My money is being wasted on this program. If you’re model for the “best co-op program in Canada” is to drop the students in the job field with no experience, no connections, no resources, no way to ask for help, and no information, while throwing everything you have at them to make them fail, YOU DO NOT HAVE THE BEST CO-OP PROGRAM WITHIN A SQUARE KILOMETRE OF YOUR CAMPUS, LET ALONE CANADA. 
It is pathetic that this school cares so little about their students, and then claims their success as their own. Utterly pathetic. It is humiliating to know that I will be working 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, just to see “unemployed term” on my report. I did EVERYTHING FOR THEM, and it still wasn’t enough. 
I’m not even going to mention the abysmal teaching efforts in second-year. Maybe this school should employ people who didn’t graduate on chatgpt.

What do you all think? Should schools fully integrate AI into education, or is this the beginning of the end for independent thinking?

What can I do to resolve this?",u/ToomintheEllimist,teaching,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/1isgl87/college_student_argues_with_every_single_grade/,"I teach college.  One student, whom I'll call X, argues with me incessantly about grades, to the point where I'm giving her huge amounts of mental bandwidth and I'm starting to suspect she spends more time arguing about grades than doing work.

I grade all assignments blind, and give extensive feedback on every one.  Nonetheless, X emails me every time she loses any point on any assignment to demand to know what I was thinking.  When I write back and explain again how her response differs from the rubric, she (I suspect from the wording) puts the emails into ChatGPT and has it come up with explanations of how *if you really think about it*, 1 + 1 = 3 and therefore her answer was right and my feedback that it's 2 is wrong.  This will go on for multiple emails, every damn time, until I finally say something like ""my decision is final, and I believe I have made it clear why; this doesn't warrant further discussion"" and stop answering her.

On a recent quiz, X earned a grade of 7/10.  She spent over 30 minutes in my office arguing that those 3 items were badly worded and she deserved credit back, even after I explained (using the textbook) why the correct answers were correct and hers were not.  X missed an assignment the following week, and when I followed my own policy on deducing 10% per day of lateness, she stayed after class to shout at me and call me a ""jerk"" for not recognizing that she was late because she had work for a different class and it was ""demoralizing"" to have a B on the assignment.

Y'all.  I have 68 other students.  How the hell do I get X's demands on my time to a manageable level, to give those other 68 the amount of attention they deserve?",active,1771

One of my students clearly used it, and I asked him where he got his work from. He looked me dead in the eyes and said, “I thought we could copy and paste from these websites.”

Part of the situation is that teachers are showing kids how to use ChatGPT, as an attempt to show them how to use it effectively. But in my room, which relies on writing, the constant use has become staggering.

Yes, my essay prompts are specific enough that ChatGPT will spit out an ineffective essay. But explaining to each kid who uses it that they can’t, following up with parents if necessary, and constantly checking the version history on Google docs adds up to a lot of time wasted.

Any helpful suggestions?

(This is just micro level, by the way. Macro level, I found myself questioning why we are even teaching writing. If adults are using ChatGPT as shortcuts with their work, what’s the point? Someone hand me an apple and let me retire.)

1iuogr0,3,2025-02-21,Dealing with students that can't learn new topics?,u/Some-Dog5000,TutorsHelpingTutors,https://www.reddit.com/r/TutorsHelpingTutors/comments/1iuogr0/dealing_with_students_that_cant_learn_new_topics/,"TL;DR: Tutoring student seems incapable of learning new concepts for her creative course, how do I tweak my teaching methods for her?

\---

I've had a web development/graphic design student for a year now, in her late-twenties who wants to career-shift. She's getting tutoring lessons from me to supplement her classes in university. Bless her heart, but... she **really** does seem to not be learning anything. Not only that, she seems *incapable*, or at least she's finding it very hard, to learn new topics.

Quick background. Her family's pretty well-off, I think. She graduated her first degree in 2017, after 6 years in college, and it seems like she never actually got a job after that? Then part of their family emigrated, she's trying to career-shift so she can get an actual job that's not just in retail.

I think partially because of her upbringing she seems just plainly incapable of coming up with new thoughts or following even slightly complicated instructions.

* Everything seems to just go into one ear and out the other for her. She seems to struggle very very hard with making new connections in her brain - seeing patterns, matching the concepts she learned, mixing up and merging together what she learned to create new things. It really does feel like she cruised through the entirety of her schooling because these seem to be things you learn in elementary.
* She is very, very, very afraid of messing up. Web development is one of those things where you need to experiment to see what happens, and she just... doesn't do that. She likes it when you tell her exactly what you need to do to complete an assignment.
* Related to this, she doesn't seem to have the capacity to improvise - getting something I want to do, relating it to something I already know, and then seeing if that works. She has to do things exactly or very similarly to what her instructors do. So most of her projects are just slight extensions of her instructor's examples.
* She has a very difficult time wording out what she wants. It's also one of the reasons why she struggles so much. She struggles with English. We share a native language, but she struggles with her native language too. She also doesn't seem to have any reading comprehension.
* When she messes up, she has no idea how to actually figure out where she messed up. Instead of figuring it out for herself for a bit, the instant something goes wrong she panics and asks me for help. She can't comprehend error messages, or even how ChatGPT explains those error messages.
* When following instructions from me or from a video, she frequently doesn't actually follow me or the video. She does something slightly different from what I or the video did. She only gets it correct after four or five times of repeating the instruction. (It's very tiring!) If you leave her without supervision for a bit to just follow some very clear instructions from a video, you'll find that she messed something up and doesn't know how to recover from the mess-up. 
* For someone who wants to get into computers, she doesn't actually understand how they work most of the time. She's the type to upload a submission and then download it again to make sure that it uploaded correctly. She struggles a lot with the notion of files and folders (her desktop is extremely messy). She has very poor attention to detail - it takes her more than half a minute to a minute trying to find a button I tell her to click, for example.

She does really have the grit to go through the course, at least, and she's good at tests and stuff where you have to memorize the answers. From what I see she is good at things like cooking for herself and following recipes. But when doing something where you actually need to be creative she really struggles. I've tried to teach her ways on how to actually think and problem-solve and study and form connections, but at this point I feel like problem solving is something that she never really learned. I feel like she'd only learn by just doing a billion drills on web development, but then that's practically just memorization again...

(Based on an experience recently)

So, I am a RA for a Deep Learning course taught at a TU9 university and the amount of Indian students (there are others too but I'm talking about the majority, out of 90 students pursuing the course 30 something are from India and I had to report 17 plagiarism cases) use chatgpt or some LLM to get their codes. Its blatantly obvious that they use chatgpt as the variable names, how they replace the classification head or even the architecture of a model that they build is word for word the same. Although, I do not like to apply plagiarisms but if I don't then I'm not fulfilling my responsibility. Moreover, they think that I should favoe them which in my opinion just shows what kind of a student you are.

So if you are pursuing a course in Germany then ask yourself, can you write logistic regression from scratch without the use of sklearn? Do you understand what bias-variance tradeoff is? Can you write a neural network's backprop without using .propogate? If yes, then think about coming here if not, my recommendation is get your foundations right first by working wherever you are residing and studying.

AI is not easy. It is not for everyone. It is not coding. It is math. It's all math. In order to be competitive in this field, you must have the self-motivation to catch up with the super fast AI field. Your university mods will only teach you the basics (including the Bellman equation above, yes it's **very basic**).

my main point is that it feels meaninlgess to attend my classes when all of my teachers assign the work online and you physically have no reason to show up to the class besides some number for attendance in a grade book ive recently missed around 30 classes this quarter and yet im still passing all my classes beause showing up has no corelation to your grade in my school my next class weight training automatically gives you a 65 even if you decide to not show up which is automatically passing (60 passing) regardless if you come or not so literally what is the point my other 2 classes the teachers just talk about their subjects and tell us to pull our laptops and start working when i can do the exact same thing from the comfort of my room

also a bit off topic but i also feel like a large majority of people in my school are able to attend classes show up but often lack things like free thinking common sense and rational thinking when i decide to sit in my science class and listen to the people talk around me how they present themselves and what they wear everyday i just see many holes in their thinking and conversations i hear the most stupid things come out of some high school students mouths that makes me wonder if they even have the capacity to think for themselves i recently discovered that only around 10-15% of people only truly have self awareness and im starting to see this more and more in my everyday life and especially when i surround myself with people from school i start to edge into that mindset of not thinking and blindly following things that may be stupid to do a reason for this may be drug influence in high school because there hasnt been one time i walked into the bathroom and not recognized a kid vaping in the stall next to me

But I  figured it's better now or never in case I kms randomly and never tell anyone anything







im 16f and I feel like I've already fucked up my life so bad I can't fix it anymore. I'm not trying to be like an emo kid who just hates the world and wants to die after any minor inconvenience but I've tried to push through with life for the last three years and I'm still stuck at the same spot. I used to be academically gifted until 5-6th grade and I came from a well off family. My dad suffered a heart attack when I was in 6th but fortunately he survived or maybe unfortunately he survived because although he's a great dad he's not a good husband and there's always gonna be some part of me that's gonna hate him for the way he treats my mom. I don't wish anything bad upon him but my familys financial issue would be so much better without him. I really don't wanna think of it this way but it's true. He spends his dads, my grandfathers money on stupid shit even tho my grandad who's a lawyer is the only person earning money in this family. Like does my dad not give two shits about saving money for my college and education in life? Things at home spiralled. My academics did too. kids started bullying me at school going ""oh when you were younger you just crammed shit but now we're in higher classes and you don't get good marks because you're actually dumb and can only cram"" I luckily have a good circle of friends at school so they helped me through the bullying but it fucking sucks when a teacher is grading my paper and she/he recognizes my face from the toppers board a few yrs back and they ask me what happened and why I don't study like I used to anymore. I let myself go physically too I'm medically obese and I've literally tried my best to loose the weight, consulting dietitians online, cardio everyday for 15 minutes since March of 2023. It didn't work out, I only lost 10-12kgs and my relationship with food isn't the best now. I'm an only child on top of this so like all of my familys hopes and expectations only have one shot which is me. Everytime I think of suicide I can't even do that thinking of the guilt I'll leave and that my familys bloodline would literally end w me since I have no siblings. Deep down ik I won't even kill myself over this shit like I'm still young and can fix stuff but there's a saturation point to trying and I think I've reached it and can't do anything more. I would push through but the issue I have rn is that I have important exams right now which give you a certificate which is needed for stuff like college applications, drivers license and everything. I used to study well despite having an academic downfall but this time I'm too tired to even study. I tried pulling all nighters on gap days to study but I end up fainting. I have total of 10 exams out of which I've given 2 so far which went pretty good but next is maths which I'm scared about. One of my uncle owns a college nearby where his kid, who's the same age as me is also studying and my parents intend to shift me there next yr. If I get bad grades in these current exams it would go on the certificate which I have to send to my uncles college to get admission. The thing isn't abt being accepted because either way my uncle would accept me to his college since our families are close but I'm scared of the judgement from that side of the family. His kid is your average trying too student who excells in every field outside academics. My parents never pushed me to do anything like sports so all I had was studying and I'm failing at that too now. In my country the certificate from these exams is considered as ""first step of life"" and shit and adults say if you fuck this up you're kinda done for. I'm an above average kid and I could get good enough marks but i want something more than just ""good enough"" I had this realization 3-4 months back that mentally I'm still 13 and that scared the living shit out of me idk probably because I have a really bad ego complex thinking I'm better than everyone and the realization of I might not be living up to the standards of how I perceive myself scare me. I really don't wanna think this way but I can't help it. I go into exams sometimes with zero preparation thinking ""well everyone else is stupid I'll do good"" just for me to get above average marks. Ik this is a stupid way of thinking and I've done cringe shit like asking chatgpt how to not think of others this way but nothing helps. My dad's sister isn't better either. She asks my grandfather (btw he's almost 70 and a lawyer for 30+ yrs who's supporting grandma, me, mom, and dad) for 500 usd each month to support her and her kid. She divorced her husband because she cheated on him and now she's bothering my old grandfather about money. My grandfather owns a few plots so he gave one of his apartments to my dad's sister. The plot was meant for me to inherit when I'm older. but it went to that cheating lying hoe and it makes me so fucking mad. She's 34 she can very well work a job and support her child. She has a fucking phd. And she chooses to ask her dad who's supporting a family of 5 for money? I'm scared my dad and his sister are gonna drain out my grandfather of money he's saved up for me and by the time I'm older I won't have anything. I don't wanna be selfish wanting everything to myself but I was always promised as a child and taken to various houses and apartments and told ""this is gonna be yours when you're older"" So seeing those plots go to family members like my dad's sister is just heart breaking and makes me mad. I may not be right in this situation but I think im allowed to be a little disappointed with how adults in my family act. This whole thing has literally been rants of different problems in my life and maybe, most definitely in the greater scheme of things all of this is insignificant. but it pains me that I didn't enjoy my teenage years the way I always wanted to or dreamed off as a kid, it might sound childish but I'll never be able to fulfill my childhood dream of being a youtuber and do all the unique video ideas I came up with that ik would rack up millions of views. I won't ever get to be one of those teen influencers because I'm not that pretty. Like I don't mean this in a pick me way but the way our society is set up looks are literally everything. Sure they don't mean shit when you wanna be friends w someone or make a closer relation but in social media it is everything. People get famous just from posting a million thirst traps and make money off of it which kinda makes me wish I was just prettier so I had some leverage on myself and could do something else like influencing if I don't end up becoming a neurosurgeon like I planned. 

as I said before, I know my problems are pretty insignificant and people will say it gets worse when you're actually an adult but the weight of my problems right now is really making it hard to just ""push through"" Life. I went into this year thinking ""if I'm gonna kms anyways I might as well give life my best try and see where I end up"" But I feel more hopeless day by day seeing my familys financial status go down and with every maths sum I get wrong something inside me dies a bit knowing education might be my only way out and I'm not exceeding at that either.",User_deleted,4
1izbz7v,237,2025-02-27,ChatGPT is now my best student...,u/Empty-Bodybuilder-62,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1izbz7v/chatgpt_is_now_my_best_student/,"You ever feel like you’re just grading ChatGPT all day? Like, I sit down with a stack of papers, and every single one has that weirdly polished-but-dead-inside vibe. Like if an alien tried to write an essay after watching a YouTube tutorial called How Humans Think.

And I know they’re using it. I know. But can I prove it? Nope. Because students aren’t that dumb. Imagine wishing your students were just a bit dumber so that you could prove what you know to be true. They don’t just copy-paste. They tweak it juuust enough to make it plausible. Maybe they delete a few commas. Maybe they add a “however” somewhere it doesn’t belong. Maybe they sprinkle in a dumb mistake to make it seem real.

And even when I catch them red-handed—like, I literally have their ChatGPT prompt that they accidentally upload to LMS—our board of examiners is like, “Well, just because they asked ChatGPT for super detailed instructions on how to write a report doesn’t mean they copied it.” Sure, okay. And finding a blueprint for a bank vault in someone's backpack doesn’t mean they were gonna rob it.

Give me a paint-by-numbers; I want to become an artist!

At this point, I’m not even mad. I’m impressed. The real learning happening here is not in the essays—it’s in the bullshitting. These kids are getting PhDs in plausible deniability.

Meanwhile, written assignments? Yeah, those are dead. Gone. Buried. Along with, you know, learning how to write, think, and process information like a human being. But hey, at least they’ll leave college with the valuable life skill of how to sound just smart enough to not get caught.

So yeah. ChatGPT is my best student now. It hands in perfect work, never complains, and never asks for an extension. And the worst part? I think I like it better.",active,296
1izddw9,447,2025-02-27,SC2207 Blatant Cheating in Graded Quiz,u/Ore10,NTU,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1izddw9/sc2207_blatant_cheating_in_graded_quiz/,"# Background

On 27/02/2025, a closed book quiz was held in LT1A and LT2A for the CCDS mod: SC2207 Intro to Database Systems. Unfortunately, the way this quiz was conducted made it extremely easy for students to cheat, and it appears that many did. Various anecdotes were shared describing how students **BLATANTLY** used ChatGPT, referred to notes, and even discussed amongst themselves.

# Issues with the Quiz:

* **No lockdown browser:** Despite being a closed-book quiz, there were no restrictions to prevent students from using external resources, including ChatGPT.
* **No attendance taken:** Student attendance in the LTs were not taken at all. Some students, seeing this, walked out of the LTs for a more convenient venue to take the quiz.
* **Quiz password released on NTULearn announcements**: This literally just facilitates students to do this quiz not in the venue.
* **Low-quality invigilation:** Very large number of students compared to the number of invigilators. In LT2A specifically, invigilators came in around 5 to 10 minutes after the quiz has started.
* Grading tied to the highest student score:
   * The prof explicitly stated that students were not meant to finish the quiz. Thus, he would base his grading off of the highest student score.
   * The average student score ranges from 250 to 320
   * Yet, many ChatGPT cheaters have scored around 380-390 / 400. This make the impact of cheating even worse - those who did not cheat have to contend with a cheater skewed grading scale.

# Misdirected blame?

Of course, the primary blame falls on the students who knowingly cheated. However, we cannot overlook that the complete lack of basic standard cheating deterrence for the SC2207 quiz that contributed greatly to the widespread cheating. Given the ease of cheating, it is unacceptable for this to be the standard of an official graded assessment.

# What needs to change?

These issues must be addressed in future assessments. We urge CCDS to consider establishing policies that mandates basic anti-cheating, and fair grading measures for **all graded assessments**:

* Lockdown Browser: This is standard practice to deter cheating.
* Only release Quiz password in the physical venue itself.
* More spacious venues: Proper seating arrangements with sufficient space between students
* Mandatory attendance taking for in person assessments: student matric cards / digital passes should be checked against for scores to be valid
* Invigilation: Invigilators should at the very least be present **on time** and enforce quiz rules strictly.

# Immediate Remedial Actions:

Due to the widespread cheating, the academic integrity of the quiz is severely compromised. As such, we believe that the best course of action for the SC2207 prof is to **VOID THE QUIZ RESULTS**, or **AWARD EVERYONE WITH FULL CREDIT**. Additionally, **investigation should be launched against the cheaters,** and it should be done as thoroughly as possible.

# Remarks:

This is yet another incident that highlights CCDS's lack of commitment to academic integrity, fair grading, and credibility of CCDS assessments (SC2001 for instance IFKYK). **We hope CCDS will do better** **~~in the future~~** **starting immediately.**",active,525
1iziluc,2,2025-02-27,"I Feel Stuck, Frustrated, and Hopeless About My Future",u/zeldron_07,OffMyChestIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestIndia/comments/1iziluc/i_feel_stuck_frustrated_and_hopeless_about_my/,"

I’m a 20-year-old computer science student in India, and honestly, I feel completely trapped in my current situation. Every single day feels like a struggle, and I just need to vent because I don’t have close friends to talk to about this.

My College Feels Like a Prison

The college I’m attending is one of the worst decisions I’ve ever made. The management enforces strict, unreasonable rules that do nothing but make life harder for students. If you're late, even by a minute, they confiscate your ID card. If you try to speak up against their policies, they threaten to revoke your placement opportunities. The teachers? Most of them don’t even have proper subject knowledge. The labs? Outdated and barely functional.

They expect us to be obedient robots, following pointless rules while getting almost no real learning experience. I joined hoping to gain skills and a good future, but now I realize that my college doesn’t care about that. They only care about discipline and control, not actual education.

I’m Falling Behind in Skills and Scared for My Future

The job market is brutal right now, and I feel completely unprepared. My college doesn’t help us learn real-world skills, so I’ve been trying to self-learn through YouTube and ChatGPT. But the problem is, I don’t have much free time.

My college schedule is from 9:00 AM to 4:30 PM, and by the time I get back, I’m mentally exhausted. I want to learn DSA, the MERN stack, and some DevOps to improve my chances, but there’s just not enough time. Campus placements start in August 2025, and I feel like I won’t be ready.


I keep reading about how competition in India is getting worse, and seeing so many graduates struggle to get jobs makes my anxiety worse. Every day, I wonder: Am I even on the right path? Will I end up unemployed like so many others?

My Living Conditions Are Miserable

To make things worse, my living conditions are horrible. I stay in a PG (paying guest accommodation) with two other roommates, and I absolutely hate it. There’s no privacy, no peace, and I constantly feel irritated by the lack of personal space.

And the food? It’s awful. I’ve completely lost interest in eating because the food they provide is barely edible. This has pushed me into eating junk food regularly, which I know is unhealthy, but I have no other option. I feel physically drained most of the time because of this.

My Social Life Is Non-Existent

I’ve always been a shy person, and I lack social skills. Making friends has never been easy for me, and now in college, it feels impossible. I don’t have anyone I can truly open up to. It’s not like I hate people—I just don’t know how to connect.

On top of that, I’ve never been in a relationship, which sometimes makes me feel even worse. I know relationships aren’t everything, but seeing others experience companionship while I struggle to even make friends makes me feel even lonelier. And yes, I feel insecure about my height (5'3""), which doesn’t help my confidence at all.

Maturity Has Made Everything Feel Worse

As a kid, I believed that working hard in school would lead to a good future. But now, the more I understand the world, the more depressed I feel. The real world is harsh, and I’ve realized that merit alone isn’t enough—connections, money, and luck play a huge role too.

I used to think that gaining clarity in life would help me, but instead, it has made everything feel pointless. Is all this struggle even worth it? Or will I just end up as another person stuck in a dead-end job, regretting everything?

I Feel Trapped in a Cycle That’s Killing Me Inside

Every day feels like the same depressing routine:

Wake up, go to college, attend useless classes, come back exhausted.

Try to study and upskill, but fail due to mental burnout.

Eat bad food, deal with my miserable living conditions, and sleep feeling hopeless.


I don’t know how long I can keep doing this. I want to break out of this cycle, but I don’t see an escape.

I just needed to get this off my chest. If you’ve read this far, thank you. I don’t know what I’m expecting from this post—maybe just some reassurance that I’m not alone in feeling like this.
