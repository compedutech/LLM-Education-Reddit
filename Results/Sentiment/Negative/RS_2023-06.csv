I'm a teacher  (temporarily) and it absolutely baffles me that AI companies *know* their tech is being used for cheating, yet they do nothing about it. 

A cousin of mine who is in high school was just caught using ChatGPT to write two of his final assignments, one of which was for an AP class. He got a zero on both his finals as a result. He has been struggling for the past year or so with complete apathy regarding school, life, etc, and he has discovered that ChatGPT is the answer to all his troubles. He never has to learn anything or try anymore with a tool like this available. Why do tech companies allow users to do this? The *vast* majority of people who say ""write me an essay about ____"" do not have good intentions, so why not disable the ability to ask questions like that? 

I have a bachelors in chemistry and have also been very tech-savvy over the years. I've built my own neural networks in TensorFlow and Keras, so I appreciate the technology but I have always been reasonably skeptical of how large companies use it. This just feels like another case of tech companies not giving a shit about anything outside the strict confines of the law.

Cheating and students avoiding learning is our #1 focus, but there are much wider implications of AI, such as how it may impact our students' jobs in the future.

142f820,18,2023-06-06,New State of the Art ESL Learning Technique on Engoo,u/SA3960,OnlineESLTeaching,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineESLTeaching/comments/142f820/new_state_of_the_art_esl_learning_technique_on/,"Okay, this is a new one. My rating is pretty high for the time being which is bringing out the worst of them. This story is about my experience with a 68 year old woman who booked the latest No Intro/Free Conversation with me. 

She's way too clever for conventional lessons. Reading, repeating, etc... That stuff doesn't work. She's been taking two Engoo lessons a day for three years and her English hasn't improved one bit and who is to blame for that? The lesson designers and tutors of Engoo have failed her. ESL, nay, pedagogy itself has failed her! She had no choice but to take it upon herself to invent the most efficient way possible to learn a new language.

VR? AI? Bah. This is the future of learning. 

It all starts with one of [these](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/APYD6G/lampitt-lc-62e-cassette-tape-recorder-APYD6G.jpg). That's right. It's a 1970's era device they called a ""tape recorder"" which I'm guessing some of the younger folks in this sub have never seen in real life. It's a simple device with a built in microphone that allows you to record things onto a cassette tape. 

First, our forward thinking tech wizard records a news program from CNN. There's no direct input for this mind you - she simply holds the 40 years of dust encrusted microphone up to the the tv and presses record. One thing she's got going for her is that they really new how to build stuff back then - it plays back surprisingly loud and clear when the cat stays quiet. Anyway, she then proceeds to transcribe the whole recording. All of this happens on her own time, pre-lesson.

What she wants to spend her 25 minute lesson doing is playing the recording, reading her transcript along with the recording (I want to be very clear here: the recording is playing as she's speaking), and have the tutor type out any discrepancies they hear between the recording and her reading.

So the process for each and every correction goes like this:

1. The tutor interrupts to tell her there's a correction.

2. She stops the tape. CLACK! (these old fashioned buttons make a loud CLACK! sound when pressed)

3. The tutor types out the correction and explains - although she doesn't even bother to repeat the correction and has zero interest in the explanation. At best she says ""okay"" and proceeds to step 4. With every correction she mostly just seems annoyed that her process has been interrupted.

4. She tries to rewind to get back to where she left off. CLACK! (a few words) CLACK! (a few words) CLACK! (a few words) CLACK! (a few words) as she rewinds and fast forwards to find the right spot.

5. Repeat.

I've had students before who *say* they want corrections but really don't. They get annoyed every time you correct them and really just like to hear themselves ramble on uncorrected. I thought she might be one of these so I stayed silent and let her do her thing for a while. Well, that was a no-go. After a couple of minutes (CLACK!) she stopped the tape and asked incredulously: ""No correcting?!""

So I went back to interrupting/correcting her. 

It didn't take long to figure out that she was making exactly the same mistake over and over. Missing the articles. She says ""the president made speech"" and I stop her and she stops the tape so I can type ""the president made **A** speech"" she doesn't repeat the correction, continues with her tape and about a minute later says ""he went to beach"" I stop her and type ""he went to **THE** beach"" and on and on. Over and over and over.

After about the tenth time I stopped her and tried to explain that she keeps doing the same thing, leaving out the articles. I told her Engoo has grammar lessons that cover the use of articles and these might be very helpful.

Silence. Blank stare.

I told her it might even be helpful to do some reading and repeating to get used to speaking articles properly.

Silence. Blank stare.

I suggested that if she doesn't want to do any of that, it might be a good idea to at least repeat the corrections she has the tutors type out.

Silence. Blank stare.

Everything I said went in one ear and out the other. After my little soliloquy she calmly returned to playing her tape and reading her no articles transcript. I calmly returned to stopping her and typing new sentences with articles. 

I only went through the whole 25 minute lesson with her once. She caught me at the end of the month at 3.99% and unable to cancel no matter what. I got a random 4* later that day but I'm not sure it came from her. Luckily, she stopped coming back after I canceled on her a few times.

Well, that's all. I just wanted to warn everyone. If you sign into a lesson and see this lady, run! Imma go figure out how to connect ChatGPT to my tape recorder so I can make my first billion and put you all out of work. Cheers!",active,19
144wewc,0,2023-06-09,Unpopular Opinions,u/sysilver,UCSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/144wewc/unpopular_opinions/,"Unpopular opinion 1: College is about advancing your career. It is no longer about being a well-rounded, renaissance person.

Useless GEs keep people from graduating early and/or focusing on more useful skills. Mandating useless classes disproportionately hurts lower income groups, but really just drives up the cost of college for everyone.

In light of ChatGPT, writing classes are especially useless. I understand that writing is an important skill, but 5 quarters of HUM amounts to about 25k when you factor in opportunity cost (assuming an 80k salary post-graduation). 35k if you're out-of-state. Don't even get me started on the language requirements.

[edit] Writing certainly is an important aspect of being able to think. That being the case, it is a skill that should be developed in high school and honed in college. A small number of people might analyze rhetorical devices in their career, but most will not. If writing is to be a requirement, it should be career-focused.

[edit] ""In light of,"" not ""In lieu of."" 

Unpopular opinion 2: Dining dollars are theft.

Imagine being forced to buy thousands of dollars worth of gift cards that you can only spend at specific restaurants. Sure, the restaurant employs people in need of a job, but other restaurants in the area have better pay. They'd love to move in and pay those people more, but they can't accept your gift cards...

Secondly, people who are working jobs for HDH are going to have to work for at least a hundred hours before offsetting the cost of their own dining dollars. Had they been able to just go buy more affordable food at target they'd probably be better off.



Unpopular opinion 3: The grad students were wrong. 

The grad students who petitioned for higher pay did so by holding undergraduate students' education hostage. They signed contracts saying that they would fill certain contractual duties, but then they neglected those duties mid-quarter.

While it may have been nice to have homework made optional and whatnot, the quality of education overall went down.

Lastly, without a budget increase, you're going to start seeing higher-income people get fired as funds get reallocated towards keeping on the necessary lower-income people. That is what you're seeing with some professors being fired.

Sure, you can argue that the budget should increase, but this translates to extracting more taxes from random people who are already struggling to make ends meet. Daddy coleslaw certainly isn't going to take a pay-decrease lol.",active,0

So last year, I was a senior in college trying to finish up my degree when I ran into some financial issues. Had only five classes left, but hardly any money to come by, so had to put a pause on going to college. I was really struggling - was stuck in retail and felt like I had no way out. 

Flash forward to the beginning of this year, I start hearing more about ChatGPT and didn't really think much of it. I thought it was more just a tool for students to use for writing essays. Man, was I wrong.

I decided to play around with it for the fun of it. Asked it many questions and was surprised by the detailed responses, I think the only thing it wasn't good at was math (but of course I fed it Cal 2 questions, so I figure it'll develop those skills soon). 

One thing led to another, I asked it to draft up a resume. Output was a simple resume. Then I prompted it to make a resume out of a specific job and its desired skills from job listings. It returned a really professional, accurate resume from the prompt (had to fix the formatting, but amazing!). 

Before this year, almost every job I applied to would give me no response. With the help of ChatGPT, I would send in my generated resume + a generated cover letter. Not only did I get more responses, but over the past few months I have taken 2 offers. Two is a low number, but it means so much to me in this case. Went from making $9/hr at my old retail job to almost $45k/yr at my new job doing sales support. 

Of course I had to fake it till I made it, but I've been learning the ins and outs along the way of my new job - with ChatGPT's help sometimes. This has literally changed my life, plus it's giving me more room for improvement with experience and salary. I'll probably stay at my current job for a little while and do online classes to finish out my degree.",User_deleted,17

Unfortunately, meaningful study of history starts at the  undergraduate level. It is a shame that they don't teach this in high school, and it is a shame that the vast majority in undergrad  temporarily rote memorize the knowledge in their history and  history-related courses just to pass the exam and then forget it after,  especially because for most students these courses fall under electives. I already studied the below extensively in numerous courses in university and critically analyzed and connected the concepts across courses over 100s of hours, so I am picking a practical summary that you can use chatGPT to learn more about in less time.

**As  you read this post, remember that our neoliberal capitalist politicians  and bankers and CEOs, who are our leaders and run the country, barely  know any of the following knowledge. Even the most educated of them,  their education is limited to isolated narrow specializations like  economics (of capitalism) and modern law (which was shaped by many of  the incorrect thinkers/ideologies named below). Isn't it bizarre? How  can you run a country when you don't even understand the validity and  morality of the ideology and systems your rule is based on? Also, the  vast majority of the electorate is unfortunately largely unaware the  vast majority of the knowledge below.**

I highly recommend everybody to study world history since the beginning  of humanity around 200k years ago, and especially European history since  the 1500s, and try to see how everything logically connects in each  specific era: geography, art, technology, political philosophies/systems  (this will also make you realize that ""determinism"" makes more sense  than ""free will""). This would reduce ignorance and racism, and also shed  light on how the modern failure of a neoliberal capitalist system came  into place. If more people realized the incorrect pillars this system is  based on, they would be less likely to continuously vote for the  politicians who prop it up, and we can finally take a step toward  meaningful change, toward meaningfully fixing issues such as the economy  and environmental degradation and damage.

**I highly recommend you use ChatGPT to learn about the following periods/people:**

&#x200B;

**The Renaissance.**

**The Protestant Reformation.**

**The Scientific Revolution.**

**The  Age of Enlightenment.** (This one is particular useful in terms of  showing why we have the incorrect modern neoliberal capitalist system,  because the thinkers of this time erroneously thought that humans are  rational, which has been proven false by the modern literature. This  kind of thinking is what led to bizarre concepts such as US gun laws. **I  would also recommend you check out ""negative freedom/liberty"" vs  ""positive freedom/liberty"".**)

**As you learn about each era, you see how each one builds on each other. They are in chronological order.**

Some important figures (that modern neoliberal Western capitalism is built on) you can research:

**Thomas Hobbes**  (incorrect thinking: mistook his immediate environment as human nature;  this is where the modern incorrect capitalist notion of ""humans are  selfish and have unlimited greed"" comes from. no, humans are not  selfish, humans are built for self-preservation: this is NOT the same  thing as ""humans are naturally hardwired to accumulate unlimited wealth  that they can't even use while starving billions for it"". It depends on  the nature of the society, if society is built in a way that punishes  selfishness and rewards altruism, then in order to self-preserve, people  would have to show a degree of altruism. Modern capitalism mistakes  cause and effect: obviously, if the system you live in rewards  selfishness and punishes altruism, then people will have to act selfish  to self-preserve, this does not mean that this is ""human nature"".  Unlimited greed is not consistent with evolutionary theory and makes no  rational sense.)

**John Locke** (much  of the US constitution is based on his largely incorrect thinking,  people like Ted Cruz act consistent with his thinking; his ideas serve  the bedrock for the bizarre idea that ""a central state should not have  too much power otherwise it will automatically be corrupt""= but in  practice this lead to neoliberalism= the government becomes so weak that  corporations practically hijack it run it/use it solely for their own  benefit, which is even worse than an oppressive central state, because  corporations have absolutely 0 regard for humans and the environment,  whereas a central state would be motivated to please people at least a  little bit, even the worse dictators please their people to some degree  due to fear of being toppled, whereas corporations would literally let  the world burn for 1 cent more profit)

**John Stuart Mill** (mostly good thinking)

**Jean-Jacques Rousseau** (mostly good thinking)

The stuff in parentheses above is my interpretation/opinion based on thinking about this stuff critically for 100s of hours. You don't have to agree. I just hope you do your own research on these timelines/historical figures.",active,0

I recently transitioned into Mod 3, but my experience with Mod 2 was extremely negative. Throughout the module, there were three teachers, and out of them, only two seemed knowledgeable. However, only one of them was approachable. What surprised me the most was that the instructor who acted like the most fun person in front of the class turned out to be a complete jerk during one-on-one interactions or in breakout rooms. He provided minimal feedback, gave one-word answers to questions, and overall seemed unhelpful. On the other hand, the other instructor who had no grasp of the subject matter was a disaster. She even refused to answer some questions during the morning practice problems, which was truly embarrassing.

&#x200B;

To compensate for the lackluster teaching, I heavily relied on my fellow students and resorted to searching on Google, which seemed like the only way to learn. Unfortunately, topics introduced in the curriculum were often neglected afterward. The curriculum would claim, ""And now you know how to do xyz!"" when clearly many students, including myself, struggled with it. Despite this, I accepted that I would need to learn and practice extensively on my own. However, this led to a major issue: my grades felt inflated. Without access to the rubric, I knew I had overlooked or failed to complete several requirements, yet I was still awarded a 99. Moreover, there were numerous cases of people failing the exam and the Mod 2 project, but the instructors pushed them through anyway. Some individuals even resorted to blatant cheating, copying and pasting from ChatGPT without any attempt to conceal it. For example, one person copied and pasted the pseudocode from ChatGPT, which explained what the code was doing. Now these individuals have moved on to Mod 3, where they contribute nothing due to their lack of understanding. It's understandable that many students are frustrated with this situation.

&#x200B;

However, my biggest question is why the HR administration wouldn't require these students to retake the module. The only reasonable explanation seems to be financial concerns. It's disheartening because I initially believed HR would be an excellent learning environment, but now I find myself paired with an incompetent partner. I fear that their lack of competence will hinder my own learning, just as it did in Mod 2. Furthermore, it appears that the administration will simply push us through to graduation regardless, even though someone like me could benefit from redoing the module.
