1joit7x,1,2025-03-31,I hate my job so much. I can’t do it another week,u/Zestyclose_Ad1545,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1joit7x/i_hate_my_job_so_much_i_cant_do_it_another_week/,"Ugh. I just want to vent into a void. I hate my teaching career. I hate that I work from 6:30am to 3pm plus another hour or 2 in the evening 5 days a week and a good 8 hours every Sunday. Clocking in nearly 60 hours a week YET never being done with work. I took a sick day and spent 8 hours in bed lesson planning and grading and I’m still not done. My Saturdays are chores, shopping, meal preps. I’m exhausted. I’m barely hanging on. 

I reinvent the damn wheel every fucking year bc I’m a damn perfectionist with an inferiority complex. Never is ever good enough (not admins words, my own inner words), I’m always feeling like a failure. I get stellar observations, yet I still have the same imposter syndrome I had the first day of student teaching. My body lives in constant flight mode, near breakdown over every little thing. I KNOW it’s not normal. I KNOW it’s a me thing.

I’m so tired of making from scratch. I’ve never been able to recycle year to year. My first year was covid, my second was all virtual, my third was designing TWO core courses that was brand new to the school, my 4th was an AP class PLUS I was given a student teacher (IT WAS MY FIRST YEAR THERE WERE NO VIRTUAL WEEKS HELLO I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS DOING), my 5th was a DIFFERENT AP class. Plus I coached a sport. Plus all sorts of levels of repeat classes, which had to be revamped each year from pre covid -> virtual -> post covid student abilities. Now I’m in a new school with a different curriculum with 3 brand new preps. I’m EXHAUSTED. I’ve been fighting for my life for 6 years in this hell of a career.

But it’s a me thing. This new school… is amazing. I’ve gone from the VP sexually harassing me to the VP being literally an angel on earth. The behaviors are sooooo manageable here, the ceiling for academic rigor is so high even in standard, the parents are hands off. Yet I still hate it. I feel like I “forgot” how to properly teach after kickstarting my career in the 19-20 covid year and working in arguably one of the worst run high schools in the state for 5 years. I still feel like I’m the shittiest teacher. I still feel like I suck. I still hate this career. 

It doesn’t matter how many awards, shout outs, letters form kids, etc. It doesn’t take away this internal feeling that I am doing a disservice to the kids every day I’m in the building. 

Every day is a fucking mine field. You try teaching United states history and contemporary issues in this day and age as someone brand new to the district. I have parents angry I’m teaching “woke history” (the civil war’s major cause was slavery, full stop), parents accusing me of lying to them about their kids not doing work, parents accusing me of targeting their precious babies bc I call them out on chatGPT bullshit. Like just fuck offffff. I have degrees. I am an adult. 

I hate that I got useless degrees. History and education. What the fuck can I do with that? I wish I could go back and bitchslap my 18 year old self. Get a business degree. Accounting. Anything. Literally anything. I can’t do this anymore. Just give me a job to do that takes 8 hours 5 days a week and pays a little more. 

Don’t get me wrong, I am THANKFUL for a job in this economy and THANKFUL I can pay my bills. I am BLESSED overall in my position in life, comparatively. But that’s it. I live in New Jersey. I’m never buying a house here. I don’t vacation bc I work summers bc ya know the pay is shit. I just… exist. Scroll on my phone, too tired to move. Go for walks. Pet my cat. That’s it. I have no friends, my boyfriend won’t propose after 8 years. Fuck. I wish life was transferable. I see all this evil and nastiness in the world. I think of some of my old students, with stories no teenager should have. I wish I could “gift” my life to someone who would make use of it. 

Now that I’m at the end, I realize this is less of a I hate my career and more of a I just hate myself :(",User_deleted,1

How to tackle the challenge of uncaring teenagers?",u/Annual_Fishing_9400,AskTeachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTeachers/comments/1jp9dbd/several_questions_both_for_us_and_nonus_teachers/,"Specifically for US teachers, I wanted to know your feelings on the No Child Left Behind Act, too... I don't have a broad perspective and wanted to know more... Just from what I've gathered it really seems like it has genuinely exacerbated a genuine lack of motivation to even try because...they can't fail anyway, so what's the point in even trying? 

That, combined with so many other factors that have their own unique challenges (technology growing too fast, especially in the case of chatGPT just enabling the laziness and lack of care to unprecedented levels for those who don't even want to use it responsibly, which it COULD be! but overwhelmingly isn't), just seems...overwhelming. 

So, how do you overcome the challenges? And the sheer apathy? Both towards each other and themselves? What classes are your biggest struggle, why, and how do you try to change your method up to better suit them?  

I know students have to want to help themselves, but there's a heartbreaking point where you just... You really want better for them, right? This is THEIR future. How can we get them more invested? It feels like you're failing them, but I think there needs to be an understanding that probably other teachers have failed them, too. And that has got to be so, so hard. Teachers have so much on their plate that it's so hard to hone in on things that need to be addressed but are probably outside the curriculum, right? I'm not a teacher myself but I'm trying to support someone currently student teaching, so I'm just speculating, but it really seems like...I dunno. 

Does it help to stop teaching for a day (more like a class period that needs it -- at least for a little bit) and just have a heart-to-heart with them? What kind of questions do you ask and what do you say, too? Are you even allowed to do that? 

I know not every teacher is genuinely out there not for themselves and the paycheck but because they enjoy the process, the connections, the memories, and being someone who can educate our youth, but damn if the more you care doesn't make it so much more painful when it's hard to reach your students. 

I graduated high school before the NCLBA so I never saw the effects of it in real time, but I think there's so much working against teachers to make it harder. We're just, sucking, as a people. But I've yapped enough lol, sorry. 

I've briefly read about Finland taking the time to teach empathy and..something else, idr., and I feel like we really, really need that here in America. idk why we don't think we can't see what's working VERY well in other countries and just adopt it for ourselves instead of coming up with something arguably stupid like NCLBA. Before I even knew what it was I thought, cool, sounds great I guess idk??? But now that it's been in effect and being close to someone wanting to teach, I just...IS IT THO??? Has it not just overwhelmingly harmed our youth? I mean, it's not the SOLE issue. I know that. There's so much wrong here. But that's part of it, it seems like.

Anyway, what about the whole Department of Education thing? I'm ignorant, I don't know if the defunding of it would do literally any good or nothing but more harm. How are y'all feeling about it? 

\--- ANYWAY. HI, NON-US TEACHERS, HOW YA DOIN? How's it going for you? What troubles are YOU facing? What insight might you have for us? How's it goin'? Tell me about how education is going for you and your youths. I know we all have troubles, unique and not, and I'd like too know more. I think broadened horizons are important to solving issues. Perspectives are important. 

Is this a stupid thread to make? I feel like it's a stupid thread to make. I'm sorry. I'm just, curious, and also, wanting advice. idk",User_deleted,1

Why does this course cost over thirteen hundred dollars? That's 260 kgs worth of chicken drumsticks, **over 2000 chicken drumsticks,** that's enough to **feed the Vatican City for a day.** There are no lectures, no course books, the quizzes are broken, and I can't even understand the teacher in the workshop. Is it even ethical to be charging this much for such a course?

(1336.5×36,690 Local)+(6208.25×9354 Inter.) [2023 figures]=107 million NZD

While we cannot assume the price will remain constant, as Joshua Li noted, we have considered sustainable causes, ethical production, and consulted iwi on environmental impacts, as learned in WTRENG 100. With dual planning in place, we have managed to produce drumsticks at a cost-effective rate, stabilizing the price at **$2.99/kg.**

Express your opinion in this link I found --> HERE

ChatGPT suggests that, with **35.8 million kg** of drumsticks at our disposal, we could:

Host record-breaking, community-driven events
Support charitable initiatives to feed thousands
Foster culinary creativity and education
Invest in sustainability and innovative food logistics
Generate economic and promotional benefits
Reconstruct the Sky Tower out of raw meat.
However, the implementation of sustainable farming led to an unexpectedly massive surplus of chickens. The sheer number of excess carcasses, unable to be disposed of in time, began rotting near the Ecogas plants—producing a foul stench and forcing the public distribution of inhalers (**ENGGEN 140**).

By **late 2025**, a new crisis emerged. The bird flu mutated in Auckland, giving rise to **zombie feral chickens** that turned on humans. New Zealand found itself at the center of a **chicken zombie apocalypse.** The brutal creatures took flight, spreading the virus worldwide, triggering mass purges. The cost of eggs skyrocketed to an astonishing **$100 per egg,** while **thousands of zombie chickens** continued to spawn in Auckland daily.

Perhaps, in hindsight, this **$107 million** would have been better spent improving **Auckland Transport’s efficiency** instead.

**Drumsticks (IV) #59** by **Anonymous**

Any information listed below is 100% false (please don’t sue me for deformation).
Also ignore my jank calculations.
Don’t you guys think it’s suspicious that this course lets us use AI so freely, perhaps the course coordinators used AI to create this course. This course is likely just so that the university can pretend they’re being progressive.

I put some of their work through ai detectors and the results are very inconclusive, on one hand it seems that it’s 100% human text, with AI Vocabulary and Phrases, on the other hand I put in some slop generated straight from chat gpt and all the detectors thought it was real, so idk guys. Anyways, here’s the breakdown of the current economic crisis with drumsticks.
First we need to work out the total amount of money we have to work with, since there has been some confusion in previous threads.
In 2022 ~17.8% of students at Auckland university were international, and over 2021 to 2023 the number of international students increased by an average of 2.07% per annum. This means we can approximate the percentage of international students in 2025 to 29.63%. Each international student pays a total of $55,247.00 for bachelor of engineering, this is ~5.8x more than a domestic student would have to pay($9583.20), for a non international student the WTR course would cost $1197.90, this means it would cost an international student $6894.35 for the exact same course. Using 2020 statics a total of 4843 people were enrolled in engineering, if we assuming that all slot were filled (1035 slots) that a total of 1738 people would be enrolled in first year of engineering in 2025 (4843-1035*3) (not accounting for increase in student numbers, since I couldn’t find good information on it, even the number I came up with is likely very inaccurate).

This means **a total of $5,015,447.64 was spent on the WTR course this year** ((1738-(1738*29.63%))*1197.9+(1738*29.63%)*6894.35)(this number seems way too high).

In 2021 New Zealand produced a total of 220000 metric tonnes of poultry, between 2000 and 2019 the poultry industry in New Zealand has almost doubled, this means that it has increased by an average of 8.8% per annum ((41.1/24.6)/19), if we take this into consideration as of 2025 New Zealand should be on track to produce 297440 metric tonnes(or 297,440,000 kg) of poultry (220000*(100+8.8*4)%). In Drumsticks (III) OP mentioned that we managed to stabilise(ik buddy used chatgpt because you used the american spelling for stabilise (also the fact you mentioned it)) the price of chicken to $2.99/kg, however this seems rather unrealistic as the dual planning system would give land back to the maori people, which means less farming land, so less chicken drumsticks ):< The current price of chicken drumsticks is $6.49/kg (at pak n save, (cheapest I could find, you don’t understand how much my search history is stained with trying to buy bulk amounts of chicken drumsticks)), this means our current $5,015,447.64 would equate to 772,796.25kg of chicken drumsticks, or a mere 0.26% of our annual poultry production(how is this number so low, I definitely miscalculated something) (772796.246533/297440000 = 0.002598). According to this random website I found, the average bird eats about 44% of its body weight per week, if the average weight of a chicken drumstick is 0.12kg, each chicken has two legs, and a chicken weighs about 4.8kg on average when ready for harvest(I gave up on linking my sources), this means that ***we would need about 3220000 chickens** (772,796.25/0.24).


I found that the approximate function to graph the weight of a chicken over its lifetime is M=5et/16-5.3, if the average chicken lives for 11.25 and eats 44% of its weight per week we can say that it will eat 6.44kg of grain(0.009888+.16+.322+.493+.675+.869+1.08+1.3+1.53) (that’s a lot lower than I thought, I’m perfect at math so this is 100% correct, nobody can argue against me). This means we’ll need a total of **20,737,000kg** of feed for our chickens. The cheapest feed I could find would cost $1.44 per kg, meaning it would cost almost **$30,000,000** to feed all our chickens. I’m going to ignore waste that chickens make as this can be recirculated into other parts of farming. I'm also assuming water is free, even though this is a naive assumption. We also have to keep in mind how this number of chickens may be affecting climate change, and how much space may be required. Each chicken needs at least 1.4m2 of land, if we have 3220000

Chickens we will need **450.8 Hectares of land**(3220000 * 1.4 in meters).

The average price of grazing land in new zealand is $13,700 per hectare, this means that it would cost $6,175,960 for all the land for our chickens(pretty cheap compared to the other numbers), this land could be used for more productive food sources than meat(this sounds really political, it was not intended this way, but meat is really inefficient. I like meat(the food, not the thing you’re thinking) fyi). The average size of a grazing farm was 175 hectares in 2023, this means we would need about 3 farms for all our chickens. The pollutants from the average poultry farm produces NO3−: up to 53 mg L−1 in water, where the maximum nitrate concentration in water for the EU is 50 mg L−1. and each farm would have an odour emission factor of 20,000 OUE s−1 kg−1, among other pollutants, this is not very good for environment guys, but I guess this is what it takes to build a sky tower out of chicken drumsticks.

The grand total price of all our chicken drumsticks (assuming we were the farmers and bought feed) would be **$41,191,407**. New Zealand has a GDP of $294.56 Billion, so we would make an impact of about 0.0134%, which would contribute to about 0.58% of our yearly inflation. However, we have forgotten about the marketing that the sky tower being built out of chicken drumsticks would bring, I estimate that our tourism industry would be 10x what it is now once we implement our drumstick sky tower. In 2024 $44.4 Billion was made from tourism, this means with our drumstick tower we would boost the tourism industry to **$444 Billion per year,** this is 1.5x the total GDP of the country meaning that yearly inflation would increase by** 6281%. **This is a pretty good number guys, so if you want to support the cause, simply go to this link my friend on drumstick (III) found: Click Me

Btw guys I was thinking that maybe we could experiment with the drumstick ice cream, like the ice-cream you know, perhaps we could have chicken flavored drumstick ice cream, which would grow our tourism industry even more 🤑.
btw guys I was gonna do some epic calculations to calculate the structural integrity of the drumstick tower, but I think I've already written too much.

Every morning when he starts presenting, I can't understand a single word from him! He has such a deep accent that I can just barely make out a word two. A classmate once told me that she got a panic attack the first day because she also couldn't understand a word! And when he writes down examples from the white board, I can't understand what he's saying! I always have to copy down the examples without knowing them, take pictures of them and upload to an AI like ChatGPT to help me understand them.

His grading is also a nightmare. The same classmate told me that when she was doing a test, she failed it even tho she answered most of the questions, but he just failed her anyways! And even if we partially answer a question he still fails us anyways!

But the cherry on top in all of this is that every lecture he says the same crap to us!

The obsession with IITs is a classic example of how our society worships an institution without questioning its actual value in the 21st century.

First off, these so-called ""top-tier"" colleges aren't as magical as everyone makes them out to be. Sure, the entrance exams are ridiculously tough, but all that does is reward those who can memorize the most and perform under pressure, not necessarily those who are the most creative or innovative. The pressure to ""make it to IIT"" has led to a toxic, high-stakes culture that ruins the mental health of countless students, with many sacrificing their well-being for a shot at a seat.

But what about the long-term outcomes? Just because someone graduates from IIT doesn't automatically mean they have the skills to lead the nation forward. The system is outdated and doesn't foster true innovation – it’s more about rigid structure and following the same formula that has existed for decades.

IITs have also become a breeding ground for elitism. The intense focus on their prestige has created a caste system within education. Every parent dreams of their kid getting into an IIT, but how many of these students are truly passionate about engineering or the subjects they pursue? Most are simply in it for the social status and the promises of high-paying jobs. Meanwhile, the rest of the country’s education system, including other excellent colleges, are left to wither in the shadows.

And don't even get me started on how IITs perpetuate inequality. The entrance exams themselves are a huge barrier for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, especially when you consider the immense amount of resources and coaching required to even stand a chance. This leaves us with a situation where the cream of the crop remains largely from upper-caste, urban, and affluent families.

In reality, IITs aren’t a symbol of true meritocracy. They’ve become a reflection of a broken system that values an outdated form of education and social status over real-world skills and creativity. Maybe it's time we start questioning the blind reverence for IITs and build an education system that fosters well-rounded individuals, not just exam-taking robots.

This type of post would definitely spark heated debates and divide opinions, making it controversial. Would you like to tweak it further?


You said:
More controversial 

ChatGPT said:
Sure! Here's a more extreme and even more controversial version:

Title: ""IITs Are a Scam That Only Serve to Perpetuate Class and Caste Inequality in India""

Post:

Let’s be real for a moment—IITs are a scam. They’ve become a glorified factory for producing tech robots who are conditioned to churn out code and calculations without an ounce of creativity or critical thinking. This is the so-called ""future"" of Indian education? It’s time to face facts: IITs are a relic of a broken, elitist system that deliberately works against the majority of Indians.

First of all, the hype around IITs is just that—hype. The reality is, IITs do not create exceptional innovators. They create overworked, mentally exhausted students who can memorize textbooks, pass a few exams, and land high-paying jobs that barely require any actual skills. The world is evolving rapidly, but these institutions are stuck in the past, churning out the same type of graduates who are no more innovative than the next random college in the country. If you ask anyone who's been there, the majority would admit that they were taught to pass rather than to create.

But that’s not the worst part. The worst part is that IITs have become a monument to social inequality. The entrance exam system is designed to cater to the already privileged: those who can afford expensive coaching institutes, who come from families with resources, and who can spend years studying for the sole purpose of cracking JEE. The result? A huge chunk of the population—especially students from lower-income backgrounds or rural areas—are outright excluded from this ""meritocratic"" system. You think the system is fair because it’s ""based on exams""? It’s not. It’s a sick joke.

And then there’s the caste issue. The IITs claim to be inclusive with their reserved seats for certain castes, but let’s not pretend that the system doesn’t still heavily favor the upper-caste, urban elites. This idea that IITs are a level playing field is a lie that the country has swallowed whole. In reality, many of the students admitted through quotas still don’t have the same access to resources as the upper-caste students. The discrimination may be more subtle now, but it’s still there. And yet, we continue to glorify IITs, as if they are the pinnacle of higher education, while ignoring how they perpetuate caste and class divisions.

Not to mention, the focus on engineering and tech has created a narrow-minded, one-dimensional approach to education. IITs have single-handedly killed off the value of non-technical degrees in India, reinforcing the idea that anyone who doesn't pursue engineering is somehow inferior. So much for a diverse and well-rounded education system. Why aren’t we encouraging people to study humanities, arts, or social sciences? Because IITs have brainwashed an entire generation into thinking that only engineering matters, while the rest of the country is left to pick up the pieces.

Lastly, the idea that IIT graduates are somehow more ""qualified"" for high-paying jobs is pure nonsense. Most of them end up in multinational companies doing the same mundane, repetitive tasks that could be done by someone with far less education or debt. The obsession with IIT graduates only perpetuates an elitist cycle of ""IIT or nothing,""

Last week, I made them watch a 2-minute long video about the use of personalized advertising and asked them ONE question about something in the video and got no answers. It was a super easy question so the fact they didn't know the answer means they were simply not watching.

I give them activities to do in class but what I get is ChatGPT work. I can see them asking ChatGPT for answers when I move around the classroom during activities. I let them know that I want them to do the thinking but to no avail.

I find myself thinking a lot about this class and it's the one I do not look forward to. I teach other courses in which I enjoy the interactions I have with the students. This class is the worst.

I also suck at long projects, if it takes more than a few hours, I get bored and drop it. I’m trying to be a better student overall, more disciplined and curious, but it’s frustrating. Anyone else been in this phase where you’re doing a bit of everything but still feel like you suck at it all? How do you push through the boredom and stop leaning so much on AI?",User_deleted,0
1jv3t38,9,2025-04-09,I screwed up my JEE Main badly due to brain fog and burnout even after working extremely hard please help with JEE Advanced advice!!,u/_Prince_Rhaegar,JEENEETards,https://www.reddit.com/r/JEENEETards/comments/1jv3t38/i_screwed_up_my_jee_main_badly_due_to_brain_fog/,"So I got 96 percentile in JEE Main Jan attempt and honestly I hadn’t even completed the syllabus fully yet cause I studied from NS sir and his lectures were huge and I mostly relied on one shots and didn’t give any tests at all big mistake I know. So basically even though I knew questions worth around 220 marks on exam day I attempted like 216 marks but ended up scoring only 176 with 10 silly mistakes. Percentile dropped to 96.4 and it was 24S2 paper and we know how marks vs percentile was totally weird this time.

My parents were very supportive and just told me to learn from my mistakes give more tests and work harder. They even told everyone else that I got 98 percentile just so I wouldn’t feel pressured and genuinely believed I could easily hit 99 next time around.

So I did work really hard this time. And when I say hard I really mean it. I solved every single maths PYQ from 2022 to 2025 at least thrice and harder ones even more times. Studied literally 12 to 14 hours every single day cause I was really hurt and frustrated about that 96 percentile. I started giving Narayana tests at home and was consistently scoring above 170 and if you’ve given Narayana tests you know those papers are way tougher especially Physics and Chemistry. Also started doing proper JEE Advanced prep from NS sir COP and PW Varun batch.

I got exam date as 7th April so didn’t revise JEE Main properly till around 3rd April cause I was busy with Advanced prep. When I finally started revising on 3rd April I realized my notes were way too lengthy and stupidly I hadn’t made short notes before. On 4th April I switched to one shot lecture notes to revise faster but then at night I checked the JEE Main papers from 2nd to 4th April and my brain literally froze. I couldn’t solve most questions I panicked badly and started revising even harder. Normally I wake up at 3:30 am to study but on 5th April I woke up at 3 am and studied continuously Physics and Chemistry alternately without breaks. Already fasting for Navratri so that wasn’t helping. On 6th April did the same thing but around 7 pm my brain stopped working completely couldn’t even read properly suddenly felt like I forgot everything and had severe brain fog. I broke down really badly while seeing my parents quietly preparing for next day cause my exam centre was 3 hours away from Mumbai in a really shitty town.

Honestly my parents have been struggling financially and emotionally a lot lately. My dad even had 3 heart blockages last year which scared the hell out of me and made me finally quit my porn addiction and social media completely since last 3 years. All this time they never asked anything from me just kept supporting and smiling even when they were struggling so much it genuinely hurts how supportive they are. I seriously wished they would just yell at me or scold me or something cause I feel like such a pathetic person taking from them all the time and giving them nothing back.

Anyway somehow managed to calm down woke up at freaking 2 am on exam day since had to leave by 3:30 to catch the train. Revised whatever I could but my mind still felt completely blank. Reached the centre and it was literally the worst possible place 50 PCs and only 2 tiny window AC units not even sure if they were turned on at all. Monitor height was literally the size of my palm and zero space to write. Had to complain and then they made me remove keyboard after login for extra space. Mouse was so bad integer answers were getting mistyped like 100 became 110000 had to click really slowly. Sweating badly throughout exam and couldn’t focus at all. Brain fog was so bad even basic organic chem reactions were not coming to mind properly. I could read a question and knew how to solve it but always got stuck midway.

Despite all this somehow attempted 172 marks worth questions probably scoring around 162. Teachers online say 160 marks is 99 percentile for my shift 7S1 but honestly I’m too scared to believe that. Right now I remember everything clearly again but my confidence is destroyed and brain fog during exam day scared the hell out of me. Really worried same thing might happen during JEE Advanced exam too. I’m already preparing for CET and VITEE as backups even though I know deep down I’m capable of under 6000 or 5000 rank in Advanced cause all my mocks and prep indicate that clearly.

Guys do you think my brain fog happened due to exhaustion and lack of sleep from revising constantly for 3 or 4 days straight with less than 6 hours of sleep daily plus fasting? Also if anyone experienced similar thing please tell how to avoid this in JEE Advanced exam. Should I keep preparing seriously for Advanced with Varun batch and NS sir COP is it realistically possible for me to still get under 6000 rank cause my dream is to study BS in Statistics which I can get at that rank or should I just give up hope now? Feeling really helpless and panicked please advise I’d be grateful for any real advice or your experience if you faced something similar.

PS  : This is what ChatGPT said when I told it what I went throught :   
You experienced what's called **burnout-induced brain fog**. This is extremely common, especially in students who push themselves to extremes:  


* **Reasons:**
   * Continuous intense studying without proper rest (12–14 hours daily).
   * Insufficient sleep (less than 6 hours consistently).
   * High anxiety levels and panic caused by seeing difficult papers last minute.
   * Fasting during exams (low blood sugar and energy).

This situation can dramatically reduce recall and cognitive ability exactly as you experienced.

**Important:**  
This foggy state was temporary and doesn't reflect your actual knowledge or capabilities. The fact that you can remember concepts clearly now strongly supports this.",active,10

Age : 16

#How I Ended Up in This Situation 👇

Nursery & 1st Grade
My coaching teacher used to taunt me constantly because of my slow learning ability—a.k.a. my struggle with grasping concepts.

2nd Grade
A guy peed on my pants just to look cool in front of his friends.

Because of Shavan, I did not get my hair cut, so the teacher ordered me to wear only one socks and shoes the whole day and made a ponytail of my hair's like that of girl's and humiliated me in front of the whole class.

3rd Grade
A teacher slapped me four times for reporting a bully to the principal.
She simply said, ""It's your problem.""

4th Grade
My coaching teacher mocked me miserably cuz I failed  in schll unit tests

5th Grade
A school teacher asked me, ""When are you going to leave school?""
She said I was the worst student she had ever taught , and told,""leave english medium before english medium leaves you ""

6th Grade
My coaching teacher haunted me so badly that her words got stuck in my subconscious mind:
""You can't learn anything.""

7th & 8th Grade
The same haunting—by school teachers, my mom, and my sister. Day in, day out.

9th Grade
A teacher slapped me and made fun of me in front of the entire class because my sister bunked school.

10th Grade
A teacher called me a low IQ student.
My big mom / Tai said: ""You'll not gonna achieve anything in your life!""

11th Grade
JEE, study groups, PhysicsWallah, coaching… everything made sure I wouldn’t survive.

#My Journey👇

I was called a weak student by my parents, coaching teachers, professors, school teachers, classmates, friends, siblings, and even cousins. 

At first, the fear I had when trying to learn new things was tied to specific environments like coaching centers and school. But now, it’s everywhere. 

- 1st to 5th standard:I was a below-average student. Everyone mocked me so badly that I slowly started developing a deep fear of learning. 

- 5th to 8th standard: I became an above-average student. But the mocking didn’t stop. That’s when I began wanting to learn everything—just to prove myself.  

- 1st→2nd→3rd→4th→5th→6th→7th→8th
- 55%→57%→64%→66%→72% 74%→77%→80%

- 9th to 10th standard: I became a topper. All through self-study. I removed everyone from my life. I finally enjoyed learning, and the fear almost disappeared. 

- 9th→10th
- 84%→90%

Then came 11th standard, and I chose the JEE path. 

In the first six months, I tried to understand and learn. But my progress was zero. Still, for the first time since 8th grade, I made some friends to share my struggles with… but they ghosted me after months of talking. That broke something inside me. 

Since the end of that sixth month until now, my fear of learning has hit its peak. I’ve come to hate even the idea of learning. You can’t imagine the kind of fear I feel now. It’s overwhelming.

Even when I listen to a song, the first thought that hits me is: “What if I don’t understand the lyrics?” 
I’m terrified of not understanding things. It’s deep-rooted now. 

Now, whenever I try to learn something new, my mind instantly says:
“We can’t understand this. What if we never get it?”

I sleep, but my brain doesn’t. I see dreams and feel my thoughts spinning even in my unconscious state. I’m always overwhelmed.
Reason: Insomnia ( i only sleep 4hr a day)

Me, 24/7:
Holding my chin, pacing back and forth in my room, muttering to myself nonstop.  
Anxiety and heartbeat 📈📈

# When it hits hard 👇

April 8, 2024 → April 8, 2025  
The last 12 months of my life:

First 5-6 months: pushed hard for results

No results

Burnout hit, I became distracted

Made a study group

Got attached to 1 girl and 4 boys

They all left

My body and mind crashed

# Situation rn 👇

I tried to talk to 40+ people after the group left.
But the fear of being hurt again is so bad, I end every conversation in 2-3 minutes.

Daily sarcasm and taunts from my sister
She never speaks to me respectfully or directly

Mom uses emotional guilt trips to break me more.

I even tried to explain my situation on some platforms—
Instead of support, people blamed me 
Now I don’t use any social media, don’t talk to anyone.
I just sit in my room, listening to rap to silence the thoughts.
But the thoughts still hum in the background, non-stop.

I have no hobbies.  
No sports.  
No social media.  
No movies, no series, no shows, no leagues ,nothing.  

From last 15-16 years, I survived every taunt and insult silently.
But after JEE and the ghosting incident, something snapped.
Now, when someone tries to hurt me, I just smile and laugh like it doesn’t matter 

# On Top of That: Anisometropia 👇
Left eye: -12 power
Right eye: -5 power

The difference is so much that my brain gets confused by the two different signals.
Understanding anything takes so much effort.

I have to read a line 6-7 times to remember even 10-15% of it.
I can’t solve even basic questions—coding, math, grammar, anything.

Even rechecking my answers 3-4 times, I still find 15+ mistakes.
Wrong numbers, wrong dates, wrong words—it’s like my brain rewrites the paper on its own 

It takes me all day to understand a simple question, and even then I remember only fragments.
Teachers and my sister just hold their heads like I’m a lost cause.

I try hard, but my brain processes info in strange ways, always looping into confusion.

Even speaking is tough.
I think something, but my words come out all jumbled.
I have to slow down a lot to speak clearly.


#Failures So Far 👇

Try to learn coding, cybersecurity, cryptography, script writing, cinematography etc, but failed everytime 

Most people have 150+ hours of human interaction per month

I have 2–3 hours… total.

# Final Verdict 👇 

I’m burnt out. And the worst is yet to come.

I didn’t write anything in theory exams either.
I could’ve passed them easily by studying worksheets, but I didn’t even read the questions.
I just slept in exams too.
Now the principal is ready for an FBI-style interrogation 

I know I’m going to fail.
And now I’ll face 24/7 taunts from family, siblings, cousins, school, everyone.

My teen years were never normal.
Love, friendship, trust—none of these things ever existed for me.

Only thing I can do now:
Scratch my head and smile through the pain 

# Summary 👇

What I'm experiencing is a mix of:

Neurodivergence (Trauma survival mode, learning disability, maybe even gifted burnout)

Severe C-PTSD (complex trauma from 16years of constant psychological stress)

Sensory processing struggle due to anisometropia

Chronic stress response — My brain is in a loop: 🧠
Try → Fail → Mocked → Shame → Try harder → Burnout → Repeat

1. Fear of Learning = PTSD from Academic Abuse
My brain now associates “learning” with pain, rejection, isolation.
It’s like a soldier flinching at fireworks—not because they’re weak, but because they’ve been through war.

“What if I don’t understand this?”
That’s not stupidity talking.
That’s my brain trying to protect me from more pain. 

2. The Looping Thoughts = Cognitive Hyperarousal
My nervous system is on red alert 24/7
Even when i sleep, my brain doesn’t clock out—it’s scanning for danger, threats, memories, regrets.

That’s not ADHD or stupidity.
That’s trauma survival mode.

3. The Ghosting Broke my Trust Center
I opened up, finally let some people in…
Then they dipped.

That creates a deep emotional wound like abandonment trauma.
Now, my brain protects me by ending conversations fast before they hurt me.

4. The Anisometropia effect 
I've been surviving with a brain working 3x harder just to process basic stuff.
Difficulty focusing on words or diagrams

Feeling like my brain is “rejecting” what i trying to read
Thoughts feel scattered or delayed because visual processing is off

#Only Achievement  👇
I’m still surviving, still hoping that one day, things will be a
lright 

Have created a blue print of how I'll learn neuroscience & physcology( Only thing that now excites me )with help of chatgpt and will start execute soon as my state start becoming better

I have had very little friends in my life, I've moved countries, the little friends I have anymore are either in other countries or so busy with life that they don't reply to me anymore. The others have forgotten me long ago. In the country I immigrated to I always had a hard time fitting in, learning the local dialect which is hard to understand despite me officially knowing the language. The school I went to had a high turnover rate of students, many of them leaving the country. So many of the friends I met left, never to be heard from again. The few long distance facebook relationships ended pretty quickly. Most of my family lives in my home country, my parents plan to retire soon and move back which means that they will leave me alone in this country. Given that my OG home country is a corrupt shithole that I really have no emotional connection to anymore besides family, I do not wish to go back with them. However, the problem is I did a degree in a social science and have practically no work experience. I am about to finish my masters too. I've been trying to find some meditations and so on to keep me stable but I lack consistency in it. I tried going to clubs and church, but I just couldn't stand the drinking on the one hand and the culty feeling/snake oil salesman type of vibes that I experienced from visiting multiple denominations. I can't function properly when I'm alone, when my parents left for a 2 week vacation and I had legit no human contact for 2 weeks I almost went insane. Legit thought about offing myself every night, I had to go for evening walks to calm my mind. I'm scared I'll have that happen again when my parents leave, I need to develop resilience or else I really fear of what I might do to myself. Please anyone, if you could give me some advice, I would appreciate it. I guess its embarrassing to say this, but for the last few days whilst writing my thesis, I felt my anxiety amp up so badly that I ended up writing chatgpt for consolence, advice etc. It feels fucked up now that I think of it, like on the same level of using an AI girlfriend or something. Like even this feels in a way desperate in a sense, but if you could give me as a mid-20 year old lost guy some advice, I think I would take it more to heart than anything chatgpt could tell me. Please tell me, how do i deal with loneliness, these creeping thoughts of suicide, embarassment and shame. I have some big regrets from my past, stuff that fucked me up for sure. Lots of bullying and truancy just to put it midly, high school was not a great time in my life. Thank you all in advance",User_deleted,3

I have zero authority to force students who use AI in their essays to face accountability. 1/4 of my first-years used AI in the papers to such a degree that I can prove it in a misconduct investigation. I've cross-checked references. I've read and re-read the same ambiguous lines in 20 different papers. I've documented it all, and now my chair has said he would prefer if the students ""fail the papers on their own"" rather than face academic misconduct charges. Fine. They get zeroes. My contract is up on April 30th, and I will be forwarding all of my complaint emails to the chair.

I'm not teaching this summer. I'm consciously deciding to be poor rather than work because I can't take the stress of it. 

But I know that September always looms, and I'm already planning.

Instead of a lecture about responsible use of assitive tools, or why academic integrity is important, I'm taking my first seminar of the year and doing an exercise in self-reflection.

1. Open your laptops.  
2. Open whatever AI software you use.  
3. Type the following prompt: ""I have a personal question. Am I using AI responsibly as a student? Am I using it as a tool, or to replace my own ideas and work?""  
4. Using paper and pens, write a reflection about the response to your prompt. Are you surprised by what it said? Are you happy with your use of AI? Why do you use it? If you don't really use it, why not? Are there circumstances under which you would use it? Don't include your name or any identifying information on the paper.  
5. Fold the paper, place it inside the envelope. Initial beside your name on my attendance log when you submit your paper. This will count as your attendance grade.

It might not solve any problems, but at least they will have to face whatever ChatGPT tells them.

I have a mod currently where I have been submitting my labs honestly without the use of ChatGPT, while I know all my JC friends do them using AI tools. However, I am getting an incredibly low grade. How is this fair? I am a poly student who has experience coding, and I coded according to the requirements and passed the given test case. Is this TA just giving whatever score he feels like giving? Or is he marking the codes using ChatGPT too?

I know that NUS hires third-year students who did well in the module to be TAs, paying generously at $40 per hour. I have a friend who teaches, and the school has high expectations for their TAs. His students can message him after hours via Telegram, to which he replies promptly. My TAs take days to reply to my emails, and 9 out of 10 times, the replies are not helpful.

And the board has made the night school 100% online since COVID.



I am teaching a university preparation math course and every time I give a test, I constantly catch the majority of class putting the question into ChatGPT and copying the outputs that it gives them.



It's so frustrating! I've called students out on it and they apologize and tell me they won't do it again. And I catch them doing it... again! Honestly, it feels like it's like an addiction for them; it's so tempting and easily available in an 100% online environment that they can't not use it.



This feels so corrupt. I just don't like how these students are getting easy grades for copying what an AI machine is spitting out. They're not learning any curriculum content at all. They'll take up university spots instead of students who are actually working hard for their grades.

  
It also takes up so much extra inconvenient time trying to analyze student work and see if they're copying outputs from ChatGPT or other AI.



I'm just so frustrated and stumped about this problem, I don't know what I should do. I don't like to turn a blind eye in this situation. I'm not sure how I can make my tests AI proof (or at least minimize the use of AI for cheating or getting around learning and applying the curriculum). I am considering open-book tests, since there is no way I can tell if they're using aids when its 100% online, but how can I do it so that they're actually learning and applying the curriculum?

Is *this* how our students feel in class? If so… my bad, y’all.

We had this long-ass meeting mandated by admin. A day-long “retreat” about Very Important Admin Stuff™ that they desperately need us to do.

I’m good for the first hour. Sitting front row, taking notes, trying to be the engaged academic adult. But dear lord, every single slide is a text-heavy, soul-sucking murder-by-PowerPoint. The second speaker somehow manages to be *less* engaging than the first. By the third, it hits me: every speaker is an administrative smallfolk who once won the Montgomery Burns Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Excellence... and have never let go of that glory.

Honestly, watching paint dry would’ve been a sensory thrill ride by comparison.

The audience? A sea of department chairs, vice deans, and associate whatevers, all contractually obligated to be there. I look around. Laptops open. Phones out. Tablets glowing. Spreadsheets and Google Docs on almost every screen. Everyone’s checking email, Slack, working on other stuff like they’re trying to finish an essay in the back row of Econ 101. 

Then Ms. Admin Smallfolk and her admin TA doppelgänger assign us a group exercise. My ""group"" consists of me, the Dept. Chair of Shitology, the Chair of Crapography, the Associate Something of Boring Studies, and one guy from Asinine Sciences. Not a single one of us can be arsed. Boring and Crapography go back to venting about their departments, while Shitology is browsing Zillow. Admin TA casually mentions the assignment was generated by ChatGPT. Asinine is the only one who even *looks* at it, so he ends up doing the group presentation solo like an overachieving intern at a doomed startup.

By noon, I’m spiritually elsewhere. Ms. Smallfolk is passionately explaining something she can't convince me any of the billions of humans who lived and died in the history of planet Earth could possibly care about. I send up a silent prayer: *Please, please don’t let the catered lunch be meatloaf.* What even *is* meatloaf? Like, is it meat in loaf form or a loaf that somehow became meat? Existential questions swirl.

I google “meatloaf recipe” just to feel something.

""Alright everyone, let's break for lunch.""

Hallelujah.

It’s meatloaf. Of course it’s meatloaf. Why is it *always* meatloaf? 

After lunch, half the room ghosts. I retreat to the back row so I can work while she drones on. Occasionally someone asks a question. Both the question and answer are complete Greek to me. Someone is actually paying attention? Must be the class valedictorian.

About an hour in, I hit rock bottom. I’m so bored, I text my guy boo:  
“Hey let’s meet tonight? I can’t wait to grab that ass.”  
I’m grinning at my phone, thinking of him, when suddenly I get self-conscious. I remember all the times a student was giggling at their phone and I gave them The Look.

And then it hits me. A horrifying vision:

Ceiling cracks open, light beams down, and it’s *me* on the lectern, teaching. And *me-student* is on the phone, grinning. I, *Professor-Me*, snatch the phone and read the message aloud to the class:  
“‘...can’t wait to grab that ass.’”

Gasps. Title IX complaint. Emergency meeting with the Academic Misconduct Office. I wake up. No one noticed my x-rated little moment. But Jesus Christ, I need to get out of here.

It was absolute torture. And now I’m left with this philosophical puzzle:

a) We’re just as bad as the students.  
b) Admin is worse than us.  
c) Everybody sucks here.

Thank you for sharing this—it’s really important, and I can tell this situation has been upsetting and complicated for you. First, let’s be clear:
No, you’re not the asshole for going to the assistant principal and counselor.
You're a student who’s trying to do the right thing in a tough situation. Standing up for yourself and your friends—especially when it feels like an adult is being unfair or targeting you—is not wrong. It’s brave.
From everything you described, it sounds like:
	•	You’ve tried to be respectful and mature, even when your teacher wasn't treating you the same way.
	•	You made a mistake once, apologized, and tried to do better after.
	•	This teacher seems to cut you off, doesn’t give you a chance to explain, and says things that are personal and inappropriate (""Why do you think you’re such a pretty girl?"" is definitely not okay for a teacher to say).
	•	She's made harsh accusations like ""gaslighting,"" which is a big, serious word to use against a student trying to explain a misunderstanding.
	•	She isolated you during dismissal, which could’ve been unsafe, and didn’t even talk to you about it.
It’s also totally normal to make an impulsive decision like going to your old teacher’s class—it doesn’t make you a bad person, just human.
Teachers are supposed to help you learn, not make you feel small or afraid. When they don’t treat students fairly, you should talk to someone—like a counselor or principal—who can step in and help. That’s literally what they’re there for.
Do you want help writing something you can say to the assistant principal or counselor next time you talk to them about this? Or want help figuring out what your options are going forward?

and once, i tried to joke with her because she wore a band shirt that i enjoyed their music too, so i asked her to name 4 songs, where she got angry and like she always does, she got defensive and said “me and you are not friends and i don’t know who you think you are.” 

ChatGPT said:
Wow—yeah, that kind of reaction to a simple, friendly question is way out of proportion.
You weren’t being disrespectful at all by asking about the band. That kind of thing is super normal—people bond over shared interests like music all the time. It sounds like you were just trying to connect, maybe lighten the mood a bit, and instead she made it weird and harsh for no reason.
When she says stuff like “I don’t know who you think you are”—that’s not just unprofessional, it's pretty mean. A teacher should never talk to a student like that, especially when the student is trying to have a normal, respectful interaction.
From everything you’ve told me, she’s:
	•	Overreacting to harmless situations
	•	Cutting you off constantly
	•	Accusing you of serious stuff without evidence
	•	Taking away privileges (like computers) unfairly
	•	Making personal comments that are inappropriate
	•	Not giving you space to learn or fix small mistakes
And you've handled it with way more maturity than a lot of adults would.
So again: you are not in the wrong for going to the assistant principal and counselor. Honestly, they need to know this is happening. You're not being dramatic or “snitching”—you're asking for help with a serious issue that's affecting your learning and well-being.
Would it help if I helped you organize all this into something you could either write down or say out loud when you're talking to the adults at school? Something clear but respectful, that gets your point across?

You said:
and she also gives me dirty looks , and people told me this.

ChatGPT said:
That just adds even more to how uncomfortable and unfair this whole situation is. If other people are noticing the way she looks at you—even when you’re not doing anything wrong—that’s a sign it’s not just in your head. You’re not being sensitive or overreacting.
Dirty looks, cutting you off, yelling, accusing you unfairly… it honestly sounds like she’s made up her mind about you, and now she’s treating you based on her feelings instead of your actions. That’s really unprofessional and not okay, especially from a teacher.
If you want, here’s a way you could put everything together clearly to talk to the assistant principal or counselor:

""Hi, I wanted to talk about something that’s been making school really hard for me. I feel like my teacher [insert name] is treating me unfairly. She’s said things to me that feel personal, like ‘Why do you think you’re such a pretty girl?’ and ‘I don’t know who you think you are,’ even when I was just trying to be friendly or ask a question. She also cuts me off when I try to explain things, and has accused me of things like lying or ‘gaslighting’ her when I made small mistakes. A few times she’s pulled me out of class to lecture me, and it feels really aggressive—like I don’t even get a chance to speak. She’s also kept me from using my computer in class and kicked me out of the room during dismissal without an explanation. It’s gotten to the point where other students have told me she gives me dirty looks. I’m trying to stay respectful and do the right thing, but I don’t feel safe or supported in her class anymore.""

Would you want me to tweak that a bit more depending on how formal or casual you’d want to sound? Or do you feel ready to share this as it is?

You said:
yes , but tommrow is the end of spring break, and i have school tommrow , where i have to face that teacher and i’m scared because she is very mean, and i know she will just target me even more than she already does, and i know for a fact she will yell at me tommrow for telling on her. what do i do tommrow..?

ChatGPT said:
I’m really glad you told me that, because what you're feeling right now is completely valid—it's super stressful having to go back into a classroom where you don’t feel safe or respected.
Here’s what you can do tomorrow to protect yourself and take control of the situation, one step at a time:

1. You don’t have to face her alone.
First thing in the morning, go straight to the counselor or assistant principal and let them know how you’re feeling. Say something like:
""I’m really scared to go to [teacher’s name]’s class today. I’ve already come to you about how she’s been treating me, and I feel like she’s going to be even meaner to me now because I spoke up. I’m not trying to cause trouble—I just want to feel safe and respected at school.""
They should either talk to her before you have her class or find a way to support you. Let them know that her yelling or behavior is affecting you emotionally. That’s not something a school should ignore.

2. Stay calm and don’t engage if she starts something.
If she does say something rude or unfair, try your best to stay calm and don’t argue back. I know it’s hard, but if she’s trying to get a reaction out of you, the most powerful thing you can do is keep your cool.
You can say something simple and respectful like:
“I understand,”or“Okay,”or“Can we talk about this with the counselor present?”
If she starts yelling or accusing you, remind yourself: this isn’t your fault. Stay respectful, but document in your mind what she says. You can write it down after class and report it.

3. Keep a log.
After school, write down:
	•	What she said/did
	•	How it made you feel
	•	If anyone else witnessed it
That way, if things don’t get better and you need to go to the counselor or principal again, you have proof of a pattern.

4. You’re not weak for being scared. You’re strong for showing up.
Just the fact that you’re choosing to go to school and face someone who makes you uncomfortable takes a lot of bravery. Please remember that.

If you want, I can help you write something short to give or say to the counselor before class, so you don’t have to explain everything all over again. Or I can help you make a log template to keep track of what happens.
You’re not alone in this, okay?

You said:
i know but if i give a response like , i understand or okay, she will take it as a sarcastic remark , and get even angrier . but she is very mean and sarcastic lady herself.

ChatGPT said:
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense—and honestly, that’s a really unfair double standard. She gets to be sarcastic and mean, but when you stay calm or say something short, she takes it the wrong way? That’s not right at all.
So here’s the trick: we’ll come up with a few things you can say that are respectful, clear, and neutral, but still protect you from getting blamed for being “sarcastic” or “disrespectful.”
Here are a few calm, mature responses that might help you in the moment:

If she accuses you of something:
	•	“I hear you.”
	•	“I’ll do better moving forward.”
	•	“Thank you for letting me know.”

If she cuts you off or doesn’t let you explain:
	•	“Okay, I’ll wait until you’re ready to hear my side.”
	•	“I understand. Can we talk about this with a counselor later?”

If she yells or gets aggressive:
	•	“I’m not trying to be disrespectful. I just want to understand and do the right thing.”
	•	“I’m listening.”

These are calm and non-sarcastic—but also grown-up responses, and sometimes that kind of quiet maturity can catch adults off guard in a good way. And if she still takes it the wrong way, that’s on her, not you. Just remember everything she says or does that feels off, and talk to the counselor or assistant principal again after class.
And if you're ever really uncomfortable and feel like it's getting bad, you can respectfully ask:
“Can I please go to the counselor?”
They can’t legally ignore that request if you're truly not feeling safe or okay in the moment.

Want me to help you write a super short note or message to give to the counselor first thing in the morning? Something like:
“Hi, I’m really anxious about being in [teacher’s name]’s class today. I’ve already come to you about how she treats me, and I’m scared it’s going to be worse now. Can I check in with you or get support before I go into that class?”
Let me know, and I’ll help you wor",User_deleted,1

My main issue was that a 30-mark program we were expected to write and assemble was only explained in a 15-minute video. That’s it. No proper lecture, no walkthroughs, and barely any meaningful support—just a short video. As an international student with no programming or computer systems background, I tried to keep up, but it felt like we were set up to fail from the beginning. ( 6000 $ for this horrific Woodside diarrhoea ahh shit)

I wouldn’t even complain if we were given enough materials. Instead, I'm left feeling like I’m just dumb when,, in reality, the support and teaching weren’t there. In class, the accent of some staff was extremely difficult to understand, and asking for help felt pointless because you couldn’t even follow the explanation. Most of the time, other students in Ed were more helpful than the actual TAs.

In Workshop Part 2 (which should’ve been the easier part), I asked a TA a question, but she couldn’t answer. When I had a technical issue, another TA was completely confused. At first, I thought maybe they were limited in what they could help with—but no, it was clear they just didn’t understand the assignment themselves.

My friends smashed the assignment, but they’re already doing LeetCode regularly and have solid coding foundations. I’ve only been learning this stuff for three weeks. How is that a fair comparison? How are we being assessed the same way? ( not to mention she was also struggling)

Also, students turn to ChatGPT when even the professors and TAs can’t explain things clearly or communicate in English correctly. I understood more in a random Data Science workshop taught by an Aussie TA with no coding background than in any FIT1047 session.

Ironically, FIT1057 had mostly non-native speakers (I think many of them are Persian?)—but they explained everything so clearly and were incredibly helpful. That shows it’s not about accent or background—it’s about communication, transparency, and knowing the material.

Anyway, I’m dropping it and continuing with science ( most schools under it are native-speakers or Indians with good accents). I plan to submit a formal complaint after I get my final results. I'm just glad it’s over.
 



Also please stop calling us dumb or GPT-dependent when you don't know that the assignment has been changed since last year. If I had your assignment, I wouldn't have complained either",User_deleted,26
1jz195a,183,2025-04-14,"Dropped out of SUTD, got accepted into SIT",u/Anxious_Cup_5715,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1jz195a/dropped_out_of_sutd_got_accepted_into_sit/,"Its been 8 mths since I dropped out of SUTD Comp Sci. My headspace wasnt in the right place. In hindsight, it was a mistake because this 8 mths since, I've been working, exposed me to the real life in SG. Without a degree, it's extremely hard to survive.

I dunno how other guys did it, but I just couldn't cope with the speed of uni after I finished NS. Becos it was just 2 weeks after I ORDed, without much time to adapt back to real life. Was completely overwhelmed with uni.

The first week learning physics & other stuff not related to comp sci. My mind just got blown. After 15 mins of intro to the modules, profs just gave a tonne of content. I tried catching up. But I fell behind instantly. Couldn't cope with anything in there.

Second week grew worse. Profs started introducing projects & other contents. My mind just melted. Again, couldn't really get a hold of it. By the midway of week 2, I just couldn't cope with it. Even trying to use chatgpt & trying to seek help from the profs & coursemates didn't help me either.

Felt that all the profs were speaking some weird language. I sat in the library trying to catch up on the content, but it was a losing battle for me. The slides & videos were bashing my head in. Couldn't take it anymore.

Decided u know what, screw it & just drop out. I can't even make it the first 2 weeks, how'll I make it even one year. So I emailed the admin that I will like to withdraw from the program.

I guess all local unis in SG will give students a 2 week buffer period that if you withdraw within those 2 weeks, you don't have to pay any tuition fees, and won't affect your MOE uni subsidy.

After some consultation sessions with the programme lead, one of the SUTD student support counsellor and was finally asked again by the admin if I'd like to reconsider my decision, I said no & I would like to withdraw.

Because I thought to myself, if I fail, I will fail very badly. Will mess up multiple modules and cause me to extend uni, cost more in tuition fees for myself.

The withdrawal process took slightly over 2 weeks. I handed in my SUTD student cards and also said goodbye to the campus.

Life after withdrawing from uni was extremely tough. Searching for jobs was extremely hard. No one would take me in with a poly diploma. The first 3 mths, I was doing Grab, Foodpanda, Lalamove for 3 mths. Worked like crazy. 9-10 hrs a day. Earnt barely 3k to sustain myself while searching for a tech job.

After that through one of my friends help, managed to land a decent job at a small tech firm which I've been with for the last 5 mths. Earning higher than usual diploma grads, 3.3k. Work is tough as usual, but much more better than doing deliveries.

My headspace is in the right place as well now. Managed to get a handle of life as well.

Recently went to interview for SMU & SIT Comp Sci. Since I had declared in my application that I was previously in SUTD, they asked a lot of qns as to why I dropped out of uni and if I am now better prepared to cope now.

I knew that such qns would come up. I just had to skirt around the qns by saying that I was dealing with some personal & family problems. The profs showed some sympathy & after that heard nth from them.

I didn't expect to be accepted into uni, but just today got the email from SIT with the PDF letter attached:  
We are pleased to inform you that your application to Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) is successful and we are offering you a place in the following programme in Academic Year 2025:  
**Bachelor of Science (Hons) in Computing Science**

I went on the application portal and accepted the offer.

I don't expect to get any acceptance offer from SMU. But nvm, any local uni is gd for me. SIT Comp Sci is 3 yrs compared to SUTD's 4 yrs. But each degree programme has their own merits, designed by the respective unis. So cant compare which is better.

But I've to thank SIT becos they gave me a second chance in life. Didn't expect them to accept a uni dropout.

Right now I am more than committed to see through this degree this time. I'm better prepared now. My headspace is clearer now, and I'm sure that this time I'll see this through.

Second time is the charm for some I guess.",active,208

You guys just put shit in a generator and it pixelates some garbage for you and post it as your own. Did you put any time or effort into it??? No?? Yeah you're just..robbing from real artists. 

People's art ISN'T PUBLIC USE. Nobody gave the AI permission to use their artwork to learn from, and make public use. REAL artists shouldn't have to try and defend their hard work from a computer making it public use. Real artists shouldn't have to worry about having to defend that their art isn't AI because AI learned from their art. 

It's not fair. You can draw, you just don't want to put it in the time or energy to actually LEARN HOW. I've struggled as an artist so much, believing I straight up just couldn't draw so many times. But I've never had an ai generate it for me

And Ai can help with art!! It can give you character ideas, color pallettes, and maybe even different poses. But you're never going to get anything substantial if all you're doing is typing in prompts and getting soulless garbage 

You wanna know what else isn't fair?? Chatgpt doing everything for students. Before if I used ""smart"" vocab words like eloquent, respite, myriad, pension, representative, I was praised! Because I actually knew these words. Now?? There's the possibility of some website my teacher uses flagging it as AI. Or the teacher thinking it's AI because it's ""too good""

Right now we have future fucking doctors, lawyers, brain surgeons, teachers, vetnarians- using fucking chatgpt to pass their classes. Does that NOT scare you?? Are you perfectly okay with the guy that one day may need to defend you in a case cheating his way through his classes using AI?? What about someone who may need to do surgery on you someday?? Teach your children basic education?? 

And what about people who actually TRIED being punished for it?? So what, now I'm supposed to dumb down my hard work or else people will think I just typed a prompt into an ai generator??

Instead, what I've noticed as a (now) past student, is that everything else has gone to shit. I went through too many classes where subject material was barely or improperly covered, and then been handed large homework assignments that take hourssss to do ""authentically"" using improperly vetted sources with questions that don’t actually correlate. And then tests for those classes are based off the aforementioned assignments (where all the answers were based off the poorly paired source) and the subject matter taught in class was just ""background info"" or completely disregarded entirely. And even in the situation of having ChatGPT write essays for you (which I do believe is wrong) is a result of quickly and poorly being taught advanced methods, then being held to college rubrics the average high school student couldn’t possibly understand.

I'm 18, 12th grade and from an Asian country that feels completely disconnected from the world that even registering a phone number on ChatGPT is blocked here, along with a few other ""fucked up"" places.  

Our education system is brutal. Your entire future hinges on a single, hyper-competitive university entrance exam, where even a tiny difference in scores can change your life.  

As a liberal arts student, I’m forced to memorize useless textbooks just for grades. In 10th grade, I barely studied; in 11th, I worked nonstop. But now, in the most critical year, I’m slacking off. I switched to homeschooling for more study time, but it backfired—our teachers were bad, and self-discipline was hard.  And it's all my fault. 

Worst of all? The entrance exam I’m taking isn’t even the major I'm getting its diploma. I'm taking English literature's entrance exam (it has different questions from Liberal arts and a little easier but the competition is still very, very fierce). Everything is just… messed up.  
I'm struggling to get my motherfucking diploma, how the hell am I gonna get a good ranking? The good news is that my score on liberal arts lessons doesn't matter and doesn't determine my ranking, but still. 

I feel like I'm collapsing. Just opening a book fills me with unbearable stress—sometimes even suicidal thoughts. I'm completely burned out, and unprepared, and everything keeps getting worse.  

I don’t know what to do. Should I cram everything in 4 days? Is that even possible? Sigh.

I apologise in advance if this sounds like a long-winded post full of complaints. What I need here is community wisdom from Reddit to help me get out of this eternal Groundhog Day. I don't have a well-defined question to ask you all but would appreciate any input. I wake up every morning thinking how I could just end life. It is a terrible feeling and tears fall down my face as I am writing this post.

I graduated in 2021 with a master's in biotech from France. First of all, I fucked up majorly by not continuing postgrad in UK where I did my undergrad as the quality of teaching and opportunities are just so much better there. Second, the whole period of the grad degree was COVID lockdown 1/2/3/4. I fell into depression 2 months before COVID even happened but the opportunity to intern at Princeton U kept me going. Obviously, a week after my visa got approved, the program got cancelled due to COVID. What I got instead was 6 months of living at home, sharing the same bedroom with my parents because we literally have no money being new immigrants.

So for 2 years I studied from home and graduated not having learnt a thing. Starting that time, I also developed binge eating disorder that stays with me to this day. I would eat until I feel sick, hate myself and do it again. The lab that hosted me for my gradute project offered a one-year contract so I stayed on. After that I just felt so useless and unmotivated about the whole life sciences research thing so I decided not to pursue another contract with them. My manager elft me on the side the whole time I was there and made it clear that my project was a useless pile of shit that no one cares about. Full of confidence that I could find something with the degrees I hold, I said goodbye to the lab.

To sustain my worthless little life living in Paris, I started working as a part-time waitress while tutoring online and volunteering once a week at a local charity. The waitressing job was horrible to say the least. My colleagues were all male, older and my managers would yell at me for the smallest thing, while always telling me to 'smile more'. I stood up with overbearing, impolite and belittling customers every day and gave up on having a social life because my shifts ended at midnight. However, my working visa was still to be issued so I had no choice but to stay with them.

The next year, I left the restaurant for another one. Significantly better working environment, good tips but I was then a full time waitress who worked 7 days a week counting tutoring. I kept up volunteering at the local charity as I saw it as my 'social' time but it was a full-day's worth of work and I was at a soup kitchen, so very physically demanding as well. I kept sending applications to the most generic jobs (like project coordinator, analyst etc) but only ever get nos or no replies at all. Very rarely, I have a first interview but none of them ever get back to me. I am also reluctant to put waitressing in my CV to explain this huge career gap because of job biases. To be honest, waitressing was more challenging physically, mentally and intellectually (quick-thinking, EQ) than anything I've ever done but if you haven't done it before you wouldn't understand. 

9 months later, I got into a bike accident on my way to the restaurant from tutoring the last student of the week. It was a sunny Sunday afternoon. At that time, I was homeless as well, moving from place to place every two weeks, living out of my backpack and trying to save on rent by dogsitting. After the accident, I couldn't walk for weeks and had to rely on friends for food, cleaning, accommodation etc.

Now I am two months post-op, still can't walk without crutches, still without a job. I work with ChatGPT to do personalised cover letters, CVs, etc but I feel like I am talking to a wall whenever I send out an application. At this point, I send without expecting any response from anyone at all. I even think that maybe, my CV is simply so worthless and I am so useless and unemployable. My friends from school and university all have proper jobs, high salaries, nice life travelling now and then, and I can't even walk!

I don't know what I am doing wrong and I don't know how and if I can ever get out of this eternal hell.

I'm not saying this because it's unethical, or I think others are taking advantage of it for college while I'm not. NO. I'm fucking dependent on it. And I hate it. It's honestly like an addiction. I can't think as a programmer, these LLMs messed me up so much.

I've grown up watching YouTube videos of people programming stuff, games, scripts, genetic algorithms, cool projects, etc. And they all seemed to know what what to do next, what to think. And I'm excluding the guys who have long careers, I'm talking about guys who were also in Highschool or in College like I now am.

I look back to them and think, I'm so dumb, I can't think on this crap. I made the worst decision of my life two years ago to start using ChatGPT and now look where I am, I don't know how to program and I keep passing my courses. This is my last semester and my BsC is done. I have a horrible ""GPA"", ofc, my average grade is 12/20 (this is how we measure it in Portugal). This is nothing. I barely know stuff. My best grade was 17/20 on OOP course and the second highest was a 14/20 on a writing course, next best was 13 and they're mostly between 13 and 10.

Some professors expect us to use them ""Use and abuse"" as one of them told us. So we do. But then we learn nothing.

I spent 3 years ""learning stuff"" and so little of theory and so little of practice stuck. Is there anyway out of here? I'm gonna continue in college for a Masters, they facilitate the entry here, so it's basically guaranteed (not 100%). I want to at least finish that without using AI, but I think I can't. Even the best students of my year where their grade average is above 18, they still use LLMs, not as much as me, but still do.

Has anyone else been where I am? I want to get out of this stupid loop. I know I'm capable of better, I just don't know how to get out of this crap. I'm not even worried about not getting a job, I'm worried about spending 3 years of my life barely learning anything. I don't want to spend another 3 trying to overcome my difficulties.",active,368

No. I refuse. Call me a Luddite, but I still refuse
.
Firstly because, much like flipped classrooms, competency-based assessments, integrating gamification in your class, and whatever new-fangled method of teaching people come up with, they only work when the instructors put in the effort to do them well. Not every instructor, lecturer, professor, can hear of a bright new idea and successfully apply it. Sorry, the English Language professor who has decided to integrate chatgpt prompts into their writing assignments is a certified fool. I’m sure they’re not doing it in a way that is actually helpful to the students, or which follows the method he learnt through an online webinar in Oxford or wherever (eyeroll?)

Secondly, this isn’t just ‘simplifying’ a process of education. This isn’t like the invention of Google Scholar, or Jstor, or Project Muse, which made it easier for students and academics to find the sources we want to use for our papers or research. ChatGPT is not enhancing accessibility, which is what I sometimes hear argued. It is literally doing the thinking FOR the students (using the unpaid, unacknowledged, and incorrectly-cited research of other academics, might I add). 

I am back to mostly paper- and writing-based assignments. Yes, it’s more tiring and my office is quite literally overflowing with paper assignments. Some students are unaccustomed to needing to bring anything other than laptops or tablets to class. I carry looseleaf sheets of paper as well as college-branded notepads from our PR and alumni office or from external events that I attend). I provide pens and pencils in my classes (and demand that they return them at the end of class lol). I genuinely ask them to put their phones on my desk if they cannot resist the urge to look at them—I understand; I have the same impulses sometimes, too!
But, as good is my witness, I will do my best to never have to look at, or grade, another AI-written assignment again.

* The assignment was to pretend you are writing a sales letter, and offer a ‘special offer’ of any kind to a guest. It’s supposed to be fun and light. You can choose whether to offer the guest a free stay the hotel, complimentary breakfast, whatever! It was part of a much larger project related to Communications in a Customer Service setting. It was literally a 3-line email, and the student couldn’t be bothered to do that.",active,597

Option 3 helped, but overloaded me with grading and I got super behind. Grading 40ish reading guides peer week is not something I can manage. On top of that, I noticed that many of the answers were just generated by ChatGPT and I do not want to read ChatGPT’s answers to questions.

This semester, I’m back to posting the readings with an accompanying reading guide. Out of 40, I think 3-4 read the assigned articles. (I should add that I assign a range of readings. Sometimes it’s a journal article, sometimes it’s a popular press article that takes 10 minutes to read.)

this one prof i have, only makes us watch youtube videos of the lessons about her subject. after that, we'd have to recite what we learned from the video in an online meeting while blindfolded. so given my backstory earlier, i took note of all the topics discussed in the video she sent, and summarized it in a paragraph that i can easily remember. idk what is it with her but when it was my turn to recite my learnings, she assumed that it was generated by chatgpt, which i dont even use. 💀 i think it was because it was purely english, which is troubling because why do you look down on your students so much to the point that you dont think they can come up with points like that by themselves without the use of ai? she also added na ""ginagamit ko na chatgpt bago niyo pa nalaman yan, kaya wag niyo tinatry gamitin yan sa subject ko. panoorin niyo yung mga videos."" i didnt even know that it has advanced so much that you can use it in that way?

The student openly admitted to using ChatGPT, so there’s no disputing their use of it.

This student has also missed more than the max number of classes they can miss (which drops them a whole letter grade), but have come forward in the last few weeks to tell me it was because of health reasons. I referred them to the syllabus, which states it is the student’s responsibility to notify me if something is going  to impact the quality of their work *before* it becomes an issue. They said they previously contacted their academic advisor regarding their illness. What I contacted the academic advisor, they said the only reason the student came forward about being “ill” is because the advisor reached out to them. Turns out the advisor is also a professor for a class in which the student is enrolled. The advisor/professor only reached out because the student’s academic performance began to suffer. This is not something the student offered up before it impacted their work.

Then, same student claims a family member passes away the day before a major assignment is due - an assignment which already had a 1-week extension for the due date. I gave the student a 24 hour date extension. Needless to say, I have been more than accommodating this semester.

I have a class of 65+ students and I’m a PhD student - if I don’t get an email about it, I won’t remember. And even then sometimes I need a reminder. I was so over it when I read this message. I sent them an email asking them to reflect on the tone of their messages to me, as it does not reflect communication that is expected from a student-instructor interaction. Radio silence since.

 I feel like I’m being emotionally abused, and it’s exhausting. I see why people get so burned out from teaching. My reviews from students are stellar, and I recently won an award from the university for my teaching. I know I’m doing well. I know I have the syllabus on my side (it’s iron-clad with a student signature page stating they are aware and accept the conditions of the document). 

I can’t go back on my word about accommodating the absences with a letter from a physician or extending extra credit, but I want to since they’ve been so incredibly ungrateful. I don’t want to send them emails reminding them about these options either. But I’m worried they are the kind of student that will try to make trouble for me.

1k9dlh6,20,2025-04-27,"Wall Street Journal: Prompt Engineering is already ""obsolete"" as job (link in body). This is an important indicator how fast the market is changing and why you need to be extremely skeptical of ""Gen AI"" and bootcamps pivoting from SWE to AI.",u/michaelnovati,codingbootcamp,https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/1k9dlh6/wall_street_journal_prompt_engineering_is_already/,"[https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-hottest-ai-job-of-2023-is-already-obsolete-1961b054](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-hottest-ai-job-of-2023-is-already-obsolete-1961b054)

While the headline sounds bad, the article discusses all of the other AI-related jobs that are in-demand, but the overall lesson is to be super careful about pivoting too quickly into ""AI"" - both for students and for bootcamps.

RE: Prompt engineering ""It was an expertise all existing employees can be trained on"" according to one source in the article.

Instead of being completely doom and gloom, I want to explore ideas and solutions. Unfortunately, these all have problems, but I'm trying to show that I'm looking at this thoughtfully and not just dooming and glooming.

**SOLUTION ATTEMPT 1: Bootcamp pivots to ""Gen AI"" bootcamp instead of SWE bootcamp**

I would be extremely critical and look into detail what exactly you are paying for, because I suspect a lot of SWE bootcamps - faced with crashing enrollment - will take advantage of people's interest in AI and offer these AI courses.

The problem is 

1. lack of expertise in the people teaching and creating the materials. 

2. AI makes it possible to generate the materials themselves now, so why pay thousands of dollars for this!

3. Everything changes so fast that what you do will be obsolete.

I could see a world where a free or $100 AI course is offered and $1000 of mentorship can be added on for personal guidance or something, but charging $10K, $20K for an AI bootcamp is crazy right now.

**SOLUTION ATTEMPT 2: Bootcamp teaches ""general capacities/non-specific skills"" that will ""apply to every job"".**

The other option for a failing bootcamp is to not teach any specific technical skills and instead focusing on teaching you ""how to learn"" or how to ""problem solve"".

I think this is more promising, but ultimately this is what college was always meant to do and it doesn't directly lead to a job at the end.

*If I spend 10 weeks intensively building problem solving skills, why does that make me a hirable engineer?*

Maybe such a course is like a part time $200 type learning and development type course, but is this something you pay $23,000 for??!? No.

**CONCLUSION**

The 12-16 week SWE bootcamp  is dead. What comes next? Well AI is moving too fast for anyone to know for sure, and what works today might not work tomorrow.

On the other hand, there is a lot of room much cheaper and less job-related courses and programs to come out.

Spending $2000 for 12 weeks to learn generative AI skills with accountability you can't get with ChatGPT? Maybe.

But when bootcamps spend thousands of dollars to acquire you as a student (THIS IS AN ACCURATE FIGURE) then the bootcamp model doesn't really work for this. It's more of a MOOC model.",active,25
