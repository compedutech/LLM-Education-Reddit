After facing endless rejections in web development, I decided to switch lanes to iOS Development and Machine Learning (since I have a better chance and I'm more competitive there). Sounds good, right? 
In a plot twist I didn't see coming, I accidentally applied full-time position (thinking it was an internship spot) at this fancy Swiss fintech company that's basically the Google of my city. Realized my mistake only after getting an interview call and now, I'm on the verge of a panic attack. If I mess this up, I'm not just rejected; I'm practically blacklisted. Plus, I need an internship to graduate, and my university's about to make that mission impossible with their new partnership rules. Could use some serious advice on how to handle this without obliterating my future. Thoughts?
---

Hi guys, hope the job market is treating you alright and isn't absolutely hellish like it is in Macedonia.   

### Backstory
---

To give you a little backstory, I'm a 4th year Software Engineering student in North Macedonia, and I've been applying to a lot of places for internships in my city (the capital it has the most jobs etc.). I've been rejected from all of them *(some have been right away; some have been in the 2nd or 3rd interview round)*. All of these positions were for web development internships...
After a lot of frustration and lack of communication and honest feedback from companies I decided to look elsewhere in terms of a career path *(since I'm still young and haven't really set roots anywhere, also my CV is not competitive in web dev compared to my colleagues and competition in the job market)*. The paths I've chosen to pursue are **IOS Development** *(bought a course on UDEMY for that and learning that atm. also there is a lot less competition in my city, but also a lot less open job positions let alone internships for IOS; I think it's a really cool platform to program and I was also able to set up XCODE on a QEMU VM so I don't need a mac)* and **Machine Learning** because I'm working on a research paper in the field which is to be published in May. I have hands on experience with supervised learning and I really think the whole field is awesome and extremely vast so you can work on a lot of cool engineering problems with it.
Also, I'd like to add that it's become so bad here that during a job fair at my collage a company had to close their stand after 3 days because they had 250 applications for a QA position, and they couldn't take any more applicants... I love you QA guys, you make software good but usually no one wanted these jobs, and they would always stay vacant.

### The Mix-Up
---

What happened was because of my frustration I started mass applying to any open position for an internship regardless of if it was for something that interested me or not. I applied to what is basically a tier FAANG company in my city *(a Swiss fintech company with its biggest branch in my city; it's a prestige to work in that company and also, it's really desirable because the best talent from the city is there. It's really major for your career imo)*. I got a call two days later and scheduled an interview for this Wednesday. Now all was dandy until I got to talk with a senior dev at that company, which holds interviews for web dev positions (he was the bf of my friend, which was a coincidence and we got to talk about my interview).
**Finally, after my wall of text comes my point/dilemma**. 
I applied for a job position and NOT an internship position. Meaning that the interview will be completely different (different level and expectations). Now to top that off the senior dev guy told me that they give candidates a grade based on the interview. If you get a low grade, they essentially black list you, next time if you apply, they will probably see that you had a bad grade and not even call you. They are also one of a few companies in my city that offer an IOS dev. internship.

### What the heck do I do?
---

I'm super stressed out and have absolutely no idea on what to do. As seen from the wall of thoughts that have been coming from my head above. I have no idea what I should do or say. And how I should act or communicate this to my interviewers on Wednesday. 
This is what ChatGPT told me:
```
 Early in the interview, clarify the misunderstanding. You might say something like, ""I want to be upfront about a mix-up on my part. I applied to this position under the impression it was an internship, which aligns with my current career stage. However, I'm genuinely excited about the opportunity to contribute to [company/project], and I'm open to discussing how we might tailor a role that benefits us both.""
```
Which is cool and all but still doesn't make me less stressed and anxious about messing up this opportunity.
Any advice is welcomed, also any criticism as well. :))



P.S. In order for me to get my diploma from my university I have to have completed at least a 3-month long internship in an IT company *(related to the field of study of my major)*.

P.P.S Starting from October 2024 the university will pass a new ""law"" where the only internships they will recognize will be in companies that are official partners with the university. To become a partner, you have to pay the university on a yearly basis. Meaning that only big companies will be able to do so and that means that all students will compete for these positions *(The IT/CS collage is the biggest in the country and has the most students compared to any other college or university in the country)*.",active,0

I'm also very bad at it. 

As I am too poor to actually travel, my language use is limited to talking to myself and writing on the computer other than Spanish which I actually use. I am also an introvert, so I will not awkwardly strike up a conversation with people in a Chinatown either. So basic phrases often are very useless to me I guess and they don't come up in my studying (which is mostly just reading books/etc and translating the words I don't know, writing them down + grammatical structures), I usually get around to them a while after being able to write, for example, this message in the TL. 

I'm wondering if this is completely unheard of?

Also, I don't like how the U.S. education system introduces students to languages. They make you memorise the basic phrases of course, nothing wrong with that, but it does nothing for your comprehension of the language as they don't teach you what ""Cómo te llamas"" means. It doesn't mean ""what's your name,"" it means ""how do you call  yourself."" This leads to kids saying things like ""Mi llamo *es* John."" Hasta luego doesn't mean see you later, it means until later. This leads to ""Yo hasta la escuela"" as an attempt for ""I see the school.""",User_deleted,2

There's another recent thread on here that is quite popular promoting turninit's AI detection.  Vanderbilt studied this with 75000 papers and proved it doesn't work.  Any expert in the field will tell you turnitin is just playing on the public's ignorance about how Chat GPT functions. They banned faculty from using turnitin's AI detection.  We shouldn't be allowing the promotion of tools that are proven not to work beyond any reasonable doubt.

Look I get it.  I hate ChatGPT and have struggled with policing it in my class. I'm still figuring it out.  But promoting AI detection would be the equivalent of a teacher coming on here and saying they figured out how to use tarot cards to predict student achievement and then having half the users take them seriously.  

Others have actually made great suggestions like using Google docs.  Not 100% effective but based on something real.  The reaction to AI can't be to promote tools that don't work because it teaches students we don't really care if they actually cheated so they may as well just do it.

So basically we were supposed to write in class essays on chromebooks and I stupidly opened ChatGPT and tried to see if it can write my essay for me. These essays are pretty heavily graded so that’s why I attempted to cheat because I didn’t do well on my last one so I thought cheating would help me do better. So what I basically did was I put in a thesis I wrote hoping it would write the essay for me. I got caught because of the software in like the guardian monitoring thingy. And the worst part is I didn’t even use the chat gpt essay because it was the wrong story part that we were given in prompt. I only really used the essay for like wording (ex: I write the “the cat had a complicated relationship with the dog” ChatGpT writes : “the cat had emotional entanglement with the dog’s personality adding layers to blah blah”). I did that because we get marked off points  if the text is informal and if it’s not sophisticated. However I think it’s very clear if u compare my essay to the ChatGPT one that it is not plagiarized because 1) I did not use any of the textual evidence given from ChatGPT 2) I put my own thesis into ChatGPT 3) the ChatGPT essay had very different points to mine so is it plagiarized? I regret ope ChatGPT so much it was all literally in vain. So now I’m most likely getting a referral and I don’t know how it’s going to affect me!! The teacher said it wouldn’t affect my college decisions or graduation which I think is straight up bs because it will be on my high school documents forever. I think this is the scariest part because I have no idea what referrals really do and I tried searching through Reddit but I couldn’t find anything clear on it. I have no idea what my future holds and the last thing I want to do is just be a waste of space. I deeply regret my actions and my teacher knows this as I completely cried my eyes out in front of him and it sucks because I wrote something completely different from what ChatGPT wrote. I already apologized and pleaded with the teacher but he said he will give me a referral but is thinking of what to do. Which is just really vague which has my hopes up a little because maybe he will just let the referral thing go ??? I will fully accept a 0 on the assignment, but I am scared shitless for the referral. I just don’t know what to do or what to expect because I never had a referral b4 or any past behavioral issues in school. I need advice please!!

P.S: I’m a pretty average student. I am not committed to a college yet but I am probably going to a state. But from my previous Reddit research I don’t think referrals affect ur admission unless it’s a top school? I could be wrong though idek.",active,1

I have witnessed a concerning amount of events of nepotism, grade falsification and failures from teachers which screwed a decent chunk of our cohort. 

- TOK teachers couldn't complete entire marking of all our essays despite 3 months time, gave us all a predicted C. Feedback provided to us was useless shameless feedback from chatgpt. 

- Extended Essay coordinator didn't know anything about IB syllabus nor how to guide on EE. Left Midyear and didn't have any formal guidance from anyone for about 6-8 months. Didn't provide any facilities for experimental science despite claiming to have all requirements.

- Teachers giving their favourite students a chance to write their own teachers comments and grade for their EE's and using it since they were too lazy.

-Multiple students bought their IAs from some service, teacher suggested it to them as they were failing.

- Coordinator giving certain favourite students chances to do large CAS projects while other were not permitted. Threatened and forced entire grade to pay for the project despite not being allowed to participate in it. 

- Claimed predicted grades are based on Mock grades but intentionally reduced those grades for no reason when submitting for UNI apps.

I could write more but I have some questions:
1. I was critical of these actions in school and teachers were aware, if I do a whistleblower and IB investigates. Could it compromise me in any way in terms of grades collection after exams? 

2. Would doing this compromise the next cohorts? Do I need evidence to file these claims?

But we started being able to cope soon enough, from picking up obvious tell-tale AI signs to doing more tests in person. It's not ideal but we managed.

But this next wave of AI apps is completely impossible to deal with. Bullying is absolutely rampant thanks to the advent of websites like Looksrater. In case you're not familiar it's a website where you can submit any picture and get a rating of how attractive you are out of 10. Students are using it to bully each other and building odd little hierarchies from it. 

If we thought Instagram was bad for these poor kids self image wait till we see the damage platforms like this do. We've even had students say out loud in class their teacher's Looksrater rating. It's horrible.

In our school there's absolutely no chance they'd let us ban phones from students. And even if we did they'd just use it outside of school and report back. The best we can do is suspend anyone caught using it but that's been predictably ineffective too. 

I'm honestly lost on how to tackle this in my class. I feel for the students who are going to have to grow up worrying about stuff like this, I never did when I was young, it seemed being young was easier back then. 

Considering just how much damage this simple site did to our school I'm terrified for students in the future. Imagine the damage deepfakes could do once they're easy to use.

1c6lvii,5,2024-04-17,I’m in school and I’m not retaining much of anything. Am I screwed?,u/-i--am---lost-,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1c6lvii/im_in_school_and_im_not_retaining_much_of/,"So I’ll try to keep this concise, but I have a tendency to give too much information and write walls of text. 

I’m 29 and a little over half way through my bachelors degree in Business Administration. It’s been a long road to get here. I did terrible in high school (1.6 GPA at grad) and had no idea what to do after graduation, except that I “wanted to be rich.” I was young and oh so dumb. No clue how the world worked. I eventually started smoking a lot of weed, developed depression, lost all my friends, and lived with my parents doing nothing but video games and a shitty part time job. Dug myself into a deep credit card debt hole buying lots of bullshit. Still working my way out of it, but making progress. 

Fast forward to my 26th birthday, and I finally decided it was time to try and grow up. I quit weed and enrolled in community college. It was a very rough start. Eventually got into the swing of things and took classes while working. Around 27 I got my first corporate job at a large local company. Started VERY entry level, no degree requirement, job. Started to get noticed early on and then promoted. 

Fast forward to today and I’m currently in another division in an entry level role, but it’s one that typically requires a degree. The money is fine but by no means great. Maybe great for someone without a degree or prior experience, like a recent college grad. But I’m about to turn 30. 

Now, to my main question and concern. While I’m “technically” doing OK in school (3.0 gpa), most of that has been from lenient grading and some cheating here and there (ChatGPT 4 has been a godsend). I absolutely hate school and am literally only here because I want a 4 year degree for backup. I was diagnosed with ADHD as a kid, but I have an atypical version of it, I’d say. I’m not jittery or super inattentive. I remember where I put basically everything except the occasional thing, which I think is normal. I don’t lose stuff. But I can’t seem to do well as a student. 

It sucks because I LOVE learning. I’m super curious and research everything and anything that I come across. I don’t retain most of it, which might be ADHD and might be brain rot from years of weed and instant gratification via internet and phone, but the desire is definitely there. I know how to dig for info (or so I think I do). But remembering it can be hard, and it’s especially hard in school, where I resist learning like a kid asked to eat broccoli. It’s like nothing has changed since high school. I still put off work and scramble at the last minute, creating mediocre at best work. 

Right now I’m doing a lot of business analytics and statistics courses, and they’re probably the worst I’ve done in college so far. I’m not taking my time to learn these things, so I just end up using ChatGPT or learning just enough in a night to complete an assignment right before it’s due. If you asked me to tell you what I’ve learned, I literally couldn’t tell you. Maybe a couple things if you jogged my memory, but nothing feels applicable with my current understanding. 

I know math is important in entrepreneurship, and I was reading threads on here that talked about the importance of knowing statistics and algebra. I’m feeling very depressed and angry at myself right now for not “properly” learning any of this. I don’t even remember anything from micro or macroeconomics. 

It’s making me feel like I’ll never make it in entrepreneurship, if I were to give it a try. 

After writing this, I don’t really know what my question is. Maybe to vent, but really I think I just want advice or wisdom. Will being a super curious individual be enough to succeed if an opportunity arises? ",User_deleted,5

But I'm not your average comp sci student, i got into it due to my passion of creating products, but uni hasn't been liked this, focusing on theoretical coding/math which I'm extremely bad at (Ive always been like this). I've barely passed most of my courses through memorization, asking many questions, and spending lots of time through brute force. I haven't truely learnt or understood much. I don't know, I've just always been like this since school, I can put lots of time into things I'm passionate about, but not efficiently or with good coding standards.

As such, I'm not confident in my abilities so I'm not looking forward to getting my first job (I've been on the doll). I will have like 30k in HECs, and 25k in the bank by graduation, which I'm at a crossroads of putting into HISA or ETFs but that isn't the point of this post.

I also have had been amazed by stuff like chatgpt, I've kept up with all of the research and developments. It's been a light in the tunnel, but also a dark one, for someone like me who isn't smart. Dark in the sense that if I take a gap year, I'm almost sure ill come back to systems which are nearing the point of making me obsolete in the work force. It might not be there yet but its semantics at that point, it'll happen in the next year or two if it isn't.

However, it is also amazing because it can then help me to create all the ideas I have, and I could be some baby enterpreneur. I would LOVE if it worked out like this and i could finance it.

And I havent really gotten to travel. I've been told if I travel after graduating it'll be harder for me to find a job afterwards. This is concerning because I'm already not confident in finding a job. And my friends and family will keep asking me what I'm doing and I just hate that, I just want to be left alone. And I genuinely think I'll only get to work a couple of years before AI makes me pointless in the workforce. It sounds nice for me to travel for X months and come back to a different reality where i can see where my skills may be needed elsewhere. As for my travelling, I'm not sure where I'd go yet, but I'd love to backpack solo and travel on the cheapest of shoestrings. By working while I'm overseas (even though i've never worked before) and couch surfing, or pet sitting, or sleeping in a hamac, id hopefully limit costs so that I won't be taking $ out of the bank. also not sure how long i could go for but the more the merrier I say? I'll practice it in australia before before going overseas.

And most importantly, expectations of my future and my wants/needs:

I do not care to have a family, I do not care for a house, I'd much rather a hotel next to public transit in a walkable city. I don't have a car and I don't plan on getting one (I have my license but I just hate driving so I don't). I really hate the rat race of society which is likely why ive not worked a day in my life or done too well at uni. How I've been treated while on the doll has reaffirmed this, and mental health has declined just from this idea of how people treat you differently. It's actually made me want to work **less** because I'm really stubborn and if someone annoys or patronizes me I **hate** taking their advice. I would rather sacrifice my livelihood by living as cheaply as possible while still feeling secure by having access to necessities ie food/power/sleep then to constantly focus on money. For what? Just so I can afford to eat out, shop and buy junk or go on some extravagent travel? I'd rather cook something myself (even if I dont have many of the skills atm), only buy necessities that I really really need, or go on cheap travels and experience the country in a less touristy manner. As such, I do not really care if i get 200k, 100k or 50k as my annual income, I already don't spend money as is (Thats how ive got 20k in the bank without working. I do live with my parents though.). All I really want and value is time, so I can focus on other parts of my life.

Also, I have like 0 life skills but im willing to learn if i'm not patronized constantly, which is the main reason I haven't up until now. That's a big reason why I want to travel and work overseas or live with others.

I don't want the curriculum to adapt to the usage of these language models. I want professors to find a way to eliminate it's usage among students entirely. I truly believe it's have a net negative result in academia.

I attend a community college. My major is IT and I cannot trust that the majority of my classmates know what they're talking about. It's almost maddening and I have to believe that if ChatGPT did not exist that these same students would have either tried to actually engage with the material or drop out entirely.

I had to do a group project for one of my network engineering classes. Fine. Upon meeting with the group it became increasingly evident that none of them knew anything about the class. They'd struggle to define the very basics to me and some of them hadn't even setup their development environments. This is the final project, worth 50% of my grade, and all of the work that my groupmates produced was both GPT generated and of poor quality.

There's no functional utility to be had by using ChatGPT to generate your code for you when you're a STUDENT LEARNING the basics of a programming paradigm/essay structure/project management etc. I've tried to have these conversations irl with my friends but they truly believe that they're benefiting from learning the material via ChatGPT.",User_deleted,16

I've been teaching courses online since the start of online teaching years ago. I'd like to think I know what I'm doing. But after this semester, I'm legit stymied.

* If I assign a paper, they use ChatGPT (even reflection papers) and my university doesn't support us in pursuing academic dishonesty claims for AI written work. 
* If I assign a discussion board, they use ChatGPT and...still no university support. 
* If I assign a test, they copy it and put it on CourseHero or Quizlet or Chegg or whatever it is. (I'm on all of them with burner accounts; my stuff is readily avail. (Note also: we don't offer lockdown browser.)
* If I assign even simple-completion exercises, they use ChatGPT rather than thinking for themselves about a topic. 
* Sure, I can assign a creative endeavor (e.g. an infographic, a vlog, etc.) but I still see ChatGPT in there (or hear it as they're obviously reading the ChatGPT generated script from an off-camera source next to their laptops).

I have one class online rn where *no less* than 75% of them are cheating their way through the class.

I know I should stop caring more than my employer does because I get paid either way, but it's way easier to say that than to embrace it.

I'm sincere when I ask this: **what are people doing with their online classes to make students maintain even a shred of academic integrity in this environment ?** 

I'm open to redesigning this course, I just don't know how anymore. Every trick I have in my arsenal I've been outsmarted on. ",active,134
1cbdzgc,2,2024-04-23,Class did bad on an assignment and now is freaking out ,u/firewall245,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1cbdzgc/class_did_bad_on_an_assignment_and_now_is/,"I suppose this is the bed I made and now need to lie in. I teach a proof based math class for computer science majors, so many students struggle with thinking in the way that is required for the problems.

As such, my office hours the days that assignments are due are filled with students asking for help because they are struggling to understand and need heavy hand holding. This also always comes after two weeks of the assignment being posted and getting no emails from anyone at all asking for assistance. This aspect could partially be on me though as since I only teach part time and have a 9-5 my office hours are very limited. 

I normally don’t mind the hand holding as I’d rather them get a walk through from me where they have to learn it, rather than chatGPT where they’d learn nothing. 

That being said this past assignment was a code assignment in which I gave them 2 challenging code problems (one leetcode one icpc) that they had to solve. Due to just extenuating circumstances I was unable to hold office hours for this assignment, but felt confident that since they were CS majors they could figure it out.

Well I was mistaken, the class collectively did horrible. Everyone except two students got the icpc question wrong, and half of the students got the leetcode question wrong, which is also a modified version of a problem that we had gone over in class already in the semester. 

With the second problem I can kind of understand as the wording was fairly confusing, but in the class period before it was due I walked through examples, and nobody reached out over email. I think they were waiting for office hours and when I didn’t hold them they were screwed. 

For the first problem it was a clear case of them not checking their code. Everyone’s solution passed the example test cases in the file, but even basic modifications to them would have shown their solution was wrong. 

Now I’m not sure what to do because it has tanked collectively nearly everyone’s grades by docking around 3.5% from everyone’s final average. 

I feel bad but also frustrated enough where I don’t know if I want to shown mercy by offering extra credit or something ",User_deleted,3
1ccc6nu,4,2024-04-24,[Ontario] Night school online and other online teachers: how do you evaluate?,u/uoftstudent97,CanadianTeachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianTeachers/comments/1ccc6nu/ontario_night_school_online_and_other_online/,"Hey guys,

I'm just wondering for those teachers who teach night school or online, how do you evaluate?

I ask because I notice some students who are doing poorly in my class, and I speak to other teachers and they are doing just as poorly in those classes as well, yet they seem to be getting 80s and 90s in night school online courses.

Another thing is I'm teaching grade 12 university and the students who got their grade 11 university online are very weak, yet their marks were 80s and 90s.

These students must be cheating using ChatGPT (for courses requiring writing) or PhotoMath (for math courses) or any other online artificial intelligence to get their grades.

So, this leads me to ask, are teacher's just letting students cheat on evaluations and assignments because there is no way to know when it is online? Honestly, this is not fair, especially to students who work hard in non-online classes to actually earn their grade. It's so frustrating to me as a teacher because students know they can just take online night school and get an easy 80 or 90 so they can get into the program they want.

Just want the opinions of teachers who have been in the online night school game. Thanks guys.",active,3

I'm a student in 10th grade, and in my classes there's this HELLA annoying girl. She never pays attention (and gets mad when the class calls her out for it), uses ChatGPT (and gets mad when the class calls her out for it), and is generally an attention-seeking spoiled brat. She made fun of me for flying Ryanair (apparently I'm ""poor"" because of the fact), made fun of the war in my country (I'm Ukrainian and several other students in the class are as well) and regularly bodyshames other students, including me. The issue is, sometimes we also say stuff that could kinda be counted as offensive (?) in retaliation. Things like ""French people are weird"" (because she's French) but it was only meant as a JOKE. She's completely serious when she says these things. How should I handle this? All advice is appreciated.",active,1

Sometimes I use ChatGPT 3 but I can see that it isn't as good as was.

I want to get help from my teachers but sometimes it takes 3 or 4 days to be able to mmet them and have some talk about the problem, so I was thinking in the option of paying ChatGPT 4 to help me in maths assignatures.

Do you think ChatGPT 4 is the best AI available to help me to study and be able to leran more and better? Or there is some other better AI that could help me? Or paying ChatGPT 4 i waste my money?

Thanks everyone its very important for me.",User_deleted,0

",u/Funny_Professional85,learnmachinelearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1cdahde/masters_student_but_a_fraud_want_to_make_it_right/,"Hi all, I want to share some stuff that I’m very insecure and ashamed about. But I feel getting it out is needed for future improvement. I’m a masters CS student at a very average public university in the US, I also received my bachelors from there. During my tenure as an undergrad, in the beginning I did well but as I got to the 3rd and 4th year and the classes got harder I did the bare minimum in classes. This means no side projects, no motivation to do any either, no internships, and forgetting everything the moment I turned in an assignment or finished a semester. I kept telling myself that I’ll read upon this fundamental concept and such “later” but later never came and I have a very weak foundation for the stuff I’m doing right now. This means I rely heavily on ChatGPT whenever I get stuck on a problem, which makes me feel awful and dumb, which leads to more bad behavior. I’ve never finished a project that I’m proud of. During my masters I got exposed to ML and took a NLP class which I thoroughly enjoyed mainly cuz of the professor and I want to do research under this professor in Fall 2024, but my programming and especially python skills are sub par and my knowledge of ML is insufficient. I have 3.5 months to build a good foundation and truly learn ML and NLP instead of just using chatGPT the second I don’t understand something. I’m thinking for start, I do the ML specialization course by Andrew NG and complement it by Andrej Karpathy zero to hero playlist on YT. Does anyone have any suggestions or recommendations or if this is a good starting point and what I should do after I finish these courses. I’m tired of being incompetent and I want to change that.
