I really don’t get why people keep saying this. At least from my perspective this is still an incredibly useful tool. For context, I’m a computer science student and I mostly use chatgpt to help me learn and debug code. In that capacity, I haven’t noticed any dip in it’s abilities. I don’t think it’s fair to judge gpt on its ability to generate erotic fanfics or make controversial jokes, as this was not it’s intended purpose. As a productivity tool and information request handler it is still insanely powerful. I also wonder if opinions like this are actually as common as they seem, or if they are just being shared loudly.",active,814

I teach 11th grade honors English and the students were tasked with writing a commentary on their choice of 3 passages from works that we had read throughout the semester. One of my class periods was a nightmare to deal with. Behavioral issues, apathy, failing grades, the works. One student in that class turned in a plagiarized essay. I looked at it and knew immediately because it wasn't a commentary and i quickly found the full essay on a gradesaver type website. I emailed the parents and talked to admin and we decided to let the kid redo the essay. He's mostly a good kid but he struggled in this class environment and was between a C and D in the class. I gave him the option to redo it and this week he turned in his new essay. The problem is the new one still wasn't a commentary and also didn't seem like his voice. I looked at the version history of the document and found that the whole essay had been pasted in the doc in one go. I'm almost certain that this was an AI essay from ChatGPT, but I don't really have any way to prove it. I'm exhausted from dealing with this family and I don't think a passing grade on this essay would really affect the kid's grade much. I'm so tempted to just brush it under the rug and give the kid a C. Do more seasoned teachers have any advice? (I also think the kid's dad is a little harsh because some of the emails he's sent seem extreme and I don't want the kid to suffer too much.

I apologize if this question has already been asked, but do you think AI could replace the job of a K-12 teacher? 

Ever since the wild 2020-2021 school year I’ve never felt more safe from the job potentially being taken over by technology. I’m aware that covid made our jobs infinitely more challenging but could a robot figure out how to navigate our every day realities of designing a curriculum, executing it, managing students, and assessing their knowledge? I could see it making our jobs easier (writing emails) but I cannot see AI dealing with the personalities we deal with every day. 

Zoom was a total disaster and proved that technology like “remote instruction” cannot replace the human connection a teacher provides. 

I’m interested in opinions that challenge my belief, because I believe that teachers are safe for the lifetime of everyone currently in the profession.",User_deleted,0

I solely use it as a template to gain an understanding of how to improve my writing style.(like word choices, outlining the structure,style,etc.)

But this one stupid thought is kinda bothering me. If I keep learning structure, style and wording from AI's writing, that will inevitably impact my style too.

10wjcmd,3,2023-02-07,Watching my college's faculty having a meltdown over ChatGPT is vindictively satisfying,u/TheInvaderZim,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/10wjcmd/watching_my_colleges_faculty_having_a_meltdown/,"I hate school. 12 years of public education and another 10 dropping in and out of college. I'm almost 30, and I'm almost done.

When I was in high school, I hated school for how obligatory it was for me to be there. Regardless of sleep schedule, regardless of practicality, regardless of what I wanted to do or where I wanted to be, fuck you, go to school. It became a game to attend as little as possible and get away with it, and 10 years later, I missed exactly fucking nothing by doing so.

I hated college for the same reason, but by then I could leave. Then after a few years I went back, and repeated, circa 3 times. Now I'm finally almost through and I hate it almost as much as I hated high school. It's still fucking obligatory - not in the sense that I *have* to be there, because I could just quit again if I wanted, but in the sense that nobody cares if the school actually teaches anything. Get on the treadmill, power it with your overpriced tuition, receive piece of job-paper, get off the treadmill.

My reasons for hating the two were different, but in both instances, so much of those reasons boiled down to shitty instructors and a system that does not care about educating.

To be clear, chatGPT is not a revolution, and if you think it is, you're an idiot. It's akin to someone inventing a calculator for paper-writing - you put in components, and the chatbot spits out the result. You could already do what chatGPT does by copying a wikipedia article, rearranging the paragraph structures, and rewording the sentences - it's simply automated the process for doing so.

But watching this garbage system that's *already* burning down around me have a complete *freakout* over the program fills me with joy, because what it *IS* doing is casting light on the dirty problems that the schools themselves have been ignoring for *literally my entire life.* Because if your entire grading system is so lazy, so impersonal, so apathetic, and so completely devoid of meaning, that a student can put a prompt into a chat bot and pass your class, that isn't the chatbot that's the problem - *it's the system.*

Education involves thinking. It involves a learning process that's unique to each student. It involves understanding. It involves rigorous, continuous reinforcement and examination of those three concepts through every medium available, and **if a grade is necessary at all,** the only way it *can* mean anything is by reflecting those processes.

Learning is not standardized tests. It is not 40 students writing virtually identical essays. The programs schools have used as crutches for as long as I can remember could not have less to do with comprehension if they tried, and as a result, they were *rife* with cheating. *Everyone* cheats, at least a little bit, whether class valedictorian or high school dropout, whether it's sharing answers with a friend or memorizing the correct response to a particular question instead of comprehending the topic. Never mind *actual* academic misconduct like plagiarism or stealing an answer key. If your goal is to cheat the learning process, doing so is *simpler, easier and offers a better reward than engaging with it does.*

ChatGPT has not changed any of this - it's only further trivialized it, and apparently we've finally reached a point where schools can't just ignore how hard they're failing their students, anymore.

So heres to the glorified essay-calculator, making life miserable for ripoff institutions that have stolen most of my life from me.",active,2

This feeling has been nagging at me for some time, but I think chatgpt finally pushed me over the edge. 

I've wanted to be in academia since I was a kid. I was infatuated with the idea of a career that celebrates learning and sharing that knowledge. But now that I'm in it, I'm being told that we need to boost recruitment for BA and MA programs. That we need to create slick, easy to understand online programs to attract new students. I'm starting to feel more like a salesman  than an educator.

And the students themselves don't seem to want to learn anything. They want the path of least resistance, or they spend an inordinate amount of time trying to cheat or game the system. And it's becoming harder and harder for me to justify why reading the textbook and some journals and then taking an exam should cost so damn much. It's hard for me to justify the cost and time spent here, so part of me understands their lack of engagement. 

I spent hours and hours trying to prep an engaging online course, and now I'm pretty sure students are using tools like chatgpt to churn out their work. It feels so pointless now. I just don't know anymore.",User_deleted,66

PS - the tools for detecting AI writing are super bad and very easy to completely fool by using different prompts.

The number of students that have been caught cheating on exams is absolutely incredible. Of course, many students are brazenly using ChatGPT to write answers for the most basic questions on their exams. This is despite the language in the syllabi for many courses indicating that using tools like ChatGPT on an exam is an automatic F.

It seems that no matter how clear we are in the language we use about academic integrity and the penalties for violating it, cheating is absolutely becoming more normalized than ever among students. It's the new ""it doesn't hurt to ask."" Now it's ""you might as well try to cheat and see what happens.""

Based on the multitude of similar posts here, I know that I am not alone in experiencing this unprecedented wave of cheating.

The email talked about the importance of creating inclusive environments and taking care of each other, but it was as cold as a robot's circuits. And that's because it was! At the bottom of the email, they even admitted that it was paraphrased from ChatGPT. Oops.

After some understandably furious responses from students, an associate dean at Peabody College apologized for their ""poor judgement"" and acknowledged that using AI to express sympathy was a contradiction of their values.

I am currently in my 2nd trimester over at SIT-Digipen RTIS (Computer Science) and lets just say things are not looking too well for me.

I was initially a Business student from Poly and wanted to try something different. I wanted to have both a business background and also some IT-related technical skills. I loved doing anything that was IT related, such as building PCs and even creating some simple python scripts. Keep in mind that all the coding knowledge I have attained is by just creating my own simple scripts through python. I have not learnt coding from anywhere else. I wanted to challenge myself and thus I joined RTIS. Long story short, it has not been easy at all. I am starting to regret BIG TIME.

Upon joining the course, they informed everyone that they will treat us as beginners and will start teaching programming in C/C++ from the very start. However, this is not the case. They expect you to know certain things and these assumptions are what that kills you. As time goes by, things start to pile up and eventually you become very lost. If you have no friends to guide or help you, you are as good as dead.

I have reached the point where even my friends are lost and we are relying mostly on ChatGPT to explain to us what exactly is going on in our assignments and revisions for our exams. I have started to form a deep hatred with what I am doing here and I can't stand the feeling of being lost and not sure on what to do all the time. It is so bad that even in exams, quite a number of people are seen leaving in the first 15 mins because none of us know how to do those questions.

Don't get me started on the amount of maths that you will have to do. Bad news for me was that I only took E maths.  I feel that you minimally need A maths to do well in this course. In lectures they assume that you know certain things that are from A maths or maybe higher maths. So imagine me, being in a lecture hall, seeing things that I have never seen before. It is basically torture and I am struggling for all of my modules since they are all linked. I feel that from the first day I started this course I was already so far behind. Now I feel like I just cant catch up because of how fast they are progressing through the topics.

Because of all of this, I wanted to request a transfer to a different course that is business related. However, my parents are not too happy with my decision. They claim that RTIS employment rate is almost at 100% and the pay is really high. ""Why do you want to let go of such a good opportunity?"", they said. The chances of me getting that kind of pay if I transfer to another course is quite low.

Now I am stuck, should I stay and suffer despite getting borderline passes for all my modules, somehow graduate (if i can) and get $4.5k+ salary (according to stats) or do I transfer to a different course that is business related, something I have experience in, have interest in (risk getting lower pay and make my parents mad)?",User_deleted,2
