1los82b,0,2025-07-01,AITAH for trying to convince my partner to use ChatGPT to get through a math course?,u/Easy-Campaign5421,AITAH,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1los82b/aitah_for_trying_to_convince_my_partner_to_use/,"So my partner has been taking this completely asynchronous (online) upper college-level math course at a community college. She's pretty good at math (way better than me as I only got up to Calc I), but the problem is the teacher for the course barely teaches at all, the textbook is written poorly, and worst of all, the homework assignments are horrendously long and hard.

Essentially what happens is she'll read the textbook and go over the videos and feel somewhat confident, but then feel completely stumped when she sees a lot of the questions. The questions are worded very poorly and it's difficult to determine what they're even asking for at times. Worst of all, if she gets a problem she knows how to do, or maybe she's finally figured out what a question is asking for and tries to solve it, she might have to spend hours on just one question in order to solve a 'syntax error' where basically she might have the right answer, but it's just not formatted \*exactly\* how the system wants in order to give her points.

  
This has been taking a really poor toll on her mental health as she has expressed \*needing\* to complete this course as it's an essential prerequisite for courses she'll be taking in her masters program. I've been trying to convince her to use at least some outside help like ChatGPT or even get a tutor. I'm not asking her to just turn off her brain and copy paste problems into ChatGPT and force feed solutions into the system without even trying, but instead, suggesting she try to use ChatGPT like a tutor if she's really stuck on a problem, or frame things like ""Hey ChatGPT, I'm stuck on this problem but don't want you to just solve it for me, so could you create a similar problem that tests the same concepts and then show me how to solve that?""

My partner is... very neurodivergent coded let's just say, and didn't even like considering the idea of asking someone close (who majored in math) for help because the syllabus specifically said ""no outside help is allowed."" She doesn't like when I suggest using ChatGPT because she says it's cheating and that she physically can't bring herself to do it.

My philosophy is that if it's the case that 1) probably at least 90% of the students are using ChatGPT, 2) the professor might even assume students are using it, and 3) she could use ChatGPT in a way that progresses her learning/understanding of the material that avoids any offloading in terms of doing the actual work or banging her head against the wall for hours trying to input a problem correctly with the right syntax, then there's nothing wrong with utilizing ChatGPT as a resource to aid her learning. I would think the whole reason people would outlaw ChatGPT is they don't want students just using it to offload putting in the work or understanding the material, but I don't see anything wrong if a student utilizes it as an active tutor.

I want to recommend a book 

Whistling Vivaldi by Claude M. Steele is a blend of memoir and social‑psychological research exploring how negative stereotypes about a social group such as gender, race, age, or class, can undermine an individual’s performance. Steele coined the concept of stereotype threat: the anxiety of possibly confirming a damaging stereotype (e.g., “women aren’t good at math,” “Black people aren’t intelligent”) which can sap cognitive resources and lower achievement, even among high‑achieving individuals 

Steele presents a variety of classroom‑friendly strategies shown to reduce stereotype threat and enhance student performance, particularly in marginalized groups

As a former teacher and current parent to two lovely visible minorities I think it’s worth a read for all teachers to understand what is happening in a world where everyone is bombarded by negative stereotypes online. ",active,14

Two years ago, I tried to teach some basic programming in a genomics course because one would think that basic programming is an important skill to have in genomics. One student despised me for having to spend time programming, and she gave me 0's across the board on my teaching evaluation. So, I no longer teach programming in that course.

Last semester, I was asked to create a new course on probability theory for our department because more than half of our bioinformatics students who took the mandatory probability theory from the statistics department failed. I wanted to give the students a solid foundation in probability theory and statistics, so I incorporated a lot of mathematical derivations and showed them how each distribution was derived. I thought the students would appreciate my efforts in making new statistics content that is both rigorous and relevant to biology.

They didn't. 

The attendance rate was about 50%. Submitted assignments were rife with answers copied from ChatGPT. Three students submitted answers screenshotted from one another.

I stacked the course with extra credit. I made the exams as easy as I could (and it was definitely a lot easier than the exam of the original course.) 100% of the students passed my course (compared to 38% of students who took the original course).

Then came my teaching evaluation score: 36% effectiveness. (I usually get 70-90% in other courses.)

Three students gave me 0's across the board. (Gee... I wonder who did that?)

I am at what's supposed to be a top institution (i.e. very highly ranked in the world). I can't imagine what's happening at other institutions.

I used to enjoy teaching, but having to teach students who don't want to learn just isn't any fun at all.",active,211

A College Algebra course is mandatory prior to starting.

However, I've never enjoyed or been very good at math. And before today, I didn't know a thing about algebra.

I started with ChatGPT for about an hour and got through simple introductory probelms quickly. But I hit a wall, and then poured 6 hours straight into Khan Academy pre-algebra. I did not do a single problem like I did when I told ChatGPT to treat me like a remedial student who also has relatively poor multiplication and division skills. And by the end I was frustrated and had a headache, although I did learn things.

During this pre-algebra, I felt like it's not like other types of math where it made sense and served a purpose. There were few Ah ha! moments where it felt like it was falling into place. It felt like it was so much stuff to learn without any fundamentals to explain how it all works together. So much of it seemed disconnected.

It's like picking a bunch of card games and mashing them together into some abomination for the giggles. It makes me think that having to learn it is like if musicians were forced to understand how sound waves move through the air, material physics of their instrument, and how air pressures and temperature and pressure affects it, then they had to learn other instruments they have no need to know just because. All before they could learn the instrument they wanted.

But I digress...

How realistic is it that I will be able get a firm enough grasp on it when classes for it start in early September? 

Can anyone recommend an ideal path of study and resources to prepare me for what I will likely absolutely need to have a firm grasp on? ",User_deleted,4

# PART 1: Sapna – “Main IIT jaunga”

Sab kuch shuru hota hai 9th ke end mein jab koi chindi coaching teacher bolta hai,

>

Toh 10th ke baad sabko ho jaata hai *""main toh IIT jaaunga""* ka bukhaar. Kota chalo, FIITJEE chalo, Allen chalo.  
Padhai shuru nahi hoti pehle, sabse pehle toh tumhaari **zindagi ki MKBHD drop test** hoti hai.

Tumhare friends chill maar rahe hain, tu ncert mein chhed kar raha hai.  
Spotify pe sab Arijit ke breakup songs sun rahe hain, aur tu H.C Verma se heartbreak le raha hai.  
CBSE board ke paper mein 99 aaya, par JEE ke mock test mein -38 marks? Bas us din realize hota hai,

>

# PART 2: The Kota Wipeout – ""Zindagi nahi JEE hai bhai""

Kota gaya? Welcome to the jail where dreams go to die.  
Pehle din sunoge – ""Selection ka chance sirf top 1% ke paas hai.""  
Aur tum ho 99% mein. Mathematically proven doomed.

2 saal mein sirf 3 cheezein hoti hain:

* Padhai
* Depression
* **Aur ek mysterious rash tumhare peeche ke bench pe jo koi reason ke bina khujlaata hai**

Social life? Mar gayi. Family? Forgotten. Love life? Beta, uske liye toh pehle **life honi chahiye**.

Aur jab finally JEE Advance ka din aata hai – aakhir mein sab ek hi jagah pe khade hote hain:

>

Spoiler: Nahi.

# PART 3: IIT mein entry – ""Swarg ka darwaza? Nah, it's Dante’s 6th circle of hell""

JEE nikal gaya? Waah bhai waah.  
Sab ghar wale sweets le aate hain, rishtedaar kehte hain *“Bahut intelligent ladka hai”*,  
aur tum khud jaake IIT ke page pe dekhte ho apna rank.

IIT Bombay, IIT Delhi... nahi mila? Koi nahi. IIT Jhatkabhari mil gaya? Badhai ho.  
Placement statistics toh same hi likhe hain sab jagah.  
**“Average package ₹13 LPA”**  
Jo tumhe nahi milega, kyunki tumne JEE me 273 nahi 274 marks nahi laaye.

Phir hostel join karo. Wahaan jaake samajh aata hai:

* Washroom = Biohazard zone
* Mess food = Culinary war crime
* Roommate = Possible serial farter
* Seniors = Gatekeepers of non-existent culture

Aur yeh *""freshers party""* naam ka scam? Woh toh bas ek aur excuse hai seniors ko hero banne ka.

# PART 4: Ladkiyan? Bro, yeh IIT hai.

Bhai, sabse pehle truth bomb: **Gender ratio = 10:1 ya worse.**  
Girls quota aaye 2018 ke baad, but situation abhi bhi same hai.

Tu college jaake feel karega:

>

Sab ladkiyaan ek ecosystem mein hoti hain, aur tum ek underpaid NPC ho iss MMORPG mein.  
Aur agar tu kisi se genuinely baat karta hai? Baaki ke dost poochhenge:

* “Bro kuch scene ban raha hai kya?”
* “Uska dost kaun hai?”
* “Tum dono ne Insta pe follow kiya kya?”

Ladka-ladki interaction IIT mein **wildlife sighting** jaisa hota hai – *rare and possibly dangerous*.  
Relationships? Hain. Par IIT mein nahi. Mostly outside waali ladki, ya PhD ke time pe.  
Aur sex? Bhai, woh toh **urban legend** hai. Kuch lucky log hote hain, baaki bas *Biswa ke jokes* repeat karte hain.

# PART 5: Academics = ""Tumhara GPA tumhari aukaat hai""

Pehla semester mein sab excited hote hain – “CGPA 10 laaunga.”  
Doosre semester mein samajh aata hai –

>

Yahan profs ne PhD ki hai tumhare hopes kill karne mein.

* Attendance 75% mandatory.
* Assignment late? -10 marks.
* Cheating? Full semester repeat.

Tu sochta tha *""Engineering matlab innovation""*,  
par yeh toh bas rat race ka hi sequel nikla.  
Projects ho ya labs – sab ek aur Excel column ban jaate hain.  
Aur agar tumhara English thoda tight hai, ya tum tier-2 se aaye ho, toh feel karwa diya jaata hai:

>

# PART 6: Placements – The Great Indian Salary Scam

Fourth year aaya. Ab sabko lagta hai paisa barshega.  
Startup? FAANG? Trading?

Aur tab college placement portal kholta hai:

* Job role: “Associate Backend Techno-functional Operations Intern”
* CTC: ₹17 LPA
* Base: ₹6 LPA
* Stocks: In the year 3055
* Location: **Ambala, WFH optional** (not really)

Wo ""₹1 crore"" job jo tum soch rahe the?  
Singapore based trading firm with **one opening**, 3 rounds, 17-hour interview, aur preference to IITB + Olympiad gold medalist.

# PART 8: Mental Health – ""Par tu IIT mein hai na bhai, kya stress?""

Sabko lagta hai ki IIT mein ghus gaya matlab life sorted hai.  
But sach toh yeh hai ki *sorted* toh sirf tumhari anxiety hoti hai – nicely categorized into:

* Academic stress
* Impostor syndrome
* Isolation
* Performance pressure
* And the eternal “kya mai enough hoon?”

IIT ke campus mein tumhein sab log smart dikhte hain – tumhare alawa.  
Tum top 1% ke beech mein ho, lekin feel hota hai ki tum 99% ke neeche ho.

Kabhi kabhi toh bas 2.5 CGPA dekhke lagta hai –

>

But breaks ka culture nahi hai. Therapy? Kaun karega? Mental health center? Staff 2 log, patients 2000.

Aur agar kisi ne kuch bol diya – toh response:

* ""Tujhe kya dikkat hai bhai, tu toh IIT mein hai""
* ""Focus kar, sab theek ho jayega""
* ""4 saal ki baat hai, nikal jaa""

Matlab bro, ***4 saal ka torture center bana diya, aur bol rahe hai tolerate kar lo***?

# PART 9: Extra-Curriculars = CV filling ya Social Escape?

Haan, kuch log clubs join karte hain – dance, drama, debating, tech, robotics.  
Par reality? 2 tareeke ke log hote hain:

1. **Climbers** – Jo bas CV bharne aaye hain. Har PPT banayenge, LinkedIn mein “Secretary, Sponsorship Cell, Techfest IITZ” likhenge, aur placement ke time bolenge “impactful leadership”
2. **Escapers** – Jinko academics itna maar chuka hai ki kisi club mein ghuske atma ko shaanti chahiye.

Actual passion rare hoti hai, mostly log bas *burnout ka bandaid* laga rahe hote hain.

Aur agar tu outsider ho – chhota town, Hindi medium, introvert – toh tera inclusion probability same hota hai jaise freshers mein ladki se baat karne ka: **low confidence, high cringe risk**.

# PART 10: Coding ka Asli Raasta – “Alma mater < GitHub commits”

Jab sab placement ke liye coding chalu karte hain – tab samajh aata hai:

>

Tumhara best friend ho sakta hai XYZ college se ho, but uska code base heavy hai, open-source contributions solid hain, aur woh Google mein pehle ghus gaya.

Aur tu?

>

Ab realise hota hai:

* **College ek naam hai. Skill ek kaam hai.**
* Projects dikhaate hain ki tum kya kar chuke ho, na ki kahaan padh rahe ho.
* GitHub > Grade sheet
* Startup internship > Summer research jo 3 slides bana ke khatam hui

Tumhara ""IITian"" tag ek checkbox hai.

>

# PART 11: Startup Scene – “Entrepreneur banna hai bhai”

Ab jab kuch nahi jam raha hota, toh sab ke dimaag mein aata hai:

>

Phir hota hai:

* “Ek EdTech idea hai bhai”
* “Bhai tuition wale model mein AI daalke disrupt karte hain”
* “Fintech pe kuch karte hain bro, UPI ka API access le lete hain”

Aur phir sab milke PPT banate hain, logo design hota hai, website thoda bana lete hain.  
Teen mahine baad sab gaya tel lene kyunki:

* Co-founder lad raha hai
* Product koi use nahi kar raha
* Funding nahi mil rahi
* Convocation aagayi

Jo log bacha lete hain, woh startup banate hain.  
Baaki log apne startup ke naam ke saath “Ex-CEO, Founder – 2023-2024” likhke placement mein daal dete hain.  
Aur recruiter poochhta hai – “Product kya tha?”  
Aur tum bolo – “Ek EdTech model tha jo students ko empower karta tha…”

>

# PART 12: Life After IIT – “Degree toh le li, ab kya?”

Toh finally, graduation ke din pe sab white kurta pehen ke photo le rahe hote hain.  
Background mein “Yaaro Dosti” baj raha hota hai, aur tumhare parents emotional hain –

>

Par tumhare mann mein chal raha hota hai:

* Job mila hai, but kaam kya hai, kuch idea nahi
* Yeh placement toh sabko mil gaya, toh special kya hai?
* Maine apne best 4 saal kis cheez ke liye diye?

Aur fir career start hota hai – **₹14 LPA** package jiska ₹85K tax ke baad milta hai, aur jisme:

* 3 month training (zoom pe lectures ka déjà vu)
* Jira tickets assign karna
* Git pe commit karo, PR raise karo, code review ka intezaar karo
* Kabhi kabhi boss “Let's sync up” bolta hai, matlab **1 hour of nothing**
* 10 logon ka team, 2 log kaam kar rahe, 5 LinkedIn pe motivational post daal rahe

# PART 13: Corporate Reality – “Tum ab ek glorified intern ho”

Ab jo corporate job mein ghusta hai, woh realise karta hai:

>

Work from home se start hota hai, par boss ki marzi pe depend karta hai:

* “Beta camera on karo.”
* “9 baje online rehna.”
* “Weekend pe thoda urgent hai.”
* “Dekhte hain appraisal ke time.”

Kisi ne bataya nahi tha ki:

* Tumhare IIT tag ka value ek saal tak hi hai.
* Uske baad sirf output dekha jaata hai.
* Tum Infosys ke non-IIT se compare ho rahe ho performance ke basis pe.
* And guess what? Unhone toh 3 saal se stable kaam kiya hai, tum abhi bhi “switch maarun ya masters karun?” mein atke ho.

# PART 14: Abroad jaayein? Masters karein? Phir se padhai?

Kaafi log bolte hain – *“Bro MS is the way.”*

* TOEFL diya
* GRE ka puzzle solve kiya
* SOP likha jisme likha “I’m passionate about CS since childhood even though I didn’t touch a laptop till class 11”
* 3 referrals jugad kiya
* Aur ek LOR fake prof se liya jo tumhara naam galat likh gaya

US aa gaye, ab wahan realise hota hai:

* Haan research acha hai
* Campus solid hai
* Par **financial struggle + immigration ka panga** \+ again aap ek fresher ho

Aur agar masters ke baad job nahi mila?

>

# PART 15: IIT Tag – Iska asli value kya hai?

Jab tumhare saamne ek **non-IIT grad** hota hai jo:

* Startup mein founder hai
* ₹30 LPA kama raha hai
* Clients hai
* Open-source pe naam hai
* Ya ek niche skill pe solid command leke remote job pe 6 figures kama raha hai

Tab samajh aata hai:

>

Tumhare friend circle mein 3 log hote hain:

1. **Chill maarne waale** – jo placement mein ₹6 LPA leke shaadi fix kar chuke hain
2. **Overachiever** – jo FAANG mein gaya aur aaj tak tumhare message ka reply nahi diya
3. **Lost souls** – jo naye naye course kharid ke Udemy aur Scaler ka comparison bana rahe hain

Aur tum?  
Tu bhi unmein se ek ho.

# PART 16: What Actually Matters – The Real Talk Nobody Gave You

End mein sab kuch boil down hota hai to just a few truths:

* Tumhara IIT degree ek *conversation starter* ho sakta hai, par success ka *guarantee* nahi
* Padhai ek tool hai, not your identity
* **Love life, social skills, communication, stress handling** – ye sab kisi syllabus mein nahi tha, but life isi se chalu hoti hai
* Apna zone dhoondna, apna rhythm banake consistency maintain karna – ye hai asli game
* 2025+ world mein ***proof of work > paper degree***
   * GitHub, LinkedIn, real-world projects
   * Network, mentorship, feedback
   * Confidence bina arrogance ke

Tum agar abhi bhi woh mindset mein ho ki *""bas IIT mil jaaye, life sorted hai""*, toh bro,

>

# PART 17: The Final Rant – “Scam toh nahi, but system flawed hai”

Dekho, sach yeh hai:

* IITs mein talented log hote hain
* Kuch log genuinely succeed karte hain
* Facilities, peers, exposure – yeh sab milta hai
* But **it’s not the utopia we were sold**

Isliye main yeh kehna chahta hoon:

👉�**� JEE ke liye 2 saal poora khud ko maarna m**at  
👉�**� IIT ko life ka goal mat banao – skill pe dhyaan** do  
👉�**� Self-worth ko CGPA, branch, ya package se mat jo**do  
👉�**� Coding jaldi chalu karo – khud se, bina kisi permission** ke  
👉�**� College ek line ban jaata hai resume mein – actual worth tum** ho

# P.S. – Tera Bhai IITian hai

Haan, mein bhi IIT se hoon.  
Aur mein yeh sab isliye likh raha hoon kyunki **yeh sab feel kiya hai maine**.

Na yeh post tumhe discourage karne ke liye hai.  
Na IIT hate karne ke liye.

Bas ek warning hai –

Jo karna hai karo – but **samajh ke karo**.  
Aur agar koi bolta hai:

I’ve gotten to the point where I actually don’t mind reading bad writing, because at least I know they wrote it themselves. But I guess it’s a technology that’s here to stay so I am (somewhat begrudgingly) trying to figure out how to incorporate it into an actual assignment. What have you done that’s worked?

For more context, I teach in the humanities. Intro art history classes, which means it’s dense. We have a lot of topics, changing every single week, sometimes covering hundreds of years of history in just one week, depending on the class.  I teach completely online, asynchronous classes. 

I did a ChatGPT assignment in the last face-to-face class I had that I think was pretty successful, but it probably was because we had the chance to talk face-to-face in real time. I had them all ask ChatGPT the exact same question (what are the similarities and differences in early Italian and northern Renaissance art?), cut and paste the answer into an assignment, submit it before class, and come to class to discuss. They compared their answers, found the similarities, and any differences they may have noticed. I had them apply the answers to works of art we looked at together in class. As the expert, I pointed out some subtle ways ChatGPT was actually incorrect. I think it was effective. 

Can this work online in a discussion forum? I’m sure they’re just going to use AI to analyze all the AI answers… they even use it to write personal reflections! [Defeated sigh…]

Would love to hear how you’ve asked students to use AI in online, asynchronous classes! 

My other hope for this is for them to analyze the writing and notice that AI absolutely has its own voice, and it’s easy to tell when someone is just using a ChatGPT answer as their own… but maybe that’s asking too much! ",active,12

Researchers tested brain activity in students writing essays with ChatGPT, Google Search, or no assistance at all. The ChatGPT group showed the lowest engagement across neural, linguistic, and behavioral measures.

Over time, those using ChatGPT relied more heavily on it—often pasting in prompts and copying results without deep thinking. Essays were described as repetitive and “soulless,” and EEG scans confirmed low attention and creativity levels. In contrast, students who wrote independently had stronger brain connectivity, memory use, and satisfaction.

The study’s lead researcher Nataliya Kosmyna, Ph.D , warns that younger users are especially vulnerable. Developing brains need deeper cognitive effort to grow. While AI can support learning, overreliance might come at the cost of creativity, critical thinking, and long-term knowledge retention.

The takeaway? AI isn’t the enemy—but how we use it matters. Education and policy must focus on responsible integration, especially for students. 

Balanced use of AI could enhance learning, but full dependence may short-circuit the very skills we’re trying to build!

here is a link to the letter: [An open letter from educators who refuse the call to adopt GenAI in education](https://openletter.earth/an-open-letter-from-educators-who-refuse-the-call-to-adopt-genai-in-education-cb4aee75)

here are my thoughts addressing each point. what do you think?

TL;DR the difference between this tech and previous tech (in this context), is that this tech is a threat to revenue/tuition streams for English départements.  
  
\---  
  
Each of these is a point from the letter.I'll add my thoughts in between the lines.  
  
\---  
  
1 — We will not use GenAI to mark or provide feedback on student work, nor to design any part of our courses.  
  
No complaints here. You do you.  
  
\---2 — We will not promote institutional GenAI products built on unethically-developed foundation models like ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Gemini, Grok or Llama. We will not allow corporate-institutional partnerships to compromise our academic freedom.  
  
a) you don't need to promote them if you don't want, but let's be sure to apply the same ethical standard to all we do.  
  
b) academia is already embedded with corporate-institutional partnerships that compromises academic freedom. Education and Ed Tech are too intertwined. and let's not forget about sports.  
  
\---3 — We will not accept without evidence the sales agenda of people who are not educators, nor will we spread hype at the expense of student learning and vibrant pedagogy.  
  
why were you comfortable previously to AI-tech to accept without evidence the sales agenda of people who are not educators? you adopt the tools given you by the institution from tech to food vendors. where is your outrage for this?  
  
\---4 — We will not train our students to use generative AI tools to replace their own intellectual effort and development. We cannot endorse the automation and exploitation of intellectual and creative labor.  
  
a) re: not training students. ok. you do you.  
  
b) please also stop using Learning Management Systems that have automated-out others' labor and your own.  
  
c) If you still underpay grad students, adjuncts, and lecturers, I don't buy this claim re: exploitation of labor.  
  
\---5 — We will not ask students or staff to violate the spirit of academic integrity by promoting the use of unethical products.

excellent. since most tech is built by unethical labor with materials mined unethically (and since streaming video can use as much water as querying AI), let's stop using computers and TV screens too.  
  
\---6 — We will not rewrite curriculum to insert generative AI into it for the purposes of ""scaffolding AI literacy"".  
  
you do you, but you are doing your students a disservice. see Kelli Cargile-Cook's Layered Literacies and tell me you shouldn't be on the forefront of AI literacy.   
  
\---7 — We will not contribute to the erosion of academic freedom and educator agency by forcing educators into compliance with technology they find unethical.   
  
how are you contributing to the erosion of academic freedom by refusing it though? and again, let's apply this same ethical standard to all tech.  
  
\---8 — We honor students' rights to resist and refuse as well.  
  
but will you support your students' right to embrace it in your classroom?",active,0

I am currently a rising junior and a SWE intern at a well known big tech company this summer. Just last year I would have died for an opportunity like this one. But after 2 months this internship has been nothing but hell. The work is sooooo boring. I've literally ChatGPTed every single thing after the first few weeks (so much that I don't even know what most of my codebase is). I'm very behind on my project and my mostly online team has been calling me out on it. On top of that, I feel like I've learned almost nothing. I feel incompetent but also unmotivated to learn. Every day I go to work and feel like nothing but a cog in the machine (and probably not getting a return offer). I want to explore something beyond prompting LLMs all day.

  
What do you guys think about quant trading? I enjoy math a lot more than coding (and am way better at it as well). I am also a top student (especially in mathy/theoretical classes). Trading seems way more interesting and also appears to pay a lot more. I've looked into some trading strategies, which intrigue me more than big tech SWE work. I also went through the Greenbook and thought the problems were (mostly) simple yet intellectually stimulating. Is this an accurate representation of the job? If so, I'd be very interested in pursuing this as a career. However, I've also heard quant is extremely cut throat and competitive with low return offer rates and hire to fire policies. This is on top of the fact that everyone who works there is extremeley smart and hardworking. I've also heard big tech SWE's have way better exit opportunities.

Let’s be honest. Long before ChatGPT, plenty of students were copy-pasting from the internet, using essay mills, or submitting work they barely understood. Who hasn't fought the likes of Chegg and Quizlet well before we knew what AI even stood for? 

What AI has done is not novel, but accelerated this level of academic dishonesty. The prolem remains: so many assignments can be done by someone (or something) with no actual understanding. For instance, using an old assignment or one that doesn't require a significant level of inquiry. If an AI can do said assignment perfectly with no insight into the course or the student, then maybe the assignment isn't worth much to begin with. 

Education should evolve. We shouldn’t be playing cat and mouse with plagiarism detection software, faulty AI detection that doesn't work, or nonsense like pretending these tools don't exist. The real issue is the class sizes that continue to get larger and the admin that makes more and more money at the cost of the student.

I might have ""friends"", but half of them aren't really friends and the others i haven't spoken to in maybe weeks. Maybe even a month idek anymore. So i cant talk to them. I can't talk to family bc they'll all probably explode at me. The only one i can remotely and extremely vaguely talk to is - ironically, my dad.  

  
It's always ""your phone this"", ""your phone that"" like okay, screen bad i guess, then explain your average 13 hours of screentime a day? Aaaagshsgdgs i don't even know where to start. 

First, there's the constant thing about sundays. For context, I'm homeschooled, and i have been my whole life. But i don't just sit on my ass the whole day, i go for 2 - 3 1/2 hours of badminton a day, horse riding classes twice a day two days a week, and taekwondo (on some days). Yet, whenever i say ""oh Mondays suck"" (because I have to go and deal with an extremely grumpy badminton teacher for three hours) it's immediately ""everyday is a Sunday for you! You have no school! You don't do anything! Everyday is a holiday for you, lazy ass!"" If i say anything about irritating people in badminton - and believe me, out of the thirty-sixty students, atleast 45/60 are the most irritating shits - it's ""you cant complain, they must be going through their own shit, NO YOU CANT CALL \[irritating girls name\] AN ASSHOLE YOU'RE TOO YOUNG "" 

Second, theres the CONSTANT nitpicking of my phone. Like, i do atleast three hours of excercise a day, plus four dogs to take care of and helping my mom with cooking and my grandfather with his tinkering and whatever. I think I'm entitled to a bit of screentime? Especially since yall spend the whole day on your phones anyways? Okay, you're an adult. Whoopdefuckingdoo. Does that make the screen less bad for you? NO. the past month, my mom has been expanding her small food business to the next city(where my horse riding is), so she's been going back and forth. Last night, i stayed up a bit late and woke up late. And now, it's ""you can't take your phone to bed"". ??? ""You can just write untill you sleep"" ??? I can read, i love reading, but i overthink a lot and sometimes i literally NEED some literal shit to be playing so my brain can shut off. When she's not there, i tend to stay up later, so now there's that too. 

Third. PLEASE STOP YELLING AT ME FOR EVERYFUCKINGTHING YOU DO WRONG!!! something literally fell today because my mom was giving it to me and let it go before i could hold it properly. She yelled for ten minutes while muttering about how she should never ask me to do anything and I'm useless and slapping me before making me continue with the thing I was doing. 

Fourth, fucking AI. I use character ai sometimes bc i get bored asf. But any ai being used for ""art"" and whatever? No. But now my mom has been telling me to use ChatGPT to make presentations for her (another thing I have to do for her), she's been using it, she's forcing me to go back to Duolingo, everyone is telling me to use ai for my editing... AND MY BRAIN IS DEAD. RIGHT.

yeah. So that's it for now. If you made it this far, thanks for attending my ted talk. Otherwise

I wasn’t able to get all As a single semester of university so far. 

I’m a CS student and I got a C in my data structures and algorithms class last semester. I’m honestly very bad at programming. 

I do really like computer science and in my free time I watch videos on interesting topics on theoretical CS. 

I do practice too, I’m also interested in linguistics so for all my linguistics classes so far I’ve went what I consider above and beyond for the projects and implemented programming. I tried using a phonological classification algorithm to analyze the structure of the minions language. I wrote an abstract and had the chance to present my work at a undergrad linguistics conference but it was the worst project there by far. I tried recreating a statistical model from a paper I was assigned to present on and I made a name change over time simulator. This summer I’ve been trying the advent of code problems (only up to 9 rn, working pretty sporadically), and I’ve been working on a custom markdown lexer/parser to build my portfolio site by converting the markdown into html and tailwind. It sounds like a lot but all of those projects suck. My code is terrible and slow and I get stuck and ask AI for help (I tried going as far as I could with the parser without help but it degenerated into a mess of if statements but ChatGPT gave me the suggestion of using a line by line lexerish thing first).

I wanted to do a linguistics REU this summer but I didn’t get accepted into any so I went back to interning with this defense internship pipeline program in my hometown. It’s more of a learning “internship” than anything. We don’t make any impactful products we just do like summer camp stuff, take tours of labs, and learn. 

The rest of my degree is gonna be theoretical cs which I’m excited for on paper, but in the back of my mind I’m not sure if I am capable. A lot of my peers are just way way smarter than I could ever hope to be. They did competition math or competitive programming in high school or just absorb the info so so much better than I do. I tried self study design and analysis of algorithms this summer by reading DPV Algorithms but I haven’t made it past the graph chapters and it feels hard to learn. Idk I think I’m just dumb. Learning about the fast forier transform algorithm was really cool and it filled me with wonder learning about the polynomial representation introduction but I got so lost with the complex number stuff. And it was like that for a lot of the book.

Also, I tried learning some abstract algebra because I enjoyed my linear class a lot last semester, but similar story. I only got to page 80 of the book  I was using but I barely did the exercises overall. I tried slowing down and forcing myself to finish a whole chapters exercises but after the first few easier ones I got stuck and intimidated so I just started skipping. 

I guess the issue is that I’m not disciplined and lazy but I don’t know what to do. I tried picking back up the algebra book but it feels like sooo much to restart from start but my foundation is too weak to pick up where I left off.

1m3ovkt,376,2025-07-19,"New Research Exposes How AI Models ""Cheat"" on Math Tests - Performance Drops 48-58% When Numbers Change",u/goyashy,OpenAI,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1m3ovkt/new_research_exposes_how_ai_models_cheat_on_math/,"Researchers from Hong Kong Polytechnic University just published VAR-MATH, a study that reveals a shocking problem with how we evaluate AI math abilities. They discovered that most AI models are essentially memorizing answers rather than actually learning to solve problems.

**The Problem:** Current math benchmarks use fixed problems like ""Calculate the area defined by ||x| − 1| + ||y| − 1| ≤ 1."" AI models get really good at these specific examples, but what happens when you change the numbers?

**The Solution:** The researchers created ""symbolic"" versions where they replace fixed numbers with variables. So instead of always using ""1"", they test with 2, 5, 15, etc. A truly intelligent model should solve ALL versions correctly if it understands the underlying math.

**The Results Are Brutal:**

* 7B parameter models: Average 48% performance drop on AMC23, 58% on AIME24
* Even 32B models still dropped 40-46%
* Only the absolute best models (DeepSeek-R1, GPT-o4) maintained performance
* Some models went from 78% accuracy to just 2.5% when numbers changed

**What This Means:** Most AI ""math reasoning"" breakthroughs are actually just sophisticated pattern matching and memorization. When you change surface details, the reasoning falls apart completely. It's like a student who memorized that ""2+2=4"" but can't solve ""3+3"" because they never learned addition.

**The Bigger Picture:** This research suggests we've been massively overestimating AI mathematical abilities. Models trained with reinforcement learning are especially vulnerable - they optimize for benchmark scores rather than true understanding.

The researchers made their VAR-MATH framework public so we can start testing AI models more rigorously. This could fundamentally change how we evaluate and train AI systems.

I assign them very simple tasks to work on using the React framework. However, I’ve noticed that they’re being incredibly dishonest about not using ChatGPT. They’re not even trying to learn the code they’re writing; it’s as if the ChatGPT is doing all the work for them.

Don’t get me wrong, AI tools can be incredibly helpful for improving productivity when used effectively. But if we use them as a substitute for traditional learning methods, it can really hinder our progress and set us up for failure in the future. I’m particularly concerned about the new graduates who are just starting out in software engineering, trying to grasp the fundamental concepts of the field. It’s affecting their education significantly.

Imagine giving a calculator to a primary or pre-primary school student. It won’t only prevent them from learning math for the rest of their lives but also set them up for failure because others who excel in the fundamentals can thrive in the field. These students might even feel depressed.

I’m at a loss for how to fix this issue. I’ve had open dialogues with them about not using ChatGPT and emphasizing the importance of learning through hands-on experience during the internship program. However, it seems impossible to make a difference every day. I’ve noticed that they’re writing a lot, and when I ask them to explain their work, they struggle to do so.

Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated.",active,10

1m79y6n,0,2025-07-23,Using AI gives me the “ick” and the inevitability of it is kind of giving me an existential crisis,u/garbagefire0002,ArtificialInteligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1m79y6n/using_ai_gives_me_the_ick_and_the_inevitability/,"This isn’t exactly a doom post. I see the value in AI but I’m also extremely skeptical and overall have a negative opinion of it. I know  surface level of how it works, and while I work in a tech-adjacent field (design), I’m more familiar with how the average mainstream person uses AI, not so much what’s being done in the research, “serious” use of AI. 

Basically my feeling of AI is the “AI bad sometimes, AI good sometimes” but it feels like a wishy washy stance. Maybe it’s because I’m surrounded by people who are either completely anti-AI (refuse to use it for anything) and people who are AI everything (coders who have said they’ve stopped coding and only use Claude). I’ve seen people use it intelligently and people use it stupidly to the extreme. 

My anti-AI friends are artists and writers, and reject all AI on the basis of its training off uncompensated creative work and being accused of their work being AI when it isn’t. I understand this being in an art-adjacent (design). 

I know all the arguments for and against (eg comparing AI to students, using training material as learning rather than stealing) but it still makes me feel super icky. I refuse to use AI generated art in my work. I hate AI-generated UI that lacks any coherent UX, not just because it’s bad but it may also suffer from “trained off designer work without consent”. However I see the value in using AI to help me create designs (based off my actual Figma designs) to prototype faster. 

This leads to questions of moral purity, like does using AI SOMETIMES mean you are just complicit in whatever collateral damage the usage and proliferation of AI may bring? I know energy consumption of AI is also a hotly debated topic, some saying it is legit bad and others saying “well what about xyz that is also bad, or people just use that as a argument because they hate AI”. 

My stance is that the average person has no discernment over why or how or when to use AI. They will turn their brain off and just have AI do everything, and not think critically about its output. I absolutely despise people who write to me using AI and being asked to convert my emails to clients using AI to sound “more professional”. It’s impersonal, and I’d rather speak to other people and have people speak to me as they are, not filtered through AI. I hate people who send me AI slop. Not to mention the education system is not equipped to help children through this, and critical thinking will be a rare trait, especially in the US where the education system is actively being dismantled. 

My brother works on LLM and AI training and is much more knowledge. Through him and my other developer friends, I learn what the “smarter” ways to use AI are. It has made me want to try it in my design workflows but it still gives me the ick. I feel both like I’m betraying the integrity of my creative friends, and giving in to something I ultimately would prefer not to exist. Like if someone back in 2010 told me how terrible social media would be and that I could stop the proliferation of it by not using it, I would have 100% chosen to not have social media. 

At the same time I recognize AI is inevitable. It’s here and not going away. My friends and I often talk about tolerance of living by your values and principles. Everyone has a different threshold for what they are willing or not willing to do to stick by their personal and societal values. 

But it’s just a huge cognitive dissonance I’m struggling to resolve. 

I’m looking for a meaningful discussion not just “suck it up”.

But then, it makes my job harder. Their writing often can’t pass AI detection — it gets flagged as AI-generated by tools like turnitin, gptzero or zhuque.

AI artists posting another big tiddie anime girl with a self-congratulatory caption suggest the potential for AI to keep stupid or tasteless people stupid and tasteless. Counterpoint: Keeping them stupid is not the same thing as making them that way.

**A tier:** *AI art ungrounds the artist from the act of creating art.* Assessment: indeed, it is a different medium and there are ways in which the brain is stimulated by holding a pencil, practicing technique, etc, that are lost in AI use. Counterpoint: there are important ways in which the brain is more stimulated by envisioning possibilities rather than learning shading and other technical skills. This argument would lead to interesting discussions about the \*qualitative\* differences between the act of drawing and creating AI workflows, etc. But we don’t really talk about this, seemingly because Antis don’t understand that AI workflows are a thing.  
  
**B tier**: *labor market impact.* Assessment: change is scary. We can (almost all)  empathize with livelihoods disappearing overnight. Counterpoint: those who are smart and serious about their craft find new ways to use tools rather than wallowing in despair.

**C tier:**  *misuse of ai is scary.* Assessment: revenge pornography, child pornography, etc, should be made illegal if they aren’t already, and that includes AI versions. And the punishment should be proportionate to the harm. Counterpoint: every single technology from the first stone tool to the splitting of the atom has equal parts good and bad potential because of how creative human beings are. AI is no different in this regard.

**D plus tier:** *it’s bad for the environment.* Assessment: it can be, mostly during training, but not compared to, for example, hamburgers, or all the electronics plugged in but not doing anything. Antis tend to confuse facts with their feelings on this topic, hallucinating water usage numbers that are pure human slop, and ignoring local ai as a thing. See localllama and stablediffusion. Anti ai environmentalism should acknowledge the potential benefits of an ai powered economy if they want to be taken seriously. Such as: very green molten salt reactors are finally going to be built by the AI juggernauts after decades of regulatory stalling AND automation hugely reduces industrial energy use.

**F tier:** *It generates slop that I need to look at.* Assessment: no, ads and social media feeds were already algorithmically driving towards a lowest common denominator. There was no golden age of social media shared art. It’s always been about personal preference rather than objective skill or sophisticated sensibilities. I would guess that most people who complain about slop on social media enjoy complaining and don't actually want to reduce their slop exposure.  
  
**F minus and you get a swift ruler to the back of the head:** *AI art and ai content is pro-corporate propaganda*. Assessment: the antis are picking up a weapon and goose-stepping to Disney’s intellectual property drumbeat. AI is the largest force freeing society from decades of snowballing IP laws that kept everything out of the public domain and behind paywalls.

**F minus minus tier:** *AI is low effort.* Assessment: barely worthy of assessment. The world needs to move beyond effort as a virtue. Kant reified this idea to save Christianity from the enlightenment. But it’s no longer useful. If some of you need to get old and live long and happy life and then die before we can be liberated from your nonsense, then so be it.

And my parents are not supportive. In fact they want me to die so that is the reason I'm here, seeking help from whoever will read this. I'm not trying to sound dramatic or fish for pity or sympathy, that's the last thing I ever want.

I don't know what I want to do in my life. And I'm being honest and completely unfiltered about what I've been thinking and what made me think that, I may sound like a fool but i seriously need some advice. And this post is really long, but please, give me few minutes and your thoughts. I'm in desperate need of them.

I've heard how successful those in the business are. I mean, marketing and sales. In real life too, and of course in books. I'm being delusional. i thought of taking that stream, starting from taking up commerce in my icse school for class 9th and 10th. I took help from chatgpt because I was so confused since both commerce and economics are lowkey ""business subjects"". But then I settled on taking commerce because I knew absolutely nothing about business and commerce would be a great optional subject as a 9th grader to know more about business.

So i bought the books along with commerce book. Went home and opened it and boom, everything except two chapters at the last namely ""accountings part one and two"" were basic things like joint hindu family business, communication skills and whatever else. But being the fool I've always been i didn't realise that all chapters except those two were meant to ROTE. That was until my definitely-not-toxic father opened the book and went like,  
*""Haah, isme to sirf rattne ka hai. Isse nahi ho payega. Khair, hum kya bole, agar kuch bol diye ki koi dusra subject le lo tab tamasha ho jaaega, aur agar ye le bhi li mere kehne pe to 100 me se 50 laakar humko aakh dikhaegi, ki mere wajah se hua hai. Hum kuch nahi bolege, isko jo karna hai kare.""*  
(This book is meant to rote. She can't do this. Well, what can I say? If I do tell her to take up some other subject, she will make a scene, and even if she agrees with what I say she will later score 50 out of 100 and then eye me as if it's my fault. I won't say anything. She'll do what she wants to.)

I can't rote, as my dear father said. Not even one line. If given options to rote one page or to study an entire book I'll choose the latter. So then I took computer as optional subject (after a lot of drama and my father calling me names that I made him go to the bookstore twice just because I can't settle on one thing). Why, because I have two elder brothers, both with the ages 25 and 23, and both studied computer science and programming (idk what it is even properly called. I'm so unaware.) and know languages like Java and C and Python, idk if more. And my computer book is based on Java entirely. And it's easy for me. Atleast for now. Like as a description I can tell you that out of around 60 students, 50+ rote codes (I'm not even joking, that's how icse works) and I can proudly say that I'm among those 4 or 5 girls who actually understand codes and THEN execute it. Last year in class 8, my friends used to call me programmer. Hacker too even. But at that time i barely knew anything, still. Also, at that time too, 100 out of 180 students used to rote codes. But I was among those 80.

So that fueled my ego and made it whisper that I can go in that line too. Computer science, i mean. For college. But then my definitely-not-toxic parents will say that i followed my brothers because I can't figure out what I wanted to do. And I too lowkey feel like I'm doing that.

Then i thought of cybersecurity. My brothers aren't in THAT. But to be honest I didn't think of that because I wanted to be a little different from them (or maybe I did, idk) but because I was genuinely interested in that. Like, ethical hacking and all. So currently I'm looking for some sources online that help you with it; for eg, apps like *HackerX* (which chatgpt called lowkey useless) and platforms like *tryhackme* (which chatgpt called really useful) and *hackthebox* (which i sadly found out to be 18+.)

Currently in my optional subject i.e. computer, I'm learning the basic things (only about java) like i/o, operators, loops, conditional constructs, mathematical library constructs and all the basic things. I can perfectly understand basic codes like prime number, armstrong number, palindrome number and fibonacci series and whatever else; and these are the codes my brothers swear they learnt in the first year of their university (KIIT).

As for what I want to do in the future, I have no idea. Nothing. I once even thought of pursuing law. Even psychology at some point because I can like.. really understand people and their motives (you may call me unaware and a fool for this but trust me, my home life is just..in THAT way, such that made me build up an ego for 'knowing people'). Then thought of business. Then this..ethical hacker thing. Now i don't know what else I'll think of. A cyber psychologist or a corporate lawyer or a ghost.

I do average in school. Study one night before and get 80% or more while those who study for an entire year struggle to get past 70%. And this is what's been feeding my ego. But now everyone is seriously studying, i mean...seriously ROTING, but some 12% are studying, meanwhile I'm just depending on my one night study that my ego is accustomed to. And my parents' scolding sessions are mostly because of this. They believe I can do nothing. Nothing at all. (Also, I want to go to a hostel after 10th. I really want to. But i don't think my dear parents will allow and I swear if I stay in this place for more than two something years I might die trying to live.)

I know I'm capable. I know that if I can get 60 out of 80 after studying for one night I can hit 80/80 too. But I have this satisfaction of doing absolutely nothing and still succeeding and I know this won't help me after school ends but I just don't know how to actually start on myself. My eye doctor even once said that i can do literally anything and that he wasn't even making predictions, he was saying that because the people who have ""eyes"" like me are like that only: succeeding in anything and everything. Maybe he meant internal structure, whatever, i don't know, I just know that he said so.

If you read my rant till this very end, thank you so much, and please, PLEASE give me some advice on what i should do. For my future, for my present in order to secure that future, anything.

I recently left a teaching job at a very low-performing high school in a city that’s notorious for having very low-performing schools for a job in a neighboring district. The student performance in the school is extremely low; the absolute best students (top 1%) typically perform about average relative to the national population, and about 90% of students are over three years below grade-level in math and reading. About 2/3 of the students in the school are English learners, with many having moved to the U.S. within the past year or two (and many having significant gaps in education, with some never having been to school before and not knowing how to read, basic arithmetic, etc.), and the school is very ill-equipped to adequately accommodate these students. Every week, the school gets new students enrolling who just moved to the U.S. and don’t know any English, and for non-English content classes (math, science, history, etc.), they’re just placed in regular classes as regular students without any supports in place (push-ins, pull-outs, co-teaching, paraprofessionals, etc.). 

Cheating is a huge issue in the school. Students pretty much relentlessly cheat on everything, and a lot of teachers kind of turn a blind eye to it, mostly because they figure what else are they supposed to do for the students who don’t know any English and don’t have any academic background. 

The school held the SAT for juniors a few months ago, and a few of the scores that I noticed in the teacher portal are pretty clearly indicative of cheating. For example, there were several students who scored over the 90th percentile in the math section (in previous years, the highest score I’ve seen from any student in the school was 55th percentile). I’ve previously had three as students in math classes, and I know that they’re not anywhere near that level, and all three would consistently cheat in class. Two of them are sisters who moved to the U.S. two years ago, don’t know much English, and consistently test around third grade level in math; they both got the same exact score at 93rd percentile nationally in the math section. I imagine they probably were on their phone using ChatGPT or something, and the proctor didn’t notice. 

I think I’m the only one who’s noticed because no one else in the school pays much attention to the specific scores. I know the SAT takes testing security and academic integrity seriously, but I was not involved with proctoring, and I don’t have any concrete evidence. I’m not sure if this is the kind of thing that I should potentially report because without concrete evidence of cheating, it’s obviously theoretically possible for students to end up with high scores.

1ma4o58,1,2025-07-26,I think I'm having one of the worst adolescence and early adulthood imaginable,u/chaklunn,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1ma4o58/i_think_im_having_one_of_the_worst_adolescence/,"M21. To put it simply, I'm a war refugee. I recently turned 21, and it hit me that I haven't felt genuinely happy for a single day in the last five years. I have no one to really talk to about this, so I figured I'd write it all out here.

This feeling gets stronger every day, especially when I scroll through social media or see my peers from Europe. I don't want to diminish their problems, but it's hard not to see most of them as insignificant, almost trivial.

My story may start off a little stupid and banal, but it gets really funny later on.

It all began, like for many people, with COVID when I was 15. Schools closed, complete isolation. The only friend I had, who was also my girlfriend, left me. My family moved out of the house where I'd lived my whole life. My grandmother died. That same year, I was diagnosed with clinical depression and started taking antidepressants. As a result, I spent my entire high school years online.

But then there was a glimmer of hope. I got into university in 2021, and the quarantine was lifted. I attended classes in person for two months, but that fall, we were AGAIN locked down with online learning. I never got the chance to make any real friends. I thought, ""Okay, I'm used to this. It can't get any worse.""

This is where the fun begins.

The year is 2022. I'm 17, the holidays are over, and it’s time to start a real student life. The first week of classes begins, and instead of an alarm clock, I wake up to FUCKING ROCKETS HITTING MY CITY. Instead of scrolling through memes, I'm scrolling through the news while sitting with my parents and my dog in the crowded bomb shelter of the school next to my house, reading about the full-scale invasion of my country.  Instead of preparing for exams, I'm on an evacuation train for 25 hours straight, unable to even lie down, heading to Poland, where I would turn 18.

Our luck in Poland ran out quickly. A local offered us a place for a couple of months in a godforsaken village with no work, and then started demanding rent. We had naively believed the war would end quickly, so we returned to Ukraine. Since the border was now closed for men, I was trapped. For context, my city is in the east, just 20 km from the front line.

For the next two years, I continued my university studies online, all while under constant shelling.  I've experienced it all—every type of missile in the Russian arsenal, bombs dropped from jets, suicide drones. About 80% of them are impossible to intercept because they're launched from so close. Every air raid siren meant you had about 50 seconds before a potential impact. 50 seconds to wonder if you were about to die. This happened up to 10 times a day. Two girls from my faculty were already killed at that point. On my evening walks with my dog, I'd listen to artillery duels in the distance. Before sleep, I'd listen to the hum of helicopters shooting down explosive drones as they approached the city. The town of my childhood, where my grandmother lived, is literally half destroyed, the cemetery where she is buried is mined, and my grandfather is under occupation with no possibility of leaving.

At 19, I couldn't take it anymore. With my father's help, I left the country through semi-legal means. I left my parents and my dog behind and flew into the unknown with just a suitcase and a ticket to Ireland. I knew no one there. It was winter. I spent all of December in military tents with other men who, like me, had arrived alone. We slept in our winter jackets, hiding our documents and whatever money we had under our clothes. We ate in a local sports hall, given food alongside other refugees from around the world (the war in Gaza had already started by then).

In early 2024, I was moved to a refugee hostel. After the tents, it felt like a 5-star hotel. That joy faded fast. I spent the better part of a year in a room with 10 random people. I've had to live with all sorts: alcoholics, drug addicts, and severely mentally ill people with anger issues. I once had to physically stop a woman from being raped. On other nights, I was the one calling the police because a neighbor was threatening to kill me. There was one shared toilet, shower, and kitchen for the entire building. Again, it was a town of 1,000 people with no jobs. I lived on a €150 weekly allowance, using some for food and sending the rest to my parents. In a place like that, privacy doesn't exist. If you want to be alone, you have to walk out into the fields or find a park bench. Obviously, I dropped out of university.

I tried moving in with an Irish family through a government program. It was a mother and her 25-year-old son. I quickly realized the son was using and dealing cocaine. The mother kicked me out after just three weeks because I hadn't found a job yet. I ended up right back at that dump.

It's impossible to plan for the future. We never know if the state will renew the contract for our housing. At any moment, we could be relocated to another city. The first hostel already closed down; I'm now living in my fourth new place in Ireland. Because of the constant moving, I can't enroll in a university here. The only reletavely good news is that a month ago, I finally managed to find a full-time job in a warehouse. The upside is that I have money, but it hasn't changed the situation much. Instead of living the best years of my life, I'm breaking my back in some warehouse, waiting for who knows what, with no one to talk to except ChatGPT, which is what I used to translate this text. But don't worry, unfortunately, this is not AI Slop. But I'm still curious how my life could get any worse. But you know, I didn't hear no bell. But I'm not gonna lie, the thoughts of making a Kurt Cobain reference are getting stronger every day, and I don't think any amount of therapy can fix this.",User_deleted,1

I know I should never cheat and I won’t learn the materials that way, but it is a required class and has nothing to do with the field I want to pursue in the future so I don’t care that much. The class is a few dozen students and will have TAs or professor walking around. Have any of you done something similar? Should I use Chatgpt or Copilot or something? Would it be easy to get caught?

1mczdwl,9,2025-07-30,People who think AI makes you stupid need to get real,u/Fantastic_Pace_5887,aiwars,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/1mczdwl/people_who_think_ai_makes_you_stupid_need_to_get/,"Let me start by saying that AI can absolutely facilitate stupidity. If you outsource your thinking to a robot by asking it to write everything for you, then are neglecting certain writing muscles that are crucial intellectual exercises. And I know that a lot of people do this. This is bad. 

But for some reason there’s a dichotomy where you’re either need to vow to never touch AI EVER (lest you risk moral impurity) or, you must be an easily impressed, knuckle dragging tech bro loser who asks AI to write everything for them.

What people miss about that famous MIT “study” about “AI atrophying your brain” is that it showed that some AI users use LLMs competently in a way that facilitates more connections. They literally write in the paper that AI can help with writing and learning. (Also one of the authors of that paper runs a AI cognitive enhancement startup lol)

Like if you need to write an essay on the space race, any knuckle dragging idiot can ask ChatGPT to write a shit-tier paper. But autists like myself who are actually curious about the world might use AI in more engaging ways.

ChatGPT, can you look for articles contemporary to 1960-1970 which cover space age development? >> followed by me actually reading the articles.

ChatGPT, which scholars are best known for covering the political dynamics of the space race? >> followed by me looking into those authors and using that to enter a scholarship rabbit hole. 

After reading articles on the space race, and getting into the writing process, I might forget which article has a certain piece of information. Maybe I forgot what terms to control+f. Oh, let me pop those articles into ChatGPT and ask it to find a particular passage.

There’s no virtue in intellectual Protestant asceticism. 

Oh but it makes up information! Well, if I’m trying to seriously compile any research, I’m never going to trust ChatGPT’s direct outputs. ChatGPT is just a way of encountering certain names, finding certain sources, digging into literature, all as a way of expediting aspects of the research process. NOT replacing them. I cite and read SOURCES, ChatGPT helps me locate, compile, and in some careful instances, help interpreting these sources (like if it is technically out of my expertise, I might ask ChatGPT to dumb it down so I can get the general idea, but then read further secondary literature after just working through the core idea).

Anyone banning AI in classrooms is doing a disservice. This is like when some schools banned the internet or didn’t allow internet sources. We need to educate people good LLM habits in the same way schools in the 2000s started teaching good computer habits. Look at boomers and gen x: they had to figure out the internet on their own and now half of them are QAnoners. If we can just be honest about how AI can be used effectively and non stupidly, we can mitigate potential future cases of AI psychosis. 

Students will definitely use AI in the stupid way anyways. Students also use the internet in the stupid way. But we can at least try (or continue to try) to reach them to use these things in a not stupid way.

1md8jb6,2,2025-07-30,MEPCO SCHLENK ENGINEERING COLLEGE BRIEF HIGHLIGHTS! WATCH OUT (⊙ˍ⊙) !!!,u/Personal_Mongoose702,Students,https://www.reddit.com/r/Students/comments/1md8jb6/mepco_schlenk_engineering_college_brief/,"Let me make it clear... There are lots of less experienced and brainless cruel staffs in every department. You are supposed to study like mug-up. They'll send you some ppts before exams and asks you to study that, you'll not gain any sort of proper technical skills required. Of course, there is bias while providing marks. You'll be surprised to see some teacher's pet students are more praised than others in all the fields. Dress culture is so stupid that they even check either we wear socks or not. Let's talk about hostel. The hostel food was good for the first week and then they showed the truth. The food had hair, and the rice had insects - PULU 🐛 (not lying 🤧). **One cannot even go outside the HOSTEL after 6.30 (both boys and girls). The joke is there are no places to wander inside the college till 6.30 🤧😂  ONE USELESS CANTEEN ACCOMPANIED BY USELESS GENERAL STORES with THEIR STUPID BILLING SYSTEM.** Hostellers can never go outside except on the weekend. For a hosteller to go outside, they have to fill 2 forms and get signature from 3 person and ur parents should speak to the staff advisor. If you are going to Industrial Visit, you don't expect enjoyment. You'll visit only companies all over the Iv. No other places will be visited like other colleges. You should keep your id card with yourself. If they found it in other person hands, they'll enquire and put a fine. I swapped my friend Id card with mine to buy a coffee since you can pay only through id cards. They found it and asked me to pay fine of rs.250. Earlier we just danced in the room, they fined 500. If they got you interacting with  opposite gender, the principal, mechanical Hod and corresponding staffs will speak more rubbish like ""you slept with them?"", ""Are you still a virgin?"", ""you booked room?"" and calls the parents of the girls and and threaten the parents to arrange the marriage for that girl with other boy or get the TC and leave. And if the case is a boy, they speak bad words more fluently. From second year, they'll allow us to use laptops, but you get good network only in the ethernet in the lab. That too, every website is restricted (you cannot open them). You can check emails only on breaks. ChatGpt is also blocked here. For a hosteller, they will give 1 hr of wifi in morning and in the evening. The timings for the wifi for boys and girls will change. No mobile phones were allowed. If your phone gets caught, they'll go through all your gallery (including private folders), Instagram, and WhatsApp. If you don't open your private folder to them, you'll get suspended for 6 weeks (they did to a girl). If a faculty member hates you, he starts showing vengeance all over the course. They'll touch the marks, humiliate them and so on. **If you and your friends go on a trip yourselves with your parents permission, and if the college people get to know, then you are COOKED. They fine 3000 each, which is costlier than the trip.** The attendance percentage is 75, but you cannot take casual leave more than 5 days. You can take leave for only 5 fu\*king days for a semester. If you exceed it, you'll have to pay fine and if fine continues, they'll suspend us. On the other hand, the management will appoint a spy among students, and they'll notify the management of the secrets about students to the management (many secrets got revealed to Principal by these assholes, so beware of your friends too). They won't give leave on many government holidays also. Let's go to placements. Imagine attending all the classes all over the year with few leave, maintaining discipline, not interacting with opposite gender, managed to get zero arrear and getting placed in a 4lpa company after lots of struggle. This is it. The majority of the company visits this college provides a package of 4lpa and below. Only a countable number of companies visits here with a package of 7 LPA. Only 2 3 companies visits which provides 10-12 LPA. No more higher packages than it. Most companies that visit here take you for irrelevant roles you studied for (for example, you are a cse student; the college will provide business role companies). However, there are lots of politics in placement processes. They'll select students randomly; you may not get selected for a company, even if you are eligible. They'll ask us to wear lab dresses for all the lab sessions, apart from the dress being so heavy and hard, if you forget to wear it, you are supposed to write apologies to many. For many unknown reasons, you'll be writing apologies. Once I and my friend went to the restroom, the **old fat b\*tch math hod said, ""why are you going to the restroom in the middle of the classes? Are you using weed? Since I'm a lady, I cannot come into your restroom, or else I'd come and check you.""** Is this the way a teacher speaks? Similarly there are millions of stories like this for each and every student. This college provides poor learning skills, a mug-up culture, and zero social interactions and gives 4 years of stressful environment and zero enjoyment. Many alumni of this college are bald and taking bp and diabetes medicines. It's better to join an arts college and develop skills on your own. Courses on YouTube are more better than what they teach here. ((((( **WARNING NOTE: On top of all, ECE and MECH DEPARTMENT HODs department ARE THE WORST TO CORE.** ))))). **The principal, the staff, the hods are still in age before independence. They don't know about liberty, freedom, independence and PRIVACY. That's why they treat us like BRITISH.** Thanks for reading; Glad it will save your life by not joining here. If any questions, please comment and I'm dying to help people.",active,3
1mdhqmd,35,2025-07-30,Students Meeting the Definition of Insanity (or at least as far as the saying goes),u/hypocriteme,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1mdhqmd/students_meeting_the_definition_of_insanity_or_at/,"Sorry, this yet another post about AI, though I'm not trying to add to the list of (mostly) legitimate complaints about student AI use. Moreso, I just want to express my extreme puzzlement. I am teaching an asynchronous online course in the humanities, at the moment, which has weekly assignments. Those assignments are there just to incentivize keeping up with the material and are meant to be mostly quick and easy. I am using a method in this course that for whatever reason, LLMs just can't seem to generate a passing product. The method involves producing a type of diagram for each question and then writing a very brief commentary (a sentence or two) that refers to specific elements of the diagram. (Sorry to be cagey here about the method, but it seems like whenever professors start loudly declaring that some type of assignment is LLM resistant, the LLMs are suddenly able to do that type of assignment within a few months.)

It is clear that more than half of my students are just taking the assignment instructions, feeding them to ChatGPT, and then sending me whatever ChatGPT spits out. The problem is that AI seems incapable of producing anything that looks like the proper type of diagram, and then even if it does, it seems incapable of rooting its commentary in specific aspects of the diagram. So, about half of my students are outright failing every assignment, not because I am knocking them down for using AI, but because they aren't producing anything that looks like a proper answer to the question. What I'm flabbergasted by is that this hasn't convinced them to change their strategy in the slightest. Each week, they just send me another round of AI slop which I then fail. At some point you would think that they would realize that their attempt to AI their way through the course isn't working, but their F's don't seem to have convinced them to do the readings, or watch the video lectures (which I can see that they aren't doing through the LMS), or come to my office hours (only one student so far who is already doing well in the course), or, imagine this, try the assignments themselves. Instead, each week, they just submit another AI generated assignment that doesn't look anything like what they are being asked to do. ",active,38

1. No one's paid to answer yr emails. In brief. If your email is hard to read, confusing, or offputting in some way then there's no compulsion to answer it other than ""it's the decent thing to do"". grease that social wheel. 
2. Most tutors = PhD students. Most really do care about the subject/unit/topic area. Most probably also care about the 80,000 word document they're avoiding putting together a little bit more than your class.
3. Underqualified at all stages is the norm. Elephant in the room re: the UG teaching? Barely any Uni tutor, or even lecturer, has more than \~15hrs of formal training before they start teaching.  A tutor's job is far less about 'teaching' and far more about modelling passion + interest in a topic and are hired on that basis. There's WAY more fields of expertise (often very niche) than there are units, and most 1st and 2nd year courses are broad enough that they don't hire for (or need) really specific expertise that a PhD student (or grad) in that 'discipline' would be expected to have
4. The system we work in fucking sucks, but students make it worthwhile by making it worthwhile. There's no money in these jobs, there's no mid or long term future, and most of the tutors you have now will never have a stable or permanent job in academic stuff no matter how incredible they are. Your tutors rock up to classes by choice, knowing full well that the hour spent in class could be basically just as well spent searching for a decent admin job or finalising a Centrelink application. Morale is so far below rock-bottom among your teaching staff now, more than ever
5. You're not a customer. If you wanna be one, sure, but I and many other tutors have had really great relationships w/ UGs in class which have shaped our research in tacit ways and sometimes explicit ones which have opened cool doors. The 'customer' mentality ignores the fact that for almost all staff, teaching is only a portion of their job, and usually ignores the quality of students holding up their end of the purchase. 
6. Free Palestine, and please don't use ChatGPT as it's really embarassing, and all the other things we're not really supposed to say in class any more",User_deleted,171
