Throughout the year I have continuously did things that are counter intuitive to my learning and now I am in a situation where I need an 86 on the final in order to get a B in the class. A C would be legitimately the worst possible because I would be inches away from losing my scholarship. An 86 doesn't seem terrible considering it's an intro python class but here's the problem the exam is this coming Friday and legitimately I only have a bare bones understanding of python and when I say bare i mean bare. We've had 10 homework assignments with 5 coding problems on it and the last one I did on my own without chat gpt was homework 2. It all started with an extreme amount of procrastination. I said that oh I'm just using chatgpt once I'll catch up but I never did and ever week I messed around and didn't focus and so now here I am. If you asked me to solve any homework after HW2 I would fail to do so and I've failed both midterms meaning if I don't get an 86 I get a c. 

&#x200B;

I've told myself over and over that I would change but I have a problem where I just let myself escape by doing anything but work so when i look back at the weeks that have gone by I realize just how much time I've wasted and I feel like a complete fool. Even now here I am still procrastinating and so now I have to ask where can I go from this. Procrastination is a habit that has been engrained in me since high school I've always been smart enough to screw around and still get high A's which is how I got into this school but I've been completely unable to do that here and so whenever I got a little anxious I would avoid everything and bam another day has gone by and no work is done. 

I keep rambling but this is probably one of the worst cases of procrastination in my life. It feels like the walls are collapsing and because of how insurmountable everything is I feel like I want to learn but because of the vastness of content I just don't know how I'd go about this and so I continue to escape. If I continue on my foolishness I'll end with 3 A's in easy classes and a C in Cs my major and a B or a C in calc which the same situation is occurring only difference is I have one extra week to study. I've been a complete disappointment to myself, my parents, and my goals and all I want is a restart but even then I feel like it's a self fulfilling prophecy I've always said to myself I'll make a change on procrastination but each time I got away with but I always felt like if i look back at my life (18 yrs) I could've done more with everything yeah i got into a t5 but I could've been even better. 

I feel like if I don't figure something out I'll fuck around until friday and fail the exam and fail the class so now I am at my wit's end and I'm essentially begging anyway to tell me is it possible to learn enough to get an 85 on an intro python course in one week or six days. All I know right now is just some stuff from lecture like I went to lectures but I never learned to actually implement anything so all I've got is random words floating through my head and half thought out concepts. Is there anyway i can do this in a week i've got the time if I essentially didn't stop studying for each day. Can anyway tell me what to do with my problem and where to go from here and how I should go about studying what resources I could use and whether it is possible. I've regretted what I've done everyday and each day I feel the weight of existence pushing down on me and I hate my life right now. I've never been under this much pressure and I just need to succeed but nothing is looking good so what do I do. I always use any distraction to escape the feeling of dread I feel whenever I wake up not any substances but going to parties, yapping to people about nothing, and just general avoidance.

Ours has been here 3 years, and two years ago he simply forgot to sign up 3 students for their math AA SL tests so they were unable to take them. They showed up in May to take their exams, and were sent away. Thankfully 2 were juniors and the other wasn’t full dp but that seems insane. He doesn’t check with students to make sure they’re testing and I am not confident he has signed me up for all my tests.

Popular, static software is best; unpopular, mutable software often yields wrong results.

I've seen [Tyler Cowen's book GOAT, ""the first book written in AI.""](https://goatgreatesteconomistofalltime.ai/en) That and this documentation problem I face got me thinking: wouldn't it be great if there was a way to write documentation for software that was specifically designed to be ChatGPT-compatible (or LLM-compatible more generally).

I am a new teacher. I did my student teaching at a High School and now work at a Middle School. I have a student who is very very low. I also had them all create origin stories for their characters. I put the prompt into Chatgpt. I got a story kinda similar. Since then, I haven’t gotten that story again. I think I may have fucked by attaching the kids story, or part of it and just created something similar. I accused this kid of AI. On his Google Doc, I saw the keystrokes of a few minutes and so I just assumed he copied and pasted. I got some similar words from the internet — nothing identical. I had a kid plagiarize his reading guide so I just thought this kid did. Besides, all the upper kids use chatgpt like it’s nothing. The vocabulary didn’t align with his. Using words I just didn’t think he knew. The sentence structure for the first time was really good. It was logical, incorporated must things I wanted. I just thought it had to be the work of AI. Now, this kid went home sobbing that he hates our school more than his last and it’s my fault. The principal said no resubmitting and that set the parents off. They hate me now and they’re right. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m tired of always having to be on the look out for chatgpt and never really knowing when it’s truth and when it’s real. I am tired of having issues I cannot control. If it was me, I would have let the kid redo it. But then again now I’m discouraging vocabulary usage. Maybe the keystrokes were because he was working really and I just thought the worst. All I can do is just hand in my resignation at this point. I can’t take my mental health decline. The kids don’t care. I don’t care. What’s the point? I feel awful because they just hired me, but I don’t feel good enough.

Last year, my geometry teacher DIED. The school was too cheap to hire another teacher so they sent somebody who had to cover 18 other classes and they sent a sub so we wouldn't burn the school down.

I'm a (woman) tenure-track faculty member at a private R2 in the humanities (think English literature, philosophy, history, etc).

I'm struggling with DEEP discouragement and dislike of teaching in this era of increasing grade-grubbing, accomodations requests, ChatGPT, and the pressure from course evals to keep the students feeling good about themselves regardless of whether they did any work, etc. This week felt HORRIBLE in terms of stress, as I was just completely buried under special testing requests, grading of essays that may or may not have been written by humans, students miffed because I didn't give them a study guide detailing exactly what terms and quotes to study for the final, difficult office hours meetings with students unhappy because I wasn't agreeing to let them make up X or Y assignment from September. Ugh.  I don't see the dynamic getting any better, since my uni just approved a whole 'student personal days' policy and everything... All the university-level movement seems to be towards giving more reign to student demands rather than less.

In the next 5 years, how could I shift to some kind of more administrative or staff role? I know that I probabably need to stick it out another 2 years and get tenure, since to be tenure-track and then not seek or get tenure would surely invite some stigma and close doors. But assuming I do, what kinds of other roles could I shift into at the university and how does one do that? 

What comes to mind is...

**a) staying faculty but doing departmental administrative work**. Our chair and various program directors get course releases, so this may be one way to teach less. I know the dept admins deal with a lot of student complaints up the chain, which could be depressing. But it seems anything would be better than the viscerality and vulnerability of being on the front lines so much myself. I really struggle with the exhaustion of teaching and struggle not take personally the course evals pettiness, cheating attempts, constant demands from students to give exceptions/re-dos, etc. I do think I have colleagues who enjoy teaching more than I do -- so, could I do more good on the back end of department admin, trying to support them in holding the line, and be myself happier? But I would still have to teach some classes, so it would just be a lessening of student contact if I went this way.

And I am not sure realistically how soon I could get into a role that would make a tangible difference in reduced teaching. Although of course all the lingo around the university is about equity and representation and whatnot, the reality is that my department (a couple dozen full time faculty) has never had a woman chair and/or a minority chair, so I actually don't know if I could get such a leadership role? It is not that long ago that these admin roles were always white male priests in particular (Catholic university). In general, I think I am well-liked and considered competent, so I think I could eventually end up in some kind of department or program leadership -- but the problem is that it would take a while and I'm not sure I can survive the stress of full-time teaching for too many more years. I'm extremely tired (and admittedly part of that is because of my own family circumstances of being mom to several small children at home), and not really sure that I can face another  4 or 5 or 6 years of day-in-day-out teaching and student demands requiring me to do my job multiple times. But even if I could  get into the program admin roles that come with course releases, that's not going to happen overnight.

**b) shifting to some kind of (non direct student suppor?) staff role on campus.** Overall, our university staff seem to have much better quality of life in that they have all the university benefits (like 100% tuition remission) but, depending on their roles, not having to be on the receiving end of so much teaching stress and student haggling. Students have much chummier relationships with the Student Support and Accomodations Office and DEI staff on campus , since they are seen as friendly advocates for success, while the faculty (no matter how much we bend over backwards to give students what they want) are seen as the enemy holding their 'A' hostage. So though I resent somewhat how this staff/faculty dynamic plays out in student culture, maybe if you can't fight them, you join 'em? If I switch to the staff side, would life be more pleasant with students, or at least more distanced from students?

Unfortunately, I suspect it wouldn't make sense for me to try to shift into the kinds of academic support staff roles that I undersatnd and see most on the day-to-day, like Offices of Student Support, DEI, Accomodations, Pedagogy Teaching & Learning Office). Admittedly,part of the mis-fit is me, since  I've developed a sort of internal beef about them (in my perception) undermining student perceptions of faculty and hijacking the process of students taking responsibility for their own learning. It's not that I don't care about diversity or compassion since questions of genuine inclusion are actually very important to me personally and in my research (I study history of immigrant religious populations, religious and ethnic minorities, etc). But it's just that I have gotten jaded these last couple years after seeing how the campus culture of 'the student customer is always right' has in practice made my life (as in fact a pretty vulnerable female/minority faculty member swimming upstream in a lot of ways) more hellish and difficult. None of the campus discussion of mental health accomodations for students has helped my mental health as a faculty member pulling all nighters responding to demanding student emails for special requests! None of the university pedagogy teaching institute people, urging us to reflect on our course evals every term so we can do better, seem to themselves face the psychological onslaught of having to read whatever 18 year olds might decide to write about them during the most stressful end-of-term weeks when they are resentful about assignments and worried about grades! None of the DEI office people has ever actually advocate for policy changes that would actually help me as a woman/minority/mother faculty member, like being able to use start-up 'research' funds for summer childcare so I can get research done. Sorry for the rant (obviously, I don't express this stuff out on campus), but my point is that I am so discouraged or cynical about what I consider the hypocrisy of these student support type offices not really supporting good teaching and learning, that it probably rules out a chunk of staff roles for me. I would not be a good fit. So what are the OTHER, more faculty-adjacent type roles that I could shift into? My sense is there are a lot of 'Director or Associate Director of X Office' people or 'Program Coordinator of Z Center' people floating around campus, probably earning higher or comparable salaries as I do... though I don't know exactly what most of them do, or whether I could realistically pivot to get those kinds of jobs. Have you ever seen a faculty member be able to shift to some kind of staff role that wasn't teaching but really did seem to support the education of the place? How did they get those jobs? What enabled them to turn their very faculty oriented CVs into viable candidates for those 'good' staff jobs?

I know some people will just say 'go to industry' -- but very practically, I don't see a way or much hope in getting out of academia entirely, since a) I'm in the humanities/social sciences and b) financially, I am still hoping my children could get 100% tuition remission or exchange down the line. We are barely affording basic living costs since we've faced these terribly high rents and home/mortgage prices of the last few years in settling down recently; so since my salary is pretty low, and we have not been able to save for retirement or for the kids' college. Without a better paying 'industry' to go to, I think my best bet to keep supporting the family is still to somehow stay in higher ed and hope for that tuition remission/exchange to work when my kids are old enough to go to college.

(PS. I'm sorry for the selfishness of this question! I went into academia wanting to be a good teacher and to make a difference educating students; so I'm sad/ashamed to have gotten so cynical about university life that I am thinking in such self-defensive ways about trying to just minimize my vulnerability to student haggling while keeping a job... But I'm feeling pretty hopeless, since I thought teaching would be better than it is and just cannot see any light at the end of any tunnel in faculty life these days).

What's my next move? I'd really appreciate any examples of non- or minimal teaching roles around campus that a faculty member could shift into!",User_deleted,6

This type of thinking needs to vanquish and rid itself from mainstream discourse. It's the idea that we should all pack up our bags and go home because there is no future for humanity as AI will take over anything and everything. Elon Musk's Universal Income bullshit. 

It's the notion that all of math and science has been solved, the secrets of the universe have been solved and therefore there is nothing left for you and me to do. We should just quit now and not look back. 

**FUCK THAT** 

This is a defeatism that only benefits the elite class. Don't even try it because AI has already solved it. You're thinking about this over here. Don't, because it will be obsolete in 6 months. AGI is coming, AGI is here, what is AGI, wait for it, ASI. What the hell does any of it truly mean? 

Let me be clear, Matthew Berman, intentionally or not, is pushing a narrative that is very harmful that is being felt in TODAY'S society. You hear it in the whispers on this sub where people ask what should I tell my kids about their future. Where are the jobs? Reports coming out that AI is replacing jobs. Fear, FEAR, FEAR. 

Anecdotally, I can tell you that enterprise data is SHIT and is years away from even remotely being able to clean up their act to even reap the benefits of general AI today. Also, how many of you(engineers) are seeing in the workplace where managers are just spitting out low level GPT ideas and expecting them to be built in a ridiculously short timespan that when they then go to the users the users actually don't want or need the product? How many? Raise your hands. I see a lot of hands up. The ideas guy is not winning here. They're making things worse. If anyone is not needed...

You have kids that are finishing high school wondering should i go into computer science? Maybe not there's no future there. That is extremely HARMFUL. Should I become a data scientist? All of the work is now just a GPT API. That is extremely harmful as a bright young mind might be swayed to pursue something else other than their true potential. 

The narrative that Matthew Berman is pushing is FALSE and seems to have an agenda. I think him and people like him should be careful when promoting the **Doomerism by Proxy** narrative. 

He tries to clean it up towards the end by admitting it's not ""all good."" Funny after you just spent the huge chunk of the video saying the exact opposite. He posts this meme to gently, but failingly, roll back everything he just said; as if to say, ""with this huge grain of salt.""

If this isn't the classic example of a wrapper project that will go BUST by next year I don't know what is. He is doing absolutely nothing innovative other than trying to resale you ChatGPT as a ""low code""/""no code"" tool set with a token price markup to boot.

The overall quote is just ridiculous.

The core **CONTRADICTION**

Today AI has A LOT OF LIMITATIONS. ONE OF THEM IS CONTEXT WINDOW LIMITATIONS.

[https://youtu.be/ZV6Sz42l0hY?si=TKND2\_\_eqc9ZgNP6&t=652](https://youtu.be/ZV6Sz42l0hY?si=TKND2__eqc9ZgNP6&t=652)

He's goes on for a huge swath of the video explaining why this is an issue and a current limitation but we'll get around that. I mean, did he think we would just miss that fact?

He even admits that most AI code bases want you to start from scratch and can't deal/iterate on existing code bases.

Other points of BULLSHIT

Next, Matthew has a new paradigm shift to programming that doesn't involve humans. They're just gone! [https://youtu.be/ZV6Sz42l0hY?si=XpKw0P91Of5FiUyh&t=837](https://youtu.be/ZV6Sz42l0hY?si=XpKw0P91Of5FiUyh&t=837)

What coding will look like in the future. Ahhh we're here again. The ideas guy. The human project manager. You're going to do research and talk to users right? P.S. why this is so funny and a great meme/joke is that A) we all have ideas. B) Most times PM's don't talk to users and or understand what the hell they are truly asking for from a business use case which could translate to a technical solution. They are glory hunters that often fail at their jobs. It isn't until the technical person is there to clean up the telephone game of nonsense. Often I find designers and UI/UX people to be of much more value along with actual USERS. IMHO.

Then Matthew, for some reason, brings up Amjad Masad and some complete bullshit hackathon that by the way has the video removed from Youtube for some reason. We'll get to that later. Which Amjad Masad person is this?

This guy. The Repl.it or now replit.com that is of this controversy. [https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/nuh2qj/how\_replit\_used\_legal\_threats\_to\_kill\_an\_interns/](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/nuh2qj/how_replit_used_legal_threats_to_kill_an_interns/)

and [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27424195&p=2](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27424195&p=2)

The entire point that story isn't really important it's about some kernel that an intern took to try and do their own thing. Not important. What is important is replit's business model. Low code / no code. That's what they're selling. Pay me this and I will spit out this boilerplate solution for you. Why Matthew seems to be underlyingly shilling this I don't know. Smells of money though.

Don't believe me? It's already happening Berman says. [https://youtu.be/ZV6Sz42l0hY?si=\_yd1S\_Gf76SsjC\_t&t=903](https://youtu.be/ZV6Sz42l0hY?si=_yd1S_Gf76SsjC_t&t=903)

Just look at the hackathon that Amjad Masad put on. Spoiler the human pm is the one who wins the coding challenge. Apparently and $10,000. Weird right! F\*\*\*\* Crazy if you ask me.

[https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1659423752881586176?lang=en](https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1659423752881586176?lang=en)

>At a hackathon where a winner is a “nontechnical” PM and her work — powered by Replit + AI — is more technically impressive than teams of engineers! Was surprised at first but it struck me that PMs must be exceptional prompting, afterall that \*is\* their job.

So with all of this, you might expect something amazing right? Nope.

[Here's the actual project that apparently won $10,000.00](https://twitter.com/pritopian/status/1659431102258507777) with a huge cardboard check. Interestly, when I tried to find the video about what was so amazing that was built. It was taken down from Youtube. I searched for it and found this. [https://devpost.com/software/doctok](https://devpost.com/software/doctok) docutok. The proud winner of how AI is going to blow the socks off of every engineer and programmers are going the way of the dodo bird.

Until you try and go to this link and hmm funny it's been removed. [https://youtu.be/WtGdyjZQMWc](https://youtu.be/WtGdyjZQMWc) I'm interested because I want to know what was actually built. Was it something amazing? Truly showing the power of engineerless future that Matthew Berman is prophesying? Hmmm?

Well, i found the video on [LOOM.com](https://LOOM.com) Thank you loom. This was probably from the hackathon.

[https://www.loom.com/share/df8a242e87394ef3a3083415e8249368](https://www.loom.com/share/df8a242e87394ef3a3083415e8249368)

Now, I am not trying to criticize Priya the person who won because she did a thing. But let's get real here. What kind of hackathon was this? What was scope and direction and directive? I mean if it was just people putting together code examples with ChatGPT and Repl and nothing else the level of wow facts here is a 1. On any standard. With or without GPT. Just watch the video. What would you use that for? Was it a 10 minute hackathon? If was like most hackathons which are 24 or 48 hours I mean holy shit that's what was built?

This is literally what every engineer was tasked to do as soon as GPT came out by the ""ideas guy"" in every organisation. I guarantee you. Put in this doc and summarize it and do this. Lame. This could have been coded in 3 hours by an engineer not using GPT 4 other than the parts of the summary.

Also, in the video she says ""I programmed a few voice agents"" at the 3:03 mark of the video. She didn't say that she prompted out code with copilot or GPT or anything. Nowhere in the video. She literally even says she used to work at Microsoft so in the least her technical knowledge is at a high level. She only mentions in the video she uses GPT4. I don't know how much she programmed by herself or got code spit out from GPT4 and or copilot.

No coding abilities whatsoever? I don't know.

[But her reply which seems as a marketing stunt for Replit is this.](https://twitter.com/pritopian/status/1659435302723936256)

>Helllooo! I had a lot of fun building DocuTok with [@Replit](https://twitter.com/Replit) and a huge fan!📷 [@Replit](https://twitter.com/Replit) has collapsed the distance between a vision in my head and a fully functional product.

Frankly, this part of the Matthews video is the most cringe because it lays out this point that somehow the ideas guy is just going to spit out ideas and code bases without any need of an engineer.

To be fair Priya does seem like she is trying to take the idea somewhere and I applaud her for that.  [LICA](https://www.lica.world/)

However, A) many people are going to be getting into this space as we speak.  [Gen-2 by Runway (runwayml.com)](https://research.runwayml.com/gen2)  has a working product now. Probably won't be good until gen-3 but it's a great start.

Here's a good overview of all 3  [3 Incredible Text-to-Video AI Generators You Have To Try! (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLxNbLY12NM&t=6s)

What I will say is that why is there advertised VC backing for Lica and a hackathon that was using Replit and GPT with no human engineers but yet no product that is available still today? No alpha or beta product at all. Hmmm, I wonder if it's because they would need real funding and actual engineers to create the product?

I can assure you that the other 3 products are actively using real human engineers that have real product design and ideation with limited ""the ideas guy"" input.

The critiques and criticisms of tools like copilot are out there. They just don't get any full scale attention like the doomerism prophecies do. It's not this isn't good enough as of yet. It's beta test your ass off and just use it. It will mean the demise of you and your job function so I want YOU to USE it now. That's what's really being said here.

This was a smartass post about why you should be using copilot. And to be fair, you can but not a lot of developers feel this way. In fact to be fair it's a 60(against)/40(for) split in their interpretation of that post.

The damage potential is clearly laid out here by real people. It's not that it's not a tool worth having IT absolutely IS. I use it each and every day. But my knowledge of coding is vast and I know when GPT is doing something correct or wrong. I've already said that GPT is a true stack overflow killer and I stand by that claim. But until we get a true ASI agent this is nothing more than a TOOL in your toolbox. It will make you better and stronger. Not replaced.

Think I'm alone. I'm not. Jeff Jarvis talks exactly about this. [https://medium.com/whither-news/artificial-general-bullshit-e480939332f6](https://medium.com/whither-news/artificial-general-bullshit-e480939332f6)

He criticizes the the legacy media's incessant focus on a small group of AI proponents and calls for a larger debate. Matthew Breman is one of these people to me and this is my debate. 

The **REVERSAL CONTRADICTION**

Going back against all of that he spends the next moments show how this is all going to play out. Humans be damned. Doomerism by Proxy full steam ahead. 

Matthew again dives into an unfounded and simply ridiculous example of some hype bullshit he found on the internet. 

[https://youtu.be/ZV6Sz42l0hY?si=8JgivNQbLAiT2bWN&t=1088](https://youtu.be/ZV6Sz42l0hY?si=8JgivNQbLAiT2bWN&t=1088)

If Matthew didn't realize this is click bait trolling level 9000 I am questioning his skill level as tech bro at all. 

**The JARVIS from Mckay Wrigley Bullshit: TLDR IT'S FAKE**

Obviously, like the Google demo (that was fake) there is a lot of hand movement code bullshit going on here. To give the credit he did the Google demo misdirect before Google even had a chance to do theirs. LMAO. I mean can none tell what's going on here? He's literally showing another computer with GPT running on it. I don't even think at this time GPT even had voice and it's not on anything other than mobile. 

Because we all KNOW this is not how latency works for GPT4. F\*\*\* AT ALL. He says in the video he optimized some speed things. Just wow. [https://youtu.be/ZV6Sz42l0hY?si=8JgivNQbLAiT2bWN&t=1088](https://youtu.be/ZV6Sz42l0hY?si=8JgivNQbLAiT2bWN&t=1088)

This IS OBVIOUSLY FAKE people. This is the fraudster marketing that people use to get clicks and funding. 

He obviously kicked off a Github action to get the codebase built. I don't believe for a moment that GPT built anything in this crazy demo because A) he was obviously using a Siri voice over trick thing and B) He's not even using an Azure or OpenAI development account to actually build something like this. 

Meaning, you could actually build something like this but not in the way that he prompted it at all and have it working as a code release. It's complete and utterly bullshit. This is the type of nonsense that Silicon Valley is priding itself on now? 

All his links to any of his work is all sign up and get interested. I can tell investors this is a great idea because I have 100 signups type of thing.

The **Final Contradiction**

Is it still worth learning to code? Yes. Lol. I can't even keep up anymore. [https://youtu.be/ZV6Sz42l0hY?si=5nH-UX320BrIrfud&t=1457](https://youtu.be/ZV6Sz42l0hY?si=5nH-UX320BrIrfud&t=1457)

I really wish people like him would stop thinking this way as it is not useful. True innovation and problem solving will be a thing until a true ASI is achieved. I believe the tools will get better and stronger and this is an interesting time. But don't tell your kids not to learn to code or not learn about computer science or data science. It is still as viable as it ever was and will continue to be so.

They ask a lot of questions. But it shouldn’t be your cohort peers. It should be paid instructors with multiple years of real experience, not previous students that never got a job outside of bootcamp systems. 

Bootcamp worked before with COVID because there was a huge demand for it. Companies couldn’t be picky because they would just get a better offer.

Academically and behaviorally, it feels like the education system (both public and private) is failing kids who aren't too much younger than I am now (25).** 

Intent: Trying to understand and offer my POV on solutions.

Disclaimer: I'm not a teacher, I graduated college three years ago, these are observations from a total outsider. Take them with a grain of salt.

Part 1: As teachers, are you personally seeing the aforementioned issues in your classrooms, or do you think it's all media hype?

Part 2: Working off of the assumption that these issues are indeed happening regularly and we are indeed facing a crisis in education, these are a few ideas I want to throw out:

*Academic*

1. **Essays/Research for older kids.** We have to recognize that the world has changed even more in the past 20 years than it changed in the previous 40. We've gone from blackboards to internet to iPhones to AI. There is no longer any real need to go to the library-- any kid with half a brain can google just about anything that they want to know in two seconds. In a similar vein, ChatGPT is here and we're stuck with it. Expecting kids not to use it, especially when they see how easy it is to get away with it, is just silly. I'm inclined to believe that in coming years, if assignments stay the same, the dumb and the unlucky ones who get caught will be in the minority. 
   1. **Suggestion:** switch homework and classwork around. Instead of assigning essays/papers for homework, assign the research for them as the homework. They can ChatGPT all they want at home, but it won't help them (and if they bring a fully-written essay as their ""research notes"" to class, you can just tear them up). Then, dedicate a few classes to writing time. Assuming they've brought legitimate notes and done the legwork as their homework, I don't see why students can't do the writing in class. ChatGPT-ing is much harder when your teacher can see what you're doing.
2. **Exams need to stop**. The only thing exams do is show which kids are better at retaining short and medium-term knowledge. I don't know about you all, but I don't remember much of any subject in high school or college that I wasn't/am specifically interested in enough to continue learning independently (history, in my case). The point of school should be to teach the soft skills that allow a person to be a functioning, productive member of society-- not to fail them for not being able to cram chemistry, calculus or Shakespeare the night before a meaningless exam. Standardized testing are just an even worse form of exams, but that's a whole other discussion I don't have space for here.
   1. **Suggestion:** Shift the focus to coursework (essays, problem sets, lab work etc.) and away from exams. These are much better learning experiences for the students, allow them to pick up soft skills they'll actually use instead of knowledge that will very rapidly fade away, and be a significantly better reflection of their abilities and areas for improvement. By all means, scatter in pop quizzes and tests here and there, they do have value as far as keeping students on their feet, just ensure that it only covers recently-taught material. 

*Behavioral*

1. **Get phones out of the classroom.** There was a certain point, around when I was in school, where tech in the classroom was alright. You'd pull out your phone for a second to text your buddy, or whip out a game on your laptop to stay awake in class, and every once in a while, you'd get caught and punished accordingly. Today, however, it isn't just a quick text or game of rocket league, it's a generation with a freakish, compulsive *need* to be on tiktok, instagram, snapchat, etc. It isn't about staying awake or making fun of the teacher, it's an addiction. It's part of a greater public health crisis (that I won't get into in this post) related to social media use. 
   1. **Suggestion:** They can kick and scream and suffer withdrawal, but phones go in a bin at the start of class and laptops/tablets don't come out unless it's for a specific assignment. Thanks to remote class, we now have software that allows you, the teacher, to monitor what students are doing on their laptop without even having to get out of your chair! And no, no one (except certain people with specific accessibility requirements) NEEDS to take notes on their machine-- people have been writing by hand for millennia and we've come pretty far. 
2. **Ride the mental health wave.** The stigma around mental health issues is slowly drifting away. Kids are freely talking about mental health and are being encouraged to do so. Be a supportive figure, guide them to the right resources, steer them away from bad influences (e.g. andrew tate). A lot of kids are very lonely nowadays. Reach out to them.
3. **Model values**. Listen, it isn't your job to teach kids values. That's a job many parents seem to be failing at. What you CAN do, however, is be a good role model. This means keeping your instagram tame, be polite to them (yelling is much more effective if you only do it every once in a while), keeping a professional distance (e.g idc if you smoke weed, but your students don't need to know), being a good listener, and...
4. **Bring back consequences.** I know, I'm preaching to the choir here. I know that this one is hard because well, parents are uncooperative, school administrations suck, etc. I know this isn't something teachers can or should have to fix alone, it has to be a whole-of-society effort. Still, it has to be said-- rampant and increasing behavioral issues are an inherent part of the crisis in education. I'm not talking about cheating (students have and always will cheat if given the chance and depending on their tolerance for risk-- in fact, I encourage cheating when it comes to busy work because you shouldn't be doling it out anyways). I'm also not talking about sex/drugs/alcohol (again, being stupid is a hallmark of being young. We definitely should be doing better when it comes to sex education and preventative measures against early addictions, but again, that's a whole other post). **I am talking about** the feeling of impunity students seem to have nowadays.
   1. **Suggestion 1:** In cases where the student is violent/otherwise dangerous/sexually aggressive to you or classmates, get other adults involved asap and have that student transferred elsewhere. Dealing with these students is not your job. Again, a whole other post could address where those students should go/how to prevent them from joining the pipeline to prison but for the purposes of this one: just don't engage, get them out of your classroom. 
   2. **Suggestion 2**: In all other cases, go for the jugular. Students want to \[insert instance of misbehavior\]? One warning and then after-school detention. That's right, more time spent in school WITHOUT their phones/electronics. Oh no, they have to miss X or Y event, so sad. Also, though this should be used sparingly and with good judgement, collective punishment might just help a stray student find their way via social pressure. I know that when I was in school, the best teachers were the ones who were supportive and kind, but didn't take disrespect and didn't feed it with attention. They just gave you detention and moved on. If you threw a fit, you'd get sent out of the room until you were done. That simple. If you tried to get your parents involved and they actually took the bait, your parents would come out looking dumb and be much, much madder at you than if you'd just taken your detention and moved on.

Anyways, these are my very long two cents. I'm interested in peoples' reactions/thoughts. More than anything this is me venting over an issue (no, a crisis), that is incredibly frustrating to see but that I'm helpless to do anything about at this stage.",User_deleted,0

I notice so many posts in this sub that are weirdly misdirected anger and frustration. So often teachers post about ""bad behavior"" ""lazy parents"" ""lazy students"" ""CelLpHonEs!"" ""ChatGPT"" like those are the things that are collapsing the field of education in America. 

It's disheartening to see so few people talk about the collapse of public sector bargaining, the rise of McDonalds-ass-charter schools, the depoliticization of curriculum. 

Putting this out into the internet that maybe the reason your students ""don't care"" is because they work jobs at night to support their families in our capitalist hellscape, maybe they have an undiagnosed learning disability (because those diagnoses are so often limited in services based on your race and wealth).

Maybe those ""lazy parents"" are working three jobs. Maybe they're trying their best. Maybe no matter how hard students, teachers and parents work job opportunities are increasingly becoming limited in a world that is dying.

Your job is political, but so often teachers act like it's not. We talk about ""students rights to this and that"" when we live in a country that has grown enormously wealthy off of depriving the rights of others.
