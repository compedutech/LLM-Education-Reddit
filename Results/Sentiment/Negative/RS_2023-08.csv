Last year, ChatGPT became a huge problem. How should I deal with it? I used an AI checker I found online and had them write in google docs so that I could see changes but I only realized this at the end. None of my kids owned up to it but I knew that they did this, as I could tell how odd the writing was. I have thought of having them handwrite essays (I'm not thrilled with this) or am wondering if I can find some program where students cannot copy and paste into but can type (I feel like I have used this). Any ideas? Thanks!",active,3

There’s been a whole lot of posts and comments arguing that CS is still by far the best career. As a current CS student who just graduated, here is why the CS field will never be the same.

- Saturation is a huge problem, and will remain to be a critical issue for the next 5-10 years. The relentless surge of fresh CS graduates is drowning the market. You are one among the masses, facing pitiful starting salaries as ruthless competition for the most basic positions reaches all-time highs. 

The average entry and junior software engineering job posting on LinkedIn gets 1000+ applicants now by the way. Absolutely terrifying.

- Rapid technolofical change won’t wait for you. The skills you painstakingly acquire today will decay into obsolescence tomorrow. Prepare for an unending cycle of self-education, or risk being left in the dust.

- Offshoring. Vast numbers of tech roles, especially those you might be aiming for right out of college, are vanishing overseas, swallowed by regions with cheaper labor costs. 

Your dream job? It might already be a offshored. Scale is a good example. Scale AI is worth $7.3 billion, yet they offshore hundreds of software jobs to other countries, paying less than $1. They will gladly offshore programming roles to remote countries. You can’t beat someone willing to work for $1.

- The job instability is treacherous. The tech terrain is marked by erratic highs and devastating lows. The allure of great rewards is constantly overshadowed by the chilling risks lurking just around the corner.

- Oh, have I mentioned AI? AI is still in its infancy, but ChatGPT and these LLMs weren’t released until 67 days ago. Look at it now. That’s how fast this shit advances.

Still wanting to major in CS? As a current CS grad, good fucking luck. You don’t see 100,000 doctors being laid off every time there’s a recession.",User_deleted,108

The bar had been set so low that it was reportedly a tripping hazard in Hell. 

I tried looking up old threads for answers, and one was about a student screeching, ""But online is supposed to be easier."" They complained about having to write discussion board posts and essays (for the in-person version of the class, the professor would administer exams). Given AI tools, however, students can cheat on writing assignments with reckless abandon. So it's (mostly) back to exams, but that means either requiring students to sit in a testing center or using online proctoring services. Some institutions do not have those resources, yet still offer an array of online classes. 

We've always had colleagues who seemingly have no standards. They won't don't even care if discussion boards are infested with bot responses, or that papers were written by ChatGPT. 

Is there any evidence the accrediting bodies take this seriously? Commenters here routinely agree ""the take-home essay is dead"" while colleges and universities expand their share of online classes. Given the *current* technological landscape, is there any evidence the online environment is as rigorous as face-to-face instruction? ",User_deleted,0

I also looked at the syllabus and this class is just stupid with all the writing. Funnily enough, my prof even has a note about not using ChatGPT and that its a violation of academic policy and blah blah blah. It's almost like they want us to do the work ourselves since we're supposed to be interested in what we're majoring in lol. I had already told myself I wouldn’t use ChatGPT this semester because I'm a really ethical and seriously motivated person, but I’m already stressing out about my classes since we have to write so many stories and stuff. I thought it would be easier to get my Creative Writing major than that lol.

I’ve read about AI detectors and it seems like they aren’t all that great and my university might not even use them, but I’m still nervous, because if they catch me, I'll actually have to do the work of coming up with good ideas (oh yeah plus it's unethical or something whatever). I also read on [r/chatgpt](https://www.reddit.com/r/chatgpt/) that some students are submitting work that says “As an AI language model”, that’s absolutely horrifying! I may have to actually proofread what ""I'm"" writing lol!

Any advice or tips? Is there anything other than ChatGPT that I can use? It’d be really nice if it did all the creative thought, writing, editing, and polishing for me bcuz my least favorite thing about this major is the writing. I swear I really love my Creative Writing courses but genuinely putting in effort, adhering to a baseline ethical code of conduct, and striving to get the education I'm paying for is an unreasonable workload lol.

161y3tv,1,2023-08-26,CMV: Generative AI is still nothing but a threat and a disgrace to the creative world and creativity itself. I'm not convinced over my previous CMV.,u/BlackHoleEra_123,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/161y3tv/cmv_generative_ai_is_still_nothing_but_a_threat/,"I feel like my previous post concerning this was cheaply rebutted by pointing out the tone used in the text and using similar arguments found on Twitter/X that were easily debunked by context and professionals who knew what they were doing. There were 4 or 5 good talking points that find artists' faults BEFORE GenAI happened, but that's about it. Nothing else. There's also one guy that said I was angry over this issue—of course I'm angry, what reaction do you expect when I see artists being bashed and screwed over just because of the introduction of GenAI? Oh wait. It's the 'net. Typical.

Needless to say, I'm not impressed either. There's a lot more I could have done, putting in new issues to apathetic light, or closing holes in an argument like this. This issue is complex well enough that I can't focus on every talking point, and all I can do is rebut with what I have on my brain at the moment. But I came back, looked at my argument representing my view, and I ""upgraded"" it with some quoting and paraphrasing, bringing up things I didn't initially bring up, and refining what I did bring.

GenAI is still the same disgrace as it was, being used to replace artists and animators, scam innocent commissioners, confuse non-artists, its supporters radically defending it flaming, screwing over artists and saying phrases like ""Adapt or Die!"" to them, and don't get me started on the copyright violations, profiteering, and privacy breaches it does, due to how its algorithm gathers data and the way people use it.

The art world has never been in more turmoil because of this technology. Not only that, corpos are trying to lobby politicians to ensure that they can continue using their dangerous tech. Thank goodness for some politicians listening to our issues and workers' strikes concerning this immoral creation.

Because of the way GenAI advocates, or techbros as we call them, and artists just expressing their concerns, it will be very hard for me to listen to the side where GenAI is supported, and even harder, because I looked back, and the professionals just pointed out how terrible your arguments are. Every day, same old phrases. Some artists thought of the S word once this tech encroached onto creative industries. Some artists quit, which is really sad. It's also causing artists and writers to turn to GenAI simply because they saw its ""potential"", and so they start using it, actively defending it the same way techbros do. Per ""AaranTheArtist's"" words: ""I often run into people who say that GenAI software learns, understands, gets inspired, has beliefs, looks at artwork, reads articles. These kinds of ideas result from careless and unclear use of language."" And ""kortizart's"" words: ""A fun thing about generative AI discourse is when AI advocates claim aggrieved artists don’t know how the tech works. But when you ask AI advocates how it works, some anthropomorphized nonsense like “It 'learns' and is 'inspired' just like you!” always creeps up. It’s embarrassing."" This is how techbros defend their use of GenAI, anthropomizing it, which is just overall cringe.

Oh, if this is only about visual art, you're wrong. While StableDiff, NovelAI, and ChatGPT being one of the current dominant algorithms focusing on text2image and text2text generation, there's plans on making similar generation algorithms for music and animation.

If you're thinking of this: ""Oh, it's supposed to be a tool."" No it isn't. It never was actually. The tech was made by corporates without knowledge of the art world and made for profit. Why else would they lobby politicians other than wanting to continue using their generators without ethical vibe checks? Its purpose is to be a replacement, to replace artists. Thank goodness the politicians listened to the artists, and the tech finally being either ethically regulated, or banned. Call me a Luddite if you want, but at least the Luddites fought against automation and job exploitation by destroying all the spinning wheels and looms that were built to destroy their careers. It's why they're called ""elitist"" and their cause being framed as ""anti-technology"" by people, which are similar to what artists are called nowadays. The Luddites are also probably responsible as well for your works to have minimum wages and fair standards today. History, being written by winners, rewrote their story from a workers’ revolt fighting for fair treatment to a narrow-minded war against technological progress and technology itself.

Some people even refuse to pick up a pencil and whatever paper they have and draw, instead paying $40 for a monthly sub service to GenAI. That's enough to buy you what you NEED to make stuff. Instead you choose to blow it over an over-anthropomorphized algorithm with the intention of automating art, which is a mockery of art itself. But of course, you don't care, because ""you can't draw."" It's not hard. There's YouTube tutorials, which are very helpful. There's even FREE hour-long courses you can watch and take, but no, you'd rather pay an algo and type what you want to get a soulless image you'd stroke your ballsack to. ""Oh, but I don't have the time to draw!"" That's exactly the point. Art takes commitment, love, perseverance. It's a fundamental process that GenAI decides to spit on. The only part where art is ""democratized"" is when those dollar signs hit up. That word, democratized. Democratized. Sound familiar? Yeah, this word is used when cryptocurrency and NFTs hit mainstream media, two things that techbros love. Having photocopiers and counterfeiting machines in every house is ""democratizing"" money. ""B-but only the rich are really good at art!"" Maybe. But anyone can do art, rich or poor. You have absolutely no excuse for paying $40+ for GenAI and complaining art is expensive.

Don't compare this with the camera either. Photography is a wholly different medium than art. There's no ironclad evidence that artists were replaced by a damn flashing printing telescope, and even if it did, at least it took time and effort, which GenAI lacks. GenAI users comparing themselves to photographers is just as terrible to them as it is to artists. You technophiles adore progress without looking into how many ethical violations and dangers were in effect during technological... progress.

And I thought automation was supposed to help, not to harm? Automation is the antithesis of art itself. And let's not forget that since it's just an algorithm on steroids, it has a chance to bias and recommend rather than giving you what you want. Why else would their outputs change with the same prompt or give out images of a busty white woman no matter the words you type? And my favorite new reason is that GenAI and its users does not know what art fundamentals and principles are. Takes no skill, time, or patience which attract techbros that love to make a quick buck rather than appreciate well-crafted crafts. And I quote a Tweet by ""Pehdrigues"": ""another fun thing is that artists are actually trying hard to educate themselves on the technical aspects of it, being informed in a field so different from their own, the AI evangelists don't bother trying to understand how we learn art, our craft or even simpl\[e\] ethics."" And yet GenAI users still call themselves artists, as per ""BookSpotlight"" on Twitter: it's not art, it's a prompt in a program processed off other people's artworks. What exactly is an ""AI artist"" doing to make the final result? Absolutely nothing. The algorithm does it for you, and that algorithm is built off other's works. Art's fundamentals, anatomy, color, brushwork, perspective, and art's principles, creativity, time, effort, and messaging... GenAI crushes all these shiny diamonds. These traits are what makes art creative and unique, and excessive automation destroys those traits. And to anyone citing digital art as automation, at least that took a near-equal degree of skill, while GenAI has zero skill whatsoever. As per ""Kelly\_McKernan's"" Tweet, I say: ""The fundamentals of art and principles of design translate across all mediums, all disciplines of art. Skill is adaptive, and if you can draw digitally, you can draw traditionally, with a relatively minor adjustment in technique. GenAI requires no practice, skill, or ability.""

Let's talk ethics. According to various artists on Twitter, a generative algorithm is ethical and safe to use if:

The sources from where processed data was originally acquired is copyright-free, with consent, and compensation.

The algorithm respects privacy.

The algorithm recognizes the word ""no"".

The algorithm is not built with any malicious or problematic intention or motive such as copyright infringement, sudden layoffs for profit, no respect for consent...

Current GenAI violates all of said rules, and therefore, is unethical and built with intent to damage human condition. Per the words of Molly Crabapple in the LA Times: ""There is no ethical way to use the major AI image generators. All of them are trained on stolen images, and all of them are built for the purpose of deskilling, disempowering, and replacing real, human artists."" Speaking of ""deskilling,"" did you know that there is a potential for some of the students in schools to use or have used any one of the current GenAI programs? Oh yeah. I'm talking about dudes that cheat on their essays by using ChatGPT to write it all for them. One such case is a post on Reddit where a student's essay was found to use an ""AI language model"". Didn't even bother editing out the evidence. I'd like to say, because of this happening, some were caught, while others managed to get off easy, letting some even-more-incompetent idiots through our system compared to our slightly-less-incompetent selves back then.

I could go on and on about other things that are blatantly problematic, such as some early forms of GenAI using power equal to 550 tons of CO2 exhausted from power plants. But this is about art, not climate change, and judging by that statement, it's probably outdated at the moment.

In short and conclusion, GenAI is theft, Big Brother, and a terrible digital stalker. Built as a minter, not an art tool. Why else would they make this tech other than money and masturbation?

To artists, as per ""konjak's"" words on Twitter: ""Don't give in to AI. Your creativity is still you. Start now. Continue as you were. Whatever. It's for you, and we also have to wait longer than one year of panic to see how it pans out."" And as per my words, don't give up, keep doing what you love doing, and seek help when needed. To artists like Karla Ortiz, thanks for defending the creative industry.

To GenAI advocates: Teaching children that pressing a few buttons to get a generated image is an equivalent to learning how to draw is literally taking away the gift of art. You just want to replace artists for green strips of paper, treating them like freaks. Artists like Scott Christian Sava tolerated the tech you praised so much, using a generated image as a baseline and inspiration, and screwing over artists is how you repay them? Well guess what? You lose. You need us to make your generators work. You need them for DALL-E 2 to work. Know your place.

I would like to end this argument with this portion of a statement that is the definition of art: Art. Noun. ""The expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power."" GenAI does not have that. GenAI damages that definition.",User_deleted,0

I work and I'm taking other Honors classes that are equally as challenging. I have exactly 2 hours to finish homework for every single one of my teachers daily.

I cheated on a Chem essay by using AI. Specifically ChatGPT. Unfortunately, I got caught. I understand that what I did was wrong but in my mind, it was my only option. She assigned the essay two weeks ago but I couldn't get to it because of every other class, her other extremely difficult homework, and work. I was in a very bad place when it came to work, my schedule was messed, I didn't get sleep as my employer was violating child labor laws. I got stressed because if I did it myself, I would've gotten 2 hours of sleep, and went the dishonest route. I used AI. She found out and gave me a 0.1/30 on the essay, which brought my grade down to a 35%. 

She's taking a toll on my mental health and every day life in general. I feel depressed and stressed out every day. She is really picky about everything. An example of this is that I forgot to add a space between lines on my lab report and she took off 10 points, which resulted in an F. 

I feel so stressed and lost. I seriously want to cry everyday. This is too much on me. I don't know who to talk to about this because she said she would sue her students if we trigger her anxiety. She included it on her 25 page Syllabus. She got in trouble and had to send letters to all the students' parents but Im still worried about getting sued. 

Please help.",User_deleted,1
