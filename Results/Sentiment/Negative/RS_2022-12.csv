I also want to ask if anyone has found any ways to mitigate this risk?

The AI software: ChatGPT

My Prompt:  Create a letter aimed at teachers telling them about how students can use AI to cheat when writing reports 

The AI generated content: 

"" 

Dear teachers,

As you may already be aware, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have made it possible for students to use AI to cheat when writing reports. With access to powerful language models like GPT-3, students can easily generate high-quality, human-like text that can be used in their assignments.

While this technology has the potential to make some tasks easier, it also poses a serious threat to academic integrity. Students who use AI to cheat on their assignments are not only undermining the hard work of their peers, but also cheating themselves out of the learning experience.

As educators, it is our responsibility to educate our students about the dangers of using AI to cheat and to help them understand the importance of academic integrity. We can do this by emphasizing the value of original thinking and hard work, and by encouraging students to use AI responsibly and ethically.

If you have any concerns about AI-assisted cheating in your classroom, please don't hesitate to contact me. I would be happy to discuss this issue with you and provide any additional information or support that you may need.

Sincerely, \[Your Name\]

zhcakj,2,2022-12-09,Opinions on ChatGPT and other AIs?,u/GalacticLabyrinth88,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/zhcakj/opinions_on_chatgpt_and_other_ais/,"[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/12/openai-chatgpt-writing-high-school-english-essay/672412/](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/12/openai-chatgpt-writing-high-school-english-essay/672412/)

As an aspiring high school English teacher (and eventual professor) I am starting to get really worried about the rapid progress AI is making, and how the rise of AI could negatively impact both the education field and classroom curriculum as a whole.

An AI like ChatGPT is only going to enable laziness and lack of effort from students in writing assignments and English classes, many of whom already don't want to put in any work for anything, and will thus attempt to find shortcuts or easy paths towards easy As. Are we going to have to ""check for AI"" in essays like we ""check for plagiarism"" from the Internet?

If AIs are getting as good as the above essay suggests, when does it become readily apparent that the human endeavor is obsolete? If Google Maps is any indicator, I fear that future students will come into classrooms effectively borderline dyspraxic or conceptually illiterate because writing will cease to become a subject worth teaching, and go the way of geography. Or worse, they're probably will see school as useless and not attend at all because AIs can do everything they can but way better, and may drastically shorten the learning process.

For fuck's sake, GPT is producing high quality essays and analyses **better than those of most teachers and professors, and disparate ideas like it's nothing.** And that's in 2022. How long will it be before we get AI capable of producing masterful work on the level of William Shakespeare, or Fyodor Dostoevsky, or Miguel Cervantes, or Herman Melville?

Don't the scientists making these AIs realize that not all progress is intrinsically good? Technology and automation is already projected to lead to high unemployment in the future, and facilitate wealth concentration among those who will maximize AI's potential for economic production, or those with the few jobs that will not be replaced by AI.

I don't know what to believe anymore. Maybe I'm talking out of my ass, since I'm no expert. What do you think about all this?",User_deleted,3
zkguxg,17,2022-12-12,My frustrations with ChatGPT,u/ThankGodSecondChance,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/zkguxg/my_frustrations_with_chatgpt/,"Hey everyone, I just wanted to rant a little bit about ChatGPT and how it's making my job as a teacher super frustrating. For those who don't know, ChatGPT is a super smart AI that can write essays on just about any topic and make them sound like they were written by a human. The problem is, when I assign essays to my students, I have no way of knowing if they actually wrote them or if they used ChatGPT.

This is a huge issue for me because I use essays to evaluate my students' understanding of a topic. But if they can just use ChatGPT to generate a high-quality essay, then what's the point? It totally defeats the purpose of the assignment.

But it's not just about me and my grading struggles. The bigger issue is that the use of ChatGPT undermines the whole point of education. The point is to foster learning and critical thinking, not to churn out machine-generated essays. And if students can just use ChatGPT to do their thinking for them, then what's the incentive to put in the effort to learn and think for themselves?

That's why I think it's important for teachers to take a stand against the use of ChatGPT in the classroom. We need to make it clear that original thought and critical thinking are valuable, and that we won't accept machine-generated essays.

Anyway, that's my two cents on the issue. And just to prove how advanced ChatGPT is, I'll let you all in on a little secret: this entire post was actually written by the AI. Crazy, right? But also kind of scary.",active,18

To tell you the truth, it can almost solve all of our exercises in a couple of seconds. I feel like that what I'm learning is not useful, because I can only see that AI is better than us students. What do you guys think about it? Thanks for the advice",active,0

zzg9kh,6,2022-12-30,Why are teachers running away from this technology?,u/mabechai,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/zzg9kh/why_are_teachers_running_away_from_this_technology/,"There seems to be a lot of hand-ringing about how ChatGPT and AI are going to destroy education. As a high school teacher myself, I am considering going all in on using this technology to help students learn how to think and ask great questions. 

Pretending like this technology does not exist or putting up all sorts of firewalls to prevent students from accessing this material seems counterproductive. Whatever career they are going into will rely heavily on this technology, and I want to help them learn how to do this sooner rather than later. Obviously, there are plenty of ways to assess them that will force them to showcase their understanding without access to these tools-good ol’ handwritten blue books for one. 

Any thoughts on these ideas?",active,5
