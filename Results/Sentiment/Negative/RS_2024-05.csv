I'll preface it with how I found myself in this position: I failed one of the top Uni's in the field that I liked enough and had to go down to a mediocre uni to study the field I don't like (Electrical grid engineering). Finished my BSc, went to do MSc as I thought ""this will be different"", and it was going alright, I found myself an industry job in relative job that I liked (mechanical engineering) but then lost it (I had some conflicts with boss and wanted to transfer to another department, but then through circumstances I got laid off as I was preparing to transfer). So I finished MSc without anything lined up. I really didn't want to do PhD. I dislike the field and have sparse understanding of it, I have no idea how to do academic research and what's it all about. But also through the magic of ChatGPT, assortment of random papers that seemed alright to me and MATLAB I managed to finish my Master's diploma, got one of the top grades in my cohort and appraisal and decided to look for jobs after graduation. I didn't find anything in 2 months, I was contacted by my master's advisor who told me I really should pursue PhD, then my whole family also persuaded me to do PhD, telling me that all my previous education is invalid since I didn't graduate from a top Uni, so I caved in and went for PhD. But also since they didn't have enough places for PhD in my Uni I was assigned to some research institute and got a second supervisor.

And now I'm stuck in this research institute with no guidance and no idea what I'm doing or what I'm supposed to be doing. I either can't get an explanation from my supervisor or I straight don't understand it. I'm likely not neurotypical so understanding some things is much harder for me. The supervisor I got assigned to just assumes that I know everything about doing research even though I have 0 idea, so his advice is either that I have to ""work harder"" or something that seems irrelevant to me like how to produce graphs or diagrams (I already know that and don't have a problem with it). I also know how to set up experiments and analyze data/fit mathematical models to data from the top Uni and I feel like I'd be doing alright if I was basing my research on experimental theories, but in here researchers don't do any of that, and I'm supposed to be doing the research purely with mathematical models and relying on other sources to supplement it.

I have tried coming to the research institute to work in the office and I have zero clue of what I'm doing. It was so much easier in the industry where I had ""clear"" goals like ""design this part that can withstand X, Y, Z stresses"" even if those goals/requirements changed to completely opposite in a week, at least I had something to work towards and make progress, even if I had to redesign it completely in a week and I knew what I was doing. The goals here are ""you need to publish 4 papers to international journal this year"", or ""you need to start writing your thesis"" and I then have no idea how to approach them. I was coming to office for 2 months, and all my supervisor was doing is berating me for working too slowly (""where are your papers, why haven't you published anything yet?""), and changing around words in the name of my thesis (""Should we put model or principle in the titple? Should we put smart grid or smart grids or maybe use intellectual grid system instead?""). This just got tiring and depressing and I stopped coming, two months later he informs me he has completely changed the name of my work to something completely different.

I got fed up and decided maybe I should just leave PhD to go work fast food or whatever but the advisor started threatening me. Now, I'm not in US and not even in a first world country so his threats are very much real, that might be like telling international PhD student in US that they will be reported to the immigration the moment they leave the program, so this is giving me even more anxiety and scared me enough that I decided to stay, but now I somehow need to finish my PhD. I can't even change this supervisor for the same reasons that he is now threatening me every time. But I also know that there is no way I'll be able to do anything with this advisor and with his lack of help and mentoring, so I came here for an advice.

Are there any resources I can read that will tell me everything I need to know about PhD and research, from start to finish, with very detailed explanations? Not something like ""just read papers"", because I have no idea which papers to reference, which do I read, what do I take from them. To me a lot of problems would require 2-3 references to the previous problems and 4-5 references to similar solutions and maybe 2-3 references to math, but there are lots of papers that have 40-50 references for whatever reason. Another problem is models, since I won't be setting up experiments, I would need to make models somehow, but I have no idea where I'd find the data and the parameters for them, especially that my paper is on a cross between electrical grid engineering and economics. Are there books for PhD students that can practically replace supervisors?



tl;dr started doing PhD that I hate and have no idea how to do in a field that I don't like and don't understand, can't leave because supervisor is threatening me and now I have to work it on my own but I have no idea how to and so I'm asking for guidance.",User_deleted,0

I’m a Tutor for that company, and believe me when I say that I know exactly how hard your job was, and how much worse it has gotten.

While you guys were trying to navigate the nightmare that was teaching during COVID, we were also right there alongside you tutoring students drastically falling behind in school.

Many of us hold advanced degrees in our fields and were sold onto this company’s false promise of ""democratizing education"". Unfortunately it wasn’t long until red flags started to appear. The company lies to schools about the tutoring being one-on-one  and fires tutors who don’t play along and maintain that facade. 

They’ve also been forcing essay tutors to ""train their replacement"", by having them spend the majority of the time they use to review essays, training an AI that automates the essay reviews kind of like ChatGPT. Essentially all we got for our efforts during COVID was our hours slashed and our 401k benefits taken away.

So we gave unionizing another shot after they busted up a previous union drive and they’ve responded with more union busting. This time however they got caught and the Reddit post below was the Email they were required to send out after a case was filed against them in Ontario.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Paper_Tutors/s/5by9b6njCq

Another thing you should know is that the company tried to get away with paying Ontario tutors less than minimum wage during COVID.

Please don’t let this awful company and its practices be a reflection of the tutors who give it their all and do their very best to support your students! We’re just getting started with holding them accountable

I am in a 3.5 years of PhD. In my first year my professor was new to the system, through the whole year he made me work on several projects but stuck to nothing. The final red flag was when my senior failed. He didn't know how to manage students. I changed my lab to a new professor in my second year who was opposite of my previous PI. I get along well, but lab is toxic as hell. A lot of people keep leaving this lab, I didn't know about this phenomenon before joining because they lied. Plus I also think that there is a huge red flag here, I am now in my third year. Mind you I had to restart my project again from the start. This field is new for me although it falls in the same umbrella. I had to come to this professor because he was he was the only one  closely related to the field that I started with. Right now, I have mostly finished my first chapter (we need 3 chapters here along with lit review). My professor keeps making me work on this technique which is old but he wants me set this up in his lab. I have been working on this technique for last 4 months. There is no support.

Like I said this technique is not novel, its a basic technique of this field. Since this field is new to me, I have to learn from basic, and this is taking all my time. There is no contribution of mine in this project. This project was designed by my professor, along with all the candidates. I thought this was good initially as he might be worried about me finishing fast. But now I think that I am just doing the RA work. I don't think I am confident enough in my knowledge to stand in front of defense. Plus he designed my project too broad so basically I will be master of none. The more time passes, the more stuck I feel. I don't know how to minimize this damage. Even during my latest milestone, I didn't get much help with writing , basically I had to learn the basic concepts quickly using chatgpt, and then write the report. My committee supports me because they think I am working too hard, but they will be not here during defense. In defense we have externals. I don't know what to do. 

I have also realized that I don't want to stay in academia. It is not for me. At this point I just want to minimize the damage, and get over with this phase :(

From what I read here, Yank educational culture seems rife with presenteeism - put up a bare facade of education for many of them, pass them, they become somebody else's problem: employers, college, etc. 

Here in the UK, minus Scotland, most education is, implicitly or explicitly, geared toward the GCSE exams at age 16 and the A-level at 18, which virtually **all** students take in one form or another. The Scots have something similar. While administered in schools, they're inviligated (proctored) by representatives of exam boards with no connection to that school. The papers are collected by them, scanned, and sent around the country - and even abroad - to examiners who have no idea about the candidate they're marking. Those examiners are then moderated by experienced super-examiners.

We're approaching exam season now - mid May to late June - and students up and down the country are pestering teachers like me. ""Sir, can you mark the past paper I did? I stuck to exam conditions. Thanks!"" They understand that there is no way to 'game' the system - no parental emails, no plagiarism, no cajoling for extra credit. Virtually none of the examinations feature multiple-choice questions; in English, my subject, 16-year-olds are expected to write a 50 minute essay on a novel on a surprise prompt, as a typical task.

When results are returned in August, dept heads and admin generally go into a frenzy of data analysis, reflection and, ideally, improvement. Careers can be made or broken. The results are available widely and you can rank schools by them. 

There are plenty of downsides as you can imagine: student stress, a culture of teaching-to-the-test, many students completely forgetting the knowledge as soon as they pass the test, and so on. However, there is basically no discussion, ever, of ""just pass the kid"". 

To what extent is there discussion about increased public examination in the US? I'm aware that never, ever will all 50 states agree on something - but even at the state level?",active,34

A few months ago, I cancelled my ChatGPT Plus subscription due to several issues I've seen echoed here. The quality of answers was deteriorating, it avoided difficult or uncomfortable tasks, and the browsing feature was removed. It also became worse at interpreting documents and images, and the DALL-E feature's capabilities were reduced.

I felt especially frustrated compared to earlier versions from early 2023. Back then, with the right prompts, ChatGPT could deliver incredibly complex and accurate responses. Over the past year and a half, I've logged hundreds of hours using it, only to feel disappointed by the gradual decline in quality. It seemed like the focus shifted from user experience to user acquisition, likely due to the high costs of running language models.

Despite these issues, I was initially happy with ChatGPT Plus, particularly because of the increased speed and reduced wait times. However, the speed improvements seemed to come at the expense of answer quality. The model often ignored prompt parameters, provided vague and lazy responses, and sometimes even suggested I do certain tasks myself instead of offering detailed help.

As a working student, 25 Euros a month was a significant expense, but it was worth it when I could get valuable assistance. I spent many nights coding, writing, and brainstorming with ChatGPT's help, and it was incredibly useful. Now that my intense learning phase at university is over, I miss those productive nights and am considering resubscribing.

Before I make a decision, I wanted to consult the ChatGPT community. **Has the service improved? Is it still top of the line, or should I explore other AI options?** I'd love to hear from other long-time users about their experiences and thoughts.

1cwipjq,58,2024-05-20,Rant: Least Rewarding Semester in a While,u/muaddib8619,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1cwipjq/rant_least_rewarding_semester_in_a_while/,"I just need to get this off my chest, but I've been teaching for 15 years, and this has been one of the least rewarding semesters in a long time. I teach a critical theories of technology and society humanities seminar at the engineering school at an R1 every spring to a group of STEM students. We cover some basic approaches in philosophy of tech, determinism, constructivism, a focus on mediation theory, and then the second half of the semester really gets into Marxist and feminist critiques of tech, power, and questions of ethics and politics.

This semester has just been really dispiriting. For one, almost 80% of the class uses some form of gen AI tool to do their assignments. Last year it was a few outliers; this year it's the majority. We spent a whole session talking about the benefits and drawbacks of using ChatGPT, and why it isn't great for learning how to argue better and get better at not just reading and writing, but thinking. I spent two extra sessions really focusing on bettering reading and writing skills in class. Nothing worked: the students still rely on largely copy-pasting from software. Grading has become an absolute chore: every assignment reads like a robot wrote it. The ways in which students, particularly international students (the majority of my class), are using these tools have become more sophisticated. One student admitted to translating a voice transcript from her native language into English via ChatGPT, and then running the transcript through Grammarly, and then running the entire thing through ChatGPT one more time to give it more of a 'voice'. They're spending more money and time figuring out increasingly complex hacks rather than doing the work.

Not unrelated, in my view, to the above, is the absolute lack of engagement by students in the classroom. Some lack, especially at the beginning of semester, was to be expected, but this semester, there was no attempt, apart from the usual 3-4 who always speak up when prompted, to engage, right up to the end. I had a class conversation and solicited advice in office hours and some students suggested more workshop\\exercise active learning teaching rather than just a straight lecture\\discussion format. I tried doing that in class, putting an hour aside each class and coming up with creative ways to get them to engage via exercises, and half of them don't engage with each other in active-learning assignments, sitting mute on their phones or laptops. Post-exercise discussions, the same thing: the minute I call for the exercise to end and us to discuss collectively what they were discussing in groups, everyone just goes mute.

I've also just felt a great dissonance in and out of the classroom. My campus has been very politically active all year: faculty have been trying to unionize (we won!), plus constant, non-stop protests over divestment from pro-Palestinian protestors. Many of the other humanities colleagues have been talking about how rewarding this semester has been, with rich, engaged conversations in classes from students who are really curious to learn more about capitalism, colonialism, sustainability (apart from the immediate Israel-Palestine conflict)...all of the most pressing issues of our times. Student evals this time pretty much confirmed what I'd suspected all semester stepping into my classroom: students wanted glowing, positively affirmative readings and discussions around STEM contributions to society and the capacity of engineers and designers to do good with technology, and felt my class was too grim and gave a ""hopeless"" view of the world. One student wrote reading Marx and Foucault divested them of a sense of agency in their profession which is not how they wanted to feel. I've envied my colleagues who've had a rewarding semester, intellectually and pedagogically, with campus up in arms: my semester has felt like utter drudgery.  
  
Class evaluations - as no doubt many of you would agree - are a joke. They aren't mandatory in my university, so at this point, only the students who want to rant about how terrible the course was fill them; none of the students who enjoyed the course bother to fill these out. Reading the evals makes it clear that none of the students filling them out really paid attention to what the instructor was trying to do to make the course experience better for them in class, and have no advice, no feedback really, to give. Anyway, that's my rant, it has really sucked to be a humanities professor in an engineering school.",User_deleted,62

I just want to move on, but I worry a lot about my future. This post might get removed by a mod, but I assure you it's on-topic.

Coming from a small post-Soviet country with widespread poverty, the coding schools here are extremely inadequate. The one I attend has a curriculum that is not beginner-friendly. For instance, introducing freshmen with little to no experience to C programming problems that's more suited for an engineering school is...well. The lectures span less than six months, not counting midterms and finals, and there's a lot of material to cover in a short period. We have a total of six courses that require technical skills, and covering the material for just one lecture can take an entire evening. Students tend to be more productive as midterms or finals approach, but there's no time to build a solid foundation to handle the course material independently.

The majority of students have cheated on exams for a year and a half using ChatGPT for coding courses, and the faculty administration allowed it because they knew the school's situation. Even now, professors sometimes let us use Google during exams. I'm 19, almost 20, and I feel like I've wasted so much time. I've only excelled in courses requiring math or physics. I first became interested in coding during the pandemic in 9th or 10th grade and spent the rest of my school years getting tutored in math to ace entrance exams and secure a scholarship.

I enjoy learning about coding and am motivated to pursue it professionally despite struggling with clinical depression and fatigue. It's not just about escaping poverty, I constantly worry about deadlines, failing courses, and the financial burden it would bring. I've considered dropping out in desperate moments, but I feel it would leave me without purpose in the long run. Anxiety fuels me, and if I ever want to return, I'd have to start over, so I might as well get a diploma. I'm holding onto the hope that I still have enough time to build the necessary skills as a coder to get a job in a year or two.

What programming languages, programs, apps, or projects should I look into for my portfolio that are relevant and in demand today and will be in the future for someone who's basically starting over? Any informative articles, links, free courses, or advice from someone who's been in a similar position would be really helpful—anything at all.

To this day, it still consistently fails. For being a damn language model, I would think something like this should be an easy task -- it's something I believe a 2nd grade student could easily answer. 

Here's what I ask:  Give me a word where the 4th letter is a ""Y"".

I've used many different letters and letter positions for the prompt, I've over-simplified the prompt, and even very thoroughly explained, with examples, of what I want. Regardless of how I word the prompt it fails miserably, over and over and over, yet thinks it's correct. The types of responses I get are something like this:

Here's a word -- ""Fairy"". The fourth letter is a ""Y""!

I then tell chatGPT that the word is incorrect, and to explain to me why. It will easily, consistently say something like ""I apologize, I see where I went wrong. Fairy has an ""R"" in the 4th position and not a ""Y"". A correct answer would be ""Mystery"" -- the 4th letter is a ""Y"". 

We then go round and round in circles, with repeated failures. Every time, chatGPT spits out an answer with such confidence, gets it wrong, and is easily able to explain why it's wrong. Yet it never learns from its mistakes and can never correctly answer the prompt. The closest I've been able to get is by asking it to provide this format, and asking it to repeat until it is succeasful:

Attempt 1
-Guess: Fairy
-Number of letters: 5
-Letter in 4th position: ""R""
-Result: Failed

Attempt 2
-Guess: Puddy
-Number of letters: 5
-Letter in 4th position: ""D"" 
-Result: Failed

.
.
.


Attempt 14
-Guess: Beryl
-Number of letters: 5
-Letter in 4th position: ""Y""
-Result: Success

I've done this many times, over months or maybe even years of development, and still it spectacularly fails every time.

Something today that I found weird was, after reaching my frustration limit, I said something like ""Okay forget all of that, let's start over with a simple request. Give me a 4 letter word"". To my amazement, it says ""Certainly! 'Holy' is a four letter word where the 4th letter is a Y!"".... I then replied with a ""wtf, I don't understand you. Give me five more"" and it successfully, effortlessly, spit out 5 more 4-letter words that all ended in Y. So in some backwards-ass round-about way, it was able to come up with successful words, but not without a serious amount of effort, failed attempts, and a scrapping of all my prompts. Instead asking for just a 4 letter word with no other criteria, when it was finally like ""Jk, here you go!""

Does anybody understand why it would be so terrible at such a basic prompt? It will provide words with the 3rd character a ""Y"", many guesses where the last character is a ""Y"", words that start and end with ""Y"", words of all different character lengths, but never a successful answer where the 4th letter is a ""Y"".... And again, it doesn't matter what character you ask for or what position of the word you want it, it just fails every time. 

Also, does anybody have similar examples of easy prompts where chatGPT miserably fails? I know I've experienced unreliable math answers, and even inconsistent answers to the same math problem, but I don't expect it to be overly great at math (despite being a computer...). It's a language model after all, not a math wizard, so I can excuse that for now. But what else have you guys and gals seen and been shocked that chatGPT just simply cannot do correctly?

Basically TLDR of how I got in this mess was that;

1 - we got to make a thesis, shit got split between 3 groups, me and another student, and two other groups with 3 members each. 

2 - but our teacher has a softer teaching style that does not suit a group of students who are in the very tired old lady teacher's words ""chill-chill"", which couldn't be further from the truth. Good people good people, just ah. God it was a nightmare to work with them sometimes. 

3 - been battling with bad mental health which stunted my progress on this very big thesis project. A lot of dad-lore shit happened too, ranaway from home for personal reasons, after a week I was sent back. It's all good now though, well as good as it can me. 

All three of these factors then led to my current predicament. I joined on of the two teams, my other team member following me, at which I thought would be an okay choice at the time. In my days, weeks, months, slumping and being depressed in and out of classrooms, I've seen them at work doing the research thesis. So I assumed the paper would be okay, and I'd just being doing minor edits to iron everything out, printing the copies, and making the PPT and studying the paper so we can defend it. 

It was fine at first, for the first I think week or so. Till it came crashing down. What job of a printer and editor ended up being a team manager, and ending up trying to fix a sinking ship of a paper. Plagiarism abundant in the RRL, our data analysist busy and unresponsive to chats, and the data she gave was good, just lacking the information needed to be okay for a presentation. And Chatgpt was the basis of the questionnaire. Which. Did. Not. Help in the data analysis part. It doesn't help that it really feels like blind leading the blind with me suddenly leading the team and taking on MOST of the responsibility. And their lack of knowledge of things and unwillingness to just Google and read is frustrating. It doesn't help that the data which was the back bone of our research was also, freaking incomplete as hell. 

God this sucks balls. I really want to quit but fuck I know I can't. 

And there's barely enough time left to fix everything. 

The best I can do is to strip down the paper, make it barebones and to rephrase everything because of what I think one of the team member did was copy and pasted sections of another authors paper and called it day. 

Fucking hate this and it's so close to graduation too. Fuck I feel so frustrated.

I am really just at my wits end with this problem. I have spent 6+ hours on it and haven't made any progress and my prof isn't very helpful. He doesn't seem to understand the concept of a student simply not understanding something which is terribly frustrating.

Question: 

1: Two pure tones with frequency of 440 Hz and no phase shift are combined. The first tone has a waveform equation of  -38cos(880πt) The second tone has amplitude of 38√3. Write out the second tone's waveform in terms of a sine function.

2: Use an angle sum/difference formula to write the waveform equation for the combined tone, using a single sine function.

3: Rewrite the equation from Step 2 so that it matches the general waveform equation described above.

4: Use the equation from Step 3 to determine the amplitude and phase shift for the combined tone.",active,1
1d1gxhg,168,2024-05-26,ChatGPT + image functionality = online class crisis,u/TheOverlordsoftheUFO,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1d1gxhg/chatgpt_image_functionality_online_class_crisis/,"I am absolutely miserable today and can't sit still from anxiety. I’m a lowly phd abd adjunct, and these kinds of things terrify me because of my lack of experience.

I'm teaching an online upper division history class, and we just did an assignment where students look at a previously unseen image, write a short analysis of it without doing any research beyond what they learned in  
class, and then discuss it with classmates in groups. 

I hadn’t realized that ChatGPT had recently added image analyzing functionality, fml.

It’s usually a great assignment and we have lots of funny, lively discussions, but this time the ChatGPT pros were out in numbers, *even using it to churn out responses to their human classmates’ posts*.

I had posted a warning not to use AI, not only because it’s so obvious, but because it produces such bad quality history writing. I told them that they’d get a zero if they use it.

So I just finished the grading the assignment last night and 10 percent of the class got zeroes. I didn’t accuse anyone of using AI, I just said (rightfully) that their submissions didn’t follow the assignment instructions or rubric and were excessively vague and contradictory. They deserved zeroes just on their own merits, ChatGPT aside.

This morning, I woke up to FURIOUS emails from said students insisting that their submissions were worth MUCH MORE, so I spend three straight hours going over them and pointing out all the glaring factual errors and contradictions, hinting that the style of the text is very strange, but never mentioning AI.

I have a feeling at least a few of these students are going to want to take this to the department or to the dean. According to my school’s policy, using ChatGPT without citing it is the same as plagiarism, but I’m not totally confident that they’ll back me up. If someone at the department gave me half an hour of their time, I could prove to them that these submissions are AI just by showing how you get extremely similar text by putting the image + prompt into ChatGPT. You get identical terms and even whole strings of words, none of which sound like they were written by a human.

I developed this class and have thrown a significant portion of my life into it – it’s an outstanding, challenging class. To see it destroyed in this manner by lazy students makes me feel sick at heart. And further, to be rudely harassed by students who know perfectly well that they cheated? It’s intolerable.",active,189

I'm sure teachers are using AI to generate their tests, students are using AI to answer these same questions. Websites are being written using AI without being proof read for errors. All of this out of pure laziness.  Right now I can choose if I want my information from a human source such as a website article or from AI (ChatGPT).. Soon that line will be blurred because we just won't know if the source is AI or not.  That's a bit scary to me. ",active,25
1d4asbv,17,2024-05-30,ECE2071 is a horrible unit,u/YogurtclosetSimple58,Monash,https://www.reddit.com/r/Monash/comments/1d4asbv/ece2071_is_a_horrible_unit/,"It all went downhill when MIPS was introduced. FIVE hours of lecture videos in week 7 for when it was first introduced, and we're just expected to be perfect in it and then be able to finish the 12+ hours of videos in weeks 7, 8 and 9 with perfect knowledge to do the third assignment as well as the MIPS lab test. Even the project for this unit was awful - literally every last person including the geniuses had to chatGPT the vast majority of the code for this. To add to that, the unit has always had a ridiculously high failure rate, so you'd think that they would atleast learn that alot of the students are struggling and would atleast space out the content because there's simply way too much to learn in such a short period of time and balance our other units.",active,27
