Just letting everyone use AI doesn't sit well with me, but investigating every darn thing is also getting ridiculous. I have a whole lesson about what genAI is, why I'm not allowing it (we're developing our writing muscles!), make them sign a contract that they won't use it—and they use it. I've tried requiring them to write in either Google Docs or Microsoft Word Online and then share with me so I can view the version history, but it's so cumbersome and such a waste of time, and I don't want to just keep catching them. I want to be more proactive than reactive; I want to teach them, not police them. The work is not actually hard; they can do everything themselves and pass quite easily. 

I've tried more personal assignments, and then I just learn about ChatGPT's made-up hobbies or whatever. I'm all ears for more AI-proof assignments, but I haven't figured this out. 

We use Canvas, and I'm considering using Respondus Lockdown for some assignments so I can be reasonably assured at least those assignments are their own work. Would this work? I haven't had time to investigate it. I'm worried because so many of my students sign up for online classes and then have major issues with very basic technical requirements, so even just giving permissions to this extension may be a hurdle.

I am a mathematics student in college and I admit to using AI a lot this semester on my homework in my classes (both my math classes and non-STEM electives). Now that the semester is closing, I’m reflecting on this and realized that my learning was very much stunted this semester due to my AI habits. For my math classes, I used AI on every assignment, mostly for speed, but a lot of the time I wouldn’t even think about the problem and I’d just put it through ChatGPT and as long as the answer used our course content, I’d go with it. I know that this is considered misuse of AI, but from everything I’ve seen this semester, 90% of students who use AI also use it in this way. Students who claim to use AI only for creating study materials, checking work, etc, are for the most part lying. I don’t have the discipline to use AI in a healthier way for my assignments. As a result, I learned way less content throughout the semester and had to cram for exams, and got lower exam scores than previous semesters. 

I decided that I’m going to ban myself from using AI next semester, but I’m wondering if this will also hurt me. All of my peers will be misusing AI for their assignments, so I will probably get lower scores than them on assignments despite putting in more work. My classes are all curved, so this will directly affect me. Also, the nature of education is shifting because of AI, and I’m sure we’ll see AI more accepted in academia in the future, and I’m wondering if I will be at a disadvantage when we reach that point if I avoid it all together as it’s developing. For the record, I plan on going to grad school and pursuing a career in academia, so this “issue” for me won’t leave once I graduate. 

Does anyone have any thoughts? I also want to open the discussion for general thoughts on AI use in college. ",User_deleted,12

Writing essays has never been my thing, and in grade 10, I thought it was a genius idea to use AI to write my English assignment. Spoiler alert: I got caught, and was shitting ma pants 😓. I was really embarrassed , especially since I had a great relationship with that teacher. After that, I retired my AI-cheating ways. 
Fast forward to now, I actually came up with an actual genius idea to improve my essays. I started using my teacher’s exemplars as a guide—basically, I copied the structure and format but wrote my own content. Id say it worked pretty good, because it was exactly what my teacher wanted.

Now, I have to write a literature review for my humanities class, and surprise, this teacher didn’t give us an exemplar. When I asked, she showed me some random student’s work and said it wasn’t exactly what she wanted. When I pushed for at least a “near-perfect” example, she hit me with, “There’s no perfect way to do it.” 😐
So now I’m stuck. I’ve never written a literature review before, and I’m thinking of asking ChatGPT to generate an example based on the rubric, then showing it to my teacher for feedback and fixing it from there. My question is: would this be cheating since I’d technically be using an AI-generated structure? If it is, what do I do instead? And yes, I know someone will say, “Just follow the rubric,” but let’s be real—I have no clue what I’m doing. Asking my teacher isn’t much better because she’s always in a bad mood and yells 24/7. 😭 🤦🏻‍♀️. Anyway, I’d appreciate advice.

As you know, RP allocates your group for you instead of letting choose your own teammates as compared to other polys and i don’t view it as a bad thing but in this case gosh im actually LIVID. 

Usually our class schedules are usually delegated like this:

morning: a run of what we’ll learn on that day and going through some slides
break: worksheet
before lunch: going through of the worksheet
lunch: slides
after lunch: presentation 

And while my lecturer was going through the worksheet, i was attentively listening and writing down my own notes because its crucial for my end of semester examination thus i diligently did corrections in the shared document and wrote some notes. However, from the corner of my eye i noticed my teammate had already started on the slides so i asked “hey, you’ve started on the slides already?” and not only did she flat out ignored me, her friend replied for her “yeah”. I literally do not care if they’re doing it early instead of listening to the lecture cause not everyone wants to stay in class during lunch to work on the slides and i also know that besides the 3 of them in my group they have other friends from outside the course that they probably also want to meet up for lunch BUT STILL I WASNT PREPARED FOR WHATS ABT TO COME. Besides the 3 of them being in one clique, there was another boy who they also didn’t tell about the slides (lets call him boy A). As a group we all already AGREED LIKE THEY SAID OKAY that I would be creating the slides and that we’d do it together as a team but NO they decided to do it, just the 3 of them discreetly without telling me or Boy A and by the time i realised, they already did 90% of the slides.

My life is a soap opera (and I need a better grade),u/FarewellTrees,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1h9w0fv/subject_urgent_my_life_is_a_soap_opera_and_i_need/,"Here's a little insight into the kinds of emails I am receiving this weekend:   


Dear Professor,   
It all started with the untimely demise of my beloved childhood dog, Mr. Woof. He was more than just a pet; he was my confidante, my furry soulmate, my emotional support animal (ESA – do I need a note for that?). His passing sent me spiraling into the depths of despair. I do apologize for not being able to contact you sooner, but this past month has been extremely stressful for me.

As I was grappling with this unbearable grief, my best friend from childhood with whom I have not spoken for the past decade, who was a mere five seconds away from giving birth, was struck down by a tragic bout of bedridden agony and/or woe. This contributed to my spiraling depression which was only worsened when she went into labor, a grueling 40-hour ordeal that culminated in an emergency C-section so dramatic it makes the plane crash episode Grey's Anatomy seem boring.   
  
Amidst this chaos, I completely forgot about your class. I know that I've done absolutely nothing of substance, but I really enjoyed this class and your teaching style. I was wondering if you would be willing to do more work by assigning me some extra credit that you can spend additional finite time grading rather than the work you already assigned the entire semester that I decided not to do?   
  
I also know that I intentionally missed the deadline for withdrawing from the course, but remember, I was in the throes of my Mental Health Issues (TM). Passing this class it of the utmost importance to me and my entire family, whose very livelihoods are at risk if you do not give me the grace I am demanding and is a requirement of your career. 

Thank you so much for your time,   
Student 

P.S. Do you accept tear-stained essays as documentation? I have a whole collection, courtesy of my favorite tutor, ChatGPT, and would be more than willing to submit them and then contest any points you decide to take off.  ",User_deleted,137

I'd get one awkwardly written paper after another. Now the course is about 75% bland ass AI generated papers. I've run my assignment descriptions through Chat GPT and Claude (paid and free versions) and it generates an acceptable (if completely droll) product. 

I can't stand to grade another boring AI generated paper. I am so annoyed and bored! How have you been AI-proofing your assignments? I'm going to attempt to restructure the assignments (it's online- asynch) to prevent or at least reduce so much AI usage. 

  
I've been telling my students that, I can't stop them from using AI, but.... and  then I do my spiel about how there is much to be gained from the process of researching, thinking, planning and writing, as opposed to just generating a product for a grade.

1. How are you AI-proofing your assignments?

This whole semester i’ve seen lecturers be disrespected in a way i’ve never seen in my undergrad (which was mostly home students). However, this year people have turned up 30 min+ late to lectures, disrespected exam conditions and have just had no respect for course mates or staff. 

Not to mention that most of these people don’t know how to speak english. English isn’t my first language either, but the way people who are literally not qualified to take a course in taught English yet are somehow here is totally beyond me. 

Just seems incredibly unfair that home students have to suffer with group project mates who do nothing, plagiarise and then violate exam conditions and we simply don’t have enough staff to punish everyone who does it.

The thing is, I have skipped almost all of my lectures on it (they're all online) and have barely done any of the homework assignments for it (they don't count towards my final grade). 

My dad, who is a software dev, tried to teach me Python when I was younger but he was a horrible teacher as he would yell at me and get frustrated every time I got something wrong or couldn't understand how to do something, so that really put me off it. I do R as well, which I am really liking, so I know it's not necessarily coding that I struggle with. 

But I am like 10 weeks behind on my lectures and I have already missed an assignment that counted towards 20% of my final module grade. I also managed to hand in another assignment which did count towards my final grade, but I half-assed it. My code was barely able to run and I had to use ChatGPT for basically the whole thing.

I contacted my personal tutor for support and I have a month-long break ahead, where I plan to grind it out and hope I can do better in my other assignments for this module. Am I screwed? Is there anything else I can do, or is what I plan to do fine?",User_deleted,6

I did however, do all my own work and take responsibility when I didn't. I loved and still love learning. I did challenge disorganized, shitty professors who were clearly phoning it in. And I won every time, because I'm a goddamn hoarder who kept every paper assignment I ever wrote until graduation. As such, I'm also a hoarding professor who keeps every single excuse note and document I need to do my job. Now to the point of my post.

I'm not sure I'm cut out to be a professor. I am a good instructor. I believe in the socratic method of interaction and question to encourage critical thinking. I'm kind, fair and equitable. But 85% of my students are chatgpt zombies who don't GAF about learning and or even doing their work. I don't take it personally, truly. However, it is emotionally exhausting to explicitly explain things over and over again or to offer students 100 opportunities to ask questions and they pay zero attention or throw clarification opportunities away. Half of them don't even attend class. 

They can choose one of the four options (they absolutely know AT LEAST that). I explicitly explained that the group project should be equal to the work each of them would do on their own if they went solo in order to earn 300 points (out of 1000). They do not have a final exam. Today, I got a presentation with three boring white slides with the most generic content and riddled with spelling errors. I said \[above\] I don't take their apathy personally, however, this feels like an insult. Like I'm too stupid to know this took you 15 mins max rather than the 3 mos I gave you to do it. Another student submitted what equated to an elementary school book report on communication devices. I teach interpersonal communication not Alexander Graham Bell. They even include picture of the fucking telephone, and leaving loads of blank spaces on the page as well. No work cited page. WTF am I even doing?

Unfortunately, that transition doesn't appear to be helping all that much. I just finished grading the latest round of in-class essays and I've had a number of extremely suspicious results. For context, the assignment is to write a essay in a given span of time based on an essay prompt given the class before. It's not open book so I let them prepare, and I specifically instruct them to base their response to the prompt on course readings other content covered in class. But none of their work demonstrates even a cursory understanding of the readings (because, shocker, they don't do readings). As far as I can tell, they prep for the essays by having ChatGPT do the work for them. So there are essays that feature all the classic AI tells: that familiar syntax and sentence structure, vagueness, the refusal to do more than ""both sides"" a complex issue, and so on. Most of my students have poor English and so the use of higher-level concepts also make it obvious. I don't know how they're managing to get away with this in-class without me noticing, but they are finding ways.   
  
But I just encountered something else that is totally bizarre. I came across three essays that all had the same word-for-word paragraph. Two of these students sit beside each other, but the third is on the (far) opposite side of the room. If it was only the first two, I would simply chalk it up to copying off a partner. But there are three of them! The paragraph in question is not taken from an internet source, the course textbook, or lecture slides (though there are other parts of these essays directly copied from Wikipedia). As far as I know, LLM's rarely produce the exact same material more than once, so it seems unlikely that these three students all used AI independent of each other. Are students generating essays before hand and distributing them? Are they making AI study guides that they copy off? That's the only thing I can think of that would explain this. I've had other bizarre things happen that would also suggest strange levels of communication, such as essays submitted for my course that were based on my essay prompt for the other course I am currently teaching.

I also suspect that this may be the reason for the test's relatively high difficulty, and it's a test I did poorly in.

The reason I suspect this is because class scores on the test were shared by the lecturers - the top grade was 100% and the average grade was around 96%. My grade was equivalent to a 2:2 and was the lowest grade. I didn't find the content hard to understand when I was revising - the test was just really difficult. However, I generally perform very well on other modules and have high grades (equivalent to a first) whereas I've noticed that all the other students perform poorly academically on other modules. The students also almost never answer any questions asked in classes, whereas I answer more questions than all other students combined.

The test is multiple-choice and if you were to put the questions and choices on ChatGPT, it'll tell you all the correct answers. I haven't seen classmates using it, though, and have no hard proof that they have. The teachers haven't been checking that students haven't been using ChatGPT during the test.

I was wondering how best to deal with this. It's had me very worried that the same thing might happen on other modules next term, and that it might significantly lower my grade. It's also frustrating that students might be cheating and doing amazingly well. I was wondering if others had dealt with something before. Should I speak to the module tutors, or go directly to the programme director?

I was messing around and got into an argument with my cousin about ChatGPT output, so I put in my original paper to see if it would be different. Believe me, the ChatGPT version was not better.

I have ADHD and don't notice small things sometimes, and I submitted THE CHATGPT VERSION OF MY PAPER!

  
I sent this email to the admissions committee:

Hello

I’m reaching out because I recently applied to the Graduate School of Education for the Interdisciplinary Studies in Human Development PhD program. I uploaded my writing sample from a paper I wrote for a class at New York University, and I made a huge error. I put the paper in ChaGPT for fun to see if it would look any different after it was edited, but I submitted that version instead of the original. I only realized the error today because I opened the document to show it to a student currently enrolled in my old program for reference for her own paper. 

If it is too late to submit the original, I understand. Though the two papers look the same, I felt it was dishonest to keep that version for review without disclosing this. Attached is the original. They are almost identical, and that is why I didn’t recognize the mistake originally. There were two errors in the original paper that the program fixed, but I left both errors in the attached document. 

I sincerely apologize to the Admissions Committee for submitting that version. It was completely unintentional. I make mistakes of this nature often because I have ADHD, not because I do not care. Attached is the original. I appreciate the committee’s consideration of my application, and I hope that this oversight will not hinder my opportunity for acceptance.

i have a small problem. I got an coding task sent on coderpad after applying for a summer internship, which i solved with the help of chatgpt, and i got invited for an interview onsite (first round, no interview before) I feel so stupid, bc i now googled how the cheating mechanism works, and found out, they can track when i left the window, which i basically did all the time, as i copied the solution.

It‘s pretty obvious what i did, so know i am wondering why the heck did they invite me. I am thinking about not attending and simply telling them that i found something else, probably they just invited me to let me suffer by asking too hard questions and testing me? 

Just fyi, i am a master student in computer science and i have software engineering experience, i just cheated bc i forget to solve the coding tasks and when i found out, that i only have 2 hours to solve the tasks bc the link expires i was just attending a in person lecture at my uni so i was already stressed.

Students have taken an intro micro class and a math 101 course (\~calculus 1) in their first semester.

 Unfortunately, the last time I taught this course to a similar batch,  I realized the poor math prep of students which resulted in poor grades (half the class failed the first open-book timed online take-home quiz: even chatGPT couldnt help them), dilution of standards at the end (had to reduce pass mark to 30) and course evaluations where students rated me highly on preparedness (4.5/5) but low on test difficulty and fast pace (3/5). Some examples of poor math background (some of these were questions on quizzes/exams which they deemed ""unfair"" and too difficult):

A. Can't differentiate 2\^X correctly. 

B. Can't recognize equations of circles/parabolas/rational functions. 

C. Can't write the equation of a line by looking at a diagram, especially if the axes read price and quantity (instead of the usual x and y) 

A portion of the course was taught by another faculty member who basically gave the EXACT same questions in the exam that s/he did in class and the students were very happy with that model (because it was easy to get a 20/20). Here I thought we were supposed to teach students well, challenge them and not spoonfeed them.

(LONG RANT)",u/grannytodd,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1hhepno/101_depression_in_the_top_10_a_perfect_storm_long/,"In my 101 humanities class this semester, I assigned my usual: around 15 total pages of writing (SHOCK) and three short multiple choice quizzes (AWE), plus as many as 30 pages of reading per week (AWE REDUX). Suffice to say, this inhumane burden tanked my evals. 



*Nine* of my eleven eval comments complained that the class was far too labor-intensive. It was ""unfair"" how much they had to work. This was the only complaint that came up, but almost every eval shared this same complaint. 



Now, the scary plot twist: I teach at a US News ""Top 10"" R1. And at this ""elite"" college, I assign the freshmen far less than what I used to assign as an adjunct at unranked R2 and SLAC campuses years ago. 



Back then, I used to require weekly one-pagers and a multimedia project along with the stuff listed above, and no one ever complained that I was a ""hard"" prof. The workload in my classes was invariably described on evals as ""moderate"" or ""fair."" 



So how did I go from ""moderate/fair"" to ""beastly-hard"" while *lowering* the workload and moving to the top of the holy US News list? Shouldn't students in the Top 10 be used to working *more* and complaining *less*?



I've been polling colleagues and pondering, and I'm putting together some elements:

  
1) Test-optional admissions. This is the top culprit I have in mind. The bottom five final papers in my class exhibited levels of basic literacy that would have been ""screened out"" by the SAT verbal / reading comprehension results in prior eras. 



2) Plummeting *private* high school standards. It used to be just ""test-obsessed"" public schools that got trashed for lowering literacy standards, while private schools were reportedly holding the line for rigor. Now it seems the elite high schools are caving too. 



3) The death of writing assignments. Multiple students told me they'd never written a paper longer than 3-4 pages. One basically told me she can't write *at all* without using Grammarly or some other AI helper. I suspect she wasn't the only one. 

  
4) The widespread idea that humanities is basically a scam unworthy of serious attention; that it's an exercise based on moral grandstanding & tokenizing cults of victimhood rather than on the critical thinking skills we hope to impart. Fair or unfair, the idea is out there. 

  
5) The decline of reading. Not just for class, but also for fun. Young Adult literature is still very popular, seemingly, but tell me: when is the last time you saw a 20-something reading a physical book on the metro or at a coffeeshop -- the places where such sights used to be commonplace? And don't tell me they're all reading novels on their phones instead. I don't believe it, cos I can see how fast they're doom-scrolling! 

  
6) A ""hustler"" mentality. Life is a scam, the economy is a scam, crabs in a bucket, the rat-race, and so on. I feel like the right *and* left are both neck-deep in this depiction of American society nowadays, and I fear it may be curdling our students' souls. 

  
7) An ""everyone cheats"" mentality. ""Everyone else is using ChatGPT, so why do I have to work?"" Many can't answer that question themselves, tragically. 

  
8) The tyranny of evals. Personally, I *still* think using evals in tenure and promotion decisions is better than nothing (and far better than ""peer observation,"" i.e. having either your tyrant Chair or your bestie sit in on a single lecture and purport to offer an ""objective"" assessment), but I have to admit: even post-tenure, I *fear* bad evals. Because my colleagues can see them. Because other students can see them. Because they seem permanent. 

  
So what do I plan to do next time? Lower the workload, of course. Or take up drinking. Or both?

I was forced into a severe time crunch with 5 minutes on the clock, to complete 4 questions that would effect my classwork grade immediately.

Every physics class I was so happy when I saw that my professor did not have enough time in his morning to create an exit ticket for the class, thus saving myself a mental HIIT session.

But then as they say, ""*you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.""*

Fast forward 2 years and I join a startup, VegaAI (otherwise known as ""Vega"" and ""myvega""), that has made monumental strides in using ai tools for education. And no, not your ChatGPT wrapper like the other ""AI for school"" companies.

When I joined, the startup already was able to generate hyper-realistic questions for SAT, ACT, AP exams and even had integrated ai tutors that mimic personalities of your favorite teacher, celebrity, athlete, anyone literally. I learned that top institutes around the world were its customers and these institutes' teachers were using VegaAI to create 5 page long home-works, exams, classworks, etc. all within seconds. Seconds.

But then I saw a grayed out tool that was ""under development"", and this was what I had to work on. It read, ""Exit Ticket Generator"" (ETG). 

No freaking (to keep it PG) way.

Over the course of the next 3 weeks I helped productize and integrate this tool next to the many other tools that Vega has for its educators. The ETG was able to use questions from an educator's question bank and generate a multi-question exit ticket with your desired difficulty, topics, and question count.

I was forced into a severe time crunch with 5 minutes on the clock, to complete 4 questions that would effect my classwork grade immediately.

Every physics class I was so happy when I saw that my professor did not have enough time in his morning to create an exit ticket for the class, thus saving myself a mental HIIT session.

But then as they say, ""*you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.""*

Fast forward 2 years and I join a startup, VegaAI (otherwise known as ""Vega"" and ""myvega""), that has made monumental strides in using ai tools for education. And no, not your ChatGPT wrapper like the other ""AI for school"" companies.

When I joined, the startup already was able to generate hyper-realistic questions for SAT, ACT, AP exams and even had integrated ai tutors that mimic personalities of your favorite teacher, celebrity, athlete, anyone literally. I learned that top institutes around the world were its customers and these institutes' teachers were using VegaAI to create 5 page long home-works, exams, classworks, etc. all within seconds. Seconds.

But then I saw a grayed out tool that was ""under development"", and this was what I had to work on. It read, ""Exit Ticket Generator"" (ETG). 

No freaking (to keep it PG) way.

Over the course of the next 3 weeks I helped productize and integrate this tool next to the many other tools that Vega has for its educators. The ETG was able to use questions from an educator's question bank and generate a multi-question exit ticket with your desired difficulty, topics, and question count.

Luckily I am out of school so I won't get these exit tickets anymore. But, I know the educators reading this will be thanking me for this tool while the students reading this will probably be very upset.

1hkx8kp,3,2024-12-23,(CS major) existentially concerned about AI,u/echo5324,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1hkx8kp/cs_major_existentially_concerned_about_ai/,"Today me and my dad (CS teacher for many years) tried a really difficult programming problem for several hours and didnt complete it fully (we got the solution but it wasn't \*fast\* enough). After some time trying, we took a break, and then out of curiousity I copy/pasted into ChatGPT, and it got a valid answer in like 10 seconds. I wasn't super surprised since I know how effective it is, but it really just made me depressed. Like I like coding and me/fellow students/ think im pretty decent at it. But if an AI can do what I can, faster and better, what's really the point? Obviously there are still things I will get that AI can't now, and maybe never will. But it still just makes me feel kinda empty.  
  
Life is not about your work, there's plenty else that I value. But I like being productive and contributing and doing things, and I'm not great at doing like projects for myself. I think if we entered some kind of utopia where machines did all the work and we could just sit around and do whatever if we wanted, I'd actually go insane. I'm definitely exaggerating the issue in my head, but its just really getting me down right now, idk.  ",active,3
1hlpb3f,1,2024-12-24,"I have a lot of problems with you people (who come here to shame students), and now you’re going to hear about them!",u/atCommunications,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1hlpb3f/i_have_a_lot_of_problems_with_you_people_who_come/,"I know yesterday was Festivus, but I still have a lot of problems with you people… and now you’re going to hear about them!

(For context: I’ve been an adjunct at a Big Ten university (you can go through my posts to see where) for 5 years. I teach 1-2 classes (typically 40-80 students) per semester. So these aren’t my first rodeos. I’m also the parent of a college senior, which may influence my perspective and give me more empathy. But then again (according to my mom and my wife) I’m also a nice person.)

**1. Those of who regularly you come here to mock or shame students (even if you don’t identify them) are a-holes.**

I’m not excusing bad behavior, but show some grace. You never know what someone else is going through. If a student asks a dumb question, then do your job and \*profess.\* If they’re asking you for a favor, occasionally consider granting it. If they seem to be trying to take advantage, give them the benefit of doubt for asking and explain why they can’t be accommodated. Consider that students are newer to this than you and I are, and they legitimately may not understand. You may even need to explain it twice.

**2.** Aside from teaching I’ve also worked in corporate America for 25 years with some of the world’s biggest businesses. **I assure you that more often than not, it IS okay to \*occasionally\* turn in something late.** Don’t fail students (or even drop A's to B's) just because they turn in one assignment late. You’re \*not\* teaching them a valuable lesson because in fact that’s \*not\* how the ‘real world’ works. (I give students one free late pass each semester; does not however apply to final projects/exams.) Again, show some grace.

**3. Tell your students you’re proud of them.** Instructors may say ""nice work"" or ""good job,"" but hearing that you’re \*proud\* of them is on a whole different level. You can even be proud of students who get C’s or worse if they tried hard and that’s the best they could do. Always remember that students look up to you. From time to time everyone needs to hear that someone’s proud of them, and they may not be getting this at home.

**4. Quit bitching about ChatGPT and learn to deal with it.** Not only are your students using it, they \*need\* to use it because it’s the future. So take some time to learn \*how\* students are using it (not just that they are using it), and instead of banning it, be forward thinking and find ways to actually incorporate it into your class.

Contrary to what you might think, my experiences have been that fewer — not more — students try taking advantage when I run my classes this way. In five years, I’ve literally just had one “grandma died” excuse (sadly, she really did). Instead of ridiculous excuses, I promote an environment in which students feel comfortable being honest with me when they mess up. And when I can (and as long as it’s not habit), I let them fix their mistakes (re-do an assignment they misunderstood or submit one late if they missed the deadline). Who doesn’t mess up from time to time?

I don’t know how to end this post other than to say: If you’re one of the people who comes here to gossip about students, shame on you. Next time you’re inclined to do so, think about whether or not the world will actually end if instead you show your students some grace.

Thanks for listening to my rant. Happy holidays and enjoy a well-deserved winter break!",active,0

CHATGPT IS AWFUL AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED

Marked as academic misconduct because using AI to negotiate a grade up probably counts as that. I've been lurking the professors sub, and I keep seeing complaints about AI emails. I'm just curious, does this *lovely* email that ChatGPT cooked up for me sound similar to the emails that students who are not doing well try to convince you is them?

ChatGPT:

Subject: Request for Clarification and Grade Review

Dear [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing regarding my grade for [Course Name/Assignment Name], as I noticed I received a C. I truly value your feedback and the opportunity to learn under your guidance, and I wanted to better understand the criteria used to evaluate my performance.

I put considerable effort into [specific aspects of the course/assignment, e.g., research, analysis, or class participation], and I was hoping to achieve a stronger outcome. Upon reviewing my work and comparing it to the grading rubric, I feel there may have been some aspects where my efforts or understanding of the material might not have been fully reflected in the grade.

Could we schedule a meeting to discuss this further? I would appreciate any additional feedback you could provide so I can identify areas for improvement and clarify any misunderstandings about the grading process. I am also open to exploring additional ways to demonstrate my understanding of the material, such as submitting an additional project or revising certain parts of my work.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I greatly appreciate your willingness to help me improve and better understand how I can meet your expectations in the future.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

It's an old one I had started working on before prisonner's code. It's not fully finished and I won't work more on it for now, but it works quite well nonetheless so I thought I might as well share it.

1hmkntl,2,2024-12-26,I messed up my life after high school.,u/No_Interest_1285,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1hmkntl/i_messed_up_my_life_after_high_school/,"1.5 years now in. 2.6 gpa. CS major. I cannot handle it anymore. The workload is too high. Apparently, the courses I have this semester should be 30 ects in total. I have 6 courses in total, 2 are 3 ects and 4 are 6 ects.  Except for that one 3 ects course, which was very easy and nice, and also had no exam (but assignments), the rest feels at least 1.5x of the credits. The other 3 ects course feels like 6 credits, and the other 4 feel like 9 ects each.

I am so behind in class. I feel hopeless - I used to be last year angry and scared, but this year I almost just accept the fact that I am screwed. The average rating of most subjects in my college is roughly 2-3.5 stars out of 5. My peers, international students and local students also agree that the workload is incredibly high and that each subject should be 9 ects effort-wise. Most profs are AWFUL. They teach nothing, almost everything I've learned is thanks to YouTube, ChatGPT or the internet. I'm just here for the degree but I can't see myself doing this for another 1.5 years. And for each course, you can only repeat it once.

The profs explain hardly anything - and yet I decided to go to class because it's everywhere written/ older people tell that you should attend class. But what's the whole point if you have to anyways study it by yourself?

Besides the awful uni environment, the exam design is bad too. Everything multiple choice and it's focused on each tiny mentioned detail. I've sacrificed so much the last 1.5 years, but this semester I've stopped almost everything just for college - my hobbies, friends, and going out for walks.... I don't think this lifestyle is sustainable.

And the job market is awful too, to get a job you need a good degree or good connections - I have none of them. I don't even think that dropping out is wise because right now I don't have any alternative - because I don't think that other majors are much better than this one. The only thing I'd try is the medicine entrance exam, because I think that for the same effort, becoming a doctor is much better than being in a job where the golden age is over.

I wish I had written the medical entrance exam because at least there, the effort you put in has a purpose. And I really cannot maintain this isolated lifestyle anymore. My self-confidence is at an all-time low. My parents make fun of me because of my low grades. And I feel high social pressure. I used to be a straight-A student in high school, so everybody was curious about what would happen to me. 

Going to trade school is also really tough, as it requires you to do an apprenticeship which again is 2 years. And this C's get degrees....that's all cap IMO. Better grades do get you a better job. And getting extracurricular activities where I live is so tough.

I fucked up my life after high school. Thanks for reading.",User_deleted,2

1hopf8n,9,2024-12-29,Bad students essay,u/BigMark02,AskTeachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTeachers/comments/1hopf8n/bad_students_essay/,"So there is this very bad student in my class, and he wrote this very bizarre essay, with a very bizarre tone. It’s bad, but in a unique way. I don’t even know what to do with it. It’s clearly not ChatGPT, but it’s still a little suspicious for a 12-year-old. However, there’s still many issues with it, as you’ll see. He once accidentally admitted that his older brother Caleb, apparently 19, helps him write his essays, I’m wondering if that may have to do with it.

Here’s the essay

“If you stare at the abyss long enough, the abyss stares back at you,” was famously said by philosopher Frederic Nietzsche back in ‘86…1886, that is. The central point of this essay will be just that—the abyss—and why our very language is fundamentally rooted in it. But what is the abyss? For the sake of this essay, I will define it as anything I have recognized as words that reflect absurd nonsense.

Arrogant? Maybe, but the good news is I’m sure René Descartes would be proud of me, assuming he isn’t an arrogant little one as well. After all, if Descartes gets to righteously proclaim “I think, therefore I am” with virtually no critique from our scholars, I think the 12-year-old deserves a break from our teachers—what do you say? Alright, let's get this out of the way.

Yap word 1: millennial

Yes, I’m gonna intentionally avoid capitalizing “millennial” because it’s not a proper noun, as it ain’t a real generation. Originally defined in 1991 by boomer authors Neil Howe and William Strauss as the generation born between 1982 and, ahem…2003, this “generation” was doomed to be infantilized from day one. Why did Strauss and Howe pick the specific dates of 1982 to 2003, you may ask? The answer is quite ridiculous, as it has to do with their theory of “social turnings” and the idea that kids born in 2003 were supposedly the “last to enter their childhood under the third turning.” This theory has been heavily criticized by historians alike as “bunk.”

So, why is this generation's very existence even justified again? What’s more crazy is that people have built their entire personality around “being a millennial,” a word of truly ridiculous origins. Language changes, sure, but if a conspiracy theorist coins a term, you don’t go around blindly using that term while refusing to acknowledge its bizarre and unjust history.

Yap word 2: adulting

Speaking of “millennials,” let’s talk about the word “adulting.” Popularized by “millennial” author Kelly Williams Brown, this word is often used in “millennial” circles by people who want to validate each other for being “fellow adults.” Is adult a verb? No. Can a non-verb be an adverb? Nope.

Yap word 3: needless to say

Needless to say, this phrase is redundant.

Yap word 4: hate speech

Is “hate speech” a legal term in the United States? Nope. Hateful speech is still free speech, as long as it isn’t a direct call to action. So no, the “yelling fire” in a movie theater analogy falls flat here.

Yap word 5: unacceptable

Define unacceptable. Is this work unacceptable? Morally? If so, what morals? Academic standards? Sounds like an appeal to authority fallacy to me.

1hp4ada,2,2024-12-29,I'm in despair and i need an advice,u/Working-Training-178,ElectricalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/1hp4ada/im_in_despair_and_i_need_an_advice/,"First of all, I’m sorry for this post. I’m just complaining and asking for advice.

I’m from Eastern Europe, and next year I’ll graduate with a BS in Electrical Engineering.

The problem is that I don’t know anything practical or useful for work. My whole education was online for particular reasons. I’ve never worked on any projects, and I’ve never assembled devices or circuits. I don’t really have any skills. I can solder and repair simple household appliances, but that’s it. Right now, I’m just starting to learn how to build simple circuits like signal amplifier, regulated power supply etc.

I see many people on this subreddit say that you can’t work in this field without a good university education. When I compare what I’ve learned to what students in Western Europe study (a lot of math, physics, and electronics), I can see why.

I want to ask for advice: **what should I learn?** I feel lost and don’t know where to start. Should I study more math (calculus, linear algebra—I only know basic matrix operations, Boolean algebra, etc.)? How can I learn microcontrollers, and should I even focus on them now? **What should I start with?**

I know this post might seem stupid, but I really don’t know much in this field. I want to work in it, but I don’t know what to do now.

(For context, I study Automation and Electric Drives. In 4 years, I only know a little about three-phase motors. I don’t know how to automate them because that requires knowing microcontrollers and other things, but I wasn’t taught them properly. For our coursework, we were even advised to write microcontroller code using ChatGPT, which doesn’t seem like the right way to learn.)",User_deleted,2
