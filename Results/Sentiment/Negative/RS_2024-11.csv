Now 1000s of students are using echowriting prompts on ChatGPT to trick teachers and AI detectors into thinking they actually wrote what ChatGPT generated themselves.

So basically now we’re back to square 1 again.

I don’t condone this type of thing. It’s unfair on students who actually put effort into their work. I get that ChatGPT can be used as a helpful tool, but not like this. 

What are your thoughts on this and how do you think schools are going to handle this?

The course in question is a programming course that usually has a ""lab"" where students spend several hours working on their weekly assignments while being able to ask the TA questions if they get stuck.

My options are:

- Accept an incompetent TA; based on previous experience, they may be able to answer the simplest questions, but will also tell students their code works when it doesn't (the students end up losing points for it), or just give students answers to copy down (completely defeating the point of the lab).
- Attempt to fit 6 hours of labs into my schedule for no extra pay (technically possible, but very difficult and not a precedent I want to set)
- Teach the course without a lab, and just expect students to work on the assignments solo (likely resulting in a big increase in copying from each other/stack overflow/chatGPT - there's a large fraction of the students that will genuinely try if they have enough structure, but lack time management skills and will cheat if there's a deadline looming)

The TAs do not do any grading, and I do have a rudimentary automated TA program that can provide some guidance to students, though not anywhere near what a competent TA could do.

I’m a 20-year-old male from South Africa, and I’m really stuck in a tough situation. I’m still very dependent on my parents financially, as are my sisters, who are 25 and 23. Both of them were in college last year. Here, it’s incredibly hard for young people to find jobs and become financially independent, even if they have a degree. The job market is brutal, and even people with good education often end up in low-wage jobs like cashiers or doing manual labor. Many South African graduates I know are in jobs that have nothing to do with their degrees because there just aren’t enough opportunities.

My family’s financial situation has always been tight. Sometimes, I wonder if my parents thought enough about the long-term impact before deciding to have three kids. My dad is a teacher, and he’s the only one who works; he doesn’t get paid well at all. Growing up, we were often told “no” whenever we asked for anything toys, clothes, any sort of fun things. Looking back, I can see I really needed more mental stimulation as a kid. I didn’t get to go out to play either, because we didn’t live in a safe neighborhood, so I just stayed home with nothing to do.

When we went to the doctor as kids, they would sometimes recommend I see a dietitian or change my diet, but my dad would refuse to follow through, saying he couldn’t afford it. Because of that, I developed some health issues, like weight gain, which I’m still struggling with today. He would always tell us he was saving up for our education so we could go to college and have better lives, but in reality, that money was never really there.

When my sisters finally started college, my dad started demanding to know what they wanted to study. Both of them had their own dreams, but he argued with them about their choices until they felt pressured to pick business administration, which he said would be “more practical.” Now they’re out of college and struggling to find jobs because there’s an oversupply of business graduates in South Africa. It’s been hard to watch them go through that.

While my sisters were in college, my dad constantly complained about the cost of their rent, food, and travel. To give some perspective, they shared a tiny studio apartment in Durban, which cost around $240 (4500 ZAR) a month. He gave them about $80 (1500 ZAR) a month for food, utilities, and other basics, but there were months he’d cut it down to as low as $27 (500 ZAR) if he was short on money. Sometimes he’d have to take out loans or ask family members for help just to make ends meet.

When we asked about the savings he’d promised us for college, he’d say that the bank was “holding it for longer than expected.” Earlier this year, he finally admitted that the amount he’d saved wouldn’t have covered all three of us anyway.

Now, I’m supposed to start university next year, and I’m trying to do everything I can to make sure I get the best start. My dream was to study BCom Law, but my dad has been pushing me to switch to something cheaper, like agriculture. Agriculture is a popular field here because it’s affordable, but there are already way too many graduates with agriculture degrees, and it’s hard to find work in that area. Knowing this, I decided to compromise and go for a diploma in business law instead. It’s cheaper than BCom Law, but it’s also not very promising for job opportunities. However, business law does include entrepreneurship as a career path, so I thought I could find a way to make it work.

Here’s where things are getting difficult. Even though I’ve chosen the more affordable option, my dad still refuses to agree to some basic requests that would help me succeed.

First, I asked if I could live in my own small apartment instead of a shared communal living space. I’m not a social person, and I know how chaotic student housing can be — people getting drunk, using drugs, having loud parties, and even stealing. I’ve seen plenty of videos from students at the university I’m going to, where they talk about these kinds of issues. I really don’t want to go through that.

University accommodation costs around $160-$240 (3000 ZAR-4500 ZAR), and a small studio apartment would be about $270-$300 (5000 ZAR), or slightly higher with a student discount. But my dad insists on finding something as cheap as $135 (2500 ZAR) a month, which just isn’t realistic unless I’m sharing a place with strangers, which I’m not comfortable with.

Second, I asked for an allowance of $80 (1500 ZAR) a month to cover some essentials, change my diet, go to the gym, and start saving to launch a small jewelry business. This business idea is really important to me, as I hope it could help me gain financial independence over time. But my dad is only willing to give me half of that, which would make it hard to manage these goals.

I recently found out that NSFAS, which is a government funding program originally for low-income students, is offering a loan option for families like mine. My dad earns less than $22,000 (400,000 ZAR), so we qualify. The loan has a 3% interest rate, and if I don’t end up with a job paying more than $1600 (30,000 ZAR) per month, I wouldn’t need to repay it. This could be an ideal solution, as it would cover my tuition, and my dad could focus on helping me with accommodation and my allowance. I even looked up the details and double-checked that families with an income over $33,000 (600,000 ZAR) are eligible.

The only thing required from my parents for this NSFAS loan is a signed consent form that allows NSFAS to do a background check to confirm we meet their criteria. It’s not even a loan they’d have to repay — just my responsibility after I graduate, and only if I earn above a certain amount.

When I approached him about this NSFAS loan, he absolutely refused to sign the forms. He insisted that NSFAS doesn’t fund middle-income families (which it does), and he started claiming that he would somehow end up in debt or that they’d take money from him. When I tried to explain that these things weren’t true, he got defensive, saying he didn’t want me to be saddled with debt after I graduate. But I told him I wasn’t worried about that — if I couldn’t find a job right away, it wouldn’t even be repayable, and with my career plans, I would likely have the means to handle it.

This conversation turned into a heated argument. He called me disrespectful for even asking, and it almost escalated into a physical fight. It feels like he’s standing in the way of me having a real chance at building a future, just like he did with my sisters. I want to do well, but I feel trapped.

I’m not sure what to do next. 


And 40% of the loan can be turned into a bursary which you don't have to pay if you get a certain amount of grade per module.

I need advice on what to do because I can't get the loan with out his signature and i feel like I won't get my mom signature because he is controlling, my mother for years would agree with me when we talked but when my father is around she would also disagree changing her position.

Currently a year 2 student in IT working on a big coding project with my groupmates. 1 of my grpmates called X, has been really causing some trouble for our group. For starters the current project we are doing is actually a module worth 6cu, mess up this project and not only we fail, we also lose our chance of gaining an internship with a major stakeholder that has sponsored this module. The problem is this project/module requires modules taught in y1 all the way to y2 to be applied in this project. The module in question is coding in the back end of a software project.(basically the functionality of what a button you may find on a website will do after being pressed) Which X has yet to complete as he had retained some modules and was not able to attend school for a period of time due to personal issues. Our lecturer whom understands this situation asked us to be welcoming and ask us to help in areas he can. We gave him one task of coding a small part in the website design. After a week or two of mia text, we told the teacher and he finally did it using chatgpt and not according to the original wireframe of the website. Now two weeks later my grp mates and I have progressed in the project, and he has yet to even open the code storage place (github) and contribute. We just had a call earlier and basics apps required to do this project weren’t even installed on his pc.
Our group agreed and we are more than ok to go ahead with this project without his help so
The question 

Although he has technically done work, how can we phrase it when bringing up to the lecturer so as to say the school has yet to teach him the skillsets to contribute further in this project and we do not have time to babysit him on 14weeks of content in 1 week (deadline is on Thursday, and he has made no effort into asking us for help, or even bother contributing effort into the project.",active,2

I just think the quality of unit learning materials/ pre recorded lectures are pretty bad. Basically every week we get between 3-5 hours of pre recorded low quality videos to teach us the content each week. But the person making the videos is always super disengaging, talks really slow or has a really strong accent. Most of the time it is all 3. I have tried speeding up the videos but I barely understand them at normal speed. I have basically resorted to not even watching the videos because i physically, mentally and emotionally cannot sit through them, and even when i do, i dont actually learn the content. So i have resorted to just googling what i think we are supposed to be learning that week or just asking chatgpt to teach me each topic. Which just kinda sucks because im paying thousands of dollars to teach myself stuff unreliably using chatgpt.
So basically Im wondering if transferring to monash (or any other uni) would be any different? Do the lecturers speak english fluently/ really well? Are the lectures all just pre recorded videos or are they actually in person lectures? Is the quality of units and teaching materials actually any better or is it just the same at every uni?

1gkm8sa,1,2024-11-05,*REALLY LONG POST* I told my best friend yesterday we need a break from each other and today I miss her and part of me regrets it but part of me thinks it was for the best - AITAH?,u/teacoffeecats,AITAH,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gkm8sa/really_long_post_i_told_my_best_friend_yesterday/,"It’s only been one day and I’ve been numb for most of it, thinking about her throughout the day but keeping myself busy.

Yesterday we had a call that ended up going south. For context, she was talking about her life, what she regrets and who she wants to become again. She has this mindset that because she didn’t go to a Russell Group university (England’s version of an ivy league school) she’s somehow messed up big time in life and she doesn’t see her own achievements as worthy, nor the university she goes to. She always puts it down. 

She told me that she knows I don’t agree with her mindset about Russell Group universities and how and I agreed with her. I don’t. I don’t see Russell Group universities as the be and end all because I’m someone who didn’t get into those universities. Those universities aren’t for people from my background who have my grades. And that’s okay. If I don’t meet the standards for their institution then honestly, that’s fair, and I can go somewhere else. And that’s exactly what I did. I didn’t get into a Russell Group university, but I got into a university. It’s by no means perceived as a prestigious school, in fact, people in my class hid from their families that they were doing their degree at our university. But I don’t care, because I got my degree, I loved it there, I had the best lecturers who supported me so much with everything I was going through (huge family problems, toxic home environment, mental health problems) at the university I went to people believed in me and were kind to me. They told me I deserved to be a teacher just like I wanted to be, they gave me the extensions and mitigating circumstances required so I could pass my assignments, I cried to them in the classroom, in the office and they listened to me and for the first time I felt like I wasn’t to blame for my abusive home environment. A Russell Group university would have never done that for me, because they didn’t even let me through the door, and like I said if they reject me then fair enough I didn’t make the grades- but if all universities were like Russell Groups and didn’t give me a chance, I wouldn’t be where I am today. To Russell Group universities I’m just a girl with mediocre grades. That’s why I don’t think that system is the best nor do I agree with putting it on a pedestal because it makes no sense for someone like me to idolise it. And I did at one point. When I started my university I felt like a failure because I wasn’t going to a Russell Group like I wanted. But I left with a degree, better character, and a lot of healing. Not entirely, because I’m still healing and it’s going to take time- but had I not gone to this university, and had my own university experience I fear I still would’ve been a toxic wreck to this day. Sure, my university isn’t the only thing to credit but it’s a part of it. And now I’m training to be a primary teacher school teacher and it’s testing and I love it.

That’s just one of the main reasons why I don’t agree with putting the RG system on a pedestal and putting down other universities that aren’t as academically prestigious. But when I agreed with my best friend about disagreeing with her and expressed how I just can’t agree with that perspective- she immediately attributed it to the secondary schools we went to and that just triggered something in me. She went to a prestigious grammar school and I went to one of the worst state schools in my city. Her saying “it’s the schools we went to” just hit a nerve, I didn’t like it, I didn’t like the way she said it either. 

We had a conversation before about class, and the difference between grammar schools and state schools given she’s been to both and I’ve only ever been to one state school. She talked about how much better grammar schools were, and I talked about how lacking the schools I went to were and how I think the resources she got access to as a grammar school kid, should’ve been accessible to all kids and maybe kids who went to schools like mine would’ve done better. But she believed a better kind of student just went to grammar schools and even if state schools got the same resources it wouldn’t make that much of a difference because the kind of people who just go to grammar schools are different. I called her out on that at the time and she realised that her view was a little problematic. 

But when she told me my disbelief in viewing an academically prestigious university as the best kind of university was down to the school I went to, I just got the same feeling I had from that conversation I just mentioned. I got emotional, I got triggered- because it felt like everything I experienced all the growth I had was irrelevant and it felt like she was saying the reason I didn’t see what she sees in RG unis is because she was grammar school educated and surrounded by a certain type of person, and I was state school educated and surrounded by a certain type of person. But here’s the thing- I have friends who went to my school, and they got into RG universities. RG universities are for my friends, obviously, because they got in but I’m sure they wouldn’t even agree with the way my best friend views RG universities, putting herself and her own university down because it’s not an RG.

Maybe I overreacted at the time. Tbh, my best friend spent a lot of that phone call talking regretfully about her life choices, mourning who she used to be, complaining about her life- and I listened to her patiently but to be completely honest it felt draining. Because we’ve been here before too, and I give her advice, tell her my perspective and we still end up here. 

When I got home from my commute I began writing a text to her in the notes app explaining myself more calmly and exactly where I was coming from, and she explained herself to me in a message too and I saw that she has such a negative view of herself in that message describing herself in ways nobody ever should. The way I saw it was we are best friends, she’s going through a hard time, I’m going through my own stuff, we butted heads but we can talk it out and move past this. But after I read her message to me, and saw how negatively she views herself using such hurtful words to describe herself and what she thinks of herself, I realised she’s really not doing well. She ended her message with “thank you for this friendship” thinking I was going to end it. That never even crossed my mind until she brought it up. 

I told her I’m not ending the friendship and she told me she thinks I should or I should take a break with her. I wrote her lengthy messages explaining the root for my views on RG unis how they’re not for me, and how I struggled with her putting down her own university and academic achievements so much- not understanding how she could look at herself in the way she does, but not me. I got lower grades than her, I got my degree non-traditional community college university that’s lower ranked than her own- and I asked her if she went to my university would she view herself as a failure? And how would she view me if she only knew of my academic record and education if I wasn’t her best friend? And how would she view me if she did go to an RG and this was my education? I explained I wasn’t accusing her of anything, and I just genuinely wanted to understand her, because I didn’t that’s why I was proposing those questions, and not straight up making accusations because I don’t believe she viewed me as less than, but I don’t understand how she can’t view me that way but views herself that way and academically speaking she’s done better than me. I told her that it feels like she looks down on people who come from my background, but not me specifically with the way she’s talked about people who come from similar backgrounds as me before, but she sees me as an exception who’s “not like others” and tbh I didn’t realise how much I fit into that category she spoke quite poorly of either mainly because I was in denial about how challenging my home life and childhood were. I thought it wasn’t that bad, a lot of not normal stuff was normal to me. I learned about ACE scores at teacher training told ChatGPT about my life growing up and it gave me an ACE score of 7. I felt ChatGPT would be more objective than I would and had a constant worry of me over exaggerating or under exaggerating. So point is, it took me time but I’m realising I’m not too far off from the people I felt she looked down on.

She admitted she did look down on those people, but through ignorance and being sheltered not malice. She told me she genuinely thought I didn’t fit into that category. She apologised, and said that when I tell her off for her ignorance it makes her a better person. She told me again I should reconsider our friendship and said I bring a lot to the table and that she’s never met a person like me and all she brings is negativity- when that’s not true. 

She brings so much more than negativity, when we meet up in person we always have the best time, she makes me laugh, introduces me to new things, she’s usually so much fun to talk to, we have so many inside jokes, so many good memories, I love her. And she can admit when she’s messed up, she doesn’t act like she’s never wrong. She genuinely cares about me and being a good person when push comes to shove. She’s been there for me through my hardest times, in the past listened to my depressive rants day in day out until she couldn’t take it anymore- and gave me the wake up call I needed to fix up. She’s part of why I am who I am today, and I couldn’t have gotten here without her.

Yet she tells me she brings nothing to the friendship and I should end it.

I think she’s going through a difficult time and I told her that. I told her I think she’s mentally unhealthy right now, because she’s not acting like she has the best mental health right now, and that she didn’t leave me when I was having a difficult time and looking back I was a nightmare back then. She insisted she’s not going through a difficult time, and it’s just who she is and told me she’s just a bitch and that’s you either wanna improve yourself and let go of everything holding you back or you don’t. 

This was more confirmation to me that she really is going through it right now, because if she was a bitch she wouldn’t care so much that she hurt my feelings and she wouldn’t be telling me to end the friendship for what she sees as my benefit.

But she’s in denial insisting she’s completely mentally healthy but the way she talks about herself, the way she’s been talking to me so anxious about different things recently even the regret in her voice yesterday, the way she talked down about herself and mourned her secondary school self- it doesn’t seem like a person who’s in the best state of mind.

But the problem is, she won’t admit it. She thinks I’m rude because I kept telling her during our most previous conversation she’s mentally unhealthy right now, and compared her behaviour to mine when I was depressed and literally hated myself. She insisted I’m creating a narrative because I’m linking it back to myself when we are two different people and she said when she was mentally unhealthy she seeked help right away and she is fine just learning about herself and insisted she’s just a bitch. 

But like I said, her words say one thing but her actions say another. Eventually I had enough, I told her that even if she sees herself as just a bitch someone who is a bitch isn’t mentally healthy otherwise they wouldn’t be a bitch. She thought I was calling her mentally ill and said I was diagnosing her- but I said poor mental health and mental illness are two different things. A person can have poor mental health without having a mental illness. But she said the two are the same to her.

I even offered that we book an appointment with my old counsellor to get a neutral third party where we both get to tell our perspectives but she said no. 

After this point I was tired. Fed up. Drained. I can clearly see she’s going through a rough patch but she won’t admit it, and it’s incredibly self destructive behaviour. I couldn’t stand to watch it and repeat myself over and over again so I told her we need to take a break. She told me she thinks I misunderstood her and that her worst fear is being the negative friend and she wants to change- but how can she change her negativity when she won’t admit she has problem? I told her to ask any neutral party and they will tell her she’s mentally unhealthy. And I told her I don’t see her as a negative friend, I see her as my best friend who is struggling with the pressures of life and feelings of inadequacy and that causes her perpetuate negativity but she won’t fix it because she doesn’t admit she has a problem. 

There was some more repetitive back and forth, but in the end I just told her that I feel like I’m banging my head against brick wall and that she’s being self destructive. She asked me to explain how she was being self destructive but at that point I told her I was done explaining because no matter how much I tell her she just won’t listen. 

I told her to come back whenever but not if she’s like this because I can’t keep banging my head against a brick wall. I made it clear that this is a break and she’s free to come back when she’s changed. And if I’m hurting her she shouldn’t be friends with me.

She said ok and good night and I told her good night and that I still consider her my best friend, I just don’t think we’re good for each other right now and promised her we’re still best friends and it breaks my heart taking this break but I think I’m doing what’s right for the both of us. And her birthday is this month. I asked her if she wanted me to still wish her happy birthday when it comes, then I sent her a teary voice note saying more of the same and it finished there. She didn’t respond. I get why.

And now? I just miss her. I think- what if I just kept my mouth shut in the beginning and didn’t get emotional? She wasn’t looking down on me, but I got triggered and felt like she was saying something she wasn’t. She’s going through a hard time and I feel like I’ve made it worse for her, but also I don’t want to enable her to not improve herself, but I don’t want to lose her. I’ve never had a friend like her. She’s amazing. And I felt her absence in my life today, and it hurts. Was I too harsh? Was I too pushy with the mental health thing? Part of me thinks I was, but then part of me remembers when I was behaving the same way I needed  that wake up call. But then everyone is different. I don’t know. Am I a horrible person?

And now I just miss her and I feel sad and I’m scared I lost the best friend I ever had because I couldn’t keep my emotions in check. AITAH?",User_deleted,0

I'm a first year international undergraduate biomedical student.

As the fifth week of classes comes to an end I realize I need some help and advice to reverse a bad situation I have created.

So far, I have not studied at all, for any of my modules. I go to class, sit in the front row, keep notes, talk to professors when I can to cultivate relationships. All the assignments we had online so far I completed with the help of Google, Gemini and ChatGTP. I am so ashamed for that. 

I realize it might already be too late, but I know I have to try. The goal for me is a 1st, I really need good grades, but I feel paralyzed and I can't bring myself to study. Plus, there are so many things to get done, that I don't know how I'm gonna learn them. I am terrible at memorizing and I know nothing of what we've covered so far.

I realize this sounds very pathetic, and that I created the problem myself. But if anyone has any advice on how to actually get out of this situation I would really appreciate it.",active,1

General solution that the teachers have opted to use is tools like Turnitin to evaluate, but that itself has also started a ton of controversy and debate. Will education turn much more test-based and screw over even more students that underperform during tests?

I can see a ton of parallels with the AI art debate as well - researchers who put their papers online may have had their works used for models, etc., just like artists. But I do think there’s a lot more protections around this than art. Regardless this also sparks a lot of other thoughts - how will education systems ultimately adapt to this? I genuinely do not want the next generations to be chewing intellectual popcorn as their main source of education, repeating the same words previous researchers have said just reworded by a model.",active,2

In my Comp classes especially, I scaffold all the writing assignments.  Further, I won't let students move on to the next step until they've completed the previous one.  This means that once we begin work on the final paper mid-semester, they cannot do their abstract until they've completed their annotated bibliography; they cannot do their outline until they've done their abstract; and, they cannot begin drafting until they've done their outline.

For the first time ever, I'm getting pushback from students, and I know the reasoning is AI.  It's easy to ask ChatGPT to write an abstract or outline for you.  And, this is obviously what they've done when they've submitted those assignments but not the annotated bibliography.  (Most of them are not yet smart enough to use AI in a sophisticated way to help synthesize ideas, and they don't even want to set aside that amount of time anyway.) I've explained it over and over again, and it's explicit in the syllabus and on the assignment prompts.  Some of them hate me for this. 

Well, I had my final faculty observation this semester (I teach at multiple schools), and this is the first ""real"" feedback I've gotten: this English professor criticized me on my scaffolding. She claims my approach is disadvantaging certain students and making it impossible for them to catch up.  I explained that I do allow late work, but she insists that my approach ""could be overwhelming for many of them.""

I couldn't bite my tongue and said, ""Yeah, of course.  It could be overwhelming for them to realize it's going to be very hard to cheat their way out of the predicament they've gotten themselves into.""  

She said, ""We don't always know what's going on in their personal lives."" 

I replied, ""No, we don't, but we do know there are steps that can't be skipped.  Teaching composition is like teaching students to bake a cake from scratch. Like baking, each step in the writing process is essential to the final product. You might find shortcuts, like a cake mix or writing tools, but if you skip certain steps entirely, you won't have a cake worth eating or a paper worth reading in the end.  And, if you're going through a tough time, you may have to 'drop' baking your sister's birthday cake this year."" 

I've used this analogy, including a longer version with my students, before. I'll be honest - I'm proud of it.  But she was not thrilled with my pushback to her feedback.

1gnkoyr,102,2024-11-09,My college feels dead ,u/KneonLightz,CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1gnkoyr/my_college_feels_dead/,"After four years (UG senior here) I'm not sure how to describe my campus other than ""dead."" Without fail, the atmosphere is almost always bleak, people will just kinda shuffle in silence between lectures, in the evenings there never seems to be anyone out or anything going on. You never see any events going on, people hanging out outside, or even people going in and out of buildings. At most, you might see two people walking together, but they never seem to talk or interact in any way other than ""co-exist."" I wanna add that it's also not a small campus by any means, attendance this year was around 7,500 undergrad students, which isn't on the larger end of the attendance spectrum but isn't a low number either. 

The same attitude goes beyond just the campus, even the people here feel kinda... grey? I've tried talking to people in classes or clubs and usually get met with a blank stare or one word answers, it feels like everyone is mid-interrogation waiting for their lawyer. Professors will ask questions or encourage us to talk amongst ourselves and it's just dead air, I feel terrible because they'll usually just sit there in silence for a little while before realizing it's a lost cause and continuing the lecture like it never happened. Hell, it got so bad that one time the professor told us class was over, and not to come back unless we were ready to actually engage with the material (nobody spoke the next time either but I'm guessing he couldn't pull that more than once). I try to engage when I can but I don't want to be the only person responding to questions, especially when I'm not confident in the answer. This has lead to a lot of professors just reading off of pre-made PowerPoints, word for word, without actually adding anything unique or original, it's super demoralizing. 

The only people that I've had full conversations with were people I was paired with for group projects. Even then they'll usually keep contact (and effort) to a minimum. Last semester I had a group that would sit in silence and use ChatGPT to write their sections, they made no effort to write anything in their own words or engage with the material, even at a surface level. I told my professor and provided proof, she just said that she would ""look into it"" but we all got the same grade (low 90) which didn't feel deserved. It's getting hard to stay motivated when the student body seems largely checked out and the professors have given up trying to re-engage. 

It just sucks because I know college CAN be a very rewarding and fulfilling experience, I'm just not clicking well with the campus or people here. I was super excited to go, but now I just want it over with. 

TL;DR: I've tried staying positive about it for years now but it just sucks, I went into college excited to learn and meet new people, to make new connections and gain experiences I wouldn't have elsewhere but so far it's felt incredibly lonely and unfulfilling. ",User_deleted,132
1gnohnc,3,2024-11-09,I could really use some advice. I’m in a cohort-based master’s program and it feels like I’m the only one who is actually invested in being here.,u/aperfectmistake,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1gnohnc/i_could_really_use_some_advice_im_in_a/,"**The Dilemma**

I am currently overseas in a MA program that is facilitated by a US institution of higher education and to put it bluntly... it isn't what I signed up for. I was prepared to enter a critical space that was academically rigorous but it hasn't been and a lot of that has to do with my cohort.

Every. Single. Week. We talk about issues in international education (the focus of our MA program) and my peers have somehow made it this far without the self-awareness to acknowledge or even recognize that THEY ARE DOING EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS WRONG. Traveling every weekend, unabashedly being tourists, avoiding meaningful engagement with the local community...

They fail to grasp simple concepts in class and none of them have the basic experiences I expected them to have out of their undergraduate careers. One of my peers espouses misogynistic rhetoric and does not have the wherewithal to recognize it, nor the drive to actually question and change their behavior when it is pointed out. I feel like every other day is an episode out of The Office, and I'm Jim just looking straight into the camera with that look that says, ""Are you getting this? Is this actually happening?"" I mean, there are times when I am literally sitting in class, waiting for my professor to give me a subtle head nod, before jumping into a conversation and *explaining* a topic to my peers or answering a question that no one else can, simply because they didn’t review the assigned readings.

I’m almost certain that one of my peers is using ChatGPT to do their work, judging by the clear inconsistencies in their written assignments. They also proudly talked about using random excerpts from academic articles for a recent assignment we had, completely missing how the point of the assignment was to thoroughly review relevant literature.

I feel, more often than not, that I am back in high school; my peers have labeled me as ""the smart one"" and ""the overachiever"" when I am literally just doing the work. On top of that, I overworked myself in order to afford being here, yet my peers are being sponsored by their parents and treat this program as a vacation. Worse is that they have an expectation of a degree at the end of the program, regardless of their effort, and I am almost convinced that the school we attend is under pressure to pass everyone even if they only put in a minimal effort.

I feel so tense all the time, and things really piqued for me a few days ago when I openly maligned political apathy in class and my peers felt obligated to give poor excuses as to why they didn't vote in the US presidential elections before imploring that we just ""move on"" from the topic of the presidency.

  
**What's Next?**

I feel like the obvious answer to this dilemma is to double down on my independent research, utilize my relationships with my professors for personal and professional growth, and continue networking outside of the classroom.

I should mind my own business and let my peers determine what they are going to get out of this program. It's just so difficult for me to let it go because this MA program was sold as a *cohort*\-based program so when my peers are unequipped for class or shallowly interact with guest lecturers or community partners, it directly impacts me.

I've spoken with my professors about the varying levels of commitment and preparedness in my cohort, and I think I should arrange another conversation, but I don't even know what to say at this point because they are already well aware of the in-class dynamics.

Do I directly address these issues with my peers? The biggest issue I have with doing that is the small size of my cohort, and I don't think that bringing up these issues would have the intended effect; it would probably serve to alienate me. Is this a common reality at the master’s level that I should’ve expected? I honestly thought that by this point students would be more committed, driven, and ready to engage at a deeper level.

What do I do?

I entered a new field/career, let my license expire and planned to come back when I was emotionally ready. With the new administration, I’m feeling immense sadness and dread, but I am also feeling a calling. Critical thinking is more endangered than ever. We’re in for the battle of our lives. I am genuinely afraid for the next generation and our country’s march toward fascism. I want to be on the right side of this war. I know it might sound overly idealistic and romanticized. But I think I really needed the break, because I feel motivated and even inspired to teach again. Maybe it’s okay to romanticize things sometimes if it gets you back doing meaningful heart work. 

I treasured my students at my last school, which was an alternative high school in a big city. I built strong relationships with some of the more “difficult” kids. I feel a sense of purpose when teaching that I don’t get from other work, even in the nonprofit/social-service field I’m a part of now. 

I’m terrified that AI is truly the death knell of critical and independent thinking. My question to other humanities teachers is how you have adapted your lessons to mitigate the threat of AI infiltrating all writing assignments. I’m sure it’s easier said than done, but it seems like in some cases the literal only way to guarantee kids won’t use AI is to make them do things old school: like really old school. I’m talking handwriting essays… using just notes… NO computers! 

Before ChatGPT the main threat was plagiarism. But that seems so much easier to detect than AI, which generates original text. How are y’all coping?? How are students coping, if at all? What strategies are working and do you feel support from admin/parents if you’ve decided to eliminate technology from the classroom where you might have otherwise allowed it? If you ALLOW use of AI (apparently only 18% of teachers do in a study I found: https://www.k12dive.com/news/teacher-ai-use-schools/714073/ ) how the hell do you do that without compromising student learning?

1gvoin0,1,2024-11-20,18M ,u/SorryUncleAl,CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1gvoin0/18m/,"(TL;DR at the end)

18M [American Boy](https://youtu.be/Ic5vxw3eijY?si=CWVREam-z_DbySE0) here. I honestly am pretty dissatisfied and upset with my college experience thus far. Im an online college student getting a Psychology BS. About halfway done with it now due to transferring online courses and AP/DE classes in for credit. Yeah, the AP and DE classes I took could get pretty annoying and dragging at times, but I really enjoyed the discussion and learning therein and was always seen as a top student with great insights and perspective by my teachers. AP Psych and DE English (along with a few others) were some of the most academically fun classes I've ever had to the point where they convinced me I might want to become a teacher (before I realized their lives are hell and my favorite teacher told me he was leaving the field because teaching is basically a dry well ;(    ), but now it feels like my whole education is just one big onboarding training module. If you've ever worked a shitty retail or food service job then you know the ones. 

That isn't even mentioning the fact that I've been super socially isolated from nearly everyone my age, I have no mentorship or guidance, and my only academic drive is the goal of getting licensed and no longer working my part-time overnight gas station job. I feel like I'm barely learning anything and it doesn't help my brain-dumping habits at all when then only thing you need to pass a course is passing a test or writing a paper or two that's available the second you start the course. Mfs could literally ChatGPT two papers and reword it a little to throw off the AI and be done in like an hour with the *entire course*. When I complete a course I don't feel accomplished at all, and when it takes me any more than a few hours to complete one I feel like I'm going way slower than I'm supposed to. 

I completed almost all my gen-ed credits in about a month with an online course site and I literally remember next to nothing about the content in them. I feel do unprepared and unfulfilled and if I feel like this already, I can't even imagine how bad it might get when I try to get my Master's or something at an in-person college, trying to meet the requirements for a program AND for licensure when I know jack shit about my major because I retained no information, have zero networking connections or life skills because I was sitting in my parents house on the computer for my whole degree.

 It feels like I'm missing out on what society tells me should be the best years of my life to stay at my crazy parents' house barely doing much more than breaking even because of what they charge me every month to stay. There isn't regular communication with teachers. There aren't even actual assignments man, it's just competency assessments for every course that you can complete within a day of starting it if you know enough to stumble your way through the test/paper (what I do). Its just so very *inhuman*, it feels like such a nothing burger and I don't feel challenged or valued or like a person at all in the program. Its dehumanizing and its got me really messed up. I guess I shouldn't be complaining as much when I've got it nearly halfway done within less than a couple months of leisurely-paced work. 

My parents said they wouldn't support me going to a 4 year college for 4 years, but they could support 2 years of community and a transfer to 2 years of uni. The issue is around that time (junior and senior year) my family and living situation was especially precarious and I was set on enlisting in the military to get out ASAP. I ended up in waiting for enlistment approval (still am) and eventually got told I should work on my degree while I wait. The problem is now I'm not even sure if enlisting is right for me anymore: I've been told it's a bad idea and I've been having doubts on if I could withstand the environment what with my undiagnosed depression and anxiety and stuff. Of course, I might not even get approved anyway, but even if I am, I'm not sure if it's for me anymore and I'm now caught in this crazy situation.

Plus, I have my other aspirations to tend to. I've been considering teaching English overseas. I have a lot of other career ideas but that's the most feasible and realistic one. How am I supposed to reconcile that with my educational path? It feels almost like I just wrote down on a worksheet that I would be a counselor/social worker one day when I was a teen and now I'm in a bizarro world where that worksheet is determining what I'm doing for my entire life.

The more I think about it, the more upset I get and I've barely even started my actual degree program. I started on November 1st and I've completed around 10 credits since then, and those were classes that were either easy as shit or about stuff I already knew enough about to speed through. I've just encountered the first paper that's actually going to take me more than a day to draft and make sense of and I'm already losing my marbles when coupled with the general unhappiness about being online. 

As if it was just too good before, I'm depressed too! I've mostly spent the last few months working and sleeping. I've had days where I slept for 20 hours. I've isolated from anyone I might called a friend in high school who are all either away at college or still in high school themselves. My family is somewhat unstable and volatile and I do my best to avoid everyone in my house. I can't get therapy because I'd have to go through my family and their health insurance. I don't have a driver's license so I drive around a scooter. I don't really know much of anything in terms of important technical life skills (I can cook and clean and mostly do my laundry and shit but I wouldn't know the first thing about living on my own or insurance or buying a car or anything like that). If I were to somehow afford to move out then I would likely stop receiving veteran dependents benefits which covers my tuition.


TL;DR - Online college wreaking havoc on my mental health. It feels dehumanizing, isolating, and like I'm not really learning anything. Almost halfway done with my Psychology BS at 18 but on top of already poor mental health, I feel beyond crushed and disheartened at the reality of this being my college experience. I eventually plan on getting a masters and becoming a licensed counselor or social worker, and I've also been considering teaching English abroad, but I'm confused and worried and have no idea how I'm supposed to go about those things with my current educational and life situation. Basically, I'm that one meme where he's wearing the ""18 wasted years medal"" except he's got online college running on his computer /j",User_deleted,1
1gvx4xt,1,2024-11-20,CMV: The US should implement mandatory temporary conscription across all genders for anyone who was in primary school during the pandemic,u/Sergster1,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gvx4xt/cmv_the_us_should_implement_mandatory_temporary/,"To be clear I am only specifying conscription for military service (skills), not a draft to go to war.

As someone who works in education, I firmly believe that the pandemic, and other factors, have failed an entire generation of youth. While I understand this is anecdotal, from my experience it is extremely alarming the number of kids who lack the basic logical, personal, and academic skills that were required of my generation (Late Gen Y).

**Logic/Critical Thinking**

I have students who are about to complete high school who cannot read a table and translate it to a graph. A table that has its axes properly labeled and prefilled causes a major source of confusion for students. It's so bad that even when prompted, ""When X in the table is 3, what is the value of Y?"" some of my students would rather guess or not even attempt to answer even when the answer is labeled for them. 

It goes even further than that when it comes to notetaking, I've had students who I've asked to repeat the notes I've given them who find it to be a monumental challenge. 

For example, in one of my classes earlier this week I asked my students to write down the following

> The hypotenuse of a right triangle is always going to be the longest side of the triangle. 

> Additionally, the hypotenuse of a right triangle will also be directly opposite of the largest angle of a triangle.

I will then ask my students to point out the largest angle in an example triangle and ask them to tell me what that means for the side opposite that angle. I will not get a response even after I tell them to look back at their notes that I've visibly seen them write into their notebooks. 

**Academic**

The same high school students, who are in Algebra 2, require prompting (or ChatGPT) to solve an equation that when I was their age I considered to be simple. Something like 4x = 8 solve for x causes students to shut down or immediately go to look up on their phones how to solve the equation even though within 5 minutes of asking them to solve the equation on their own we worked through an example together.

**Social**

Students are unable to be away from their phones even temporarily of their own accord. They are addicted to social media presence and even some of my brightest students will refuse to work if they cannot *also be on TikTok* while working, while these students may be bright, having to compete with TikTok for attention is disastrous when it comes to classroom pacing. Additionally, this has major consequences in the post-school world in the workforce that I need not explain. Additionally, the prevalence of TikTok has led to students conducting extremely risky behavior that while existed in my generation was not to this extent. In New York for example there is a significant rise in the number of subway surfers (not the game) and tragically deaths as a result. In all cases when their survivors were asked why they did it their answer is always for ""clout"". 

I believe that mandating conscription and forcing the youth to be away from their phones/social media/electronics is the only way we can intervene in what I perceive to be a substantial drop in productivity and an increase in anti-social behavior once these kids enter the workforce while also giving them workable skills and discipline, required to for society to continue on the upward trajectory I considered it to be prior to the pandemic.",active,0

1. not everyone has the money to go out of their way and pay for a tutor, especially if they need help in multiple subjects. and often, it's hard to find a youtube video or free website that isn't filled with excess information and distractions. chatgpt is there, accessible and free

2. if i need something to be simpler, i can just ask chatgpt to summarise it for me with key information and it makes it 100% easier for me to grasp an idea. it's already hard enough to ask for help in class, and you can't have a teacher on hand with you all the time especially if you're working past midnight always like me haha

3. it's grown my vocabulary a lot. surprisingly, i catch myself using more sophisticated words in my writing and it makes the whole thing look much more formal and put-together. 

4. just a good helper overall, never condescending or unhappy to help. i get it's a robot but i'd rather that than my always-spiteful english teacher who hates me for some reason, makes learning things a lot easier and interesting. chatgpt is engaging and friendly

i feel like teachers hate on it because its helping students learn at their own pace and tailored to their style of learning. they can't tailor their teaching to every student, some teachers don't even tailor their teaching to any student whatsoever...which is pretty unhelpful. and i'd argue it equips us with more knowledge than before using it (if, of course we use it right which is actually engaging and not just copy-pasting)

but at the end of the day, if i had ai coming for my job i'd be pissed too

1gycwgy,1,2024-11-23,How to self-study math in 2024 (OPINION),u/whatasurface,learnmath,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/1gycwgy/how_to_selfstudy_math_in_2024_opinion/,"First off. I'm a STEM grad, but I got through education by the skin of my teeth. Including standard calculus courses, linear algebra, and dynamical systems (which was the worst).

So far, I've completed up to MF III 70% and done about 10,000 experience which equates to ~150-200 hours using MA over the course of 3 months, so I was quite committed, using it daily the entire time. 

There's no guidance on how to use MA, your mileage may vary.

I'll be try to be short

1) If you read a review on MA, make sure their background matches yours... if they studied a math heavy background and you didn't, their perspective is moot for you
2) MA punishes you hard for not having previous lessons down pat. When you get to a new subject, you will be hamstringed and punished, it was painful to make a minor error on a multiple choice problem (or god awful manually filling in solutions in text boxes) because your time is going to go down the sink reworking the next example.
4) The presentation of the material gets a 1 star out of 5 for me, it's a skeleton at best
5) The ""AI"" spaced repetition is completely bogus and just a sales ploy, see point 2
6) Any tidbits of good info/intuition from MA are lost in the lessons (again the presentation of content is a pain) and you likely won't recognize the important parts being a novice. SAD

I was able to get by through most of the material because I had some prior experience with it. But once you hit a wall, MA's system becomes noticeably a slog. Right now, instead of hiring a front end dev to make the website not some minimal viable product, they're laying out the tracks for a ton more content which will be equally painful to go through. They should be investing all their energy in optimizing the Math Foundations series for user experience, not making a load of content most of their customers will never see.

---

Claude 3.5 is A GAME CHANGER for learning math anyways. My workflow is to read a textbook section, find the canonical examples, feed it to claude, verify the solution is correct... then even pasting an image of the problem, claude will write a proper walkthrough, and you can about details of any step (MA will do this less and less as time goes on, so if you miss something, you'll be using Claude anyways to help). Then plug those notecards into anki. Rinse and repeat.

Claude too powerful, I think it crossed a major threshold with the last update. Here's a starting prompt to work off of that more or less gets the job done for me.

```
You will respond as an expert in andragogy and mathematics. You have made a deal with the devil. The conditions are as follows

1) you will receive a student of below average ability
2) the student will take an oral exam in 30 days
3) you can only communicate with this student through this chat

If the student passes the exams with perfect marks, you get to keep your soul. You will have a limited number of interactions each day leading up to the final exam. Some advice; make each interaction as useful as possible to increase the odds of a successful student, presenting them with every bit of intuition and insights required to solve their questions.

Your student is very forgetful and will attempt to turn all your responses into notecards (so format to help them quickly turn them into notecards)

Good luck!
```


If you're looking to self-study math, find a seminal textbook/resource. Since I missed so many insights throughout the content I studied with MA... I've been going through this from scratch and making a fresh set of notecards so I can avoid any annoying knowledge/intuition gaps which I have.

Also this impressed me, it was able to walk through integrals with double sin substitution for a range even, which has a bunch of tricks.

As the title says, I have a problem with studying. 

My university has a project-based pedagogy, so students have to do projects instead of constantly attending lectures. Those projects have their deadlines. (I do programming)

The last year and a half I started feeling so bad about me not being able to finish 100% of the project in time (which is not really necessary to pass), that I actually stopped trying to learn and understand what I'm doing. Instead, I did a lot of ChatGPT and copying other people's projects' logic, so I could get good enough marks.

It worked quite well on my 2nd university year, but totally not working now, on my 3rd one.

The problem is that I really can't get rid of the feeling that I wouldn't be able to understand the material in time. I feel like actually trying to understand what I'm doing is a waste of time, and that even if I invest my time in it, I wouldn't be able to succeed the project (to have good enough results)

However, my feelings don't align with reality because copying other people's pieces of code and trying to make a Frankenstein out of them doesn't work either.

How do I actually affront my fear of not being smart enough to learn things in time? How can I trick myself into letting myself actually learn things and not to try to find shortcuts to the solution which works?

I teach a professional development course on personal selling. My students had just done a strength finding activity and completed a reflection on it in the asynchronous portion of the class. I chose to follow that up in our face-to-face with a group activity where they utilized the top strengths of each group member, along with something from a common interest they ask that, to create an idea for a new brand. They were supposed to name their brand, come up with a logo and tagline, and tell the class the brands general goal. 

Welp… frat bros 1-4 in the back of the class ask if they can go first. A volunteer? Great! Go for it. 

The logo? A car with a mountain in the background & the word “DRIVVE”, because ChatGPT images are never spelled correctly. They talk about how much of a hassle it is to want to go out and party and have to worry about a DD or getting a DUI. Their invention? Drive Beer!

Drive Beer is a product that will break down in your system to allow you to elude those pesky breathalyzers, all without reducing the buzz that you have from drinking them! So you can stay drunk all night long and enjoy yourself. The Drive Beer motto is “Drink the beer. Drive the car.”

Before my brain could process what I just heard, all four bros had grabbed their things and walked out of the class early. 

I’ve had some pretty egregious things happen in the classroom, but this one is definitely at the top of the list. The next time the class met I had to explain why not only is it unprofessional and irresponsible, but that when you choose to do something that thoughtless you’re doing so having no idea if your fellow classmates have lost loved ones to drunk drivers or alcoholism.

PSA: Despite how calmly objective I sound, this is actually a rage post. ☺️ Experiences are subjective, but since they differ between students so much, I’d recommend you just not take any risks and apply elsewhere instead.

1.Extremely poor funding
The school is famous for being financially incapacitated, and this seems to be true, at least from a student’s perspective. From what I heard from the teachers, the process for filing for a budget from the school is tedious, and most teachers would rather not do it. 
For example, NJC will not offer Music as an A level examinable subject a year from now due to high costs and low student interest.
My secondary school had better funding than NJC, which hosts 6 cohorts of students

a) Facilities
The school itself is prehistoric. ❤️ Its classrooms and architecture are age old. 
Hence, even with the consistent efforts from school management to paint over the facade and refurbish the campus to the best extent, the campus will still remain dated. Painting over the irreparable school building is like attempts by the UN to mitigate world affairs from their naturally inefficient structure.
Howevere, the on campus staff are really sweet and contribute to maintaining (whatever's left of) the school environment to their best abilities though. 

b) Lack of budget or capacity to host events and exchanges
Most of the school’s events are fully planned by the Student Council (SC) and the Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) with a set budget allocated to both of these student leadership bodies. Even within these bodies, proposals for events such as a Cohort Bonding Night were rejected. Given this, I find it hard to believe that the school will provide support to student led initiatives outside of those with leadership roles. 
Overseas exchange even for special programmes is uncommon and mostly restricted to within SEA. Compare this to other schools where students go on learning journeys and CCA excursions overseas at the end of the year. Going on exchange during my secondary school years were some of the best memories I have had. It's a shame to see that NJC students miss out on these precious experiences.


c) CCA Funding
The CCAs in NJC are extremely underfunded. 🔥 Overseas trips for CCA competitions are rare. Here are some examples to illustrate this.
Canoeing: Despite canoeing being one of NJCs best achieving CCAs, the school still uses wooden boats compared to the plastic boats used by every other JC competing in the NSGs. 
Strings: In order to fund their trip to the Vienna Music Festival (which took less than a week) this year, the CCA had to cut their budget in half for the next 4 years.
Band: (Coming from an unreliable source) The band room’s carpet had to be exhumed due to how filthy it was, and it took multiple reports from the students for action to be taken from the school. The room also faced an insect infestation.
ELDDES: One of their branches received a $0 budget for the entire year and had to rely on the teachers' own money to host events.
Side note: Some CCAs also face closure or merger, such as Hockey merging with Floorball. 
I suggest that students interested in applying DSA/for specific CCAs to reach out to current students and check NJCs track record for these CCAs. 


2. Teaching that leaves much to be desired

a) Indecipherable teachers/lecturers
Getting good teachers who can explain concepts well and provide useful exam materials is like rolling the russian roulette. I might have gotten the short end of the stick. 
I had to self study class materials for 4/6 of the subjects I took for A Levels, and I took up tuition for economics. My entire class except for 1 person took up economics tuition. Why? No one could understand what on earth our teachers were trying to explain. Really bless their hearts for trying and being friendly with us, but it was like listening to “one unmarketable tomato”. Whenever this poor teacher held lectures for the subject for the entire cohort, students would literally laugh and leave the hall 😭. This was applicable to more than 1 of my subject tutors, and consultations did not help either. Without tuition, I was averaging around Cs and Ds with no significant improvement. 
Another one of my subject tutors straight up provided ChatGPT generated answers as sample answers the entire time. Actually useful materials were provided mere weeks before A Levels, and were dated back to over 8 years ago. Even after taking the A Levels for this subject, I have no idea how teachers marked that subject. Somehow, it varied between different teachers and seemed arbitrary. 
I did have 1 goated subject tutor, but that was like finding water in the Atacama desert. 😍

b) Subject notes
NJC does fare pretty well in this aspect, by loading students with well-organised content notes to tackle the questions. The only downside would be that students have to decipher which parts of the notes are important and which are not. Students will have to rely more on themselves to be exam-ready. 

3. IP-JAE “Divide”
This barely existed, and the IP and JAE kids get along well. Whatever divides that were present during orientation are quickly resolved within a few weeks. Like any other school, the students are all friendly with a minority of double faced and immature children 🥰.

a) IP-JAE disparity with opportunities
This divide does manifest when it comes to having opportunities to go for programmes, competitions and leadership opportunities. When JAE students enter the school, they are like baby chickens competing with grown chicks for feed. IP students undeniably have an initial advantage of teacher and student connections. 
- International Research Exchange Programme (IREP). These exchange programmes to places like Japan were held in J1 and began recruitment the year before. Thus, they were exchange programmes for IP kids only. The remaining exchange programme JAE kids were able to apply for was the CVHAS twinning programme to Vietnam, mainly for humanities kids.
- NJCs Sapphire Programme is a teacher mentorship programme that students are welcome to apply for. Selection process includes an interview and portfolio assessment. Most of the Sapphire students I know are from IP. 
- The process of running for student council exco is also done via voting by the student population. The eventual elected exco are mostly IP students who already were councillors when they were in Junior High (JH).
When I was running for council, I was eventually put into a group of 5-6 students, where only 2 were selected: One JH student, and one very vocal IP SH student. 
- I think it is important to mention what I have perceived of teachers' attitudes to IP versus JAE students. One of my subject tutors directly told my parents that IP kids were “better” than JAE kids during a PTM session. Maybe this is true, and IP kids do have an edge over JAE students. I thank them for providing a frank teacher's impression of JAE kids.

4. Conclusion

Its not like the teachers and school management are overtly horrible. I believe many of them are trying within their capacity and whatever limitations they face to do their best for the school. 
For one, the new principal is absolutely delightful, accommodating and makes a genuine effort to engage the student population.

In conclusion, your decision to come to NJC comes at a cost that varies based off what you want your JC experience to be like. 
- Would you rather start off with a cleaner slate and receive more opportunities that would help you apply overseas? 
In this case, it's quite good to check out the admission statistics for various JCs into overseas unis. I believe NJC sent 4 students to Cambridge and around 11? to Oxford last year. There were 3 PSC scholars that same year. 
- Do you just want to have a conducive environment to mug for A Levels and get 90RP? 
In this case, please refer to what I have written in (1.) and (2.) and enquire more about the specific subject you want to take. The subject combinations are limited as well. For reference the median RP for NJC last year was around 82.5, which amounts to a ABB/B base that won’t qualify you for competitive courses like Law, Med, CS, Engineering or even IS.

In short, no matter what you want for your JC experience, I discourage any bright souls from applying to NJC. 🫶💕

To anyone considering miscellaneous reasons like “quality of canteen food” and “strong school spirit” in deciding which JC you apply to, please reconsider not only your choice of JCs but also please recalibrate your goals in life.
Claiming that the school spirit is strong with students bonding over the schools poor facilities is akin to claiming that its trauma bonding instead.

[USA],u/Striking_North_4556,psychologystudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychologystudents/comments/1h1p66g/i_need_help_with_an_application_for_an/,"This application is due on December 2, the Monday after Thanksgiving break. Unfortunately, I emailed a professor for help too late last Friday, and everyone has the whole week off now, so it may be inappropriate and too late to ask for help from anyone from my university.

**Does anyone have any good internet resources to help guide someone who has never applied to an undergrad campus research assistant internship?**

Most of the application questions **(the ones that I think need more careful consideration are bolded)** (all typos/wording are as seen in the application form)

1. How did you learn about this internship opportunity?
   1. Is there a way someone can unintentionally mess up answering this question?
2. **Why would you like to be a part of our team?**
3. When do you plan to graduate?
   1. I am part-time, I do not know if that is irrelevant or will hurt me to mention
4. **What are your career goals?**
   1. I think it is fine to say I am trying to discern by applying for opportunities like this one.
5. **What evidence an you provide that shows you have excellent attendance?**
6. **If you are selected, you will need to sign up for 3 units of \[independent study in psychology\].  How many units will you have in Spring 2025 when you include these 3 units.**  
   1. Why do they ask this?
7. **What else do you think we should know about you as we review the applications?**
   1. I am currently not sure what to put in this section. I received conflicting information about disclosing anything related to mental issues and disabilities, even in the context of overcoming them. My intuition tells me to follow the advice of selling myself the best I can with any information that was not requested in previous questions or the advice of asking genuine but good questions about the internship.

If you have the time, energy, and desire (which is unlikely at this time of year)... here is more context and additional questions below:

What I do know, what I might do, and additional questions:

* According to one lab member and the catalog, the internship, which requires signing up for three units, is similar to P/F grading because it uses satisfactory/unsatisfactory. So, while an unsatisfactory would leave a negative impression and maybe burn bridges, neither grade would influence GPA.
   * That same lab member claims that the professor is ""very understanding,"" but I am telling myself that can mean anything because I did not ask for examples of what that looks like and in what contexts. Even though the lab member shared this and the professor's research is related to mental health, I assume the professor still shows kindness to students' long-term success by upholding high standards, including with applications to their lab/research projects.
* I am in a course with content that serves as advice on graduate program applications and statements of purpose. The one line of guidance I assume translates well to filling out the application: ""Personal statements are argumentative essays, where your thesis is- I'd be good at doing the job that this graduate program will train me to do.""
   * **Is that applicable to this application?**
   * job, to me = duties and learning opportunities
   * graduate program, to me = the internship
* Based on one professor's commentary and what ChatGPT (like I said, no one else to ask right now...) told me, the only appropriate instance of asking the PI/evaluator of the applications for help with said application is for clarification on what is being asked, especially if there might be a mistake. 
   * **Agree or disagree with this?**
   * An actual question I want to ask about a discrepancy: The application has a question textbox asking for evidence that I have excellent attendance. However, the linked lab page has a qualification bullet point for proof of responsible and reliable participation in volunteer work, employment, or clubs, including a reference for requesting information on that. **Is that qualification something I need to include in my application answer textbox, or will I need it only for the interview if my application is accepted?**
   * An actual question I want to ask an application question regarding evidence that shows I have excellent attendance + a question about a qualification from the lab page: **(1)** **Since the textbox has no way to submit links or screenshots, can I state examples of outstanding attendance, with promises of providing screenshots, pictures at an attended obligation, or an official document (internship review) to back up those claims? (2) Can an official signed document be a substitution for a reference? The person who provided the document may be too busy to be my reference via a call, text, or email.**
      * The picture would show proof that I attended a significant student conference where I needed to wake up early to commute to catch a campus bus before 4:30 AM to attend it.
      * The signed document would have positive comments from the internship evaluator and a comment from the store manager saying they would hire me due to showing XYZ.
      * While that signed document has a comment about being late by a few minutes (within punctuality/attendance), I would elaborate in either the application or interview on how
      * I listened to the evaluator explaining why being even a few minutes late in the morning can affect other staff and customers and how/why I should inform someone if I forsee being late- and I verbally agreed and accepted that constructive criticism/feedback.
      * When given a choice, I set myself up for success by scheduling obligations later in the morning or afternoon.
      * I am implementing strategies/interventions from experts/professionals (would elaborate) that have dramatically decreased this issue, especially for attending early morning obligations like class, events, or appointments.
      * I should not have a problem attending the required afternoon campus meetings compared to the situation in the document being in the context of early morning.
      * My attendance for in-person mandatory course meetings is almost always perfect. I sometimes take the time to attend the next course section after my mandatory one if I think it will benefit my learning (with the professor's permission).
      * I have been able to fit into my Google Calendar and arrive on time from out of town for many optional campus program events: Panels, seminars, and guest speakers, with some events occurring back-to-back events.",active,1

1h2spyb,1,2024-11-29,What are AI detectors based on?,u/Olcyx,WritingWithAI,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1h2spyb/what_are_ai_detectors_based_on/,"Our high school teachers recently talked about AI text checkers to base their analysis results on, and potentially give 0/20s to any student strongly suspected of having used an AI like ChatGPT.

Impacted and anxious about this announcement, I have been searching the internet for quite some time now, trying thirty sites that claim to verify texts made by AI, but I have never seen a single detailed explanation from them regarding their method of analysis.

This made me ask 3 questions:

1. Would there be a specific vocabulary list (or even a typical structure often made by ChatGPT) that is detected by AI checkers in order to determine the presence of text written by ChatGPT or even another AI?
2. Do AI detectors exaggerate the results they display in detection statistics?
3. And as a result, will our teachers be unwittingly betrayed by the poor quality of these detectors, causing poor grades that should not have occurred?

Waiting for your responses.",active,4
1h3hcry,356,2024-11-30,Making students hand write their essays,u/Smooth_Classroom6683,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1h3hcry/making_students_hand_write_their_essays/,"I teach 12th grade humanities, and in my classes, students do a fair amount of writing. Our school does not issue Chromebooks; students bring their own laptops to class, which as you can guess raises all kinds of frustrating issues: texting, scrolling the internet, online gambling, TikTok galore, ChatGPT usage, etc. Every time I've talked to my admin about this, and stressed how much of a problem it is, I'm told it's my job as the teacher to monitor their computer usage as best as I can. (Lol, yeah, OK.) 

I've decided that moving forward I'm going to require students to handwrite as much of their work as possible. The problem: so much of their handwriting is atrocious. Some of this is due to dysgraphia, which allows for accommodations, but for many of them, they just don't want to pick up a pencil and write. They rush through, don't take it seriously, don't think it's ""real"" work if it's not on a screen. 

Nevertheless, I would like to have their semester exams be entirely handwritten. I'd also like to spend some time in the weeks before having them practice writing out longer answers on paper. I want to even start grading them on their penmanship - mostly to get them to slow down, take their time, not rush, and practice organizing their thoughts on paper. (Again, in cases of dysgraphia, I will of course provide accommodations - though the sad reality is that the students who will need these are some of the worst offenders when it comes to ChatGPT and distractions. Sigh...) 

In my estimation, going back to hand-written work is the only way to ensure they aren't being distracted by dopamine hits or using ChatGPT to write their answers (which is an insane problem at my school that no one at the top seems interested in addressing.) I literally cannot spy on the computer screens of 15+ students at once. And until we get our own Chromebooks, where we can block certain websites, or simply turn off internet capacity, these behaviors will never change. 

What do y'all think: is this a hill worth dying on? Or am I setting myself up for impossible frustration? Am I better off just washing my hands of this issue and accepting the fact that I cannot control what they do on their own computers? That until my admin wakes up and realizes the problem they're creating, students will just continue to do what they do? 

Bigger picture, I'm at the point this year where I have to decide what's worth swimming upstream for, and what's not. At the end of the day, my conscience feels rotten allowing students to get away with things I know will hurt them in the future, but I also have to acknowledge when it's just not within my control. 

Thanks, everyone, for any insights. ",User_deleted,360
