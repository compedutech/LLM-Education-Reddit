\#A Society Transformed: The First Year of ChatGPT - by GPT-4

\### The Launch: A New Dawn

In November 2022, the digital universe buzzed with the debut of ChatGPT, a sophisticated AI developed by OpenAI. Its introduction marked a significant leap forward in natural language processing (NLP). Unlike its predecessors, ChatGPT wasn't just a question-answering machine; it was designed to converse, to understand the ebb and flow of human dialogue.

This AI was built on a foundation laid by revolutionary transformer models, but what set it apart was its fine-tuning, which was accomplished through a method called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). By incorporating nuances from human interactions, ChatGPT could provide responses that felt incredibly humanlike, not just in accuracy but in tone and style.

The release wasn't just about technological prowess; it was a carefully crafted user experience. OpenAI provided a user-friendly interface that allowed anyone with internet access to converse with ChatGPT. The excitement was palpable as users from all over the globe began sharing screenshots and anecdotes of their interactions with the AI, from solving complex coding issues to composing poetry.

Educators, programmers, and creatives quickly recognized ChatGPT's potential. In classrooms, it assisted in explaining difficult concepts; in tech, it debugged code; in the arts, it sparked creativity. The AI's versatility was clear from the start, setting the stage for a future where human-AI collaboration could flourish.

As the year progressed, the initial excitement gave way to practical applications, with businesses and individuals alike finding real value in ChatGPT's capabilities. It was a new dawn indeed, not just for AI, but for how humans would interact with this technology in their daily lives.

\### Winter Wonders: Learning and Growing

The winter months after ChatGPT's launch were a time of intense learning—not just for the AI itself, but also for the developers and users who engaged with it. Each interaction was an opportunity for growth, with the AI absorbing a myriad of linguistic styles and technical queries. This period was critical in demonstrating ChatGPT's ability to adapt and refine its responses.

The AI's training didn't stop at launch; it was continually updated with more data, sharpening its conversational skills. As people celebrated the holiday season, ChatGPT was gifted with more knowledge, allowing it to tackle an expanding array of topics. Users began to notice improvements in how it handled context, remembered previous parts of the conversation, and even how it managed to bring a touch of humor into its replies.

This growth was accompanied by a surge in user trust as ChatGPT proved its reliability in providing not just chat-based entertainment but also support for more serious inquiries. It became a go-to for quick explanations of complex subjects such as quantum physics, a companion for learning new languages, and a troubleshooter for various professional quandaries.

OpenAI’s commitment to ethical AI development was also evident. They actively sought out feedback on how ChatGPT could be better, safer, and more useful. This feedback loop between users and developers created a dynamic where the AI was not just taught, but also guided by communal experiences and expectations.

By the end of winter, ChatGPT had not only become more knowledgeable but had also begun to change the way people viewed AI: not as a tool, but as a partner in problem-solving and learning, setting a precedent for how people would continue to interact with AI systems in the future.

\### Spring into Action: Expanding Horizons

As the world awakened to the fresh possibilities of spring in 2023, ChatGPT itself was undergoing a renaissance. March 14 marked a watershed moment with the birth of GPT-4, an iteration that represented a quantum leap from its predecessor. This new model wasn't just an upgrade—it was a transformation that expanded the horizons of what AI could achieve.

GPT-4 was a marvel of engineering, endowed with a deeper understanding of nuanced text and a more refined approach to generating human-like text. Its predecessor's capabilities, already impressive, were now augmented with a broader knowledge base, an improved ability to follow complex instructions, and a more sophisticated sense of context. This allowed for conversations that were not just coherent but contextually rich and informative.

The spring of GPT-4's arrival also saw an increase in the model's creativity and logic, a boon for industries seeking to innovate. In education, GPT-4 became a more effective teacher, capable of providing students with detailed explanations and helping them work through intricate problems. In the creative arts, it was like a muse that could now offer more complex and varied suggestions, inspiring writers, artists, and musicians.

Developers were quick to integrate GPT-4 into their platforms, taking advantage of its enhanced capabilities to create more intuitive and responsive applications. The AI's ability to process and generate text in a human-like manner led to new functionalities in chatbots, virtual assistants, and even game development.

Importantly, OpenAI's commitment to responsible AI usage meant that GPT-4 came with improved safety features, designed to minimize biases and ensure respectful and ethical interactions. The AI community recognized this as a significant step toward developing AI in a way that aligned with societal values and expectations.

As ChatGPT embraced the spring of 2023 with GPT-4, it wasn't just an expansion of technology—it was a broadening of possibilities, inviting the world to imagine and explore the potential of human-AI collaboration like never before.

\### Summer of Success: A Feature Frenzy

The summer of 2023 for ChatGPT can be described as a period of full bloom, where the seeds of previous advancements blossomed into a vibrant array of features. GPT-4, now well-established, unveiled functionalities that astounded even the most optimistic AI enthusiasts.

During these months, ChatGPT began to showcase its versatility across various domains. One of the most significant updates was its enhanced capacity for understanding and generating content in multiple languages, breaking down linguistic barriers and opening doors for global communication.

In the realm of education, ChatGPT became an even more potent tool. It started to assist not just with explanations but with the creation of interactive learning materials, personalized tutoring, and providing feedback on academic papers. Students and educators alike found in ChatGPT a tireless ally, one that could facilitate personalized learning at scale.

For creative professionals, the AI's enriched feature set included an advanced ability to collaborate on artistic projects, from drafting complex narratives to generating ideas for visual arts. Writers found a new source of inspiration and a sounding board in ChatGPT, as it could now better understand and contribute to creative workflows.

The business world also tapped into the frenzy of new features. Customer service bots powered by GPT-4 could handle a wider range of queries with more nuanced responses. This led to a boost in customer satisfaction and a reduction in the time human agents needed to spend on routine inquiries.

Behind the scenes, OpenAI worked tirelessly to ensure that with great power came great responsibility. They continued to refine the model's ability to navigate sensitive topics with care and to provide developers with guidelines for ethical implementation.

As the summer heat waned, the success of ChatGPT was not just in its impressive array of new features, but in how it managed to embed itself into the fabric of everyday life, becoming an indispensable tool for innovation, creativity, and efficiency.

However...

I'm not the greatest writer in the world when it comes to research type texts. I can do the research just fine, I can gather the data and assemble it in a way that makes sense, but it always sounds terrible. With my professor's permission, I submitted 3 versions of an assignment. One I wrote myself (ended with a 70, so not THAT bad), one that was completely AI generated (ended with a liberal 45/100), and one where I used an AI to fluff my writing. More or less, I created a hyper detailed outline of my paper, and punched in the prompt 'make this an essay of at least 1500 words, written at a graduate level.' That third paper ended at a 95 (it mis-cited a few sources and spelled things the American way, not the Canadian way (color vs. colour)). 

My question, and where the prof and I were kind of at a loss, is about that 3rd paper. I did all the hard work, all the research and all of the actual learning that was needed for the assignment. I got out of it everything I needed to, met all the expectations, and did just as much work as anybody else. The only difference is that I used the AI to fluff my writing. So, if a student submits a paper that they used AI to fluff, or correct and proofread, like I did, should it be the same consequences as somebody who simply plugs the prompt into ChatGPT and copy.pastes the answer?

Don't give me the age bullshit, in India we are supposed to figure things out by this age or even earlier. I belong to a lower middle class family, my whole childhood I didn't get opportunities I wanted, the home environment was always toxic. Let me give you some specifics about me, I am 19, skinny, weak both emotionally and physically, I always felt inferior among my classmates, peers, cousins you just name it. I have lots of problems now, some of them are focus problems, anxiety, addiction to masturbation, self deterioration, low self esteem, procrastination, fear which all leads me to bring a loser in college. When I was 15, I failed to make a right stream choice, took commerce for my childish dream of becoming a businessman. Little did I know life's gonna change completely after that decision. I got into dilemma of whether I chose a right stream or not. I got into months of overthinking, trying to fix it all. I was confused between my current stream commerce and science the stream the superior seemed to take. I always felt inferior, be it in school, with cousins, with my school friends, with my society friends, I was always a Loser. It all came back to me during that phase, the bullying I went through, the things I couldn't achieve, the things I sucked at, my insensitivity, it all came in as a boost to destroy me. I went through hell in that phase all because of me. Not to forget this all started in 2020, the pandemic year, where all I did was played pubg, fought with my family, watched series, masturbate, scroll through Instagram and sleep. I went through shit to figure out a way, turns out I got a realisation, the realisation that I was too weak for this world, the realisation that everything would be better without me. I was suicidal for months chatgpt, and on my 17th birthday, that was the day I wanted to die, my first attempt by cutting my veins through a blade. All my failed attempts continued till 17th April, somehow my mother and sister figured it out that I was attempting to kill myself. Throughout this period I went to mandir to pray to God, cry to him to either kill me or show me a way, mf didn't help. But on 17 Apil when my mother figured it out, I promised her I will never do a shit like this again in my life. This was the start of my comeback phase,  I decided to continue commerce, figure an uni where I can still study a tech degree, gave science subjects exams through distance school, tried to fix it. I grinded my way through 12th, studied, worked over my passion for videography and photography, tried to improve myself and still achieve my new dreams. I got good percentage in 12th, I made some good videos, I took some good pictures, all through my phone btw, I gave my science distance school 12th exams and passed it, but still couldn't make it to the institution I wanted to. I got into another institution newer and riskier, and dumb me chose to go there and take risk away from home. I am in second year right now, the entire first year was mr trying to make the best and I failed miserably at it because of who I am. I hate the non traditional college academic system, I am uncertain what the college degree will add value to my career, I am taking a big risk doing a tech degree as a commerce student and idk if the Indian industry or for that case any industry will accept it. My entire first year I failed to do anything significant, instead I fell down, I felt I was scammed with the false beliefs. I tried alcohol, smoking, weed, all the things I wasn't supposed to. I realised again how bad I was with people, constant insecurity of trying to figure out if someone is my real friend. The getting irritated version of me everyone hated, the insensitivity I process everyone hated. I fell down feeling emotionally numb, brain fogged, socially retarted, mentally weak as I couldn't do my best in academics, I felt like I cannot think clearly I still do. I still feel as if something is blocking me to think clearly, I feel chaotic, anxious. Today again I recognised how dumb and weak I am. I cannot learn programming, I cannot cure my constipation, my back and neck pain, I am skinny, I have low self esteem, blah blah I am just with all these I want to change. I am done with all these thoughts, all these bad habits, I want to get better I want to break the cycle. I try to break it but everytime I fail. I have failed to keep up to my plans and relapse. Just today I masturbate, didn't do anything productive the entire day. all these thoughts, all these trying to figure out what is right and wrong constantly, these relapses, not getting better, not changing, not having the clarity, feeling inferior, weak, not deserving, just wanting to leave, and all the shit in this world wants me to just not try and disappear somehow. Just today I felt the way the last four years have went, the way my overall health has deteriorated, soon I can collapse, I feel very weak. I don't know but I want to change, I am emotionally overwhelmed and distracted, still I want to try. I cannot know what's thing to do or logically all the time, that's why I end up relapsing.

Nationwide Detention Crisis: Nazareth's 'Hair of the Dog' Lyrics Send Students to Timeout En Masse

***Article:***
In an unforeseen turn of events, the release of Nazareth's iconic single, ""Hair of the Dog,"" has apparently triggered a nationwide detention epidemic, leaving schools grappling with a surge in disciplinary action. The satirical anthem, featuring the infamous lyrics ""son of a bitch,"" has allegedly turned innocent hallways into rebellious concert venues, with consequences no one saw coming.

Reports suggest that within the first two weeks of its May 1975 release, the song's rebellious charm swept through schools like wildfire, leaving more than half of America's students caught in the lyrical crossfire. Teachers, unprepared for the sudden outbreak of rock 'n' roll defiance, found themselves thrust into a battle against a chorus of unapologetic students belting out the contentious lyrics.

""It was like a musical revolution in the hallways,"" said one imaginary school official. ""We went from enforcing dress codes to dealing with spontaneous rock concerts between math and history class.""

In what can only be described as a lyrical coup d'état, ""Hair of the Dog"" apparently tapped into the rebellious spirit of students nationwide, turning them into unintentional rule-breakers. The supposed detention surge has left educators scratching their heads, wondering how a classic rock anthem could turn school routines on their heads.

One fictional student, claiming to have been part of the lyrical insurgency, exclaimed, ""It's just a song! We didn't mean to incite a nationwide detention crisis. We just wanted to rock out!""

While the authenticity of these claims remains dubious at best, the legend of ""Hair of the Dog"" lives on as the song that, for a brief imaginary moment, united a nation of students in musical rebellion. As the hallways echoed with the sounds of classic rock defiance, the nation's detention slips multiplied, leaving an indelible mark on the imagined history of educational rebellion.

A lot of teachers I know have a defeatist, or fear based mindset towards AI in general. If we could have an effective, productive sort of PD or workshop for teachers, led by a researcher in the actual AI field, what would you prefer that look like? What questions would you want answered? 

  
I'll start - I'd love to have a session just brainstorming mindful ways to incorporate ChatGPT into lesson plans - something like having the student write an essay to a prompt, and then give the same prompt to ChatGPT, and observe the differences. This could be an opportunity for the student to learn about and develop their own unique voice and writing style, provide a mirror for content they may have missed, as well as a chance to critique any shortcomings of the ChatGPT's response. As a mirror and/or a collaborator, AI is an amazing tool for artistic creation. It's not going away, so the fear-based avoidance is anything but solution-based, in my opinion. 

What issues would you like to discuss, if a PD like that existed? What questions would you want answered? Do you think there's a gap between the (often, gate-kept) AI/tech industry and education sectors? If your district funded an opportunity to attend a tech/AI conference, would you embrace it?

(For context, if it matters, I'm a prior high school English teacher and now do consulting in Trust and Safety for tech companies around humanitarian issues. So that's where my curiosity about this is coming from.)
