theories information-processing noticing sla embraced cognitive science researchers viewed learning building complex skills knowledge memory influential idea noticing hypothesis schmidt posits learners must notice linguistic form input enter interlanguage simply hearing spanish verb conjugations example lead acquisition unless learner pays attention verb endings empirical support comes studies learners prompted notice certain forms e.g spanish noun-adjective gender agreement endings learned better noticing often facilitated input enhancement instruction example highlighting subjunctive verb forms spanish text might help learner become aware prerequisite mastering subjunctive relatedly information-processing models mclaughlin attention-processing model dekeyser skill acquisition theory suggest practice convert declarative knowledge procedural skill spanish learner might first learn grammar rule explicitly e.g form subjunctive difference ser estar communicative practice rules become automatized evidence skill acquisition spanish sla instance learners practice forming subjunctive sentences meaningful contexts often improve speed accuracy time indicating shift effortful processing automatic however aspects become fully automatized adults complex forms remain prone errors suggesting limits converting explicit knowledge implicit overall cognitive approaches underscore interplay attention memory practice sla align classroom approaches include focused practice feedback supplement rich input interactionist theory long interaction hypothesis michael long proposed negotiation meaning communication facilitates language development learners actively converse face communication breakdowns ensuing negotiation clarifying correcting helps process language deeply spanish context often happens learners speak native speakers instructors learner says necesito practicar mi español porque estoy curioso en la cultura literal translation english curious native might understand clarified tener curiosidad idiomatic expression negotiation draws attention gap estar incorrect provides correct form key mechanism interaction corrective feedback especially recasts recasts implicit corrections interlocutor reformulates learner error correctly e.g. learner el niño juega con sus amigos ayer uses present juega instead past tutor ah jugó con sus amigos ayer. research shows feedback help acquisition example learners received recasts noun-adjective gender agreement spanish showed significantly greater accuracy gender correctly learners received feedback leeman study english-speaking learners recast said e.g. el casa likely later consistently say la casa demonstrating interactional feedback led learning interactionist research spanish learners

learning harder quantify social context cultural immersion widely recognized powerful factors achieving proficiency explaining study abroad spanish-speaking country often accelerates learning colloquial pragmatic aspects usage-based emergentist approaches approaches associated cognitive-functional linguists nick ellis construction grammar scholars argue language acquisition emerges frequent exposure usage patterns without needing separate innate language module learners gradually pick statistical regularities language spanish sla usage-based view highlights role frequency chunks example learner might hear ¿cómo estás often acquire fixed chunk understanding grammar time many examples abstract pattern forming questions conjugation estar concrete finding supporting learners tend acquire high-frequency forms earlier spanish corpus analyses show certain verb forms present indicative far frequent others subjunctive past imperfect consequently learners encounter master hablo vive queremos common present-tense forms relatively early whereas forms subjunctive hablara viva rare input often remain challenging even advanced stages study noted subjunctive mood acquired late incompletely many l2 spanish learners likely represents verb forms native input low input frequency means many learners scant exposure varied subjunctive usages usage-based perspective predicts correctly struggle usage-based researchers emphasize exemplars constructions learners might first learn construction hace tiempo\\ que… time\\ that… unanalysed whole talking time later analyze components approaches align idea massive exposure meaningful repetition key patterns emerge learner brain detects regularities modern tools big data analyses learner language trace spanish constructions become native-like proficiency grows supporting view frequency recency form–meaning mappings drive acquisition key findings research spanish sla research focusing learners spanish l2 produced wealth data enriching general understanding sla notable findings examples include developmental sequences learners languages spanish learners go predictable stages acquiring certain structures example morphosyntactic development follows sequence classic finding beginning learners often simplify verb morphology english speaker might initially verbs infinitive base form e.g yo hablar con ella speak mastering spanish conjugations processability theory research spanish describes seven distinct stages grammatical development requiring certain processing capacities early stages involve canonical word order formulaic expressions later stages see emergence verb inflections complex word orders instance subject–verb agreement correct verb appears relatively early spanish rich verb endings salient required grammatical sentences however object clitics lo la placement later-stage phenomena learners might first produce sentences without incorrect positions studies confirm even taught rules early learners tend incorporate structures output cognitively ready essence instruction entirely skip developmental stages learner spanish interlanguage grows order constrained learnability processing mirrors findings languages e.g english developmental sequences negation questions reinforcing sla internal sequence component role first language transfer cross-linguistic influence evident spanish sla learners often transfer sounds word order usage patterns l1 especially initial stages example native english speakers struggle spanish grammatical gender since english lacks noun gender might incorrect articles adjective endings el problema masculine spanish english speaker might mistakenly say la problema analogy -a ending looking feminine l1 english speakers tend always subject pronouns yo tengo english requires whereas spanish often drops pronouns tengo time learners adjust features input realize differences l1 transfer effects persistent anglophones learning spanish often retain accent difficulty rolled r pronouncing v b distinctly etc learned different phonetic categories childhood however positive transfer exists english spanish share many cognates e.g fabricar fabricate curiosidad curiosity give learners boost vocabulary acquisition overall research shows l1 influence strong pronunciation sometimes syntax interacts developmental processes advanced learners overcome many l1-based errors especially awareness instance explicit instruction spanish-specific patterns adjective-noun word order casa blanca vs english white house helps speed correction transfer errors importantly proficiency increases learners rely less l1 equivalence operate within norms spanish sign interlanguage evolving target-like specific difficult areas spanish certain features spanish reliably pose challenges studied depth preterite vs. imperfect past tenses e.g canté sang completed vs cantaba sing research e.g salaberry formulated default past tense hypothesis observing learners initially over-use preterite default past marker purposes early stages english-speaking say ayer comí pizza comí pizza cada día preterite ate pizza yesterday ate pizza every day yet grasping context calls imperfect comía cada día later learners acquire aspectual distinction starting imperfect background repeated actions progression aligns general aspect hypothesis sla spanish data central testing another notoriously late-acquired feature subjunctive mood studies collentine others show even advanced learners struggle subjunctive e.g quiero que vayas want go vs indicative sé que vas know going reason mentioned low frequency subjunctive input subtlety meaning collentine notes subjunctive competence remains incomplete many learners even heritage speakers instruction raise awareness textbooks devote many pages subjunctive forms research suggests mere knowledge rules guarantee production learners might drills correctly still avoid subjunctive spontaneous speech due uncertainty extensive meaningful exposure need learners begin naturally pronouns clitics another area spanish clitic pronouns precede verb lo veo see english speakers often omit mis-order double

reading literacy ng mga batang nasa edad year old nung pang-last pa rin sa hiwalay na assessment ng timss na sinusukat naman ung sa 4th 8th grade nung una ko tong nakita hindi ako makapaniwala n't realize na ganito na pala kalala yung illiteracy sa stem sa pinas siguro dala na rin ng lagi akong nasa top section nung nag-aaral pa ako kaya akala ko normal lang yung pagkakaroon ng proficient knowledge jan. reality slowly reveals nung naging close kami nung pamangkin ko tapos nagpapaturo siya sa akin sa mga assignment niya already high pero sobrang hirap siya maggrasp ng mga basic concept sa science na naturo na noong elem pa lang atom hindi niya alam hindi siya naniniwala nung sinabi kong gawa sa tubig yung mga ulap hindi sa vape gulat na gulat din siya na bilog yung mundo hindi flat para akong nakikipag-usap sa toddler jusmiyooo thought nung una na siya lang yung ganon kaso nung nagperiodical sila sabi niya na wala ni isa daw sa kanila ang nakapasa sa pero subjects fine naman idk pero ca n't live reality kaya talagang nagpokus akong turuan yung pamangkin ko turo na memorization ganon yung typical na pinapagawa sa kanila sa ang ginagawa ko ay iniispark ko muna yung curiosity niya let tell wrong answers n't make feel dumb kapag nagkakamali siya sinasabi ko na bakit sense yung sagot niya bakit dati yung mga tao ganon din yung akala non discovered na case made feel exploration instead chore fortunately 've seen great improvement sa kanya dahil nadadamay pa nga mga classmates niya pagnakukwento niya yung mga bago niyang nalalaman tapos nagugulat na lang ako na sila na nagkukusa maghanap ng sagot kay google kay sa mga tanong na bigla nilang maiisip tapos iseshare nila sa akin hahaha tell whatt info ay kahit ako hindi ko alammm ako pa yung natutunan sa kanila ang angas diba nakakatuwa silang tingnan learning fun tama nga yung sinabi ni carl sagan na every kid starts natural-born scientist beat ang kaso even hindi pa rin ako mapakali feel need even kung kaya nila yung ganong progress kids 's ngayon bigla akong naisip gawin na think super effective yet super feasible create local content na super engaging interesting curiosity sparking influence tried navigating internet kung meron ng gumagawa ng mga ganon ang kaso part wala akong mahanap na masasabi kong good enough content para magtetake talaga ng time yung mga bata para panoorin yon realized kung ano yung nagpa-udyok sakin noong bata ako para magspark yung curiosity ko ayun na nga naalala ko si vsauceee hahaha humaling na humaling ako sa mga vid nia nung bata ako gawa na lang ako ng style teaching niya na sobrang entertaingin pero tagalog na maiintindihan ng mga bata ngayon primary purpose channel spark curiosity pero kapag naging successful siya plano ko naman gumawa ng parang crash
