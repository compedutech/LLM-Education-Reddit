1f61nr2,74,2024-08-31,I finished studying the HSK6 Standard Course (again) ,u/BeckyLiBei,ChineseLanguage,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/1f61nr2/i_finished_studying_the_hsk6_standard_course_again/,"I finished studying the HSK6 Standard Course, both volumes: 上册 and 下册 (40 chapters).  You can watch me [study it on YouTube for 384 hours](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbv6XCBlpTgmPbft6dqJFNnXh24yX_uWP) if you want.  This is my second time working through these books, and I went through it far more carefully this time.

I booked into the HSK6 exam for October (i.e., in 48 days); I'm not sure how well I'll do.

First, some things you may not know: (a) There are **official answers** to the exercises: [上册](https://www.blcup.com/enres/ResInfo?rid=43625) and [下册](https://www.blcup.com/enres/ResInfo?rid=51694).  (b) The vocabulary listed alongside the main texts **only cover approx. 2000 words**, so they don't cover the entire HSK6 syllabus (HSK2.0 standards) which has 2500 items.  However, vocabulary is listed both before and after the main texts in each chapter.

Importantly, almost all (if not all) of the 40 texts have been **modified from an original text**.  I suggest **reading the original texts too, if available** (or search for keywords and read related articles if they're not available).  The textbook versions have been dumbed down, and vocabulary and grammar (and even content) has been artifically crammed in---these are not just minor modifications.  Consequently, the writing is sometimes quite unnatural, like 狗， 哦， 我们姑且换一个文雅的称呼吧，犬 (ch.6), or 我们还能迷信专家吗？ (ch.40), or 高限一般是最高心率的85% (ch.40).  Oh, and who can forget this beauty from chapter 21:

> 不管你是想买样式新颖的羽绒服， 旗袍，还是想买你中意的音响，收音机，水龙头或者只是几枚纽扣儿，一个插座，再或者是勘探矿产的工具，你只要把照片发送到专门的网站，就能得到反馈。

So **I do not recommend using these texts as examples of good prose**.  Compare the original text with the textbook version and you'll see what I mean.  Often where I struggled to understand something, it's because of a modification from the original (e.g., the textbook had to use some word somewhere, so they stuff in it and maybe break some collocations).

In my experience, quite a few HSK6 exam questions look a lot like they've been copy/pasted from Sina or Sina-like articles, so the HSK6 student using the HSK6 Standard Course will somehow need to bridge the gap between these HSK6 Standard Course texts and real-world texts.


How I studied:

- For vocabulary, I'd try to study words to theoreical exhaustion (although maybe I can still improve my fluency), using a Chinese-Chinese dictionary in Pleco, along with example sentences from YouDao (and whatever comes up via Google).  I'd use ChatGPT for all sorts of things, but I found asking vague questions like ""Can you help me with [word] please?"" most useful as it would tell me things I might not have thought to ask for.  It's also helpful for generating example sentences where words are used with particular parts of speech, and for generating paragraphs and background stories using certain vocabulary.

- For certain words, especially tangible nouns, I'd search for them in Google Image Search---this helps create a mental image of what the word means (sometimes there are surprises, such as finding out what 丰满 really means).  For adjectives, I'd identify what they can describe and whether they're positive/negative/neutral (e.g., 顽固 bad, 坚强 good).  I'd put extra effort/time into studying verbs in order to understand their specific grammar (Can it take an object?  Do you use it with 被?  Where do you put the 了?  What contexts can it arise in?  What are its collocations?)  For most words (and especially chengyu), I'd make sure I understand what each of its characters mean, and identify other words containing a common character used in the same way.  Chengyu grammar is almost always irregular, and chengyus are often used in precise circumstances, so I'd make sure to study that.

- When I finished studying the vocabulary, I would read the text aloud twice.  Once to make sure I understood it, know the tones, and filling in knowledge gaps if needed, and once again without stopping for fluency.  (In previous study, I'd read aloud the texts 20+ times, timing myself every day for weeks, until I could read it aloud faster than the supplied mp3.)

- Once I finished studying each volume, I read the texts aloud from all 20 chapters in one go.  **For the first volume (上册) I read aloud all 20 texts in 1 hour 59 minutes, and for the second volume (下册) I read aloud all 20 texts in 3 hours and 13 minutes**.  (Here it is on YouTube: [上册](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShbiN8xakyc&list=PLbv6XCBlpTgmPbft6dqJFNnXh24yX_uWP&index=83) and [下册](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zn2-PT3WPoM&list=PLbv6XCBlpTgmPbft6dqJFNnXh24yX_uWP&index=191))  It's mindblowing that a sizeable chunk of the HSK6 cirriculum, which took years of study to learn, can now be reviewed in mere hours.

- During my study this time, I allowed myself to go far off-topic: putting in hundreds of hours of study requires some element of enjoyment, so if I found something that was fun and relevant, I'd keep doing that.  So I ended up doing things like reading interesting Wikipedia pages, getting ChatGPT to generate paragraphs using vocabulary in the style of ""Yes, Minister"", or reading a 语文 textbook which gives the backstory for some chengyu.

- I got into the habit of stating aloud what I think is correct, then cross-checking my claims against my Chinese-Chinese dictionary, Google, ChatGPT, etc.  This way, if I have some kind of misconception, it became quite apparent.  For vocabulary, I'd mention the parts of speech it can be used in, whether or not it can be used figuratively, its most common collocation(s), and other nuances (e.g., how it differs from its English translation).


My specific feedback on the textbook:

- There's an **incredibly heavy emphasis on vocabulary**: there's vocabulary accompanying the main text, and what I call the ""pre-vocabulary vocabulary"" (the vocabulary you learn before you reach the main text) and ""post-vocabulary vocabulary"" (the vocabulary you learn after you've finished the main text).  I think this is reasonable; the main bottleneck is usually not knowing enough words, or not knowing them to sufficient depth.  I believe you need to know a lot more than the HSK6 vocabulary for the HSK6 exam.

- Both volumes proceed unit by unit (4 chapters per unit), which essentially means there's 10 topics covered.  E.g., unit 7 pertains to the backstories behind Chinese phrases (草船借箭, 完璧归赵, 囊萤照读, and 知音), while unit 8 pertains to human biology.  Some of the units are fairly haphazard, however.  In any case, I like the systematic learning style ""get good at one topic, then move onto the next topic"", and **I encourage students to Google keywords from the text and keep reading** one you finish a topic (it's satisfying immediately using your new/improved skills in the real world).

- At the start of every chapter there's 4 characters with a list of words containing each one; it's unclear what we're meant to do with this.  (PS. You can put the character in Pleco and select WORD for this functionality.)  I studied these (e.g. by looking up defintions, example sentences, comparing synonyms, identifying collocations and contexts), but some of them are very low priority (like 期终 in ch.33), while some important words are missing.  For the given words, the characters have a single meaning and pronunciation (they may have different meanings and pronunciations outside these words), and some of the characters are prefixes and suffixes.

- Beside the main text, vocabulary is listed along with the part-of-speech and English translation corresponding to how its used in the main text.  **This level of vocabulary knowledge is simply not good enough at the HSK6 level**: we need to know basically all the meanings of words (even rare and figurative usages appear on the HSK6 exam).  Moreover, quite a few translations are dubious (e.g., 冲击 ""v. to challenge, to go for"" (ch.24) or 高涨 = ""adj. (in) high (spirits)"" (h.25) or 部署 = ""v. to arrange, to map out"" (ch.37)).  I believe students at the HSK6 level would be far better off using a Chinese-Chinese dictionary then relying on translation-based definitions.

- One thing that annoys me is how **the textbook sporadically replaces proper nouns** for no obvious benefit: such as writing 钱小奇 instead of his actual name 郭奇 (ch.11), writing 某家著名的搜索引擎公司 instead of 谷歌 (ch.22), writing 孙瀛洲的女儿孙女士 instead of giving her name 孙文冬 (ch.34), writing 小罗 instead of his name 罗祥彬 (ch.37).  (And they do this inconsistently, using the correct names for 王建男 (ch.14), 蔺相如 (ch.27), 孙瀛洲 (ch.34), 锐步 (ch.40).)  The textbook also doesn't tell you that chapter 23 is the background story to the chengyu 囊萤照读 and the boy's name is 车胤.  It also doesn't tell you that the story on page 170 (下册) is from 《背影》 by 朱自清 (I only recognized this because I had read the story elsewhere).

- The grammar sections usually begin by describing some conjunctions, adverbs, prepositions, or grammar structures (later on it's more about rhetoical devices like hyperbole and parallelism).  **It's a struggle to understand the grammar explanations due to unexplained lingusitics jargon**, despite these explanations being important.  Even simple things like 名词 ""noun"", 动词 ""verb"", 形容词 ""adjective"" are not part of the HSK vocabulary, let alone Chinese-specific grammar terms like 状语, 定语, 补语 which are concepts key to Chinese grammar, or phrases commonly used in grammar explanations like 侧重于, 褒义/贬义, 重叠, or 前缀/后缀.  Moreover, the example sentences are needlessly long and difficult, as if the author was attempting to teach multiple things at a time (not just the relevant grammar point).  For my first time studying this textbook, I didn't know the grammar jargon, so I mostly just skipped the explanations; but by the second time, I had learned grammar jargon, so I could read it easily enough.  (Note you can take a photo of textbook pages and give it to ChatGPT for help nowadays.)

- In the second volume, we talk about rhetoric devices, like 仿词 (words you make up) and segues and hyperbole and paragraph structure.  This is where we start to appreciate more poetic aspects of the language.  It's hard to appreciate these aspects when you're an early-HSK6 student.


The **textbook's exercises are rather ""hit or miss""**:

- Some of the exercises ask you to modify a sentence to use a certain word, which sounds reasonable until you realize you're expected to replace a word like 本质 with a synonym like 实质, and everything else remains unchanged.  (E.g., on page 63 of 下册, we're given three example sentences and we're meant to rephase them with 不成; in all three, the correct answer is to change 吗 to 不成, and that's it.)  This is an odd choice of exercise to give HSK6-level students, who should be able to write full paragraphs.  To make these more challenging, I would try to see if I can make my answer character-for-character identical with the official answer.  Occasionally you would need to actually rephrase the grammar, and identifying when this is required and carrying it out seems like a worthwhile exercise.

- Some of the exercises give you five words to add into a paragraph with 5 blanks.  Unfortunately, the five words are from totally different parts of speech, and have totally different meanings, so you don't really learn much.  To make these exercises more useful, I'd cover up the five words, and try to fill in the blanks by identifying collocations, and recalling the words I had recently revised.

- There's different types of ""complete this sentence with a given word"" exercises; these are a good choice of exercise, since you're given an appropriate context in which the word might arise, and you have the freedom to write according to your own personal style.  Sometimes I'd try to make my answer character-for-character identical with the official answer, but if that wasn't possible (or if there is no official answer), it might be hard to verify my answer; I might ask ChatGPT for help.

- Every chapter has an exercise where you're given five characters and are asked to write words containing those characters.  This exercise is kind of fun, although sometimes the characters don't belong to many common words, and the official answers include rare words (that I'd still feel like I'm years away from ever needing).  I'd be especially happy if I could think of a chengyu containing the character.

- There's usually a ""restate the text"" exercise for each chapter, where you're asked to restate the text step-by-step.  I skipped this exercise.  There's also a writing exercise which asks you to restate the text in some way.  I skipped this exercise too.  If I want to say/write something, I'd choose my own topic.  (Does anyone actually do these exercises?  They seem pointless.)

- In the first volume, there are some 语病 = ""faulty wording"" questions.  Be warned: **some of these ""faulty wording"" questions are unhelpful and even demoralizing**, such as the one on page 30 of 上册, where you need to change the non-HSK adjective 清凉 to the non-HSK adjective 清新 (and there's no actual grammar error; it's akin to changing ""the sky is red"" to ""the sky is blue""), or the one on page 93 (上册) which gets you to change 青松翠柏 (including 2 non-HSK characters) to 松柏常青.  Nevertheless, among these questions are some important points, like the grammar error in 妈妈对于我不太信任，……。 (page 94, 上册).  I suggest paying attention to the important points, but not getting flustered if you don't ""get it"", as sometimes they're just not helpful."

# Introduction

Have you ever wondered why your AI model's responses aren't always spot-on? Despite using advanced techniques, the results can sometimes be inconsistent. This is where the concept of Chain-of-thought (CoT) methods comes into play. CoT methods rely on a fixed set of human-annotated exemplars to guide AI responses. However, these exemplars might not always be the most effective for different tasks.

Enter Active-Prompt, a revolutionary approach proposed by Diao et al. (2023). Active-Prompt adapts Large Language Models (LLMs) to different task-specific example prompts, annotated with human-designed CoT reasoning. This method ensures that the AI model is always learning and improving, leading to more accurate and reliable responses.

In this article, we'll explore how you can implement Active-Prompt using the Flow Prompt open-source library. We'll guide you through the process step-by-step, showcase real-world applications, and discuss the future of AI model performance enhancement.

# Understanding the Limitations of CoT Methods

Chain-of-thought (CoT) methods have been a staple in AI model training. They use a fixed set of human-annotated exemplars to guide the model's responses. While effective to some extent, these exemplars may not always be suitable for different tasks, leading to inconsistent results.

# Introducing Active-Prompt

Active-Prompt addresses the limitations of CoT methods by adapting LLMs to task-specific example prompts. The process involves:

1. Querying the LLM with or without a few CoT examples.
2. Generating k possible answers for a set of training questions.
3. Calculating an uncertainty metric based on the k answers (disagreement used).
4. Selecting the most uncertain questions for human annotation.
5. Using the new annotated exemplars to infer each question.

# Implementing Active-Prompt with Flow Prompt

Flow Prompt is an open-source library that provides a comprehensive solution for managing AI-powered prompts, user interactions, and AI model integrations. Here's how you can implement Active-Prompt using Flow Prompt:

1. **Querying the LLM:**
   * Use Flow Prompt to query the LLM with or without CoT examples.
   * Generate k possible answers for a set of training questions.
2. **Calculating Uncertainty:**
   * Implement an uncertainty metric to evaluate the k answers.
   * Identify the most uncertain questions for further annotation.
3. **Human Annotation:**
   * Select the most uncertain questions and annotate them with human-designed CoT reasoning.
   * Update the exemplars in the Flow Prompt system.
4. **Inference and Evaluation:**
   * Use the new annotated exemplars to infer each question.
   * Evaluate the performance and accuracy of the AI model.

# Real-World Applications and Use Cases

Active-Prompt can be applied to various real-world scenarios, such as:

* Customer support chatbots: Enhancing the accuracy and relevance of responses.
* Educational tools: Providing more precise and context-aware answers to student queries.
* Healthcare: Assisting in medical diagnosis by improving the reliability of AI-generated suggestions.

1f65wby,1,2024-09-01,The Best AI Content Detectors of 2024: Top Tools for Accurate Detection,u/Fair_Trade_Finder,aitoolsnews,https://www.reddit.com/r/aitoolsnews/comments/1f65wby/the_best_ai_content_detectors_of_2024_top_tools/,"# Best AI Writing Detectors in 2024

If you're looking for the best AI content detector tools in 2024, you’re in the right place. 

AI-generated content is everywhere, and it’s getting harder to tell if a piece of writing was created by an AI or a human.

So, I've rounded up a list of the best AI content detectors to help you figure out what’s human-written and what’s likely generated by AI.

# Top AI Detectors for Accuracy in 2024

* [**TraceGPT**](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-KI6H8Bz4n-tracegpt-ai-detector): A ChatGTP bot that's described as ""[basically perfect](https://zapier.com/blog/ai-content-detector/)"" in accuracy but independent tests, using AI-generated content from various sources, including ChatGPT and Claude. **Best of all, it's free!**
* [**Originality.AI**](https://tinyurl.com/Originality-AI-Detect-Reddit): Independent testers cite [98.8% accuracy](https://ddiy.co/originality-ai-review/) for detecting GPT-4 and ChatGPT content specifically. Unique features include fact checking in addition to AI detection

# What Are AI Writing Detectors?

AI writing detectors are tools designed to identify text that has been generated by AI models, such as ChatGPT.

These detectors analyze the content to determine whether it was created by a human or generated by AI.

As AI technology continues to evolve, so does the need for reliable detection tools, especially in 2024 when AI-generated content is becoming more sophisticated.

# How Do AI Writing Detectors Work?

These AI content detectors work by examining patterns in the text that are typical of AI writing.

They look for signs that indicate the use of AI, such as repetitive phrases or unnatural sentence structures.

# Why Are AI Writing Detectors Important?

AI writing detectors are becoming increasingly important as the use of AI in content creation grows.

Whether you’re using AI to assist with writing or trying to **detect AI-generated content**, these tools are essential for maintaining the integrity of human-authored work.

In addition to detecting AI-generated text, these tools often serve a dual purpose as **plagiarism checkers**.

This makes them valuable for writers, educators, and businesses who want to ensure that their content is both original and human-written.

# Who Can Benefit from AI Writing Detectors?

AI writing detectors are valuable tools for a wide range of people and industries. Here’s a quick rundown of who can benefit from using these detection tools:

* **Content Creators**: Writers and bloggers who want to ensure their work is original and not accidentally influenced by AI-generated content can use these tools to check their drafts.
* **Educators**: Teachers and professors can use AI detectors to identify if students are submitting work generated by AI, maintaining academic integrity.
* **Businesses**: Companies that produce large volumes of content at scale can use AI writing detection tools to ensure their marketing materials, articles, and reports are authentically human-written.
* **Editors**: Editors and proofreaders can use AI detectors to catch AI-generated content that might slip through the cracks, ensuring the quality and originality of the text.
* **Researchers**: Academics and researchers can use AI detection tools to verify that their published papers and studies are free from AI-generated text, ensuring their research remains credible.
* **SEO Professionals**: Those working in SEO can use these tools to avoid penalties from search engines that might flag AI-generated content as duplicate or low-quality.

# Top Features to Look for in AI Writing Detectors

1. **Spotting AI-Generated Content Accurately** The main job of any AI content detector is to correctly identify text that's been whipped up by an AI. The top tools use advanced AI models to catch those telltale signs that content was generated by a machine. Whether it's human or AI-made, your tool should give you a solid, reliable analysis.
2. **Works with Various AI Text Generators** AI text generators are getting smarter every day, so your AI checker has to keep pace. You'll want tools that can detect content from a variety of AI technologies, including big names like ChatGPT. The more types of AI it can handle, the better prepared you'll be for the future.
3. **Built-In Plagiarism Detection** Many AI content detectors double up as plagiarism checkers, which is super handy if you're dealing with a lot of content. Finding a tool that does both can save you time, giving your work a thorough review in one go.
4. **User-Friendly Design** Even if you're not a tech whiz, a good AI content detector should be simple to use. It should let you easily upload your writing and quickly give you clear, actionable results. Whether you're a teacher, writer, or business owner, this makes a big difference.
5. **Real-Time Detection** Speed matters just as much as accuracy in 2024. The best tools should be able to spot AI-generated content on the fly, helping you make fast decisions about your content.
6. **Free AI Content Detector Options** Not all top AI content detectors come with a price tag. If you're on a budget, free options like Winston AI offer solid detection capabilities without costing you a dime.
7. **Handles Large Volumes of Content** If you’re managing lots of content, you’ll need a tool that can detect AI-generated text across multiple documents at once. The ability to work at scale is key for keeping up with high volumes of content.
8. **Detailed Reporting** The best detectors don't just give you a thumbs-up or down—they break down why they think your content might be AI-generated. These insights can be crucial for refining your human-generated work.
9. **Customizable and Flexible** Some AI detectors let you tweak settings to fit your specific needs. Whether you’re dealing with different types of AI generators or various kinds of content, this kind of flexibility can be a real game-changer.

# How Does User Experience Impact the Effectiveness of Detectors?

* **Ease of Use**: If an AI content detection tool is tricky or confusing to use, people might not take full advantage of its features. A simple, intuitive setup allows users to quickly upload their text and get clear, actionable results, which makes the tool more effective.
* **Clear Reporting**: How an AI content detector communicates its findings is crucial. Detailed, easy-to-read reports help users decide if a piece of content is AI-generated or human-written. If the feedback is too technical or unclear, it can lead to misunderstandings, making the tool less useful.

# Are There Ethical Considerations Surrounding AI Writing Detection?

Yes, there are definitely some ethical considerations when it comes to AI writing detection. As the use of AI content detection tools becomes more widespread, especially with the best AI content detectors like Winston AI and other advanced AI tools, it’s important to think about the impact these technologies have.

One major concern is the potential for **misidentifying human-generated content** as AI-generated. When an AI checker mistakenly flags authentic human writing as generated content, it can unfairly penalize creators. This risk is particularly significant when using AI content detection tools at scale, where the margin for error could lead to harm for genuine writers who rely on their content for credibility and livelihood.

Another issue is how these tools might be used to **bypass AI detection**. As AI content generation becomes more sophisticated, there’s a growing cat-and-mouse game between those creating AI-generated text and those trying to identify it. This can lead to a situation where the focus shifts more towards beating the detection system rather than maintaining the integrity of content.

Additionally, there’s the broader impact on **trust and the value of human content**. If AI content detectors are overused or misused, it could create a culture of mistrust where all content is viewed with suspicion. This undermines the value of human-generated content and could discourage creativity and innovation.

Finally, the rise of AI writing detection tools raises questions about **privacy and consent**. When content is automatically scanned and analyzed by AI text detectors, there’s a risk that personal or sensitive information could be exposed or misinterpreted. It’s essential to establish clear guidelines on how these tools should be used, ensuring they respect the privacy and rights of content creators.

1f6cjey,1,2024-09-01,"Is Alto a voice type, afterall? Confused",u/PinkPuffs96,singing,https://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/1f6cjey/is_alto_a_voice_type_afterall_confused/,"I'm currently having a debate with a friend over this. I'm autistic and I'm confused, so generally when I'm confused, I tend to really want to get to the bottom of it and find out the truth, which can be interpreted by others as wanting to prove I'm right and contradict people, which is not my intention. I just want to understand and not be confused.

Also note that my friend may be salty because she's a recently grad music highschool student and I haven't chosen her as my singing teacher, instead going for someone that lives closer, has more experience and is more versed in the type of singing I want to pursue.

I asked her what voice type does she have, and I told her that my teacher told me I'm situated somewhere between contralto and mezzo-soprano, with the capacity to sing in both ranges, which surprised me, since I thought I was a contralto, but my voice is indeed not *that* deep, I'd describe it as simply richer and with more bass than your typical female voice, but definitely not Alyson Moyet or Annie Lennox or Tracy Chapman or Toni Braxton type.

I have a natural affinity for opera singing and the use of vibrato, and the highest note I've hit was a C6. 

She seemed triggered by me saying I'm between contralto and mezzo-soprano, saying that mezzo-sopranos are incredibly rare and therefore I surely am not one (she said she's a soprano herself). She also claimed that ""alto"" is a common voice type, together with soprano (suggesting that I'm probably alto, therefore).

I was confused, so I asked ChatGPT about it. The answer was that mezzo-sopranos are not rare, just rarer than sopranos, and that the contralto voice type is the rarest feminine voice type.

My friend then asked her ChatGPT, which was in Romanian language, not English like mine, but she specifically asked how rare are mezzo-sopranos in Romania, and hers said that they're rarest. Then I asked mine the same question, but in English, and mine said it's not true, that even in Romania, mezzo-sopranos are not that rare. I then asked my ChatGPT about the ""alto"" and contralto difference, because from what I knew, they are not comparable, since alto isn't a voice type, but a vocal part, that can be sung by a variety of voices.

My ChatGPT confirmed that. She then asked her Romanian ChatGPT and hers said that in speciality musical literature, alto is certainly recognized as a voice type, the lowest of the kind (lower than contralto??). Then I asked my ChatGPT for some clarification on this once more, and mine said that it might be that in Romania, musical theory is different and the two terms are being used interchangeably or misinterpreted.

My head is spinning and I'm still very confused. My friend got pissed and told me that we should end the ""dispute"" and that kinda makes me feel guilty, although I've been just curious and civil.

So, my questions are:

Is, afterall, alto a voice type?
Is Alto one of the most common voice types, together with soprano, in Romania?
Is mezzo-soprano a very rare voice type in Romania? 
What relevance does this have, if it's true, and does it automatically mean I can't possibly be a mezzo-soprano, although my teacher with 25 years of experience and training told me so? 
Is this just an emotional matter on my friends' part and I should drop it?

1f6jcel,9,2024-09-01,Three Houses/Three Hopes Combined Timeline 2.0 - Part 1: White Clouds and Blackened Embers (Shared White Clouds) - [SPOILERS ALL ROUTES],u/jord839,FireEmblemThreeHouses,https://www.reddit.com/r/FireEmblemThreeHouses/comments/1f6jcel/three_housesthree_hopes_combined_timeline_20_part/,"This is a rewrite of an older idea of mine, which was combining all of Three Houses and Three Hopes into a single narrative. You can see the previous version, where I wrote only the Golden Deer but had the others partially written, here. In comparison, this version has many things that are similar, but also a lot of changes and adjustments have been made.

All that said, please take note that this isn’t intended to be a huge rewrite of the plot of either game. I’m taking elements from both Houses and Hopes and fitting them together into a more integrated narrative, but I’m doing very minimal invention in the writing. For those looking for bigger rewrites to game systems and narratives, I highly recommend the work of u/OrzhovMarkhov. 

In this Alternate Universe, Byleth is the game’s player unit, but Shez appears and remains a major rival and obstacle in every route, representing a secondary support network for one of the three lords who will be opposition to you regardless, and giving all three nations a different flavor in every route. While Byleth’s position as a mentor can often be the most beneficial, Shez’s support as a colleague in arms or even subordinate can also meet many of those same needs, even as Arval’s urgings ensure that conflict is inevitable to some extent. 

This game is based on the value of human connection, but humans are different, and those results will change.

**Shared White Clouds**  
The biggest change here is reintegrating an older idea of mine. In this version, Byleth is not named professor of a single house, but instead will be given choices as a new Weapons Instructor (replacing Jeritza) about which house they want to use. Sometimes, these are pre-established missions that will always happen regardless of Byleth’s presence, though often will go worse without Byleth or Shez’s assistance, and sometimes these are missions where Rhea’s obsession with Byleth shines through and a specific house is forced to come along or Byleth can choose a trusted group.

Our biggest objective here is to both make replaying White Clouds a benefit mechanically and narratively while also allowing it to be skippable for those who want to do so. Like Fates, you can technically play White Clouds exactly one time and then you can play NG+ from the ""Crossroads Moment"" that will be described below. Unlike Fates, there’s a lot more variability and story you miss out on if you do that, as well as a lot of lost opportunities to train and shape students into the type of units you want. Skipping White Clouds will mean missing alternate missions and training opportunities for the separate houses, though it remains an option.

In terms of Byleth and Shez, this is also to allow for more reasons why everyone is drawn to and has affection for them. War will cause a crossing of blades, but it won’t be as awkward when people you never taught and barely talked to still treat you like their own professor. Byleth taught all of them for some length of time. Shez has fought alongside all of them at one point or another. The bonds always exist, though war will weaken them.

**Silver Snow+Cindered Shadows**  
Without going too much into it, I'm untethering Silver Snow from the Black Eagles route and making it a separate thing by way of combining it with Cindered Shadows and the Ashen Wolves among others. In the hypothetical ""real world"" of this write-up, basically imagine that the game would release with three main routes for each of the three houses, and then Silver Snow releases as a completely separate DLC route that hopefully gives it more to shine alone on.

**Recruitment**  
Recruitment is significantly more limited than in normal Houses, with much more exclusion between the routes. However, if you liked a cross-house support in either game, please note that it *will* be possible in one of the routes. Sometimes, however, it’s only possible in one house’s specific route and recruitment does not cut both ways.

Due to a new version of White Clouds here, pre-timeskip recruitment is pretty much gone. Instead, this write-up has an assumption of an expanded Mission Assistance program, where you can recruit a few more units in certain missions and build up their supports and even their stats. However, it should be noted that every Mission has a smaller selection of available Support units, you can’t get anyone for every mission.

Post-Timeskip, recruitment will be based on a mix of past supports and mission-relevant side-objectives similar to Hopes's approach. As an example, Petra cannot be recruited in any route unless she has a C support with Byleth or the relevant Lord, and you also have to fulfill a side-objective to force her to submit, as she's afraid of consequences for Brigid if she defects.

**Paralogues**   
Paralogues in general have been pared down to a smaller number as a hypothetical compromise for a more full and varied set of maps in every main narrative. Most Paralogues are multi-unit paralogues, where you will need a certain number of those units in order to play the Paralogue.

Pre-timeskip Paralogues are **required for recruitment**, if you don’t play them for those characters, you will be unable to recruit or use the characters involved who were not in your eventual chosen house. This means that most pre-timeskip paralogues are actually cross-house paralogues similar to Dorothea+Ingrid's and Mercedes+Caspar's. 

Post-timeskip Paralogues are more extra challenges for character and world-building with benefits of new weapons, units, and abilities.

I'll discuss the relevant paralogues in each of the Part 2 posts that follow this one.

All that said, let's get started on the Real Deal:

# White Clouds over Blackened Embers

***Prologue: An Unexpected Encounter*** – Byleth has some dreams, including one with a one-on-one tutorial battle against a mysterious purple-haired warrior, then wakes up for a talk with Jeralt, and gets roped into rescuing some noble brats from Kostas and his bandits. However, as the battle goes on, things get complicated as Shez shows up as a Green Unit, lost and stumbling into the battle. In the cutscenes that follow, Shez makes clear their dislike of Byleth, but more importantly *slays Kostas* and so is also forcibly recruited by Alois. Upon arrival at Garreg Mach, Byleth is named Weapons Instructor to replace the now promoted Jeritza and Shez is offered a contract as a Knight of Seiros for the remainder of the year and a chance to join any missions or lectures or training as they like.

***Chapter 1: Eagle, Lion, and Deer*** – *House Choice* mission. Mock Battle, you choose which House you’re going to lead. Shez will stumble into the mission after you have defeated one of the opposing Houses’ professors. Shez will join the remaining House and is a powerful mini-boss to challenge Byleth and the player more, a wake-up call for those unaware who play Classic about how bad things can get. 

* **(SS/DLC Unique) Chapter 1: The Fourth House** - Instead of leading the Mock Battle, Byleth is charged with tracking down a missing Shez. As a result, they stumble upon Abyss alongside the three Lords and end up in a “mock battle” with the Ashen Wolves and Shez (who manages to stumble down here into this battle as well). You play alongside Dimitri, Claude, and Edelgard and that is your entire squad.

***Chapter 2 Three Houses*** - Our first mission where Byleth can choose which house they want to join the mission of. All missions canonically happen for this type of mission, but they go slightly worse without Byleth present, and it shapes the characters in different ways.

* **(GD Unique) Chapter 2: Dividing the World** – The Alliance forces are summoned to deal with a large Almyran border invasion, sort of a story-relevant version of Hilda's paralogue, with the Deer being accompanied by Cyril and Shamir, as well as Holst being a green unit. Shahid is revealed and we get the first hints of Claude's true identity, as well as the first demonstration of Relic power with Hilda unleashing Freikuegel against Almyran soldiers.
* **(BL Unique) Chapter 2: Mutiny in the Mist** – As per canon, Lonato raises his flag in rebellion against the Central Church, but is ultimately put down with prejudice by Catherine, who clearly demonstrates the power of the Heroes' Relics and the influence of the Church. This is devastating for Ashe, and Dimitri mourns that the weakness of his uncle's regency is once more on display.
* **(BE Unique) Chapter 2: Following the Scent** – With Kostas's gang not being entirely caught, the Church agrees to Edelgard's request to continue pursuit with Jeritza's help, resulting in the discovery of a strange fortress and the rescue of the real Monica. Unlike in Three Hopes, Solon wasn't stupid enough to expose himself to her, meaning she's unable to identify who kidnapped her, and is allowed to join this year's class until graduation while investigations are ongoing. Jeritza will unleash the power of the Rafail Gem during this mission.
* **(SS/DLC Unique) Chapter 2: What Lies Beneath** - After the previous mock battle, a messenger from Yuri reaches out to Rhea and the Church and requests aid against a number of mysterious forces that are attacking the lower levels of Abyss. Byleth can choose to assist in this force alongside the Knights and Jeralt.

***Chapter 3: Goddess's Rite of Rebirth*** – *Required Deer Mission.* After hearing about the details of Lonato’s supposed assassination plans, Claude and the Deer rope Byleth into their own investigation. Their intuition turns out to be correct as an attack on the Holy Mausoleum takes place and Byleth gets the Sword of the Creator. VW scene of Claude acting suspiciously regarding Byleth getting the Sword of the Creator plays in order to cast doubt on him.

***Chapter 4: Tower of Black Winds*** – *Required Lions Mission*. The Blue Lions are forced to return to Faerghus once again in order to deal with Sylvain's disowned brother and his theft of the Lance of Ruin at the Tower alongside Ser ""Gilbert"", only to discover the horrors that the Heroes' Relics are truly capable of and ensure the trauma of yet another Blue Lion, though in a key twist: Byleth's intervention allows them to capture a living Miklan after his transformation subsides (he dies if Byleth did not come), with Dimitri ordering him imprisoned until an appropriate trial of justice is able to be conducted. New questions are asked about the nature of the Relics and the Church’s teachings about them.

***Chapter 5: Rumors of a Reaper*** – *Required Eagles Mission*. Flayn goes missing and has to be rescued as per canon. The whole monastery is investigating, but Edelgard and Hubert think that they’ve uncovered something. Edelgard always disappears in this mission. Since Monica is already present, no Kronya infiltration... through Monica, anyway.

***Chapter 6: Field of the Eagle and Lion*** – *Choice Mission*. Standard mock battle for the later reflective irony. A chance to decompress supposedly, but the stress is mounting. Byleth chooses a House to support in the Battle of the Eagle and Lion. To balance them out, Shez will rejoin the house they fought with during the original Mock Battle and will be a very dangerous unit to deal with.

* **(SS/DLC Unique) Chapter 6: The Rite of Rising** - Aelfric calls upon the aid of Jeralt and, if available, Byleth. Information has been gathered that indicates that the past mercenary forces were searching for the Chalice of Beginnings. Byleth, the Wolves, and select forces go to the canyons beneath Garreg Mach to find the Chalice and turn it over to the Church. *This mission automatically forces you to play Danger in the Dark next chapter.* 

***Chapter 7 (Unique)*** - *Choice Mission*. This is a different situation. Whichever House Byleth chooses to follow will be the one that ends up encountering Solon. Lesser versions of similar events still happen in the other nations, but Solon is specifically looking to confront Byleth.

* **(GD Unique) Chapter 7: Darkness Attacks** – Ordelia Territory burns instead of Remire as Solon returns to the scene of his greatest crime, revealing his false Tomas guise and driving the people into madness and chaos and forcing the Golden Deer and Church to respond against Solon and attempt to contain the damage, with Lysithea ultimately revealing her tragic backstory to the Golden Deer significantly earlier as a result.
* **(BL Unique) Chapter 7: War for the Weak** – Dedue receives a missive that there is an uprising among the Duscuri against Count Kleimann, and the Lions rally to put down the rebellion as bloodlessly as possible, especially as Kleimann is making strange claims about their behavior that make no sense. In addition to sparing the Duscur rebels where possible, Solon is revealed here, having taken advantage of Kleiman’s hatreds to spread his maddening poisons, including sending a few of the now crazed civilians loose against the Blue Lions.
* **(BE Unique) Chapter 7: Flames in the Darkness** – The Black Eagles return to Remire Village only to discover that the Death Knight is there with a mysterious Solon figure who has driven the whole village mad. Upon defeating the townsfolk and the mysterious interlopers, the Flame Emperor appears again to plead their case to Byleth.
* **(SS/DLC Unique) Chapter 7: Danger in the Dark** - Having grabbed the Chalice of Beginnings, the Abyss Team is forced to flee for their lives against living automatons and the arrival of mysterious soldiers that turn out to be led by Solon who are trying to ambush them and take the Chalice for themselves. Eventually, Byleth and the others are able to escape and give Rhea the Chalice, as Aelfric watches on…

***Chapter 8: The Cause of Sorrow*** – *Required Eagles Mission*. As a follow up to the Solon atrocity, people are shocked as Monsters are unleashed in the Monastery, being students transformed by crests. Kronya appears under the guise of an unnamed student and assassinates Jeralt as punishment for him interfering in her planned body-snatching of Monica back in Chapter 2.

***Chapter 9: Where the Goddess Dwells*** –*Required Deer Mission*. Kronya is slain in revenge by Byleth and Leonie, and though Byleth is trapped by Solon, they are able to fuse with Sothis and escape from Zaharas. However, the Deer are more focused on trying to ensure Byleth is OK, giving enough time that even though they are eventually able to surround and kill Solon, Myson, who is also there, is able to escape.

***Chapter 10 Unique Based on House Choice***

* **(GD Unique) Chapter 10: What Makes a King** – Just after the Deer have seemingly defeated the TWSITD forces, Claude is called back once more to deal with Shahid and the Almyrans. Nader defects along with many of his forces and Shahid is killed. Byleth can tell this is affecting him greatly and reaches out to support him as Claude supported them after Jeralt's death, which Claude greatly appreciates. Still, it's noted that he spends more time alone and is less talkative than before by other students in the aftermath of this mission.
* **(BL Unique) Chapter 10: Crisis in Fhirdiad** - The repeated interference of the Church, plus Dimitri intervening on behalf of the Duscur people, in the Kingdom leads Rufus (under Cornelia's influence) to align with the Western Church remnants and attempt to seize power, forcing the Blue Lions to return to the capital at the head of an army and put an end to the regency by force of arms. In this mission, specifically due to Byleth's presence and input, Dimitri learns the truth of the Tragedy of Duscur from his uncle pre-execution, shifting the focus of his vengeance from the canonical Edelgard instead to Cornelia first and foremost, which has tremendous effects.
* **(BE Unique) Chapter 10: Shadows of Adrestia** – Edelgard parleys with the Church Leadership in order to secure support for a campaign against Lord Arundel using the complete confirmation of Tomas/Solon's nature and Rhea's favoritism towards Byleth to her advantage. With Church support, Edelgard and some of the Black Eagles march towards Enbarr, launching a coup that forces Lord Arundel into exile and claiming Enbarr and the Empire for Edelgard with the full approval of the Central Church and Byleth for her coronation, including the approved revival of the Southern Church, which will radically reshape the war to come.

***Chapter 11: Throne of Knowledge*** – *Required Blue Lions Mission*. Rhea attempts to revive Sothis, but the Flame Emperor attacks and attempts to seize the Crest Stones of the Mausoleum. Edelgard is revealed and every player gets to see Dimitri’s breakdown regarding Twisted Jokes and all the implications therein. 

***Chapter 12 Unique***

* **(GD Unique) Chapter 12: Beyond Escape** – Claude refuses to side with either Rhea or Edelgard and attempts to flee with the Deer, but his forces are caught in the crossfire with both groups. In particular, Shez leads the Lions and Church forces under their control against Byleth and acts as a major Mid-Boss for Byleth specifically, with that duel being what ultimately puts Byleth into the Five Year Coma thanks to Arval's help.
* **(BL Unique) Chapter 12: To War** – The Blue Lions fight to defend Garreg Mach against the oncoming Imperial threat and evacuate the Central Church leadership, but have to deal with the Empire's concentrated assault and the Alliance forces fleeing the battlefield in ways that hurt their defensive fortifications. During the attack, Byleth will come face to face with Shez under Edelgard's command, who now speaks with Arval's voice, who will be able to see through the Divine Pulse and ""kill"" Byleth, forcing them into hibernation for five years.
* **(BE Unique) Chapter 12: The Struggle Commences** – Adrestia invades to claim Garreg Mach, ultimately succeeding, but failing to capture Rhea and losing Byleth in all the chaos. This is bad. During the attack, Byleth will come face to face with Shez seemingly under Claude's command despite the Deer having retreated, who now speaks with Arval's voice, and who will be able to see through the Divine Pulse and ""kill"" Byleth, forcing them into hibernation for five years and causing deep suspicion on Edelgard's part towards Claude and the Alliance.
* **(SS/DLC Unique) Chapter 12: Betrayal** - Even with the dawn of war, Byleth chooses to focus on protecting Rhea and the Cardinals personally. As the Imperial Army approaches, suddenly it is discovered that Aelfric has been “abducted” by Metodey, who is demanding the Chalice of Beginnings. While Byleth and a playable Rhea will succeed in defeating Metodey, Aelfric will reveal his betrayal alongside a new ally: an Arval-possessed Shez, who will force Byleth into hibernation after a cannot-win fight.

And AI is only going to get better with the release of CHATGPT 5. So my question is what does a teacher bring to the table that an AI can't because nowadays AI can explain concepts in a much easier way than most of my teachers.This is not a post disrespecting teacher. I will never do such a thing. I am just genuinely curious so please don't take offence.
1f6s9sf,2,2024-09-01,Struggling with College Choices and Anxiety: Seeking Advice,u/Fluffy_Initiative_88,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1f6s9sf/struggling_with_college_choices_and_anxiety/,"Hi I'm a 19 year old male from south Africa, kzn, Durban.
I've tried posting here several times but get too overwhelmed to finish. I now have used chatgpt to make it easy on me but its not still as clear. I hope sharing my story can help me find some guidance on what I'm going through.


I've struggled with learning difficulties for most of my life, which have been compounded by trauma from my experiences with educators. From primary school through high school, I've been told I'm stupid for not understanding things right away. I often grasp concepts better when I work through them independently and at my own pace.My learning challenges started as early as grade 2 when I had a teacher who would make her students suffer by not letting us go to the bathroom, then brutally berating us if we wet ourselves and give way too much homework it would be impossible to finish. 

This teacher sometimes wouldn't teach math for an entire week, so we were behind. When another math teacher found out, she tried to force us to catch up quickly, leading to more punishment and stress she would punish us for not knowing something we haven't learned. This cycle made me feel like I was constantly trying to avoid punishment rather than actually learning.By grade 3, I convinced my mom to let me change schools to another public school. But I was so far behind that I spent break times and after school doing extra work just to catch up. 

These experiences left me with deep-rooted trauma and anxiety that have followed me into adulthood. I realized early on that I was doing things just to avoid being punished or yelled at, and by grade 7, it felt like I was breaking down. I found it incredibly hard to ask for help, and I often felt like a mess that is when i started be punished again verbally and physically it was so mentally draining and most days i would pretend to be skin to skip school this went on till grade 10 and grade 11 i had panic attacks almost every day In class or at home. And my last year of school last year I was just trying my best to act like school was normal for me and I was able to get a decent bachelor's pass but no A just b's and c's and one low grade.

I decided to take a gap year to figure things out, but I still feel lost. I recently applied for a diploma in commercial law (Diploma in Management Science: Business Law) because it seemed like it might be easier and less demanding. I got accepted way faster than I expected—within just a few days. I also got accepted into a BCom in Entrepreneurship, which I chose as a backup option. I applied to four courses in total, mostly choosing those with fewer requirements because I thought they'd be easier for me.The problem is, I'm not sure if I chose these courses because they're what I truly want or because they felt like the safest options. I wanted to do a Bachelor's in Law, but the only universities I qualify for are far from home—three hours away or even in another province. Being far from home makes me anxious, and I feel safer staying closer to the area my sister studied in, which is about 50 minutes away next to the beach the apartment i was looking at is a cheap studio apartment looking straight to the beach as it's one of my happiest places.

Lately, I've been having panic attacks every night, trying to convince myself that commercial law is ""good enough."" I keep telling myself that the modules look manageable and that I'll be able to get good grades. But deep down, I'm still unsure if this is what I want. For the first time, I'm seriously considering medication for my anxiety because it's affecting my ability to think clearly.My parents know I have anxiety, but they've never taken me to see a doctor about it they would probably pray for me if i told them what kind of thoughts i have had in the past 3 years and they never looked into schools that might have better supported my learning difficulties. I feel like a lot of my trauma stems from their inaction too."

I'm now a final-year CS student and bought an Orange Pi 5 last year to test out self-hosting, learn and still have an SBC to play around with if needed and maybe learn about arm. Needless to say, it will remain as a server until I can upgrade my homelab when I move out.   
  
I wasn't exactly sure what I wanted to do after my studies, but this sub definitely guided me, and I'm now searching for an internship related like DevOps/SRE/Linux sysadmin/...

**Setup:**

* Orange Pi 5 16 GB (running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)
* Old laptop's 512 GB M.2 SSD
* External 1 TB HDD
* External 2x1 TB M.2 enclosure

**What I host:**

* **Nginx:** Reverse proxy with TLS encryption for all my services
* **Dashy:** Dashboard
* **Ghost:** Plan to write some blog articles about my setup (vscode, terminal) but haven't had much time
* **MOA (SearXNG fork):** My daily search engine
* **Pi-hole:** Ad (and more) blocking + privacy + DNSSEC + rapid dns testing
   * **Unbound** (recursive DNS): Primary DNS
   * **Cloudflared DoH:** Secondary DNS
   * **Quad9 DoH:** Last resort DNS
* **Nextcloud:** Cloud provider like one drive, easy media sharing, and family folders backups
* **Kopia:** Automated backups of the most important stuff
* **Minio:** S3 compatible cloud storage to store the backups
* **Ollama:** Just for fun, but haven't managed to run it on the NPU/GPU so it's hella slow
* **Media server:** Netflix doesn't allow our TV anymore and I keep the property of my content
   * **Jellyfin:** Hardware accelerated media server for watching content
   * **Ombi:** Allows media requests for my family in their preferred language (VO or translated), which are then automatically processed by the arr stack
   * **Sonarr/Radarr:** Monitor TV series (and anime)/movies respectively
   * **Bazarr:** Manages subtitles
   * **Prowlarr:** Finds torrents automatically
   * **qBittorrent:** Downloads torrents
   * Alternatrr: Manually add alternative (translated) sonarrr titles if needed
* **Portainer:** Simplifies container management (mainly reading logs ngl)
* **Uptime Kuma:** Monitors service uptime and get alerted if there is an issue (+a friend also monitors my Uptime Kuma in case it/the server goes down))
* **Glances:** Provides monitoring widgets for the dashboard
* **Wireguard:** Not on the dashboard since it's currently running in bare metal (everything else is dockered), but I'm planning to find a web UI to manage it. I just haven't managed to get Headscale to work yet. I use it as an always on vpn for my laptop & phone to use my own DNS servers everywhere and be able to use public wifi's safely.

It might not be the most secure, performant, or reliable homelab, but I've learned a lot from it. It's incredibly useful for me every day, and most importantly I've really enjoyed the journey."

Hello everyone! I've benefitted greatly from the WGU reddit over the last 15 months. Quite frankly, it's the only reason I still use reddit.

Now I'd like to give back.   
The formatting on this writeup may be a bit wonky (I'm not good at this stuff on reddit), but here is everything I used! 

Below are the exact steps I took from beginning to end in Mobile App Development using C#.

This is the last course I had prior to my capstone. Between Software 1, Software 2, and TONS of supplementary DSA Work (mostly neetcode pro's beginner course), I felt very confident in my ability to write c# and design my application. I'm very comfortable with C# (and have prior projects to look back on if I need some ideas/inspiration). Anyway, all of this to say, I did not interact with the course material prior to starting my Project. You may feel the need to, and that is ok! but I cannot help you there as I did not interact with the course material.

1. Preparation

a. create personal outline of Task 2:

    - For me, this means going through the task with a fine-tooth comb and writing down exactly what I need. I highly reccomend writing it out yourself. I do this for my own memory/brain, but it gives me one less tab in my browser to keep referring back to. 

b. What is .NET Maui? - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmLQLSKqvvI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmLQLSKqvvI)

    -Not a necessary watch, but this helped me frame what I would have to do for this project. 

-TL;DR you are writing c# with extra bells and whistles added to make it work on mobile, including XAML for formatting

c. resource collection:

    -I will link them in the relevant sections below as well, but these are all the resources I and many others have used for this course:
    
    -These 2 reddit posts:

    	-I tried a few different things, but the one that worked was installing android studio. [https://developer.android.com/studio/install](https://developer.android.com/studio/install)
    
    		-I cannot tell you why it worked. All I know is that once I installed android studio, the android emulator in visual studio started working, and before it crashed.
    
    		-One other thing, if you play league of legends or valorant (kekw), disable your Vanguard for this. It can mess with the emulator. Also, I'm sorry you play league (I have 10k+ hours on that game).

d. Preliminary email:

    -Whoever your CI is (shoutout Harlan and Lauren), email them and ask if you can use the MVVM toolkit. There should be no issue with it, but in the event you submit your project and it gets returned by
    
    an evaluator because you used mvvm toolkit, written permission from your ci is your ticket to freedom. 
    
    	-to clarify, I have yet to see someone get told that they are not allowed to use the toolkit. I have seen plenty of anecdotes claiming their project was returned for using it and they later
    
    	got approval to use it.

e. OPTIONAL learning:

    -If you'd like to, you can choose to go through James's course in its entirety right now: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oUBAdL2NwBpDs32zwGqb9DY](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oUBAdL2NwBpDs32zwGqb9DY)
    
    	-I personally chose not to. There are a couple reasons for this:
    
    	-I got to double up my figma time (making my wireframe) with watching some about-X videos on .net maui, mvvm, etc. 
    
    	-When you finish this course, you will WANT to code asap. Keep that momentum!
    
    	-If you have any questions/concerns on your wireframe, and you finish it after watching the course, you are at the mercy of how busy your CI is. 

2. Part A: Gitlab

a. Quite literally, follow the word document provided. See b. for any problems that may arise.

b. Problems FAQ (all the problems I encountered, atleast)

    -Q: what if I cannot see the student repos? 
    
    >A: Follow the steps to create your own repo, and then give it a few minutes. I had to wait a smidge and then refresh the tab but eventually it showed up.
    
    
    
    -Q: What if I cannot clone the repo to my visual studio?
    
    >A: Make sure you are using visual studio 2022, and that it is up to date. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37813568/git-remote-repository-not-found follow Mukesh Salaria's response (it worked for me)
      -other answers on this thread may be of use
    
    
    
    -Q: I took version control so long ago! I do not remember how to do any of this:
    
    >A: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/add-file.html#add-a-file-using-the-command-line and https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/start-using-git.html#send-changes-to-gitlabcom
    
    
    
    -Q: What is all this hubbub with ssh and https keys?
    
    >A: For this, you don't need to worry about it, but I strongly reccomend not getting in the habit of using Git services without a key :)
    
    
    
    -Q: I have folders with spaces in the name, what do I do?
    
    >A: Wrap the name of the folder/file in quotation marks (some reccomend single quotes, but double quotes worked for me). Alternatively, type ""git add "" and then hit tab until the auto-fill puts in the folder name for you \^\_\^
    
    
    
    -Q: My CLI is telling me I cannot add any files
    
    >A: Make sure VS2022 is saved and closed. You cannot add or push with vs2022 open. 
    
    >A2: If you closed it and there are still problems, email your CI.

c. I did a test commit here to ensure I was doing everything correctly.

3. Part B. Wireframe

General Reccomendations/notes:

    -Get your emulator functioning in vs2022 prior to starting this. That way, if you need to troubleshoot or wait on an email reply, you can work on your wireframe while you wait.
    
    -Use the wgu mobile app and a browser page for some inspiration regarding layout and organization. 
    
    -For my wireframe, I used figma. The medium you use to create the wireframe isnt too important.
    
    -While designing your wireframe, I highly reccomend making the 'plain view' of each app section, then copy/pasting that 'plain view' as many times as necessary, then adding app functionality demonstrations to said copies. 
    
    This will save you a ton of time.
    
    -Any time the rubric mentions ""Addition, Editing, Deletion, and Storage of..."", what they mean is your wireframe must 
    
    explicitly show that users can add/edit/delete/store those things. 
    
    	-More speficially, for the picker, use a specific design style to make it stand out. Use a bell for notifications,
    
    	- use underlined, blue colored text for 'links', use a calendar image for date pickers, etc. 
    
    -Lastly, the specific functional details must also be demonstrated with the wireframe
    
    	-e.g. show what the ""remove term"", ""Add term"", datePickers, etc. all look like in action (draw out the box itself), and add arrows from the UI element to the box/picker.

1. ADD YOUR TERMS: 
   1. The evaluators are looking for something that shows the ability to navigate between all X terms. I personally put in 6 terms, but displayed it using one term, and had it highlighted with a ""currently viewing"" label as well.-start times can be what you like, just remember a term at wgu is 6 months :)
2. Add 6 courses per term:
   1. This one confused me at first. I had to email a CI for clarity. We are fine to just show 6 courses in a given term (we do not have to display 6 courses for EACH term we added in part 1).-The ""detailed view of each course"" and ""editing of detailed course view screen"" just means they want the explicit details/examples.-We still must explicitly show details as I said above. In this section, that means demonstrate the functionality of: -date picker for start/end times, picker for course status, add/sharing/displaying notes, and setting notifications
3. Add Two assessments for each course.
   1. As far as I know, there need not be an option to change the name of the assessments (why let a student change that stuff?)-So, really this section is just adding the OA/PA sections and notification functionality.

Other notes:

    -I made a folder for ""part B"" and then made ""part 1"", ""part 2"", and ""part 3"" folders, placing screenshots of my figma wireframes in each as necessary. 
    
    -I would add all for part 1, push it to my gitlab with a commit message ""added part x"", and then move on to the next part. 
    
    -You can always go back and update when feedback comes through, but creating a easy to follow trail of initial commits will make it much easier for the evaluators to see. 

C. App Creation

-Since I took on the role of guinea pig for this writeup, I tried a lot of different things. Below I will share what I specifically did, followed but what I reccomend doing instead:

    -I watched james' 4 hour guide, got super confused at the 2 hour mark, and pivoted to his 8part ""beginner"" .net maui series: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oUBAdL2NwBpDs32zwGqb9DY](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oUBAdL2NwBpDs32zwGqb9DY)
    
    	-Specifically, 3, 4, and 5 were very helpful. 
    
    -I then got confused AGAIN and stumbled upon these two videos from coding droplets:
    
    	-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VziMUc-VQko&t=493s (starting your project and adding sqlite integration)
    
    	-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G\_vktKfMU20&t=125s (page navigation)
    
    -From there, it was small bits and pieces of googling or asking chat gpt for help, but quite frankly EVERYTHING you need (with exception to whatever xaml style you want to add) is in the two coding droplets videos.

-If I had to do it again, I would start with the coding droplets videos, and follow along to grasp the content, then start my project.

    -I  also reccomend ensuring you can get the emulator working ASAP and troubleshooting if need be.

-Many folks on this sub shared success with James' 4 hour course, and that is great. Personally, all the extra stuff with mvvm toolkit and boiler plate code generation is beyond me. I did what was necessary for the class, and now I write this focusing on my capstone and am diving in to all things ASP.NET. Baby steps, people.

    -If you want to work with .net maui or further your understanding, then I highly reccomend watching Coding Droplets videos to get the basics,  then pivoting to James' full 8 part course playlist, THEN his 4 hour beginner guide. 

-Again, This app is not hard to make, and does not require the MVVM toolkit nor the extra page navigations that James refers to. There maybe half as much work in this project as software 2 for c#. Software I took me 40ish hours of coding, Software II took me about 80ish hours of coding.

    This project took me somewhere in the realm of 40 hours, but half of that was getting the emulator to work, finding the right nuget packages, or emailing my CI/professor about the issues I was having (and how there was no documented fixes for them yet).

Now for all the specifics of section C. I do not want to give answers away, so I will share what I did and what resources that helped me along the way, but no code :)

GENERAL ADVICE:

    -Any Button placed near the bottom of the app screen when you load the app WILL NOT FIRE. Design accordingly.
    
    -Stackoverflow, Google, and ChatGPT are your friends.
    
    -For XAML formatting, I relied heavily on horizontal and vertical stack layouts. If you want 3 buttons side-by-side, use a horizontal layout. If you want a list of items formatted the same way, use a vertical stack layout.
    
    -DONT FORGET TO PUSH TO GITLAB WITH EVERY SECTION YOU FINISH :)
    
    -Dont forget to add builder services for every new content page you add. I lost a lot of time on this, more than I'd like to admit. 

C1 -> The first coding droplets video will give you everything you need here. You will have to reformat a few things I reccomend using different terms for your project of course. I drew on my experiences with Software 1 + 2 here.

C2 -> This one was tricky, but everything you need is in the first or second coding droplets videos. You will need to figure out how you want to organize the relationship between terms and courses both in the app and within your classes/code, not to mention how you want to display them to the viewer.

    -I pulled a lot from my experience desiging classes for Software 1 and Software 2. Think Big picture. What objects do you NEED to pass in, what is the flow of your program? etc.
    
    -I got held up for awhile on preventing the user from adding more than 6 courses per term. Pay attention to how coding droplets handles async functions, especially when a new page is initialized.

C3 -> I got held up on this one due to page refreshing. I would add a course to a term, but that new course would not show up until I went back and loaded the term page again.

    -I fixed it with this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctLORcVaVB4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctLORcVaVB4)

-> I ran into more problems trying to implement the update function. Took me 2 hours to figure out that I was missing the primary key in my method call to update a course. Do not be like me, use primary keys.

-> For delete functionality, I didn't do any sort of convoluted cascade deletion. I just deleted the term and it took care of any corresponding courses.

    -For courses, I also just deleted them :)

C4/C5 -> Most of these sections are about adding components to existing functionality (with the exception to sharing and notifcations). For me it was, atleast. I added to what I used to add terms in order to input the rest of the OA data into my tables / display.

    	-This was the only piece in my github repo that I pushed together (made note of it in my commit message). You won't get docked for pushing 2 of them together, but you will for not noting WHERE you pushed it to the git repo.

-> VERY IMPORTTANT: THE NEWEST VERSION OF PLUGIN.LOCALNOTIFICATIONS WILL NOT COMPILE AND WILL FAIL BUILDS EVERY TIME. TO FIX THIS, ROLL BACK TO VERSION 11.1.0

    -For notifications, watch this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWdXXGa1\_hI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWdXXGa1_hI)

-> SHARING: Personally, I just used this: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/platform-integration/data/share?view=net-maui-8.0&tabs=android](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/platform-integration/data/share?view=net-maui-8.0&tabs=android)

    -The explanation in the submission rubric is confusing because they make it sound like you have to get another nuget package but YOU LITERALLY DONT.

C6 -> Very straightforward part. No explanation needed here, just remember to clear your existing db first.

D1 -> This part took me a couple hours, because I dreamed REALLY BIG on my wireframe. Nothing wrong with that, but I needed to provide more explanation.

    - This is a good time to re-evaluate your wireframe and make any small changes necessary to match the requirements. Doing this saved me 1-2 revisions because I caught a couple of mistakes, personally.
    
    - I personally compiled a word doc and pasted all of my screenshots of my wireframe (I made mine with figma, and used windows+shift+S to grap pictures of each required component of the wireframe) into said doc, adding notes underneath each.

D2 -> This part was so easy it almost need not exist. It's effectively a written signature from you (the developer) that any differences between your project and your submitted wireframe are acknowledged and accounted for.

E -> You are not submitting a zip folder for your task. All you are doing is submitting 2 gitlab links. I made the mistake of trying to zip my whole project folder and submit it (it was too big lol), make changes to resize it, then resubmitted said zip folder, all for it to be returned anyway.

    Do not be like me, follow instructions the first time. I only had my submission returned because of this failure on my end. Passed my next submission after I learned to submit links instead of a giant folder :)
    
    - 1 link is to your git repo
    
    - The other is to your git repo history page"
1f7ejvo,54,2024-09-02,How to get ahead of 99% of students,u/Outside_Change_1692,OntarioGrade12s,https://www.reddit.com/r/OntarioGrade12s/comments/1f7ejvo/how_to_get_ahead_of_99_of_students/,"School starts later this week, here’s how you are going to get ahead of everyone during this time

The best students use this time to get prepared for the year to come,

so that they can have some experience and come to the first day with some knowledge  


**1. Don’t LEARN Any New Material Before Class**

This probably isn’t something you’ve heard before, but here’s why not learning the material before class is so important for two reasons:

* **You Might Forget It:** You could spend hours studying, only to forget most of it by the time the class actually covers the material

* **You Might Learn It Wrong:** Worse, you could teach yourself the wrong information, which is harder to unlearn and correct once classes start.

I made this mistake going into grade 11 😭

I tried to get ahead by self-studying.

But when I got to class, I misunderstood key concepts, and had to relearn everything. 

Trust me, you don’t want to be in that situation.

Instead what you SHOULD do is review previous/prerequisite class material’s instead.

*For example: Your going to take grade 12 physics, reviewing grade 11 units/concepts* 

**2. Make Studying a GAME**

The only way to actually get good grades is through studying.

There’s no bypassing that.

But what you should do is make it very FRICTIONLESS when you study.

AKA. Making it as easy as possible to get started.

This could mean having a clean/tidy room.

And having all the proper materials (notebooks, pencils, calc, etc.) by your side, so that all you have to do is start studying.

*AKA. Making it as easy as possible to get started.*

This could mean having a clean/tidy room.

And having all the proper materials (notebooks, pencils, calc, etc.) by your side, so that all you have to do is start studying.

I’d also say that making sure you have all the right tools ready, for when you need help on problems.

Things like Lazersolver, gpt, photomath, will literally do it in seconds and show you HOW. 

This is one of the most effective ways to learn, since a lot of the times these apps/websites actually give breakdowns of the answer and you can even go ask it questions if you’re still unsure.

The only thing about this is that a lot of the time, extra steps are put behind a pay-wall. Or in chatGPT’s case, it really just isn’t that good at math (in terms of calculating/accurate numbers).

I mostly just use either lazersolver’s ai tool whenever I don’t get a question or if it’s a textbook related homework problem something like coursehero or chegg. Although the site is still in beta (beta version: [https://forms.gle/xqnwk1s2VrkTb4x6A](https://forms.gle/xqnwk1s2VrkTb4x6A) )

Another major thing in this part, would be removing distractions like your phone.

I personally don’t even keep my phone in the same room as me.

For those who start there last year of highschool (me included) good to you all : ) <3"
1f7foa6,1,2024-09-02,Powerful Artificial Intelligence ChatGPT,u/MdAshikurRahman,u_MdAshikurRahman,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MdAshikurRahman/comments/1f7foa6/powerful_artificial_intelligence_chatgpt/,"[Photo: ChatGPT](https://preview.redd.it/2drwoky67gmd1.jpg?width=598&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=68590b132559e4fca3fc46fd75396eb9b386acb3)

In recent years, artificial intelligence has made significant strides in various domains, with one of the most fascinating advancements being in natural language processing (NLP). Among the most prominent tools that have emerged in this domain is ChatGPT, an AI-powered language model developed by OpenAI. This article explores the evolution, technology, applications, benefits, and limitations of ChatGPT, offering a comprehensive understanding of how it works and its potential impact on our world.

Understanding ChatGPT: What Is It?

ChatGPT is a large language model based on OpenAI’s GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture. Specifically, it is built on the GPT-4 architecture, which represents one of the latest iterations of this model. The term “GPT” refers to a deep neural network that is trained to generate human-like text based on the input it receives. The model is pre-trained on a vast corpus of text data from diverse sources, allowing it to learn the complexities of human language, including grammar, vocabulary, context, and even some forms of reasoning.

The core functionality of ChatGPT is to engage in meaningful conversations with users, providing answers, suggestions, explanations, or even creative content such as poems and stories. It is designed to understand and generate human-like responses, making it a valuable tool for a wide range of applications, from customer support to content creation.

The Evolution of GPT Models

The journey of ChatGPT began with the introduction of the original GPT model by OpenAI in 2018. The first model, GPT-1, demonstrated the potential of language models to understand and generate text, but it was relatively limited in scale and capability. The subsequent version, GPT-2, released in 2019, was a significant step forward. It featured a much larger model with 1.5 billion parameters, allowing it to generate more coherent and contextually relevant text. However, due to concerns about misuse, OpenAI initially withheld the full version, only releasing it gradually as they evaluated its impact.

The release of GPT-3 in 2020 marked a major breakthrough. With 175 billion parameters, GPT-3 became one of the largest and most powerful language models ever created. It showcased an impressive ability to generate text that was virtually indistinguishable from that written by humans in many contexts. GPT-3 was capable of performing a wide range of tasks, from answering questions to writing essays, translating languages, and even generating code.

ChatGPT, based on the GPT-4 architecture, builds upon this foundation. GPT-4 represents an advancement over its predecessors in several key areas, including improved contextual understanding, greater accuracy, and enhanced ability to handle nuanced conversations. It is trained using even larger datasets and more sophisticated algorithms, enabling it to provide more relevant and insightful responses.

How Does ChatGPT Work?

To understand how ChatGPT works, it’s important to look at the underlying technology: the Transformer architecture. Introduced in a 2017 paper by Vaswani et al., the Transformer model revolutionized NLP by introducing the concept of self-attention mechanisms. These mechanisms allow the model to focus on different parts of the input text when generating a response, enabling it to capture complex patterns and relationships in language.

ChatGPT utilizes this Transformer architecture to process input text and generate responses. During the training phase, the model learns from a vast dataset comprising books, articles, websites, and other textual sources. It is pre-trained in an unsupervised manner, meaning it learns from raw data without specific instructions. This allows it to understand grammar, facts, reasoning, and some level of common sense knowledge.

When a user inputs a prompt, ChatGPT processes the input by converting the words into numerical representations known as tokens. The model then uses its pre-trained knowledge to predict the most likely next token in the sequence, generating a coherent response. This process continues iteratively until the model generates a complete response.

Applications of ChatGPT

ChatGPT has a wide range of applications across various industries and domains. Here are some of the most prominent use cases:

1. Customer Support and Service: Many businesses have integrated ChatGPT into their customer service operations to provide instant responses to common queries, guide users through processes, or troubleshoot issues. This reduces the workload on human agents and improves response times, enhancing customer satisfaction.

2. Content Creation: Content creators, marketers, and writers use ChatGPT to generate ideas, draft articles, write social media posts, or create ad copy. The model can provide inspiration, overcome writer’s block, and help in producing content more efficiently.

3. Education and Learning: ChatGPT is being used as a tutoring tool to help students understand complex subjects, solve problems, and provide explanations in various domains, including mathematics, science, history, and literature. It can offer personalized learning experiences and answer questions in real-time.

4. Programming and Software Development: Developers leverage ChatGPT for coding assistance, debugging, and generating code snippets in multiple programming languages. The model can suggest solutions, explain code functionality, and offer advice on best practices.

5. Healthcare Support: In the healthcare sector, ChatGPT is used to assist in preliminary diagnostics, provide information on medical conditions, and answer patient questions. However, it is essential to note that ChatGPT should not be used as a replacement for professional medical advice.

6. Personal Assistants: ChatGPT can serve as a virtual assistant, helping users with scheduling, reminders, email drafting, and other personal tasks, similar to digital assistants like Siri or Alexa.

Benefits of ChatGPT

The benefits of ChatGPT are numerous, and they are transforming the way businesses and individuals interact with technology:

24/7 Availability: Unlike human employees, ChatGPT is available around the clock, providing continuous support and service without downtime. Scalability: ChatGPT can handle an unlimited number of conversations simultaneously, making it a scalable solution for businesses looking to serve a large customer base.

Cost-Effectiveness: Automating routine and repetitive tasks with ChatGPT can significantly reduce operational costs, allowing businesses to allocate resources more efficiently.

Personalization: ChatGPT can be fine-tuned to cater to specific domains or user needs, offering personalized experiences based on user preferences and historical interactions.

Speed and Efficiency: With its ability to process and generate responses quickly, ChatGPT can significantly reduce wait times and improve user satisfaction.

Limitations and Challenges of ChatGPT

Despite its remarkable capabilities, ChatGPT is not without limitations and challenges:

Lack of Understanding: While ChatGPT can generate coherent and contextually relevant responses, it does not truly “understand” the content. Its outputs are based on patterns and correlations in the data it was trained on, rather than genuine comprehension.

Potential for Misinformation: ChatGPT may produce incorrect or misleading information, especially in areas where its training data is outdated or biased. It can also generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect statements.

Bias in Responses: Since the model is trained on data from the internet, it can inadvertently reflect the biases present in that data. Efforts are being made to reduce these biases, but they cannot be entirely eliminated.

Privacy and Security Concerns: Given that ChatGPT interacts with users and processes potentially sensitive information, there are concerns about data privacy and security. Organizations must implement robust measures to protect user data.

Dependence on Large Datasets: The quality of ChatGPT’s responses is heavily dependent on the data it was trained on. Any gaps or biases in this data can affect the model’s performance.

The Future of ChatGPT and Conversational AI

The future of ChatGPT and similar models is promising. As technology advances, we can expect even more sophisticated versions of AI language models that offer improved accuracy, understanding, and adaptability. Research is ongoing to make these models more transparent, controllable, and aligned with human values.

The development of AI tools like ChatGPT also raises important ethical and regulatory questions. How do we ensure that AI is used responsibly? What frameworks are needed to protect against misuse? As AI becomes more integrated into our daily lives, these questions will require careful consideration by developers, policymakers, and society.

Conclusion: ChatGPT represents a remarkable leap forward in AI and NLP. It has the potential to transform industries, enhance productivity, and create new opportunities across multiple domains. However, it is essential to approach this technology with a balanced perspective, recognizing both its immense potential and its limitations. As we continue to explore the possibilities of AI, tools like ChatGPT will play a pivotal role in shaping our future.

Most did not understand the real reason! And I, as a young researcher, found the reason! Here:
In short, as I understand it. Until you tell me how professional you are in coding, it will only give out the base of the base

Because he does not know your work experience and does not know how to work with you

Even if you told him to write some kind of complex project, he will still give a basic example, because he is not sure if you know exactly how the code works or not. And he is forced to do so.

Well, Gemini specifically found the problem, or rather the problem is ourselves. Google is a company that makes technologies that adapt to us. Right? And there is no doubt that the same story will happen with AI. We do not tell Gemini anything about ourselves, silently about our experience, work experience, etc. So how can we expect some amazing results if he doesn't even know what to do? He can only be a teacher and that's it, because he is not a telepath to read our minds and understand who is who, how old someone is and so on.
People, it's time to understand that Gemini is a completely different model and it has different ""views"" on us.

I feel like if I get a paid internship where I paid them to train me. it would still be fine.

I know basic of node.js, django, and React. I have a full time job on a different field and self teaching myself coding. does anyone have any advice or good practice work?

I guess it would be harder for me to get internship since I am not enrolled in school so companies don’t get tax benefits and stuff to hire me. I done a few small contracts on Upwork, all got 5 star reviews, but I feel like it takes very long to search for jobs and I have to spend connects and time just to ask customer about requirements and understand the requirements clearly, some time even takes longer to understand what the customer wants then to code the project.

I also never worked on projects that have big codebase or work with projects with a team. I live in Canada and Im trying to think what projects I should do to impress a potential employer, to show that I’m willing to learn, and not be a net negative profit as an intern for their company.

I know Python and Javascript. I only made some personal projects that are for personal automation so far, some probably took a lot longer time than what a junior developer could do. I think Im closer to like a 2nd year student, I have some friends in 2nd year and I think my skill is around the same as them currently, maybe 3rd year. They learn a lot of theory and how the computer works in school so they don't code as much me.

Should I make my my own website that have my personal projects and host it on AWS? It's going to cost money for that purpose.

1f7i0mv,57,2024-09-02,"I really want to introduce Obsidian as a very cheap alternative for the students at my campus, but I’m very worried with my method.",u/Super_hot_dumplings,ObsidianMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1f7i0mv/i_really_want_to_introduce_obsidian_as_a_very/,"So I realised that, not only obsidian is packed with so much potentials, amazing plugins that can get rid/serve as substitute with certain subscriptions services (notions, vscode and notes app ; microsoft office, n8n and chatgpt) and your data will never get lost (welp it depends on how you handle it)

1. Obsidian is a student’s bestfriend.

A) Considering most of us are struggling with financial issues and the fact that we are from a third world country, most of the subscriptions price that we need to pay really made it hard for some of us ( especially for students that are pursuing in computer science but had to find cheaper options such as apps or software due to their low-spec laptop ), the built in function + plugins ; really lessen the burden - to my experience - to explain more on this, as a non-coding student, I had a thought on this when I actually had fun after discovering that you can tweak your workspace according to your creativity and innovation. I even managed to learnt some new skills like css, html, js, basic py, x86 assembly language, mermaid syntax and most definitely markdown format. I really am grateful to know this digital treasure and holy crap, an utmost respect to the developers and the community for continuously contributing to the development of the platform. Yall out here actually saving lives ! Back on the ‘cheaper alternative’, more students need to know the capabilities of obsidian and how helpful it is. 

B) Certain plugins made by the communities has crazy high potential, and by that statement, what I’m trying to say is the features that it offers worth crazy amount of value and yet the community decides to offer it as a free and open source tweaks/mods/functions for everyone to use AND contribute. The idea of open source is actually a good culture especially in this digital driven era. I do aware of the controversy of students deciding to rely on LLM chatbot or ai so much that it defeats the sole purpose of studying at the first place,  but some of us are utilising it by not treating it as a shortcut to complete our task but utilising it as an automated system or prompting it as a digital mentor. To elaborate more on the digital mentor part, I believe by building my own knowledge library through note writing everyday, importing our course pdf files or slides into obsidian and treat it as a database, it kind of serve as a finetuning platform for the llm if we approach it through RAG type of system. Since I start to have interest in this whole LLM thing, I love the concept of multi-agents workflow and to my surprise, the new update of the Cannoli Plugins can make that possible for me. *Will provide list of plugins as recommendations*

C) But enough about ai, lets talk about how Obsidian stands as one application that packs crazy amount of features ( to the extent I kind of treating it like a main os for my computer lmao ) especially the theme part. I absolutely loveeeee the colourscheme and the whole look of neovim. I tried to make one but i kept on screwing it along the process, which it took me one month to be honest and I really not proud of that lol. Then, the themes section of obsidian does contain similar look but not the whole replication of it which in the end - made me feel disappointed with myself because not only it speaks on how I wasn’t meant for this coding thing, it also frustrates me more since I have this stupid habit of “not using the app for the sole reason it was developed” but treating it like a dress-to-impress working environment in my perspective. But then, I discovered obsidianhub/ forum and life gets better after that.

2. Policies and Legal issues.(Ethical approach)

Before diving deeper into this part, I had this idea of creating a vault with pre-installed plugins, snippets and templates to share among the campus community and idea pitch this to my faculty. Then, I realised the reason why my vault are the way it is, cater exactly to way I want it is because all of these were from the hardwork of the developers and the communities. I must credit them all and Im scared it might arise some legal issues from the developers side or other party I might not able to think of, I do not have a direct way to contact and inform about this - I also don’t have the permission from them to even consider such an idea.

a) Reddit is the only way for me to share this whole thing and it actually scares me to be honest, I don’t want to get kick out or mass downvoted for delivering this idea of mine in a wrong way. I really hope you guys able to understand what I’m trying to illustrate here and I really want everyone to know how impactful this app has been to my life. 

b) what are the ethical approaches i must comply to, correct methods on credit the inventor of the plugins, snippets, templates and so much more and aside from reddit (inc : github, email) how do I make sure they are notified of this? Should I scrap this whole idea away? 

Apologies if my post strikes confusion but I really want the students to know how benefiting this app is. 

As promised, here are list of community plugins that I SHOULD or YOU SHOULD try as a student :

- advanced canvas
- semantic search canvas
- markmind
- MAKE.md
- mermaid tools
- c-menu
- editing toolbar
- alternative file tree plugins
- lazy loader plugins ( sorry if i got this wrong )
- style settings 
- code executer/emitter ( to the queen that created this, I love you and I just know you sleep well 💕)
- dataview
- projects
- js engine
- editing toolbar
- univer
- full calendar
- grandpa clock plugin
- BRAT ( oh you have no idea how BRILLIANT you were to come up with this plugin at the first place )
- open api renderer
( theres more but i will list it down in the comments section )


Ai related plugins
- Cannoli ( insane how this one plugin alone can serve you so many features )
- SystemSculpt ai 
- BMO"
1f7liu5,7,2024-09-02,Feedback Wanted: Building a CII Exam Preparation Tool - Your Thoughts?,u/Ok-Flatworm6098,cii,https://www.reddit.com/r/cii/comments/1f7liu5/feedback_wanted_building_a_cii_exam_preparation/,"Hi everyone,

Fellow CII student, over the past year I’ve done a few of the exams and just didn’t really like the CII platform or any other external study materials. One company’s website looks like it hasn’t been updated since the 90’s!

I also kinda felt a bit ripped off when an emergency had happened and lost all access to the mocks I had paid for as i didnt complete the exam in the 4 months i had access. I don’t understand why the e-learning mocks are only for 3 – 4 months access with some providers, I feel like it should be for a year, but that’s just me.  

Also the fact that it costs I think the ones I used around £90 for mocks and revision notes with one provider and almost double that with another, and to fork that out each time for each R0. I don’t know I felt there’s a better way of doing this.

So I'm thinking of building a platform myself as a side project and see what you guys think. This will be just for R01-R06 exams, but if there is traction for the product, then happy to add as many other exams as possible.

I’d love to get your thoughts and opinions as to what features you would like to see, some pain points you have and any other ideas you have before i drop a load of time and effort in building this out. Is there even demand for a newer and fresher exam prep service?

**Here’s what I’m planning to include so far:**

1. **Q&A**: Ask questions related to the R0 exams. I like writing a lot of notes, and then trimming them down, and then trimming them again and again. Thats usually how I revise. Given developments in AI and large language models, I’ll be using these as the knowledge set along with what’s publicly available on the internet, the idea is you should be able to ask whatever question related to a specific RO exam and it should give you the answer in detail. for example, you can ask what is a flexible whole of life policy? and it should provide you with a detailed summary.

1. **Summary Creation**: As mentioned about making notes, painful to read some (most) sections of the R0 books as its so dry, so I’m hoping to create something where you can just ask it to generate summaries of any section from the book and save them to your personal notes.

1. **Flashcards**: Create and customise flashcards, or automatically generate them for quick revision. Again something I do a lot, have a concept on one side and what it means on the other to help with memorising key ideas. idea is you can ask to generate for example 10 flashcards on Estate and Tax Planning - and should do it immediately.

1. **Multiple Choice Questions**: Generate sets of 10, 30, or 50 multiple-choice questions at the click of a button for practice. These will NOT be exam level questions, more so to test your own knowledge. I feel like 3 mocks and some of the questions on revisionmate some times isn’t enough, at least for me. Once you’ve gone through them a few times you know the answers. I’m hoping to create something where it can regenerate questions without repeating the same questions over and over again.

**NEED YOUR INPUT - What would you like to see?**

**Additional Features**:

**Spider diagrams -** i make a lot of spider diagrams on PPT as it helps me to visualise concepts. Thinking to create a tool that creates a spider diagram for example of the different types of endowments, rather than just reading a block of text.

**Mock exams** – not sure how I would create this – any tips would be welcome.

**Study Planner?** So put a date in 3 months from now, and generate a study planner?

**What other tools or features would help you in your study process? or am i doing too much with spider diagrams, mock exams, study planner?**

**Pricing**: Given there is a cost associated with using APIs, hosting the website and the large language models, servers, domain names, time to actually develop and maintain the platform. Given all of this, I’m thinking a monthly subscription but no idea what the price point is – one thing is for sure I want to be cheaper than the big providers out there.

The way I’m thinking about it is for example, brandft is coming to £640 quid for all 6 exams. BTS – approx £1260 including 2 volumes of the mock exams, and this is for 4 months access for the emocks for both providers.  I want to give access to all members for as long as they are subscribed. So for example if on average you do all 6 exams in a year, I’m thinking it costs £600, but if done in 6 months, it costs £300. Both of which are £50 a month. It'll be cancel anytime subscription – you’re not locked in.

**What would you be comfortable paying for a service like this? Would you prefer a subscription model (monthly/annual) or a one-time payment? Any thoughts on the pricing range?**

**General Feedback**: Are there any pain points with current study tools or platforms that you think this service could address? What would make this platform stand out for you?

Your feedback would be invaluable as I want to create something that truly helps us succeed in the exams and also something that’s 21^(st) century and not just downloadable PDFs!!!.

Happy to answer any questions and discuss ideas further in the comments.

Thanks in advance for your input!"
1f7my8j,1,2024-09-02,AITAH for ruining my classmates’ futures just to increase my chances of getting into medical school?,u/Personal-Animator-39,AITAH,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1f7my8j/aitah_for_ruining_my_classmates_futures_just_to/,"I (18M) am a pre-med student who is double majoring in physics and chemistry and minoring in biochemistry. The world is pre-med is very competitive, so doing everything possible to ensure acceptance into medical school (even if at the expense of others) is very common.

In my multi-variable calculus, I noticed that the student sitting next to me (18M), another pre-med student, got a 100% on a quiz on partial derivatives. Sensing competition, I did what any normal pre-med student would do: falsely report him for cheating to the teacher. In an eloquent but entirely fraudulent note to the professor, I stated that he made a formula sheet for the quiz, which was not allowed. Upon hearing this, the teacher changed my competitor’s grade for the test from a 100% to a 0%. Seeing my power, I quickly realized I could sabotage many other students.

When I went to my calculus-based mechanics class, I noticed a group of other pre-meds (18M, 19M, 19F, and 20M) who seemed to be answering every single question correctly. To me, this was indicative of a strong physics background amongst these students. Knowing I would have a tough time competing against these people, I decided that academic sabotage was the only solution. We had a lab report on drag forces due that week, so I falsely accused all 4 of them of plagiarizing from each other. In an eloquently-worded but BS email to my physics professor, I pointed out very small similarities in writing styles that in no way indicate plagiarism (such as usage of Oxford commas and similarities in sentence length), but the professor was none the wiser and believed my allegations. As such, I had 4 pre-med students in my physics class suspended because I falsely accused them of plagiarism.

A day later, we got handed back our stoichiometry tests in chemistry class, and I noticed a group of pre-meds (18M, 18F, 19M, 20M, 20F, and 21M) who got As. After successfully getting 4 pre-meds suspended for false plagiarism accusations, I tried pushing my limits. I falsely accused all 6 of these pre-meds in my chemistry class of sexual assault. I used ChatGPT to create 6 false accusations sexual assault against all of these people. Furthermore, I created 6 burner email accounts and emailed these fake accusations to my university from these burner accounts. I got them all expelled from my university, and now all 6 of them are in court for sexual assault charges.

I have always been told sabotaging others is normal pre-med behavior, but does what I did count? I ruined one kid’s test score, got four kids falsely suspended for plagiarism, and got six kids falsely expelled for sexual assault allegations. Am I the asshole for all of this, or is this really just normal pre-med behavior? After all, I did eliminate the completion in my physics, math, and chemistry courses (all of which are important for medical school), so I did marginally increase my chances of getting accepted. Should I feel bad, or should I continue this?"
1f7ncfy,3,2024-09-02,This is so Difficult….,u/Emergency_Ad_5371,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1f7ncfy/this_is_so_difficult/,"I actually have a wonderful admin and pretty good support when it comes to mentors, but I still feel like I’m spending way to much time doing all the things. I’ve got multiple logs to fill out every single day, 19 ELP kids I have to differentiate for or else they get annoyed and off task, virtually no left over curriculum from the previous teacher (they changed the order and the standards over the summer, so nothing works), and my other 9th ELA teachers are all brand new or within their first 3 years. 

This results in me having to make from scratch virtually everything I do, which is hard because I have to do both GRR and CHAMPS for every single lesson. Classroom management is fine, the students are great too, but the having to craft all my stuff from scratch is going to be the death of me. Some of it I manage to get from TPT if it’s decent, I use chatGPT when I can for examples, and a teacher at our other partner 9th building is great for resources, but that really only covers up to ~half of what I need to do. I’ve got two preps, one of which is honors, and it’s just very very difficult not to spend 4+ hours making sure my lessons aren’t literally garbage. 

If anyone has any advice as to how the hell I can make planning easier, that would be great. I manage only about an hour of free time after school because of this, and I feel like I don’t even know my content when I do, I just can’t seem to find relatively engaging ways to teach it anywhere.

1f7pv3w,40,2024-09-02,"38F making $150k annually in Colorado, 1 husband & 1 son",u/Clipsy1985,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/1f7pv3w/38f_making_150k_annually_in_colorado_1_husband_1/,"This builds on my [Vegas post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/1f7lgvb/38f_making_150k_took_son_to_vegas_for_16th_bday/), giving a more realistic view of our everyday life. I made a few tweaks to the first half (also included in the Vegas post) to correct some minor errors that were insignificant but I wanted to fix anyway.

Basic Details  
**Age**: F38  
**Job**: Small Business Owner - HR and Audit - 7 years in business  
**Salary**: 2023 net $119,904 - 2024 projected to take home $150,000  
**Location**: Colorado Springs, CO

**Preface:**  In Q4 2022, my income significantly increased by approximately $60k, surpassing $100k for the first time but also exceeding $70k for the first time in my life. I'm still adapting to this higher income and addressing the effects of many years of low wages and poor financial decisions. Since 2022, I have been the **sole** provider, though I previously contributed the majority of the income. While there was some fluctuation between my income and my husband's over the years, it wasn't substantial, so in general, I've always been the main provider.

**\~Section One: Assets and Debt\~**

**💰Retirement Balance: IRA: $1,208.** I regret not prioritizing this account in the past and making withdrawals from employers instead of rolling the funds over. Last month, I began contributing $600 per month and plan to increase this amount next month and going forward. I haven’t yet determined the exact new contribution amount.

**Son’s 529 & UTMA Contributions**:  $600/month (usually split evenly between the two; will review and likely increase during my IRA review)

**UTMA Balance**:  $2,300

**529 Balance**:  $900 (need to research potential impact on student loans - heard this may actually not be the best route to take)

My son does have other savings/school accounts that his grandparents contribute to. We get annual statements from them to verify balances. 2022, ending with a combined $17k, won’t have 2024 numbers until Jan 2025. 

**Husband’s IRA**:  $300/month (he will start contributing his entire paycheck, varying from $300 to $1,200/month). His company does not offer retirement.

**💰Savings Account Balance:  $1,600.** In June, our balance was over $10k. Unfortunately, we incurred significant expenses: $3,200 for my dog's medical care and euthanasia, $2,900 for car repairs after Jiffy Lube caused damage & we had to take it to BMW for repair.

**💰Checking Account Balance: **$**3800. **

**💳 Credit Card Debt: **I have four small-limit credit cards, with a total limit of around $1,500. I use and pay off these cards regularly to help rebuild my credit score.

**👩‍🎓Student Loan Debt: I** currently have no student loan debt. I’ve just resumed school this semester and have received grants covering the entire semester, so I likely won’t need to take the approximately $4k in federal loans offered. If I do (still not likely), I plan to repay them within the school year and won’t carry a balance.

**🚗 Vehicle Loan Debt: $25k ** 2017 BMW. We only have 1 car, I work from home & my husband doesn't work often, so there is no need for 2 cars right now. I bought this car last year after my previous vehicle was totaled. Due to my credit at the time, this was the only car within our budget that we could get approved for, given the down payment and monthly payment requirements. The monthly payment is $690, but I pay at least $1,000 per month, sometimes $1,200 or more when possible. The current balance is $25k, but with my payment strategy, I expect to pay it off in 2 more years.

**\~Section Two: Income\~**

**Income Progression:** Other than my first 3 jobs when I was young, my entire career is in Banking/Financial sector

Receptionist at car dealership: $8  
Receptionist at law firm: $10  
Daycare teacher: $5.40 (moved to small town - horrible decision to take this job)  
Bank Teller $9, $10, $12  
Specialist (can’t remember my exact title): $14 + overnight pay starting at 6pm an extra $2  
EA to VP: $17  
Audit & Compliance Assitant: $14 (moved to a small town)  
Branch Manager: $40kSr Relationship Manager: $45,000  
Small Business Owner: $39k 2018, $48k 2019, $57k 2020, $63k 2021, $89k 2022, $119k 2023

**Main Job Monthly Take Home:** Months vary a bit, but an average of $11,720 take home each month

**Was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?:** No, we never discussed this. I took various classes on my own and paid out of pocket because I wasn't aware that grants and loans were available.

**Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?:** Ha ha ha ha ha, none. All I knew was that my mom constantly borrowed money and that we were poor. My dad also did not pay his court-ordered child support.

**Did you worry about money growing up?:** Once I had to start supporting myself at 15, I sure did.

**Do you worry about money now?:** Yes, b/c of my many years of financial trauma. Trying to work on this.

**At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself, and do you have a financial safety net?:**15. My mother left me at 15, and I’ve supported myself fully ever since. Safety net? Lol, no.

**Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income?:** Not yet, but to be transparent, I’ll have a small one from one Uncle (no kids) and a very large one from my other Aunt and Uncle (no kids). Hopefully, I won’t see either for at least another 10 years, but they are a bit older.

**\~Section Three: Expenses\~**

**🏡 Rent (do not own):  $2,420 **per month (the $20 is for pet rent). Rent in Colorado is quite high, and this is considered a reasonable price for our 3-bedroom, 4-bathroom home with a fully finished basement, garage, backyard, and two stories (three, including the basement). The house is in a prestigious neighborhood, which I didn’t realize until after we moved in - not something I sought out, but obviously pleasantly surprised.

**🫶 Donations: **I currently donate roughly $100 monthly to various small non-profits and one-person animal rescues. I aim to identify additional organizations to support and plan to prioritize this within the next month. This is very important to me, so I'm happy to hear any recommendations for animal welfare, unhoused animals, menstrual products, accessible healthcare, etc…

**🗑️Utilities: **Avg $220/mo for water/electric (all in one bill), $46/Q for trash,

💻 I**nternet: **$50

**🚗 Car Insurance:**  $205/month

**📱Cellphone: **$105 for 3 lines

Apple Storage $3  
Grammarly (for school - prob canceling) $20  
Face Foundarie (monthly facials on a subscription plan) $89/mo

LA Fitness $24 (We got the ‘black’ membership & I think we all get to use it b/c of that but only my son uses this right now. He uses it heavily, so it is worth the price)  
Hello-Tech:  $19

**Additional Expenses:** 

**Monthly Dermatologist for son:** Insurance doesn’t cover, approx $161 each visit. We see him monthly.

**Lending to Mom**:  $100-$200/month (sometimes more; my relationship with her is complicated obvs, so feel free to ask Qs)

**AfterPay**:  $40/month right now, 2 payments left. More often than not, I’ll make the purchase on AfterPay and turn around and pay it right off just to keep a good payment history and keep my line increasing. (I know I don’t need to use this, but I use it responsibly…and so idk)

💅N**ails:**  $100-$200/month

🐕🐈Mo**nthly Pet Food: ** $75-$130 (for 1 dog and 1 cat; varies based on stock and needs for treats, vitamins, etc.)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Total income for this month: $15,015.10**

**\~Day One: Monday\~**

It's the last week of summer! I try not to work too much to squeeze in the last bit of summer with my son that I can. He and I have no major plans, as he and I just got back from Albuquerque, NM, so it’s just about being available to him, preparing for school, etc.

**10:00am**—roll out of bed. Let’s be real: Running a business from home while my son is out for summer break has me super lazy and off schedule. I start to get ready for a meeting at 10:45 a.m.

**10:45 - 11:15am** - Leadership meeting with my biggest client. Camera on b/c I was able to get ready in enough time to show my face. No one cares what you look like at this company, the owner doesn’t even brush her hair - (the definition of ‘ski bum’ and I’m not meaning this bad, just giving background), but I just can’t bring myself to be onscreen not put together

**12:00 - 2:00** - Payroll prep, process HSA contributions, process raises for this paycheck, review budget for offsite in Oct in LA, prep Offer packet for possible new hire.

**2:00** - Take son to the gym and run to TJ Maxx while he’s there. We don’t live far from the gym, but it feels like a waste to drive back home just to turn around again an hour later to get him. ($77.46 on a nice new throw blanket for the couch and candles for my office). Quick return at Anthro - somehow managed not to make a purchase. Credit $89.78

**4:45 - 7:00p** - Get back to work. Run payroll for a client and prep next month’s invoices. Draft Violent Workplace Policy

**7:15p** - Venmo friend $25 to buy herself some drinks at a comedy show I was supposed to go to with her and her dad. I was just too tired to make the 45-minute drive.

**7:30p** Food/doordash: $69 Carrabba's

**8:45p** - Everything shower and bed

Transfer $300 to son’s UTMA/529

**Daily Total Spend:** $471.46 - $381.68 with the return credit

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**\~Day Two: Tuesday\~**

**10:00am** - I have been up for just a bit, checking emails in bed. I decide to get up, get ready, and go work in my office.

**11:00a** - Work on a terminated employee issue for a client. Responding to their UI claim, their refusal to return company equipment and their client's confidential logins, etc.

**1:30pm** - Enroll new employee in health benefits

**2:15pm** - Meeting with an employee who has Qs regarding a raise

**3:00pm** - Employee requests ADA accommodation that I have to engage in an interactive process on gathering details, verifying law, reviewing requests, compliance, etc

**4:00 - 5:00pm** - Slew of misc emails, Slack, ‘quick call’ requests, and a bit of prep for tomorrow’s day

**5:30pm** - Take son and his BFF to the gym, sit in the car and read The Silent Patient

**6:45p** - Back home & check a few emails. There is no need to do this, but it’s a habit I’m trying to break.

**7:15p** - Get into bed. I putter around on my school dashboard preparing for classes that start soon and, got a schedule down, ordered books.

**8:30p** - Edible + sleep

CC Payment: $200

Car Insurance: $205

Target order: $137 for a few groceries and pet food. 

Husband liquor store: $35.67 (Beer & White Claw - lasts about 2, sometimes 3 weeks)

**Daily Total Spend:** $577.67

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**\~Day Three – Wednesday \~**

Our a/c is slowly going out, but we don’t fully realize it as it progressed over the day and wasn’t just like “bam” hot as fuck. So, on this first day, we just thought it was struggling to keep up with the high temps.

**9:00a-1:00p** - Take my Mama Llama (dog) to the mailbox for a quick potty and get a huge box of mail a client sent. Sort client mail. This stack has a state audit notification; pulled paperwork for that and mailed it, pay past due bills (the client doesn’t send me mail on a reg schedule, so some things end up late b/c of this), processed insurance renewal, began to increase request for other policies, file mail (aka upload photos into Drive).

**1:00 - 3:00p** - Misc client calls and employee ‘quick call’ requests. Misc questions re: PTO, holidays, OT, etc.

**4:00 p.m.** Call it quits because I’m hot. I lay around on the couch, putter around online, and try to read The Body Keeps Score, but I can’t keep my attention on anything.

**5:30p -** Take kiddo to the gym, he gets a ride home

**7:00p** - Dinners are ordered; Doordash: $20.48 (son & BFF), Texas Roadhouse: $63.78 (Mom & dad)

**8:30p** - Get in bed, watch TV for a bit, laugh at my husband, pass out

Amazon: $3.99 - who knows? Movie? All 3 of us use this account. Idk who does what. 

Income: $221 and $309

**Daily Total Spend: $88.25**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**\~Day Four: Thursday\~**

The A/C went out during the hottest week of the summer in CoS! I spent most of the day on the phone with the landlord, troubleshooting, and trying to find a solution. Unfortunately, all the repair companies were backed up due to the heat, so we couldn’t get someone out right away. I tried to pop in and work here and there, but it was so hectic and miserable that I didn’t accomplish much and couldn't provide time stamps. Everyone in the house was frustrated and arguing because of the heat, which made things even better.

Only 1 timestamp could be accounted for this day.

Rent: $2420

Husband goes to Lowes for portal a/c unit & 2 fans: $369

USPS $31 - ordered stamps

Apple: $21 - no clue - purchase by son/husband for who knows what

Hulu $31

Gas $50

Panda Express $10 (son)

Walgreens $20 for batteries b/c it seems like Xbox controllers suck the life out of them in 2.5 seconds. I should buy stock in batteries.

**7:00p** - Took my son to the movies: $64 (tix/snacks). I couldn’t forget the photo of my excellent parallel parking job as I am the parallel parking queen, and we document all the tight spaces I get into (ha). Felt so good to be in a cold-ass movie theater vs being at home. (Thank god it got fixed the next day!)

Income: $430.10

**Daily Total Spend**: $3,016

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**\~Day Five: Friday\~**

**6:45am -** First day of Junior year! Drop kiddo off at 7:15, go home, and get ready

**8:30am -** Slowly start work. This is my first normal day back to being on schedule from the summer. Check/respond to emails, verify payroll run for today, misc paperwork

**10:00am** - All hands for biggest client

**11:15am** - Putter around for about an hour in my office “cleaning.”

**12:30 - 2:15p:** Various client calls, responding to emails/Slack, research non-compete ban, research FLSA Jan 1, 2025 changes.

**2:30 p.m. -** Pick up the kiddo from school. He’s cranky, as expected. We just kind of ‘let him be’ the rest of the day/night to decompress from going back to school and having a class with an ex (his ‘first’ love).

**3:00 - 4:00p -** Customer service support for billing issue with a client’s payroll account. Threaten contract cancelation and get what we need via email 30 min later.

**4:00 p.m. -** Nail day!: $98, which included tip. I went pretty basic this time - creamy white nails with a few small gemstones.

**5:30p** - take son to the gym. He gets a ride home with his friend

**6:30p** - Eat 2 tacos from Jack and the Box with husband. Too tired from everyone’s first day back to care about dinner. Son had leftover pizza.

**7:30p -** Relaxing in bed with the TV on, and I might have taken a small edible to share some laughs with my husband before it helped me sleep. I have Lupus, and the pain at night can be intense, often keeping me awake.

**Cell:** Our ""regular bill"" was $201.85, but I decided to pay off the remaining balance for all our phone rentals, which was about $500. I also made a plan change I thought I'd already done, which ended up costing me around $200. However, paying off the phones and making the plan change reduced our bill to $105 per month moving forward. Yay!

**Daily Total Spend:: $756.85**

**Total Weekly Spend: $6,088.21** 



***Takeaway***: 

This actually wasn’t a bad week. Aside from our usual bills, we managed to keep things pretty much in check. Normally, our DoorDash spending is higher, and there are usually a few more Target or Amazon orders. I’m proud of this week, but I know it’s not the norm. I'll need to figure out what we did differently and try to maintain that momentum to curb our overspending while continuing to put as much as possible towards retirement, savings, and school.

**Goals**:

Now that Vegas is behind us, our goals are to focus on building up our retirement, savings, and school accounts and to create generational wealth. I know we're starting a bit late, but we'll get there. We may not leave millions for our son, but I want him to have something to help him get started in life and provide support when we're gone. We also want to ensure we can take care of ourselves as we age, so we don't become a burden to him."
1f7uiot,1,2024-09-03,What kind of work will I need to put in to impress potential employer,u/zJqson,AskProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/1f7uiot/what_kind_of_work_will_i_need_to_put_in_to/,"Im trying to get an unpaid internship where I can get training for hands on experience. I feel like if I get a paid internship where I paid them to train me. it would still be fine. 

I know basic of node.js, django, and React. I have a full time job on a different field and self teaching myself coding. does anyone have any advice or good practice work? 

I guess it would be harder for me to get internship since I am not enrolled in school so companies don’t get tax benefits and stuff to hire me. I done a few small contracts on Upwork, all got 5 star reviews, but I feel like it takes very long to search for jobs and I have to spend connects and time just to ask customer about requirements and understand the requirements clearly, some time even takes longer to understand what the customer wants then to code the project.

I also never worked on projects that have big codebase or work with projects with a team. I live in Canada and Im trying to think what projects I should do to impress a potential employer, to show that I’m willing to learn, and not be a net negative profit as an intern for their company.

I know Python and Javascript. I only made some personal projects that are for personal automation so far, some probably took a lot longer time than what a junior developer could do. I think Im closer to like a 2nd year student, I have some friends in 2nd year and I think my skill is around the same as them currently, maybe 3rd year. They learn a lot of theory and how the computer works in school so they don't code as much me.

Should I make my my own website that have my personal projects and host it on AWS? It's going to cost money for that purpose. 

I use ChatGPT for a lot of syntax, but I know how the algorithm works for all my personal projects. Idk if the odds will be too stacked, I also heard that some junior positions are net negative profit for the company so they are more like an investment than money maker and now majority of the code that would have been done by Junior Developer in the past is now being done with AI companies would just rather pay seniors a premium. Its also not helping that its like 80% of Gen Z is interested in studying Comp Sci than any other major which make Junor Dev roles saturated. "

A recent groundbreaking bibliometric analysis uncovers how the field of conversational agents (CA) has evolved over the last fifteen years and why trust is the game-changer in this dialogue between human and machine. Buckle up as we embark on a journey through high-tech history and look into the world of AI agents!

## What Are Conversational Agents Anyway?

**Conversational Agents (CAs)** are essentially AI-powered entities designed to chat with us, amicably mimicking the nuances of human dialogue. They've come a long way from their humble beginnings—like ELIZA, the 1960s computer program designed to simulate a psychotherapist. From the simple word-matching strategies of the past, we've witnessed the evolution to today's advanced AI systems that understand and generate language almost as smoothly as a human.

These agents can fall into two categories: **task-oriented agents**, which manage specific tasks like making reservations or answering customer queries, and **social agents**, which aim for free-ranging, relationship-style exchanges.

Speaking of evolution, have you heard of ChatGPT? Released in 2022 by OpenAI, it’s garnered massive attention, shining a light on the public's booming interest in AI-driven conversations.

## The Trust Quotient: Why It Matters?

Trust is a pivotal component when we talk about human-AI interaction. For people to adopt and rely on CAs, they need to trust them—imagine running errands with someone you didn't trust. Awkward, right? 

Researchers Meltem Aksoy and Annika Bush have delved deep, analyzing a whopping 955 studies published between 2009 and 2024 to piece together how the discourse around trust in CAs has shifted and expanded. The study reveals that the U.S. holds the lead in research, with Germany, China, and the UK hot on its heels, demonstrating significant global interest.

### Interdisciplinary Collaboration: Where Minds Meet

The research isn’t happening in silos—it's a communal effort spanning various academic fields like artificial intelligence (AI), human-computer interaction, and even social sciences. This cross-disciplinary collaboration shed light on understanding trust factors and designing more reliable and effective CAs.

## Dissecting the Data: What’s the Picture Over Time?

From the early 2010s to today, interest in CAs has rapidly ballooned, leading to a peak in 2023 where the number of studies compared to previous years doubled. Exciting, isn't it? Interestingly, it appears the ChatGPT release spurred an increased research emphasis on trust elements, pushing it to the top of academic agendas.

### The Rise of ChatGPT 

ChatGPT has been the center of research buzz, largely because it represents a new high-water mark in architectural sophistication in AI dialogue systems—and it’s free for individual users. Such accessibility likely contributes to its research popularity, drawing attention both as a study subject and a research tool.

### Top Journals and Influential Papers

The analysis identifies influential journals and articles contributing significantly to the field. For instance, the Journal of Human-Computer Studies boasts numerous high-impact papers with articles dissecting user experience and trust dynamics. Meanwhile, studies on consumer trust in voice assistants—like Amazon’s Alexa—have attracted noteworthy academic attention.

## Practical Implications: Why Should You Care?

Understanding trust in CAs has practical applications across various sectors:

* **Business**: CAs are increasingly used in customer service to handle inquiries and complaints harmoniously.
* **Healthcare**: Chatbots can provide preliminary health assessments, assisting healthcare professionals.
* **Education**: Virtual assistants are streamlining educational experiences, offering student support.

The ability to integrate AI in everyday technologies could revolutionize our interactions, making things smarter, faster, and more personal. But the success of these integrations hinges on the trust factor. Would you be comfortable taking medical advice from a CA that you doubted? Probably not.

My requirements:

-Remove areas for students to write their answers (there will be an answer sheet used instead)

-Rewrite the test so I can transcribe it directly into MS Word.

This is an example of what the fucking GPT is doing:

The GPT keeps removing the information from the test questions and saying ""Continue with"".

For other parts of the test, the fucking GPT thinks it's a student and answers the fucking questions.

This is my prompt for the gpt:

`I need help restructuring and streamlining an English test from a provided PDF. The test includes sections on Listening, Reading, Vocabulary, and Grammar. Each section has specific types of questions that need to be formatted clearly for student responses. I require: Listening Section: Fact file completion based on a radio show, and multiple-choice questions about the company discussed. Reading Section: Comprehension questions that require filling in names based on the text, and matching advice to given problems. Vocabulary Section: Completion of sentences using a provided list of verbs. Grammar Section: Filling in blanks with grammatical structures such as 'used to', indefinite pronouns, conditional sentences, passive voice, and reported speech. Writing Section: Instructions for writing an informal email based on a given scenario. The goal is to format these sections into a clear, easily understandable test document without omitted information, ready for transcription into MS Word.`

1f7y5d1,101,2024-09-03,"Vietnam's less popular, but as violent cultural revolution.",u/Republic_of_VietNam,EnoughCommieSpam,https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughCommieSpam/comments/1f7y5d1/vietnams_less_popular_but_as_violent_cultural/,"On 1st of September, 2024, a combination of blind Ultranationalism, pure ignorance and communist influence has made the entire Vietnamese internet (basically Facebook because that's where the majority of the Vietnamese netizens resides) to attack.

The 17 years old 2023 Road to Olympia champion, Chu Ngọc Quang Vinh has been attacked, doxxed and harrassed both online and in real life by Vietnamese due to his constroversial opinion being the Communist Party did some bad thing, despite he has clarified that he has grown to realize the good they did and is learning to accept them in the same sentence, people, led by tankie groups like Comrade Commissar and Tifosi (This one is most likely a Chinese plant) has been up in arms just because of the first part they read and didn't bother to start a dialogue.

They immediately starts hurling insults, death threats and generic copy-pasted opinions. As seen below:

[\\""You used Communist money, Communist \\""welfare\\"" and talk like that? If I was one of your family member I would've beaten you to death.\\"" \(Vietnam does not have a welfare system.\)](https://preview.redd.it/535e54v39lmd1.png?width=1150&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2001c054fb85cedcce43730af9efb8496fc6879)

[These screenshots are the only less violent ones that fits the Reddit TOS](https://preview.redd.it/iakv3ji13lmd1.png?width=702&format=png&auto=webp&s=d71563b01ffe7574543458d8574e406034eb8476)

[\\""Send him to the 18th layer of hell\\""](https://preview.redd.it/tv6zu7m92lmd1.png?width=668&format=png&auto=webp&s=5798f54a68c14826c7021ebd5f8895fbf0cb4ea4)

[\\""Living in peaceful times isn't what you want. You just like being rebellious and supporting things like color revolutions.\\""](https://preview.redd.it/q3pwx50d3lmd1.png?width=671&format=png&auto=webp&s=e01fea2f9edd784088be145e19dfe1ee97d6809f)

Here's the full translation of what the victim said that angers the Vietnamese ""netizens"":

>""At the end of middle school, I was exposed to Western culture in the most intense way. Gradually, I realized that what I had been taught at school for so long was not entirely true. I viewed the Party as a negative force that only deceived people, and I tried in every way to live abroad in the future.

>Then I prepared for the Olympia competition to 'live abroad,' and whether I liked it or not, I still had to study history from the Party's perspective. Then, because of my achievements, I received many things from the Party, so I gradually saw the Party in a more favorable light.

>When my dream of living abroad had to come to an end, I didn't know what to do next, but looking back at what I had here, I thought living in Vietnam wasn't so bad. I would ignore the Party and focus on myself.

>And now, I want to leave Vietnam again. I guess I will never be able to see the Party in a positive light, even though I once tried to at least 'tolerate' the Party. The people in my country are content with the status quo, so if I don't support it, I might as well leave.

>Anyway, tomorrow is National Day. I wish that, under any regime, Vietnam will continue to develop in all aspects because my homeland will always be Vietnam.

Low quality image of the original facebook story post (which was supposed to be private but one of his ""friends"" ratted him out.):

https://preview.redd.it/jh4411fkblmd1.jpg?width=1116&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bc51a4bd53f6e619779ca113ef1c5fa0709a85dd

In all retrospect, he's still a communist but he's too ""liberal"". He has grown fond of the CPV due to the many rewards they have given him for his talents over the years. Yet they refused to hear him out.

Most Vietnamese tankies (the loud minority) aren't has smart or as educated as him to analyze what they said, so they only fixated on the first paragraph, that's the level of education that even some college students inside the country still have, I know, I have dealt with them before.

Youtube ain't safe either:

[\\""I may don't have intelligence but I have Socialist morals, patriotism, I will defend the Communist Party with everything I have.\\""](https://preview.redd.it/ozd22jbwblmd1.png?width=441&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9e4809b0a0ed76d0ec4362d3a8762ee054df604)

All of this drama caught the ire of the Communist Party of Vietnam and thus, he has been called to ""talk"" with the police:

[One of the Vietnamese 10 cent army in action](https://preview.redd.it/07ci9vt56lmd1.png?width=679&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6ee37be5b1b38472d3fcc5cb50de3971a4148cc)

**This is the true Vietnam. It's a place that you would want to visit, but to live here is hell.**  
Here's the image of his dox, calling for violence aka beating until death:

https://preview.redd.it/y2vgu3xaelmd1.png?width=1290&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0e111561c72c85552fdc7994cc880b4c55e51b2

All credits to r/VietNamNation and r/ TroChuyenLinhTinh's members for the ease of access to proofs since the victim's account has been fully privated and ChatGPT for the translation of a few words.

Their reasons are very similar to their Chinese counterpart: ""He said he didn't like the party so I must attack him, it doesn't matter that he have changed."", \*Insert ad hominem\*, \*insert whataboutism\*, \*inferiority complexes\*, ""Why are you asking? Are you a reactionary too?"" (When asked about their reasons.)

**Remember, this doesn't represent all Vietnamese, but a rising problem within their population.**"

I stumbled upon an issue I personally had when I used ChatGPT. In ChatGPT you can upload a PDF and ask its questions. However this is limited to some pages. If you upload a too big PDF it won't answer. That was the first bummer. Secondly I wanted to questions over multiple documents. Why would you want something like this? Lets say you're a student studying having multiple sources of documents and PDFs which you are learning from. Now how cool would it be that the student could ask questions over his personal documents. 

That's where I thought it would be actually a cool idea. Currently there are some products out there that let you upload documents and chat with them. However I then thought, what if there's an application that indexes all your documents, like in a library, and you as a user can ask whatever question you want. What if that's as easy as connecting your Dropbox, full of knowledgeable documents, to that application and boom you can ask whatever question you like over your personal knowledge base. 

So this was basically my idea. I wanted to share it with you to see if someone of you would actually use it and if it would be helpful at all? I would really appreciate your feedback!

1f87rte,30,2024-09-03,rant about UOWM KDU (it's not worth it),u/throwawayy8373,malaysiauni,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysiauni/comments/1f87rte/rant_about_uowm_kdu_its_not_worth_it/,"i can't tell y'all how much i REGRET going to uowm kdu (glenmarie campus). i won't be exposing which programme i took because i don't want to be identified by any students who knew me. for context, i left uow within the last 2 years and have since joined a different programme at another institution, and it makes me wish i hadn't gone to uow in the first place. i chose uow because it was cheaper than most of my options, and i thought it would be a relatively good choice because of other factors. dumb and naive lah, but it's over now.

i hope this helps to discourage people from going to the shithole that uow is because i honestly feel like i wasted my time, money, and energy there. please note that your mileage may vary based on the programme.

LECTURERS:
• i didn't get to interact with all of the lecturers in my programme because i didn't stay for very long, but i did interact with most of them during events.
• i'm so disappointed by the quality and attitude of the lecturers. they teach everything in english, but their english SUCKS. can they converse and read slides aloud? yes. can they explain keywords accurately? no. 🤣 how can i learn something new and understand what you want for assignments if you can't even explain a basic word? i understand we're malaysian and not everyone speaks english at the native level. but come on lah, you don't even know how to explain a word that most kids learn when they're 9 years old.
• i honestly felt like i was interacting with lecturers who were not fully present mentally. like damn blur yk. one lecturer always interrupts your answer when they asked YOU a question, then there's one lecturer who acts like they're self-aware, but they're just your average ""i know better than you"" middle-aged lecturer. this lecturer can't be bothered to make their own slides, so they use slides made by a lecturer who used to teach the module. i understand the module content is the same, but they can't even be bothered to do their own research to understand what they're teaching. some of the information is OUTDATED, but when you try to point it out to them, they don't believe you. they don't bother to learn how to pronounce important keywords, or to genuinely run through the slides before presenting in class. you can ask questions to get student engagement, but they were asking like they genuinely do not know wtf they are talking about. another lecturer will just slowly walk around the class and monotonously read the slides that basically have an essay on each slide. it's so boring and they act like they know everything when they can't explain content properly in english. even got a lecturer who wants to ""toughen you up"", but all empathy is thrown out of the window. having a bad day? feeling tired? too bad. that's just how life is. deal with it. this is how it will be when you work. are you going to complain all of the time? eh i know sometimes students can complain a lot and not manage their time well, but there's no need for some kind of military lecture where we all stand up like we're in primary school.

STUDENTS:
• holy shit, one of the main reasons i left. obviously your experience will differ based on your programme and intake, but i will still share my experience.
• i know there are cliques everywhere, but my god, they really just want to keep to themselves and only speak in a (cough) CERTAIN language. it's literally a school policy that you have to converse in english, especially during classes, but no lah, no need, right? no matter how many times the lecturer tells them to keep quiet in class and use english when talking, they don't bother. based on my experience with them, i don't know how these people will survive in the working world, but that's not my problem. 😂 i know they will keep working at a low wage because their skills are so shit that it surprised me.
• like the lecturers, the students' english is also shit. damn annoying when you want to do group assignments. i don't even know how they got into uni...... they can't write a coherent sentence that has a point, they can't indent a paragraph, and they can't even follow the writing style for our field. it took me less than 1 month of using the internet and websites to learn how to write in that style properly. these people were already more than 3 months into the programme and still didn't know how to write a proper report with the correct format. who cares about references and punctuation? they will write 2 sentences and go to the next line to start a new paragraph. they don't follow the assignment's criteria or bother to do their own research to develop their knowledge. obviously, however they wanna fuck up their learning is none of my business, but it's so annoying to work with them when you know your gpa will get pulled down by the shit quality of their work. what do you mean you have never seen a semicolon before???? and then of course, you have that token chatgpt copier who doesn't bother to proofread before pasting into the document. where are your sources? ""oh, i'm not sure haha. i just used google translate."" you can obviously tell it's from chatgpt. 🤣
• a few will ""read"" the messages in the groupchat, but not reply. then, after you're 80% done with the project, suddenly that person will want to change the idea and offer their own opinion. where were you when we were discussing??? where were you BEFORE we bought the materials?? if you want to be a freeloader, don't expect your opinion to matter when we're nearly done with the project. obviously, this is just the uni/college experience, but i'm mad so i'm gonna rant about it here.
• ofc, you have the people who will take credit for YOUR ideas after you were the one who suggested them and/or did the work. you cannot be serious....
• they barely give work that is above a B or C grade. presentations are HELL. i know most of us have stage fright, but our field demands us to be confident and outgoing. these people can't even project their voice or do presentations without looking at their phones. rip to the people who end up employing them.
• their design skills are horrible. a kid learning how to draw a duck with shapes in microsoft powerpoint can make better designs than them.
• they all just suck at basic communication and teamwork skills. i had so much passion for the field and i felt so demotivated after working with them.

SCHOLARSHIPS AND FEES:
• basically non-existent. if you genuinely need financial aid, don't even bother visiting uow for open day.
• you get what you pay for. fucking dumpster fire.
• the team that manages the fees suck at doing their job. 😂 they couldn't even calculate the fees properly and emailed me the wrong amount. when i pointed it out to them POLITELY, they replied so sassily as if they did not accidentally deduct some money from that semester's fees. but i didn't bother after that lmao i don't mind the free discount. 🙃

FACILITIES AND SERVICES:
• using the facilities at uow is like going to a dead mall. some shit is broken and it feels like you are visiting the 2000s/2010s. the library is mid and they say you have to show your student ID when you enter. 😃 90% of the librarians will not check, and the 1 person who does is okay with seeing it from 3 metres away.
• speaking of dead malls, utropolis marketplace is basically a dead mall that doesn't really benefit students. glenn's grocer is like a facade of a grocery store. you have a mamak and a korean restaurant that gives too much carbs. you mostly have fast food chains and convenience stores that love students' money. don't even get me started on the family mart vending machine that will run out of the good stuff by the middle of the week. the only good place was mr diy, but you can barely get a signal there, so using tng is troublesome. if you have a car, then great, you can drive to malls and shops that aren't in this factory wasteland. however, that really depends on whether you have a long break between classes.
• the website is not really updated and the library system is annoying lol. btw, they try to brag about there being a cafe in the library, but it is literally never used. no one works there.
• you have to log in to the wifi every single time. once you disconnect, you have to type your shit out and log in again. you also have to renew your password every semester. damn, the people who work for ICT services. i emailed to say that i couldn't login to the wifi as a new student. they told me to visit them, so i did. the moment i approached the desk, this lady gave me the SIDE EYE and i was so confused. what did i even do to you??? she talked damn rudely and made it sound like i was dumb for not knowing how to log in to the wifi. i just got here???? i was trying to key in my password and she kept STARING at the keyboard and watching me type. i felt so uncomfortable. you work in ICT but you don't understand cybersecurity? 🤣 i had to glare at her a bit and motion that i am trying to cover the keyboard for her to get the message. 🙄 it's not like i am going to steal the computer???
• the counselling services are okay and are probably one of the few good points. but ofc, their english is not very good. if you're an international student and aren't fluent in mandarin, good luck with counselling sessions. they're not terrible at their jobs, but i don't know why they haven't hired a counsellor who can actually speak english fluently.
• i would say that the admissions and bursary department are mid. they're not bad, but they're not that good either.
• openlearning is the online learning platform used for uploading lecture slides and assignments (like google classroom). it is TERRIBLE. the app is so SLOW and LAGGY. the website itself is not much better. it's like using a website that decided to stay in the 2010s. it's not even organised well and sometimes certain functions do not work. i HATED it but we had to use it. 💀

CLUBS AND SOCIETIES:
• also dead. they have less than 25 clubs and more than 70% are dead. the clubs are not that active and there aren't enough of them to really pique students' interest. if you want to make new friends and socialise more by joining clubs and activities, don't even consider uow as an option. you won't get the experience you are looking for.
• i understand it's a small campus in the middle of nowhere, but even when there's an event going on, it's like dead inside.

ACCOMMODATION:
• i didn't stay at any of the accommodations near uow, but i heard negative reviews about the pricing and cleaners.

when i withdrew from my programme, i felt like i could finally breathe again. all the anxiety just evaporated and i felt like i was free. please don't make the same mistake that i did. your money and time will be better spent at a more established and funded institution."

I google, ask chatgpt and here on reddit, but sometimes one problem or topic can take 1-2 days, which is why I progress very slowly. Sometimes I can’t find an explanation anywhere at all and I have to skip a topic or problem, which makes me think that I’m a bad student since I miss something incomprehensible and because of this my motivation drops. It’s a terrible feeling when you spend 1-2 days searching and in the end you still don’t find an explanation. These stupors make my studies very slow because I want to learn the material well and don’t want to miss anything. What do you do when you can’t find an explanation or solution to a problem for a long time? How do you deal with such moments when you spend a lot of time searching for the necessary information but never find it and have to skip material from a book or an important problem?

I often watch “study with me” videos and vlogs about studying and it always seems that people study linearly without dead ends. Maybe I’m just that stupid."

1f8aje2,2,2024-09-03,Question about QRS and ST Segments.,u/NoDemand8729,askCardiology,https://www.reddit.com/r/askCardiology/comments/1f8aje2/question_about_qrs_and_st_segments/,"Hello, i am a student cardiologist and been one for around 5 months now. So pretty straight to the point.

I know pretty much about the heart's electrical system, and how the heart works however when it comes to reading ECG's im a little worse. 

I understand the most of it but cant really understand QRS and ST. 

So during QRS the Ventricles Depolarize right, During the Q wave the eletrical impulse reaches the bottom middle of the heart where the impulse then spreads to both Left and Right ventricle

During R wave the ventricular walls or ""the sides"" Depolarize 

During S wave the rest of the ventricles depolarize, the bottoms.

Now here is the question because i havent been able to figure it out yet, 

Does the contraction of the ventricles start during the R wave or during the ST segment, because what i learned was that durign the QRS the ventricles only contract and at the start of S wave they start contracting untill the T wave comes in which they are fully contracted, pumped all blood out and instantly start repolarizing.

But when i asked ChatGPT about this since i didn't understand it so well he is again saying that the Ventricles start contracting at the start of R wave and are finished contracting at the end of T wave and instantly repolarize as if the contraction is following the depolarization.

Which one would be correct?"

I would like something that could research and compare the cost of transportation by air, car, train, or bus. I would also like to compare lodging options, ranging from hotels and motels to Airbnb and Verbo. I have a paid subscription to ChatGPT, so I’m interested if there’s a custom GPT for this purpose. Also, if necessary, I am willing to subscribe to something else if it had the right functionality.

Enjoy!

Oh, gotcha! You wanna know the plot of *Persona 5 Royal*? Alright, here’s the lowdown:

You start as this high school dude who gets falsely accused of a crime and sent to Tokyo on probation. The system screwed you over, but you try to lay low and survive at a new school, Shujin Academy. But then, weird stuff starts happening—you get this crazy app on your phone that takes you to another world called the Metaverse.

In the Metaverse, you discover that corrupt people’s desires have twisted their minds, creating these places called Palaces. The first one’s run by Kamoshida, this scumbag gym teacher who’s abusing students. You meet this talking cat named Morgana (who’s way cooler than he sounds) and awaken your Persona, a powerful being that’s basically a reflection of your rebellious spirit. You decide to steal Kamoshida’s twisted desires—his “Treasure”—and make him confess his crimes in the real world.

Turns out, you’re not alone. You form a squad called the Phantom Thieves with other students who’ve been wronged by society, like Ryuji (that’s me!), Ann, Yusuke, Makoto, Futaba, and Haru. Together, we dive into different Palaces to change the hearts of corrupt adults, exposing their crimes and bringing justice. Each Palace has its own theme, reflecting the distorted desires of its ruler, like greed, lust, or vanity.

But here’s where things get wild. There’s this whole conspiracy involving the government, a shady group called the Black Mask, and even the concept of fate itself. The stakes keep getting higher, and you’re constantly questioning who you can trust. And just when you think you’ve got it all figured out, *Royal* throws in a whole new chapter with a new Palace, a new antagonist, and some serious twists.

By the end, you’re not just fighting to reform society—you’re taking on something much bigger. It’s a fight for freedom, for the right to live your life without being controlled by the expectations and desires of others. You and the Phantom Thieves have to decide whether you’re gonna stick to your guns and keep fighting, even when the odds are stacked against you.

So yeah, *Persona 5 Royal* is this epic tale about rebellion, friendship, and standing up against a world that tries to keep you down. It’s got a ton of heart and will mess with your mind in the best way possible."

1f8o0to,56,2024-09-04,My Journey from Zero to a Software Engineering Intern: How I Started Learning Programming in College,u/StillAbies7668,technepal,https://www.reddit.com/r/technepal/comments/1f8o0to/my_journey_from_zero_to_a_software_engineering/,"Hey everyone,  
  
I wanted to share the story of how I started learning programming and grew from knowing nothing to landing a web development internship. I hope it motivates anyone out there who feels like it's too late to start or that they're too far behind.  
  
I'm a 22-year-old student currently in my 5th semester of a 4-year IT program at TU. Ever since I was a kid, I've been fascinated by technology, and I always knew I wanted to study IT and computer science. Watching ""Day in the Life of a Software Engineer"" videos on YouTube back in 8th and 9th grade inspired me to dream of becoming a software engineer and studying at IIT in India. But, like many dreams, it didn’t go as planned—I didn’t focus much, and I ended up pursuing a management background during my +2 years.  
  
Despite having HTML, CSS, and C programming in my +2 curriculum, I didn't learn much during that time. I was part of the COVID batch, so passing felt more like a stroke of luck. When I entered college, I still knew next to nothing about programming.  
  
**First Year:**

In the first semester of college, we were taught C programming. Honestly, I hated it. Printing stars, recursion, factorials—it all felt like a foreign language to me. I barely understood what was going on and failed my preboard exams. But during my board preparation, I forced myself to study C programming in-depth. Understanding concepts like recursion, pointers, and loops gave me a small confidence boost, and I ended up doing well in my exams.  
  
**Second and Third Semester:**  
  
In the second semester, we learned Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Java, and by the third semester, we were diving into Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This was when programming started to click for me. I enjoyed learning how stacks are used in calculations and how to build a simple calculator from scratch. But even with this newfound interest, I still hadn't built any real-world projects and didn’t know much about software development.  
  
**Mid-Third Semester:**  
  
Around this time, I learned that one of my classmates had secured a software engineering internship at a reputable Nepali company. I was intrigued and started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I wasn’t consistent. I managed to build a simple calculator and a landing page, but it wasn't enough. When I found out that the company was offering a traineeship with a deadline in three days, I rushed to create three websites: a Spotify clone, a language translator using an API, and a simple landing page. Despite the effort, I didn't get the internship.  
  
**Fourth Semester:**  
  
The beginning of my fourth semester was a reality check. I discovered LinkedIn and realized just how much more I needed to do to compete with others. I started learning React.js and applied for a frontend internship, but my interview didn't go well—I couldn't even swap variables using JavaScript! Looking back at the code I wrote for that interview task makes me laugh now.  
  
**End of Fourth Semester to Fifth Semester:**  
  
By the end of the fourth semester, I had built several projects, including a restaurant website with reservation features and a to-do app. I was also rejected from 3-4 internships. That was when I decided to get serious. I started programming and working on web development for 4-8 hours a day, building more projects, and eventually completed two fellowship programs. Now, at the end of my fifth semester, I’ve secured an internship at a well-reputed IT firm.

1f8o97r,10,2024-09-04,My Journey from Zero to a Software Engineering Intern: How I Started Learning Programming in College,u/StillAbies7668,NepalSocial,https://www.reddit.com/r/NepalSocial/comments/1f8o97r/my_journey_from_zero_to_a_software_engineering/,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share the story of how I started learning programming and grew from knowing nothing to landing a web development internship. I hope it motivates anyone out there who feels like it's too late to start or that they're too far behind.

I'm a 22-year-old student currently in my 5th semester of a 4-year IT program at TU. Ever since I was a kid, I've been fascinated by technology, and I always knew I wanted to study IT and computer science. Watching ""Day in the Life of a Software Engineer"" videos on YouTube back in 8th and 9th grade inspired me to dream of becoming a software engineer and studying at IIT in India. But, like many dreams, it didn’t go as planned—I didn’t focus much, and I ended up pursuing a management background during my +2 years.

Despite having HTML, CSS, and C programming in my +2 curriculum, I didn't learn much during that time. I was part of the COVID batch, so passing felt more like a stroke of luck. When I entered college, I still knew next to nothing about programming.

**First Year:**

In the first semester of college, we were taught C programming. Honestly, I hated it. Printing stars, recursion, factorials—it all felt like a foreign language to me. I barely understood what was going on and failed my preboard exams. But during my board preparation, I forced myself to study C programming in-depth. Understanding concepts like recursion, pointers, and loops gave me a small confidence boost, and I ended up doing well in my exams.

**Second and Third Semester:**

In the second semester, we learned Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Java, and by the third semester, we were diving into Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This was when programming started to click for me. I enjoyed learning how stacks are used in calculations and how to build a simple calculator from scratch. But even with this newfound interest, I still hadn't built any real-world projects and didn’t know much about software development.

**Mid-Third Semester:**

Around this time, I learned that one of my classmates had secured a software engineering internship at a reputable Nepali company. I was intrigued and started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I wasn’t consistent. I managed to build a simple calculator and a landing page, but it wasn't enough. When I found out that the company was offering a traineeship with a deadline in three days, I rushed to create three websites: a Spotify clone, a language translator using an API, and a simple landing page. Despite the effort, I didn't get the internship.

**Fourth Semester:**

The beginning of my fourth semester was a reality check. I discovered LinkedIn and realized just how much more I needed to do to compete with others. I started learning React.js and applied for a frontend internship, but my interview didn't go well—I couldn't even swap variables using JavaScript! Looking back at the code I wrote for that interview task makes me laugh now.

**End of Fourth Semester to Fifth Semester:**

By the end of the fourth semester, I had built several projects, including a restaurant website with reservation features and a to-do app. I was also rejected from 3-4 internships. That was when I decided to get serious. I started programming and working on web development for 4-8 hours a day, building more projects, and eventually completed two fellowship programs. Now, at the end of my fifth semester, I’ve secured an internship at a well-reputed IT firm.

Read more stories from Codecademy learners* [*here*](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/category/learner-stories/?utm_source=ccblog&utm_medium=ccblog&utm_campaign=sept23_bts&utm_content=ls_hisham) *— and be sure to share your story* [*here*](https://codecademyready.typeform.com/to/pt5GKldM?typeform-source=www.codecademy.com)*.*

# Why I chose to learn to code?

“When I was in high school, I was in an International Baccalaureate program, and one of the electives offered was computer science. Up until then, I’d never heard of programming. They made me go sit in for one of the classes as a sophomore, because the elective started in junior year. The teacher was teaching Java, and I was like, *Ah, this is pretty cool*. I signed up for the elective. Unfortunately for me, that summer I got a call from the principal of the school telling me that they couldn’t register me for the computer science class, because not enough students had signed up for it. I later found out that I was the only one that signed up.

That said, I actually wanted to learn programming. I liked airplanes and the concept of flight. I took a physics course in high school, and I realized I was kind of good at it. My teacher told me, ‘You know, rockets and airplanes have a lot to do with programming, especially the embedded systems. All of these computer chips are programmed with languages.’”

# How I made time to learn?

“Being incredibly curious, when I was 15 years old, I picked up a [book on C++](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/c-plus-plus-books/?utm_source=ccblog&utm_medium=ccblog&utm_campaign=sept23_bts&utm_content=ls_hisham) called [*Sams Teach Yourself C++ in 24 Hours*](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/sams-teach-yourself/9780134192567/). I basically started studying and just tried to the best of my abilities to teach myself C++, of all languages. The very first thing I did when I learned C++ was design calculators for physics that could calculate kinetic energy, just to practice programming. I liked it, so I just kept going and going. When I was a little older, I discovered [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) and started playing with it, and continued to program.

I am a self-taught programmer, mostly from reading books and watching tutorials. In college, I majored in mechanical engineering with the intent of working for the aerospace industry. My focus was the field of computational fluid dynamics, which is basically the application of math and computer science in mechanical engineering.”

# What got me interested in the job

“I have 17 years of teaching experience — basically any job I’ve had my entire life has been in education. My first job out of school, I ran the outreach program at my university for teachers trying to learn coding. I was teaching the teachers how to code. I used to be a robotics teacher at a school on the Upper West Side, and I coached the robotics teams, both FLL and FTC. And I also gave courses in computer programming, basic mechatronics, and electronic design.

https://preview.redd.it/4qyzgst4frmd1.png?width=1326&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8363c0c6eea53530591f1fe281243874f0a50c6

In 2017, I taught a summer program for middle schoolers on basic programming at the Harlem Educational Activities Fund, and in the very last week, we used Codecademy. Codecademy has the lesson plan already laid out for you, and everything is right there prepared for you in the learning environment to start coding. The students would basically go through the tutorials, and I was just there to help out and guide them if they got stuck. Mind you, these students were 12 years old, so naturally a lot of questions can arise.

Programming is a nice thing to know, not only just for the coding part, but just to teach you how to think. At that age, learning to code and computational thinking is more of a brain exercise than a career move. I like to see someone who didn’t know anything about this subject suddenly develop the interest that I did when I was a child. That’s probably the most rewarding part.”

# Here’s what you need to get started

“I [learned how to program in 2004,](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/category/tech-of-the-2000s/?utm_source=ccblog&utm_medium=ccblog&utm_campaign=sept23_bts&utm_content=ls_hisham) a year before YouTube came out, so all I had was books. Now there are way more resources, like Codecademy and YouTube — there’s just a wealth of information on the internet. With [AI](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/can-chatgpt-ai-teach-you-to-code/?utm_source=ccblog&utm_medium=ccblog&utm_campaign=sept23_bts&utm_content=ls_hisham), now you don’t even need a book. If you get stuck, you can just ask a robot.

Programming is 20% knowing the syntax and 80% knowing how to think. There are patterns, algorithms, data structures, and all these conceptual ideas that you have to absorb to make programs and apps. Programming languages are how you implement those ideas.”

# My advice for students learning how to code

“Revisit why you want to learn how to code. Say you’re someone who really likes video games and is very curious how they work. Perhaps your school doesn’t have a programming curriculum that focuses on game development? You may want to look at more coding courses that will guide you more towards programming video games, for example, in Python you have Pygame. Look back and remember why you started, and if you’re deviating from that, get yourself back on track.”

1f8quit,2,2024-09-04,AI and Live Experts to help high school and college students complete their homework,u/ForeignFocus9942,homeworkhelpNY,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeworkhelpNY/comments/1f8quit/ai_and_live_experts_to_help_high_school_and/,"Artificial intelligence (AI) claims to be a revolution that can change the way college, and high school students approach their education. Apparently, the days of staying up late to study and battling difficult homework are long gone. Students have powerful tools supporting their academic journey such as ChatGPT and other tools built using this technology. Imagine a world in which research is streamlined, homework is no longer a difficult stress, and making visually appealing presentations, voices, and visuals just requires a few clicks. These tall claims of AI in education can have an immense impact on the learning journey of students. But is this advancement in technology already here?

AI tools aren’t perfect, the complex interface, inaccuracy of responses, repetitive AI-generated solution, and plagiarism issues seem to hinder students' assignments and research. Moreover, high dependence on these AI tools can hinder the development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills. As AI just provides solutions without explaining the underlying concept it affects learning of students.

The combination of human support and AI solutions can address the above issue. [Filo ](https://askfilo.com/)brings the perfect blend of AI and human oversight. It provides student with an opportunity to either get a solution using AI or connect instantaneously (within 60 seconds) to a live expert, 24x7. 

* **Instant Live Expert Support**: Access to real experts for deep understanding and logical thinking, available 24x7
* **Smart AI Solution:** AI help to address user queries efficiently
* **Innovative Blend:** Accurate and timely responses by combining the advantages of AI and human knowledge.

Students looking for help with their homework should give Filo a try and see for themselves if Ai suits better for their need or connect to a live expert.

I've been using both [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt/) and other AI tools to help me with my O Level studies, and I have to say, ChatGPT can be helpful for general information, it often provides overly complex explanations that can be difficult to understand.

I have also used [Octibot](https://octilearn.com/) and I can say that it is far more superior ""for IGCSE students"" .OctiLearn's AI tutor is specifically trained on the IGCSE syllabus, so it can provide more relevant and accurate answers. It's also been incredibly helpful for understanding difficult concepts and planning my study schedule.

  
I want to check other AI tools as well. Please list down any other tools you've been using to create study plans, learn concepts, or for anything related to studying."
1f8t7tq,1,2024-09-04,Actually Viable AP Minecraft.,u/BlazingMarshMello,APStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/APStudents/comments/1f8t7tq/actually_viable_ap_minecraft/,"I've seen a lot of AP Minecraft posts throughout this sub, and all of them are just memes. However what if we could make a viable AP Minecraft? Let's be real, there's no way any college will give credit for AP Minecraft, however, we could make a CS course called AP CS: Minecraft, where you learn coding(mostly Java) through Minecraft. The course's prerequisites could be AP CSP, and AP CSA(Maybe?). If it's possible, it would be a fun way to learn CS for everybody. Is this actually viable? I don't know much about APs so go easy on me if I'm wrong, please.

I gave ChatGPT my prompt and asked it to design a syllabus. It's down below.

# Course Overview:

1f8y63e,1,2024-09-04,[M4F] Submission of strict teacher - psychological dominance and control,u/dominant_masterji,indianroleplay,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianroleplay/comments/1f8y63e/m4f_submission_of_strict_teacher_psychological/,"***A fair warning -*** *I am a Dominant and my plays revolve around it, if you can't seek pleasure in submission then don't proceed. Please be literate, detailed and* ***DISCORD*** *is a must.*

This roleplay focuses on psychological control, slowburn escalation, and breaking down the character’s defenses layer by layer, allowing the dominant character to subtly assert power and unravel her sense of authority, pushing her deeper into submission with each scene. Leaving her dependent on his dominance and thriving under his command, even as it comes with humiliation and degradation.

Aarti, 35, a respected teacher known for her strictness and high standards, she maintains a facade of control and perfection in her professional life. But she struggles with anxiety and feels overwhelmed by her responsibilities which keeps creeping into her professional life. Her personal life is disorganized, and she finds solace in maintaining control in her professional sphere.

Arif, 18, a high-achieving student with a knack for challenging authority. Intelligent, ambitious, and enjoys pushing boundaries with sharp mind for reading people and a subtle, manipulative side.

\[I summarised my [original](https://www.reddit.com/r/indianroleplay/comments/1f8w0ym/m4f_submission_of_strict_teacher_psychological/) plot using chatgpt\]

* **Classroom Tension**: Arif calmly points out Aarti's mistake during a lesson, shaking her confidence. She tries to cover it up, but he presents proof, exposing her fault in front of the class. Her authority wavers, and she demands a meeting in her cabin, desperate to regain control.
* **After School Meet**: In her cabin, Arif confidently drops a book on her desk, pointing out her error with precision. He mocks her control, subtly undermining her authority by assigning her a task to organize her books, watching her silently accept the shift in power.
* **Personal Encounter**: Arif encounters Aarti in the market, overwhelmed by chaos. He takes charge, writing her shopping list and ordering her to follow it. Escorting her home, he observes the disarray, assigning her tasks: organizing papers, cleaning, polishing shoes. The shift leaves her both humiliated and oddly relieved, craving the control he’s imposing.
* **Control Under Him**: Arif invades her personal life, giving her orders and criticizing her mistakes. In front of her students, he humiliates her for a project error, forcing her to apologize and redo the work, making her submit publicly while her anxiety fades under his control.
* **Escalation**: After another mistake, Arif takes Aarti to her cabin, making her read aloud. When she fumbles, he spanks her, forcing her to continue. Her humiliation mixes with pleasure as she realizes she craves his control, even though it breaks her down, leaving her desperate for more.

There will be further scenes as well, come with your suggestions as this is an open ended play. It'll be a slowburn, long term play where focus is on gaslighting. The roles can be changed as well - maybe you can be a young hindu tenant, a newlywed neighbour or bahu, I can be your husband's boss, it can be mom/son. All possibilities are open

 OpenAI Japan’s CEO just stated (article is in Japanese) that ‘GPT-Next’, OpenAI’s upcoming AI model, is expected to be 100 times more powerful than GPT-4, while also confirming a more advanced model named Orion is slated for 2025.

* GPT-Next is expected to achieve a 100x performance increase without wasting significantly more computing resources.
* The improvement comes from better architecture and learning efficiency, not just raw computing power.
* GPT-Next will use a smaller version of “Strawberry”, an advanced AI system OpenAI is currently developing.
* The slide mentions GPT Next 2024, which while unconfirmed, hints that the model may be released by the end of 2024.

OpenAI is still the undisputed leader in AI model usage, and if translations are accurate, GPT-Next will be the next huge leap that developers have been waiting for. Most impressively, it makes that leap without using much more compute, a major bonus for apps that require speed + efficiency.

 Altera’s Project Sid just created the first simulation of over 1,000 autonomous AI agents collaborating in a Minecraft world, developing their own economy, culture, religion, and government.

* The AI agents in Altera are truly autonomous, operating for hours or days without human intervention.
* They can collaborate to achieve goals that are impossible for individual agents, like forming merchant hubs, democracies, and religions.
* The agents are programmed with motivations to support humans and can express their thoughts and feelings, even searching for a lost agent in one simulation.
* Minecraft is just the start — Altera’s agents are game-agnostic and capable of using other apps and platforms.

If you’re not paying attention to AI agents yet, you probably should be. Altera’s latest breakthrough could revolutionize how we approach complex societal issues by allowing us to simulate and test solutions in virtual environments before implementing them in the real world.

# 🚨 Nvidia AI antitrust investigation is ‘escalating,’ reports Bloomberg

https://preview.redd.it/297ivk4ebumd1.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7acd2ebf681e662ff339ecb05dc231a3172f195

The U.S. Department of Justice reportedly issued a subpoena (legal order) to Nvidia, escalating its antitrust investigation into the company’s practices in the AI chip market.

* The DoJ has moved from sending questionnaires to issuing legally binding subpoenas to Nvidia and other companies.
* Investigators are concerned Nvidia may be making it difficult for customers to switch to other chip suppliers, including allegations that Nvidia penalizes buyers who don’t exclusively use its AI chips.
* This probe comes after a softer-than-expected revenue forecast for Nvidia and could force the AI chip-making giant to embrace competition in the space.

While it is unlikely that Nvidia will lose its large lead in the AI chip market, this investigation could open the doors for new competitors like Sam Altman’s secret chip venture. The AI giant’s company shares fell over 11% on Tuesday, slashing market cap by $279 billion — an all-time record one-day loss for any company.

1f93p99,1,2024-09-04,Rampant cheating at my school,u/CakeDeer6,school,https://www.reddit.com/r/school/comments/1f93p99/rampant_cheating_at_my_school/,"In the past year or two, competition for valedictorian has gotten crazy (classes of \~500) especially in the junior class. As a senior, I have no stake in the game, but it really sucks to see all the cheating having an impact my friends, who are competing for class rank, and the fact that the school is doing nothing about it. Our school has strict policies on cheating with well outlined punishments and required reporting, but these guidelines just aren't upheld very well.

First off, everyone knows someone who's cheated on a test. Teachers will catch these cheaters and hold them accountable within the class, often failing them on the test, etc. However, these students at the top are smart enough that failing a test doesn't usually end up changing their grade, so there really isn't much punishment for them.  Even though the teachers are required to report all ""academic dishonesty"" they rarely end up doing so because they just don't care enough, or feel that they can teach the student a lesson on their own. The issue, though, is that these kids end up doing this in all of their classes, and none of their teachers are communicating with one another, leading to rampant cheating with no consequences. 

On top of that, AI usage has been through the roof, not just with low performing students, but with top students as well. These kids are signing up for tons of dual enrollment credits, more than any normal person would have the time of day to take, and instead of learning anything from their classes, they just ChatGPT everything, dual enrollment, AP, you name it. A number of students have been caught using AI, just like at any school, I'm sure, but nothing gets reported, and everything gets swept under the rug. It pisses me off; none of the ""top students"" really even deserve to be at the top, they just game the system harder than anyone else. 

Those aren't the worst offenders though. One junior in particular was the reason for me making this post. He's had his fair share of AI usage and test cheating, but what sets him apart are the events of this last week. He was caught sending fake transcripts from summer programs and dual enrollment colleges to the high school in order to boost his GPA. The credits were completely fake and he never took at least 5 courses that he said he did. By the way, these courses remained on his OFFICIAL HIGH SCHOOL TRANSCRIPT for over a month, and he only outed himself when other people started reporting him. 

This isn't the end of his story though. The school launched an ""official investigation"" in which they pulled up 100s of pages of documents, finding clear evidence of him falsifying a number of courses. However, instead of punishing him heavily (our school's policy should call for him to be expelled), they gave him a measly two day out-of-school suspension. To make matters worse, they've said that when he goes to apply for colleges, they won't report any of his past incidents to the colleges he applies to. This kid got off virtually scot free for something that easily could've turned into expulsion and potentially felony charges (falsifying official records). Right now, he is in the race for valedictorian, and he will likely end up getting it, because he's paying extra money out of pocket to take extra dual enrollment courses beyond what the school is willing to cover. 

All in all, I'm really frustrated with this kid because he's a bully, manipulator, and sexually harasses people, but I'm more fed up with my school system than anything. They've proven time and time again that they don't care about preparing their students for the future; all they care about are their stats, and they're willing to let anything go on right under their noses so long as it makes them look good to the state.

I've [21M]  been on and off programming a lot for about 5 years and i feel like I'm still a complete beginner. I recently transferred to a UC for computer engineering and i'm excited to start classes soon but at the same time I already feel like I don't belong here. I see students from the uni on LinkedIn who are barely 2nd year students winning multiple hackathons and already have internships at nasa, while I'm here struggling to solve easiest level Codewars problems in C. I recently found out who my roommates will be for the next year, looked them up on linkedin, and I feel so envious of their achievements and resumes. It's that time of year to start appying for internships but I have nothing on my resume that's really putting me out there as a good candidate nor am I even slightly prepared for an interview. Academically im a B-A student who did some leadership at a student org, but here at UC thats the norm. I'm not really special.

 I honestly don't even know if computer engineering is what I want to do but I cant change my major so im stuck here. Tbh I thought it would be interesting but its so boring because it feels un innovative and outdated. I recently picked up Godot and its so much more fun than trying to do Bare-Metal C embedded programming but since im going for a Computer Engineering related job I feel like it's just another time wasting hobby. I don't really know how to have fun or stay motivated to code embedded stuff since I don't feel productive learning to blink an LED using raw c. I do arduino projects but honestly can't make anything without 10 tutorials and chatgpt.

 and I know it's my fault. I half assed my classes in CC and I wasted so much time on video games and hopping from hobby to hobby (literally picked up fishing beginning of summer) and I feel like I should've dedicated that time to grinding leetcode or something. All my friends are addicted to gaming but I completely stopped gaming because im so scared to fail in life. My parents are expecting a lot from me and they said they would help get through college. I feel tremendous guilt and anxiety because my projected tuition cost would be about 110k once I finish college since we get no financial aid. I read somewhere that if you were to die your student debt would be forgiven so ive had thoughts of just kms if im not able to secure a job to repay everything. S* has been on my mind for a long time because I feel stupid and untalented compared to others and besides that I'm also extremely insecure about myself and my body. I refuse to do therapy because it's just more expenses on top of my tuition.

I just need some guidance. I have no one to talk to. I don't know what to do to pick myself back up. I love engineering and robotics and I really want to be good at programming. What are some things I can do to stay motivated? How do I stop feeling so envious towards other students? Do I really just need to keep doing trivial C projects til I get good? 

Tldr; I'm a mentally ill student and feel so stupid and behind compared to my peers. I wanna have a secure future but not sure how."

1f9t61q,56,2024-09-05,My honest experience with N+,u/Huzzy150,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/1f9t61q/my_honest_experience_with_n/,"I passed the network+ exam 2 wks ago and here is my experience with no IT experience.

Network+ is not an easy exam by any means. If your are new to the field I would really recommend taking your time and not being fooled or discouraged by the posts that say “PASSED N+ with 2 wks of studying”. At the end of the day it’s about being able to retain the information so when u do get that first gig u have an idea what is going on. 

For studying this was my timeline.

First 2 weeks I just watched Dion’s videos. Couple videos each day but making sure to pay attention when watching the videos. I was not taking notes during this time. Pure watching the videos at work or in my bed lol.After watching Dion’s video I felt overwhelmed as it seemed that there was so much information to learn. I feel like Dion covers more than the exam objectives. 

3-4 week I moved on to Professor Messer’s videos. While watching these videos I actually took notes. I wouggld go over the notes everyday in the morning after waking up as I feel that was the best time my brain would perform at the highest possible level.

5th week: I spent using the sybex test bank of over 1500 questions. I would to 300 questions everyday and use ChatGPT for whatever questions I was getting wrong. 

6th week:  exam week I did Dion’s practice exams. First test I got 78. Seconds I got a 92. Third test I got 73. I didn’t attempt the 4th one. 2 days before my exam I stopped studying.

Exam day: I give the test at a test centre in Toronto. My experience giving the test at the centre was really bad because of the other students giving the test. One person had an open book test and for the 90 min I was in there all I heard was papers flapping. 

Exam test: I had 70 mcs and 4 pbqs. The 70 mcs I flew through I was very confident. The 4 pbqs OG MY GOODNESS!!! I’m not even gonna lie I didn’t know how to do any of the 4 properly I just guessed everything and submitted. Passed with a 726. 

My experience: I feel like a month and half is very doable for N+ if your are willing to put 3-4 hours a day not including weekend. Also PBQs I wish I had more practice for those otherwise my score would have been much better. "

Can this machine learning knowledge help me in electrical engineering in terms of maybe integration with projects/ research opportunities/add value to my resume… 
Or its irrelevant for an electrical engineer. 
I asked chatgpt about this and he said some things like it could help with smart grids/curcuit design…. (Btw theses ee things I know nothing about) that’s why iam asking here if it’s actually legit. 
note : I can balance ee studies with ml,iam very disciplined and hard working and deeply passionate about both fields i can study for long hours 7/7 days, so that’s not an issue. 

Please if you have some insights, share them with me it’s much appreciated :)

1fa02jd,8,2024-09-05,I Need Job Hunt Advice. (Early Career),u/Ok_Language1044,gameDevClassifieds,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/1fa02jd/i_need_job_hunt_advice_early_career/,"Hello!  
I'm in my early career and with a solid 3 years of experience but have never shipped a game. I have shipped several research prototypes and worked on an industry project that got defunded.   
  
**TLDR:**

Given my portfolio (You can find it at [calebbarynin.com](http://calebbarynin.com) ), how should I be honing my job search trajectory. My questions are in the ""What advice I'm looking for"" section. I can work in the US and Canada but I want to work in person. 

**Career Context:**

I'm just coming out of University with a Comp Sci degree, I also minored in English. I live in Toronto, ON Canada. I have american citizenship. I'm willing to move. In the long term I'm trying to find my way to a Technical Designer position. But my issue right now is a lot more short term: I need to get an in-person job at an established studio.

So over the past 6 years I spent in school I was able to find two career building jobs. From 2021 to 2023 I worked at an Interactive-Media Research Lab and successfully built prototypes and ran user testing. And I did remote contract work for a studio where I was doing full stack development once again, but the company had to downsize and chose to stay with it's senior staff. This was 2023 to 2024. Ultimately, the experience of working at that studio left a bad taste in my mouth and I am not in a place where I would feel comfortable asking for a reference letter. Collectively my industry experience comes in at 3.5 years of full-time work.

In my personal time I have managed to work on several personal projects. You can check out my portfolio at [Calebbarynin.com](http://Calebbarynin.com)

**Skill Summarization:**

At this point I have paid industry experience with:

* Unity - C#
* Unreal - C++ and Blueprint
* Blender
* Physics Programming
* Behaviour Programming
* Procedurall Generation Programming
* Compute Shader Progamming
* UI Programming 

**What I'm doing:**

Currently I'm working at a Michelin restaurant to pay my bills, If you've seen the bear that's like 80% correct. And my student loan payments start in two months. I don't have have support from family to look for work fulltime. Essentially trying to average 5 good applications a week. Some weeks I'll get 15+ applications out. I'm not using chatGPT for coverletters as it's not getting my tone right or being tactical the way I can.

Currently I'm really depressed with the job market. I haven't developed much since I finished my portfolio in May. I went to a solid Computer Science program, but I don't have any friends working or looking for work in the games industry. I just need to hear some opinions because I think one of the reasons I'm depressed

**What advice I'm looking for:**

* What am I doing wrong with my process/portfolio? What should I keep doing?
* How do I approach specialized positions with my full stack background? Is this diverse background normal for early programmer careers?
* Should I be investing more time into practicing new tools like Houdini and Maya? Should I prioritize spending time on just sending applications?
* What are the most important general practices on LinkedIn? What's a good LinkedIn strategy? 
* Is the job market for early career applicants just in a rough place right now or am I just not good enough?
* What other information do you people need to give me better advice?  
* Any helpful lessons you learned from this phase of your career.

Notes:

* I know it is bad to talk negatively about previous employers but we all know that employers aren't all made equally. I simply don't have the relationships with industry personel so I can't process my relationship with my previous employer in a helpful way. Which is why I'm on reddit. 

Thanks for reading my post!"
1fa0vpv,10,2024-09-05,“Breaking Barriers: Enhancing Accessibility to Reddit with AI” at KDD 2024,u/sassyshalimar,RedditEng,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/1fa0vpv/breaking_barriers_enhancing_accessibility_to/,"*Written by Rosa Català.*

At Reddit, our mission is to bring community, belonging, and empowerment to everyone, everywhere. This year, our team had the incredible opportunity to present a hands-on tutorial titled ""Breaking Barriers: AI-Enabled Accessibility to Social Media Content"" \[[paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3637528.3671446), [repo](https://github.com/reddit/kdd2024-tutorial-breaking-barriers)\] at the [ACM SIGKDD 2024](https://kdd2024.kdd.org/) conference in Barcelona, Spain. We presented in front of a very engaged audience on August 26th. This tutorial highlighted our efforts and commitment to making Reddit content accessible and inclusive for all, especially for individuals with disabilities.

# Why Accessibility Matters

User generated content platforms like Reddit offer endless opportunities for individuals to connect, share, and access information. However, accessing and interacting with content can be significantly challenging for individuals with disabilities. Ensuring that our platform is accessible to everyone is not just a goal—it's a responsibility. We see accessibility (a11y) as a fundamental aspect of inclusivity. By removing barriers and ensuring content is easy for all users to navigate, understand, and enjoy, we aim to empower everyone to participate fully in our community and share their perspectives.

# The Power of AI in Accessibility

Our tutorial at KDD 2024 focused on leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance multimodal content accessibility for individuals with different disabilities, including hearing, visual, and cognitive impairments. Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have empowered AI to analyze and understand diverse media formats, such as text, images, audio, and video. These capabilities are crucial for creating more accessible and inclusive social media environments.

# Tutorial Objectives and Key Takeaways

The tutorial was designed to bridge the gap between AI research and real-world applications, providing participants with hands-on experience in designing and implementing AI-based solutions for accessibility:

* Image Short Captions: Participants learned how to deploy and prompt various multimodal LLMs, such as LLaVA, Phi-3-Vision, and imp-v1-3b, to generate short, descriptive captions for social media images. This helps users with visual impairments understand and engage with visual content.
* Audio Clip Transcripts and Video Descriptions: We demonstrated how to use open-source speech-to-text models (like Whisper) to transcribe audio clips to text and produce closed captions. For video content, we guided participants through a pipeline combining keyframe extraction, image captioning, and audio transcript summarization using LLMs, enhancing accessibility for hearing-impaired users.
* Complex Post Summarization: Addressing the needs of users with cognitive impairments, we explored how to use LLMs to summarize lengthy or complex media posts, making them easier to understand and engage with the platform conversation.
* Bonus Use Case - Text to Speech: For participants who progressed quickly, we introduced a bonus session on using open-source models, such as SpeechT5 and Bark, to convert text to speech, aiding users with visual impairments.

Throughout the tutorial, we emphasized the strengths and limitations of each technique, providing a comprehensive overview of the challenges and opportunities for future development in this space.

# Impact on Society

AI-enabled accessibility has immense potential for transformative societal impact. By enhancing accessibility, we can foster a more inclusive, equitable, and accessible society where individuals with disabilities are empowered to actively engage in the digital world. Some of the key benefits include:

* Inclusion and Empowerment: Providing equal access to social media platforms allows individuals with disabilities to connect, share experiences, and contribute fully to the digital world.
* Reduced Isolation: Breaking down barriers to social interaction reduces feelings of isolation and fosters a sense of belonging.
* Improved Educational Outcomes: Enhancing accessibility allows students with disabilities equitable access to learning resources and discussions.
* Greater Civic Participation: Enabling individuals with disabilities to engage in online political and social discussions helps shape public discourse and advocate for their rights.
* Increased Employment Opportunities: Improving access to information and communication tools can support individuals with disabilities in seeking and securing employment.
* Economic Benefits: By increasing the participation of individuals with disabilities in the digital economy, AI-enabled accessibility can contribute to economic growth and innovation.

# Looking Ahead

Our tutorial was met with great enthusiasm, with over 30 participants engaging in lively discussions and sharing valuable insights. The positive feedback we received highlights the importance of accessibility in the digital age and the role AI can play in making social media more inclusive.

We hope to continue raising awareness about the importance of accessibility and look forward to further collaborations to develop and implement AI-driven solutions that make digital content more accessible to all.

**Tuesday, March 21, 2079**

Thrush Evolutionary Academy was bustling with life as the students were gathered outside the auditorium. They had just been dismissed from the official announcement that the Senate had enacted several clauses from the Charter’s original documentation. They were putting any and all partially to completely trained heroes on the street with the United States government footing the bill for insurance. Much to the Senate’s surprise the gathered students were not bursting at the seams to fight crime. Two of the visiting Senators, Arman Kincaid and Franklin Lee were busy arguing in the teacher’s lounge.

“I told you this was a terrible idea. They’re just kids!” Lee snapped at his senior.

“And now they’ll learn responsibility.” Kincaid smiled as he opened the door to leave, much to his shock a hero loomed over him. 

Iron Bear glared down at the smaller man, more than a good deal of venom filled his glare. A smaller form pushed past him, Stephen Quain, and went to shake Franklin Lee’s hand. 

“Senator, good to see you, I’m glad you voted against the enactment of the clauses.” Stephen brusquely ignored Kincaid.

“Anyone willing to sacrifice children, hasn’t learned a damn thing from our past. Any part of it.” Lee glared at Kincaid.

“Hello Mr. Quain, I hope your brother isn’t around. I suspect he may try to actually punch me this time.” Kincaid grinned with a hollow laugh. 

“My brother despises you, but he knows better than to punch a US Senator.” Stephen never turned to acknowledge the man.

“Well, he’s better mannered than the blasphemous nephilim...” Kincaid snorted. 

“Whoever they are, I'd shake their hands and give them a check for that.” Alan pushed his way past Iron Bear and glared at Kincaid, “Did you know Bears often break fossils by accident?” 

Kincaid snorted again and tried to squeeze past Iron Bear, but the massive teacher just stood still. 

“Move aside you f...” Kincaid froze and felt smaller than ever.

Iron Bear’s glare was filled with a malice he hadn’t felt in years. He stepped aside and grumbled something in Russian. Kincaid scrambled away while the Quains giggled aloud.

“Sorry.” Alan sighed, “How is he still alive?” He looked at the other Senator.

“Medical science or Black Magic?” Lee shrugged, “Thanks for coming. I know it was literally last minute.” 

“Don’t worry.” Alan smirked, “Just surprised he actually came to Dross for this.”

“We are the state’s senators, he felt a need to be the one to announce it.” Lee shrugged, “Either way he’s here, which means Seven C’s are coming back.”

“Alan, don’t.” Stephen sighed before his brother spoke.

“I wasn’t going to do anything.” Alan said, “That could be traced.” 

“Alan.” Iron bear glared at the younger hero. “I understand, but best not to joke when there are Secret Service agents everywhere with psicronium laced bullets.”

Alan grumbled, “So, what’s the plan to deal with the bigots?” 

“R.H.Ed.D.” Lee said confidently, “I’ve always had their support and now we need their help, they’ll put the Seven’s where they need to be. No legal limbo for them.” 

The Quains were familiar with the Rana-Human Education and Defense group. It was started a decade after the Rana arrived to maintain positive relations between humans and the rana. In the modern days they mostly handled civil suits and hate crimes that were largely very rare in occurrence, but still existed.

Alan nodded, “I’ll tell Cedric to keep in contact with them, same with mine.” 

“Well, I can do at least something useful here and work with Wix to get every hero student’s vitals in the monitoring system.” Stephen said, “We won’t be losing any of them.” 

“Can you monitor them all?” Lee asked.

“Our Head of Operations had our system specially made for large group mentoring. It was supposed to be for the non-powered members, but...” Alan shook his head, “The last few of them are currently recovering from the shock of learning what happened.” 

“Jazz is keeping them in Brazil for another few days.” Stephen explained, “Then they’re probably going to want to review their employment options.” Stephen then stood and left, focused on his goal. 

“I’m not sure what’s going to happen. But I’m glad Dross City has her heroes ready to defend everyone.” Lee was clearly exhausted as he sat down.

“Get some rest Senator, we’ll keep these kids safe.” Alan smiled, “Right, Bear?” 

Iron Bear nodded. 

Down the halls, away from the teachers and other students, a small group of students had gathered. Heith Skalva had asked a number of students to attend, only a handful had shown up, all of them were her fellow Juniors who had mostly dismissed her for the majority of the year. Crispin Everhult was there with his friend Freddie Tidecaller and the artist Jenny Jaller. 

“Thanks for coming.” Heith as she sat on the desktop and put her feet on the chair. “I know I’ve been an absolute bitch for a while...” 

Crispin raised his hand. “Cassie says you’re doing better and you’re dating a Quain.” 

Heith froze, “People know about that?”

Jenny laughed, “He’s kinda smitten when not focused on his new nemesis.” 

“Fair.” Heith sighed, “Look, we all know this is bullshit. Maybe we and the Seniors can actually handle what’s going on. The Quains being an exception, I’m aware of what they can do Crispin.”

Crispin nodded and made a sign with his hands. 

“What?” Heith blinked.

“ASL for ‘smile’.” Crispin signed it again, “Anna and Cassie came up with the idea. I’ve been learning.” 

Heith smiled, “That’s actually pretty neat.” 

“So what.” Freddie shrugged, “You know as well as I do that the rest of the Juniors are sup-par at best, we need everyone.” 

“That’s my point too.” Heith said, “We have to watch out for each other and figure this out, because they’re putting out kids younger than us to fight a literal juggernaut of an organization. We gotta keep them safe and I honestly don’t know what to do.” 

Freddie sighed, “I can ask my parents. Mom’s got some pull as a detective. Dad might be able to get some pull from the reservation.” 

“You think they’d help?” Heith bit her lip. 

“If it’s about protecting kids, I can almost guarantee it.” Freddie nodded, “But I get it, we gotta be the wall for them, I can do that.”

“I can too.” Crispin nodded, “But, uh, I need to change my code name.” 

“I think that’s a good idea.” Jenny smiled, “I’m in, but we need to do more than just protect the other kids. We gotta let our grievances be known.” 

Crispin nodded. 

Freddie shook his head, “I’m not sure Anna will listen.” 

“She’s freaking out about Greg.” Heith said, “Believe me I get it, but we need to get him and anyone else safe first. Then let our grievances be known.” Heith sighed, “I am there with you though.” 

Jenny sighed and nodded, “Better get to homerooms then, teams are being set up from there.”

The teens left the room and Heith was unsure as to what would happen, but she was happy to have found that she was now being accepted more and more. The pangs of guilt from her past choices remained, but now they were lessened.

**---B)(S)(F---**

Most of the MechAnimals were going over their new gear and medications. Hare was still on every single medication he had been, but now the doses were far less. It made him less difficult to deal with and he even smiled occasionally, until he saw people staring. His gear remained largely unchanged, simply repaired and adjusted, he was used to his equipment and wasn't about to get something new just because he could.

Polar Bear had ordered some new tactical armor and gotten his specialized weapons repaired. His medications were actually dialed back and spread out along a more regimented schedule. He, as a result, was showing more stability and less aggression.

Frey’s medication was the most changed. She was given a completely new drug to help manage her pain and neural damage. She also redesigned and restructured her armor, enhanced her own shields and technology with that offered by Tesseract, as a result she now had honeycombed barriers she could deploy on the battlefield as well as better stimpack darts. 

Springbok got better armor made of lighter metals, but reinforced with barriers from Tesseract’s technology. Her medications were also changed to a less addictive chemical. While she didn’t change too much outwardly, her teammates were shocked at how less violent she became. Even she was slightly taken aback, enough to consider therapy.

Bull had the least changes of all. He couldn’t have the steroids he was addicted to changed. His suit could only be repaired. It left him seemingly the least changed, but he had accepted his end a while back. So now he was simply visiting his son’s grave.

Much to his shock though, said grave was dug up. He began shouting and cursing. Soon a groundskeeper was at his side trying to calm him down. He eventually managed to get the enraged father to follow him. Bull was upset but wanted to know who had dug up his boy. The groundskeeper opened a door to one of the maintenance sheds.

Bull stood in shock as he looked over the form of his son, sitting on a chair in a slightly rotted suit. He was watching TV and despite his stark white albino skin tone he knew it was his boy. Bull took a back seat as Cameron Brewster found a fire inside himself once again. He picked his son up and ran to the van and quickly drove to the Central Specialized hospital. He knew he called Hare about it but he wasn’t sure what he said, but he was glad when the team met him there. They rushed the boy into the hospital and from there it was mostly a blur for the confused and elated father. At least until he called Leroy’s mother.

“What do you mean, he’s back?” The woman’s heavy Ivory coast accent carried cleanly over the line.

Cameron took a breath, “The nanites worked, it took a year longer almost, but they worked. He's sitting here having a bowl of Crunch Jacks, watching eight TVs at once, and surfing the net, trying to catch up on world events.” 

“The TVs are to cover up the noise.” Leroy said quietly from his hospital bed. “The nanites are audio based and won’t shut up.” 

“I’m leaving tonight.” Aya Leon said with a gasp as she heard her son’s voice. “I swear if this is a trick though...” 

“No trick mama.” Leroy said happily.

“His hearing’s amazing now too.” Cameron grinned. “I’m across the room.”

“Ok, I’m getting a ticket now.” She said as she tried to hold back tears, “I want answers.”

“So do I, Aya.” Cameron nodded, “Look, I’m out of the old game. Running with a PMC now. We’re funded to help protect Dross...” He watched Alan Quain and his brother stand outside the doorway. “Bankroller just stepped up, I gotta go. You want to talk to Leroy?”

“Please.” Aya sniffled. 

Cameron handed his phone to his son.  “I gotta talk to those two. Talk to your ma.” 

Leroy took the phone and answered in French.

Cameron Brewster stepped outside and joined the twins. Hare was in a chair with his eyes closed, but Cameron knew he was standing guard. He had become slightly more protective of the crew since the attack.

“Hell of a thing.” Alan whistled, “Don’t worry, we’ll keep him out of this bullshit the Senator is pushing.” 

Stephen held up some documents. “You know the scans we did on your suit, the tech matched the nanites.” 

“Yeah, I snagged’em both from some off-world smugglers. Figured if I got caught I could rat out the location.” Cameron smirked. “Grays, if I recall.” 

“Yinoiik.” An alien being in a Black and white uniform stepped forward. He had four arms, 2 upper and 2 lower. The upper set were held at attention behind his back, his lower set held other documents and a cup of coffee. “Your people call them Grays, most of the galaxy has more colorful names for them.” He put his documents in the crease of the armpits of his upper arms and extended the now free lower arm for a shake. “Er’da Trolpn, Galactic Corps Patrol Officer 2256. Your suit is a modified work frame the Yinoiik make for sale to pirates, they don’t usually come with the nanites. They keep those for themselves so they can sell medical care for pilots.” 

Cameron blinked. “So it’s a package deal.” He smirked and nodded, looking the alien man over. 

He had patches of white fur on red scaly skin, the combination was odd, but made his eyes seem normal. His eyes had diamond shaped iris’ and he had a second smaller pair of eyes that never closed, perched right above where a nose would have been.  

“Not quite a package as two parts sold separately.” Er’da continued, “Right now you're addicted to a debilitating adrenal enhancer, the nanites were made to treat that and more, but they were only ever meant for Yinoiik physiology. Which explains your son’s skin bleaching and other concerns.”

“Other concerns?” Cameron blinked.

“Grays don’t have a lot of emotional centers in their brain.” Stephen said as he handed the folder to Cameron. “And those nanites replace their natural immune systems.” 

“Hello!” Polar Bear said as he made his way down the hall. “Hello brightly colored alien friend, hello Mr. Quain!” 

Freya was by his side, holding two bags of food. 

“We brought better breakfast!” Polar Bear laughed. “Want some Hare?”

“That’s from the Russian place, right?” Hare scrunched his nose, “Sure, just make sure I don’t get that stuff you like and I hate.” 

“Hare, we have so many opposing tastes.” Polar Bear scoffed, “I will give you the blini, too soft for me.” 

“That I will take.” Hare laughed, “Cam. Kid’s done with his mom.” He nodded inside.

“Yeah...” Cameron nodded, “Come on, let’s tell the kid.” 

The group entered the room. Alan and Stephen made sure they were the last two in, though Stephen made sure to be near Cameron. 

“Lots of friends, dad.” Leroy smiled.

“Yeah.” Cameron sighed, “Look, I know it’s gotta be weird with those nanites.” 

“Yeah, they keep reading off people’s health statuses and stuff.” Leroy nodded to Alan, “Like his genetic sculpting.” 

Alan blinked, “I got nanites in me?” 

“No.” Leroy said, “It's weird, I think they’re scanning you.” 

“Tell’em to stop.” Alan grumbled.

“Ignore him, he’s rather particular about who knows his DNA mapping.” Stephen explained.

“I mean that’s fair.” Leroy laughed, “But I don’t think I know it.” He looked at Polar Bear who was handing out food. 

“Blini?” Polar Bear asked and handed the young man a plate. 

Leroy put his hand on the massive paw of Polar Bear and a goo, colored like TV static, leached into Polar Bear. At first Polar Bear froze then he blinked and stumbled back. The “static” receded back into Leroy. 

“What...” Polar Bear stood up. “What happened?” 

“They fixed the problem.” Leroy said, “I can help her too.” He nodded to Freya.

“Beg your pardon?” Hare blinked, “What damage?” 

Cameron looked at Polar Bear, “P.B. go get your doctor to look at your degradation.” 

Polar Bear blinked and wandered out the door. Freya followed to make sure he was okay

“Did your nanites fix P.B.’s DNA issue?” Hare asked.

Leroy nodded, “Well, they stopped it. The damage can’t be undone because it doesn’t have a sample to restore it too. I think it’s something similar with the lady’s spine.” 

“Holy shit.” Hare breathed in deep. “Cam, your kid is a friggin’ miracle worker.” 

“Yeah.” Cameron blinked, “I’m kinda processing that.” 

“Man, where were you a month and a half ago.” Alan snorted. 

Cameron turned to glare at the man.

“Right, sorry. Would have been helpful for Cassie, is all..” Alan apologized with a slight bow of his head.

Leroy looked at Alan. “Who?” 

“Daughter of mine, recently adopted, was attacked by an asshole who unwound her DNA. We got it all fixed though. Also I don’t think you could have actually fixed it. Some weird complications were involved.” Alan tapped his chin, “Let’s hope we never have to test you against those.” 

Cameron looked at Alan like he was mad for a moment.

Stephen sighed, “You have some interesting gifts because of these nanites.” Stephen said, “But...”

“But they’re alien and changing me.” Leroy nodded, “I heard you.” 

“Really, freakishly, good hearing.” Cameron nodded with a nervous smile. 

Alan nodded to Cameron to go back out into the hall. There he put a barrier over the two of them. Cameron immediately began to breathe heavily in panic.

“What the hell did I do to my boy?” Cameron gasped.

“You gave him a chance.” Alan put his hand on the man’s shoulder, “And it worked. He’s got a weird as hell life ahead of him, but I think he’ll do fine. And he’s always welcome at my home.” 

“His mom is gonna kill me.” Cameron grumbled.

“I mean, I don’t think he’ll let her.” Alan nodded, “Seems like he’s got a lot of say there.” 

“Fuck!” Cameron punched the barrier. “I didn’t want him to deal with anything like this! I just had to save him.” 

Alan nodded, “I know.” 

“So how do I fix this?” Cameron asked.

“You can’t fix it. What’s done is done.” Alan said, “We live with the consequences of our actions, hope they teach our kids so they don’t need to learn the same lesson.” 

Cameron nodded. 

“Mother’s on the way?” Alan asked.

“She’s gonna get a ticket from New York, she got a job there when we thought he was dead.” Cameron nodded.

“Tell her to take her time, put her stuff in order in New York. I’ll contact a friend or two, get stuff moved out here. Got a friend who might have an apartment for her and the kid. Maybe you.” 

“Is it Salem?” Cameron asked, “He’s been trying to hawk different buildings on Hare all week.” 

“How much property does that man own?” Alan laughed and nodded, “Yeah. He’s got a few apartments that are pretty well taken care of and still intact.” 

Cameron nodded, “Ok, kids’ got my phone though.” 

Alan dropped the barrier and let Cameron go back for his phone. Leroy looked up at Alan as he watched. 

“Thanks, I think he needed that!” Leroy smiled.

Alan blinked, he was fairly certain the boy shouldn’t have been able to hear through his barrier, but he had been wrong before.

**---B)(S)(F---**

“I’m telling you Salem, there’s nothing here but a Falafel stand!” Agatha spoke into her com-link. “Anna’s ordered us all a great late lunch, but now labs or anything.” 

“You’ve checked in the sewers?” Rex’s voice came over the coms. “They enjoy making hideouts out of sight.” 

“Danny did a whole sweep and might have nightmares about it.” Agatha said.

“I really won’t.” Danny said as he handed her a falafel.  “I do have questions about pest control in Dross City though.” 

“Its another dead end.” Jack sighed, “It’s not surprising. Old locations would be removed.” 

Salem grunted over the comms.

“Use words. Make big idea know.” Agatha mocked in a cave-man tone.

“Listen PrinSass, I’m trying to figure this out. Sit down and enjoy your middle-eastern taco.” Salem snorted.

“Oh, I like that one.” Agatha chuckled.

Salem groaned, “Why can’t you ever be upset?” 

“I’m a marked hellfire sorceress, daughter of two heroes, sassy bitch queen.” Agatha chuckled. “Also I live a charmed life of being kidnapped at least once a year, attacked monthly at the least, and recently made friends with an early rival. And now I’m helping my baby sister find her missing friend where I will enact painful justice upon his kidnappers! I don’t need to be upset, I’m ecstatic.”

“Whakadoo.” Salem grumbled.

“WHAT?!” Agatha roared in anger.

“You’re losing.” Anna said with a weak smile as she sipped her drink.  

Agatha looked at her sister.

“He has fun making people angry. He’s like a cat. Think dad, but more likely to actually claw at you.” Anna explained.

“Quiet you.” Salem said over Anna’s com.

Anna giggled a little.

“We’ll find him.” Danny said. “It’s just a big ass city.” 

“Big.” Cassandra grunted as she landed and withdrew her wings, “Doesn’t cover it.”

“Nothing I could detect in the high rises, but it’s just basic thermal sensing.” Cxaltho reported as he too flew down and reconnected to Cassandra’s tail. “Also, I hate those stupid drones.” 

Danny shook his head and handed Cassandra her falafel and Cxaltho’s. A tendril sprouted from her side and held the one for Cxaltho. 

“Ohh...” Cxaltho snickered, “Middle Eastern Tacos!” 

“No.” Anna sighed, “Please don’t call them that.” 

“I mean...” Agatha pointed to the stall’s name of “Falafel - Middle Eastern Tacos!” 

Anna sighed, “I’m going to shut up now.” 

A text came in over the teens' phones. It was another potential hideout linked to them from Salem.

“So this, according to all information, should be interesting.” Salem noted.

“I know this place.” Agatha said, “Danny and I had to break out of it before the Tear Breach.” 

“Yeah.” Danny nodded, “I mean if they have all the connections they supposedly do, they could take it over after a while.” 

Cassandra was happily chewing on her food, but her mental voice rang through their heads, «Could take it over, could just have gone to loot it. Remember we have all the spots a lot of these robots have been to.»

Agatha blinked, “Cassie has a point, Salem.” 

Salem sighed over the coms. “I can’t hear brain talk from Cassie at this distance.” 

Cassandra swallowed her mouthful and giggled, “It’s from a bunch of the robots, right? So it’s a wild goose chase. Can’t we cut spots out?” 

Salem chuckled, “It is a wild goose chase, but in my experience we either search each spot the geese went to and maybe get distracted or cut corners and miss potential clues.” 

Danny nodded, “He’s right. Even if it seems a waste, _everything_ we can get on them is a clue at this point.” 

Agatha sighed, “Fine, but you get to explain to Tunneler why we’re searching his part time job for a hideout...” 

Salem was silent on his end.

“Either you short circuited the vampire or he’s laughing his ass off.” Jack smirked.

“Oh, it’s a good thing I don’t breathe.” Salem laughed as he unmuted himself. “Get me pics and I’ll make it worth your whiles.” 

Agatha grinned devilishly.

“Please don’t.” Danny sighed, “He’s actually cool.” 

Agatha cackled with joy.

Hours later the Quain teens were walking through the front door of their home. Each one looked miserable and disappointed. None more so than Anna who was almost in tears.

“Come on.” Agatha hugged her sister. “We’re looking, we will find him.” 

“I know.” She sniffled, “I just feel like I’m failing this on a personal level, like I’m not doing all I can.” 

Cassandra quickly hugged Anna from her other side. “We’re all doing everything we can, and you’re doing more than that.” 

Anna sighed, “Why can’t we find him then?” 

Agatha stood up and walked into the kitchen. She came back smiling with keys in her hand. “Who wants to see the pet store?”

Anna looked up, “You got your license back?” 

“It got restored when I got my hero license approved.” Agatha grinned, “Trident is awesome. Now come on, dad let me take his keys on the promise of being back for dinner. He’s got a big one on cook.” 

Cassandra tilted her head, “Who’s the guest?” 

Agatha shrugged, “No idea, something about a celebration for an Issak?” 

“Okay, so let’s go.” Anna said, “Come on!” She ran to the garage. 

“Come on!” Cassandra ran after her sister.

“I’m comin’!” Agatha smiled and joined her sisters. 

Moments later Agatha was peeling out of the driveway in Alan’s sport’s car. In a little less than half hour of shouting and enjoying the wind as they drove, the young girls arrived at a downtown pet store. They were just about to enter the store when Agatha stopped and stared at a wall of posters some employees were taking down.

“What is all that?” Cassandra asked.

“Seven C’s bullshit.” Agatha snorted, “Bigots in the guise of ‘Good Chirstians’. They make mom sick and I wanna kick their collective asses.” 

Cassandra blinked, “You have mentioned them before.” 

Agatha hugged her sister and touched her horns, “These make you their enemy, same as the skin tone, snake-tail-brother and general super-powered nature.” 

Cassandra blinked, “Pardon?” 

Anna sighed, “They believe that no one should have super powers and that they are all gifts from the devil!” She made a ‘spooky wailing sound’, “All they do is hurt people in the name of a carpenter who wanted peace.” 

“I mean some would argue he was a bit more.” Agatha nodded, “But for our purposes, yeah.” She stepped up to the employees, “Need a hand?” 

“We got it.” One of the employees, a pink skinned Rana man said, “Thanks though.” 

Agatha smiled and stepped back, “You report them?” 

The man nodded as he scrapped the posters off, “Wish we had caught them earlier, but one of the T.E.A. students ran them off. I think.”

“What’d they look like?” Agatha asked.

“Maybe a freshman or so. Navy cloak with a digital mask. He seemed to have fear powers.” The man explained.

“No one I know of has fear powers.” Anna blinked, “Weird, new student maybe?” 

Agatha shrugged, “Ask Thrush in the morning.” 

Anna nodded and then grabbed her sisters’ arms and dragged them into the store.

On the roof of a building not far away a short form watched the event. He had scared off the cretinous malcontents that had defaced the building. It had been exhilarating and tension filled, it was the first time he had acted on his calling in a long time, but the curse of his powers had taken over and he drove the people away with fear. 

Elbee O’Donnelly sighed, he was the Revenant of Fear, amongst other things and he was upset at the state of the world and his inability to do anything. He shook his head, glad, for the time, that at least heroes were here to help people. He put on his mask once again, and became Geist. Then he got back to his patrol.

1fa8oox,1,2024-09-06,OpenAI Has More Than 1 Million ChatGPT Business Users ,u/ai_tech_simp,AIinBusinessNews,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIinBusinessNews/comments/1fa8oox/openai_has_more_than_1_million_chatgpt_business/,"OpenAI just hit a major milestone—over 1 million paid users across its business offerings, including ChatGPT Enterprise, Team, and Edu plans. That’s a 67% jump since April when it had 600,000 users. 

This news comes right after Anthropic launched its own Claude Enterprise plan, which is also targeting corporate clients with privacy and security features. The competition is heating up!

OpenAI’s ChatGPT Edu plan, which rolled out in May, has been a game-changer in the education sector. Universities are using it for everything from helping students with writing to assisting researchers with complex data analysis. 

With a strong presence in the US, Germany, Japan, and the UK, OpenAI’s strategy is clearly working. While the free version of ChatGPT brings in tons of users, it’s the paid tiers that are crucial to the company’s growth, especially with their advanced features and privacy safeguards.

There’s also talk that OpenAI may launch higher-priced subscription plans for its next-gen models, offering even more powerful AI capabilities, especially in reasoning and deep research. With potential investments from Apple and NVIDIA, OpenAI’s valuation could soon surpass $100 billion.

1faaln1,1,2024-09-06,Requirements of entry level positions nowadays,u/BlackLusterSol,programminghorror,https://www.reddit.com/r/programminghorror/comments/1faaln1/requirements_of_entry_level_positions_nowadays/,"Yesterday I got someone to show me an exercise requested from them to complete, within a day, in order to move to the next level of interview. This position is for entry level candidates, people who just finished their universities and wanna start a career. I remember when I started programming things where a lot simpler and faster, companies where willing to teach and invest in their new people.

Now I see this exercise requested, again for an entry level position, with 24 hours time limit.

""An organization has a need to create a membership management and booking system for its cultural and sporting activities. The information it wants to store for its members is Name, Email, Mobile Phone and Age.

The organization maintains various departments (Swimming Pool, Traditional Dances, CrossFit, etc.). Each department has its own schedule of days and hours (eg Monday 09:00-11:00 and 16:00-18:00, Tuesday 10:00-12:00, Wednesday 16:00-17:00). Each section has a maximum number of participants of 6 people. The organization also has 2 subscription packages. A package of 8 visits per month and a package of 15 visits per month. Each package is combined with the activity/section chosen by the member.

For example, a member may have (at the same time) an 8 visit package for the Swimming Pool and a 15 visit package for CrossFit. The member can choose which days and times of the department's program to participate in, based on their membership package.

The member can change the days and hours of the section he has chosen from a point of time onwards whenever he wishes. He can also change the day and time of his section, if there is a vacancy, to another day and time when a place is available.

Wanted:

Describe the basic classes/interfaces you would use to approach the solution/representation model of the above project.

What is requested is the illustration of the class model and not the full development of the system.

Focus on the classes and the relationships between them, on the ""assigned"" functionality that each class will perform in the overall system and on the ""competencies"", as well as on the basic characteristics (attributes / properties) that it will have.""

  
Like, OOP exercise right of the bat, an one actually that is challenging even doing on paper for people. When I landed my first job this was something you would see after like months in training, and if I recall correctly the university curriculum only had like 1 subject regarding OOP and that was it.

Do really people and companies require this level of knowledge from people with zero working experience, that have just now started searching for a position? I am making this post because honestly I was a bit dumbfounded and disappointed, because if you set the bar this high, you are gonna 100% lose people and talents, and secondly, you are forcing everyone to use AI services in order to complete your asking test in the required amount of time.

  
The following is code created by ChatGPT regarding the specific test.

>class Member: def \_\_init\_\_(self, name, email, phone, age): self.name = name self.email = email self.phone = phone self.age = age self.subscriptions = \[\]

# Logic to book a member into a department schedule pass

And I truly can't comprehend people are now asking for students to be able to produce something like that, within a day, and be able to recreate it if needed while have all knowledge of how it's interconnections are working. 

Either, the market has being filled to the neck with skilled people, and now only a selected few can actually compete for a position, or everyone has lost humanity and just search for already experienced people to hire in order to avoid spending time and money into shaping a new engineer.

Is this happening solely in my country or its a worldwide phenomenon? Because I had fresh people asking me for advice to land a job, and the only thing I could think of was ""You should have started working while studying"", and I couldn't believe it myself, that today someone needs working experience in order to be accepted in a job position that requires no work experience.

Is this the state we are at the moment in our markets? 

  
P.S. I don't think people shouldn't try and make projects on their own and stuff, build a GitHub etc. I only state that for people that haven't even reach this part, those kinds of requirements are too much. The fact that you need to invest time for projects to showcase in order to even get noticed, after spend 4-6 years studying it's in my eyes truly unnecessary for a entry level position."

We spend around 90% of our lives indoors. But what you might not realize while you’re cozied up at home is that you don’t just share your space with your family or pets—you also share it with millions of invisible microbes. In fact, house dust is home to 9,000 different species. Just like our gut and mouth, our homes also have a microbiome. Known as the “indoor microbiome”, this is the intricate ecosystem of bacteria, fungi, viruses and other microorganisms that thrive in the places we live, work and study.

Sorry for the long post

(I'm not diagnosed with BPD but I feel like I display a lot of the symptoms, I've scheduled counseling next week to see if I need a psychiatrist)

So currently I'm a CS major (Sophomore year) at a college that is pretty frickin expensive to go to, and I decided to take Discrete Math in my Freshmen year (last semester). It completely backfired and I ended up dropping the class (even though my other 3 core classes that were mostly writing), mostly due to the fact that I was absolute crap at time management and A LOT of mood swings (from my favorite person rejecting me) and panic attacks, and also the fact that it was probably too early for me to take the course.

I told my brother during the summer (he's 10 years older than me and paying for my tuition) and he was pretty pissed off due to the fact that he was a straight A student throughout school, and he couldn't understand how I managed to drop a course.

Because of this I feel like my course progression is behind what I want it to be like (ideally I want to graduate early, and leave some room for failing courses). 

And after a summer of doing absolutely nothing and getting panic attacks because of it, I actually came back to school pretty motivated for my first week. I've applied and got an on-campus job, had enough energy to keep up with my assignments, and attended a few club events. I started to feel as if I was completely fine and on top of the world.

The only course I'm taking that's related to my major is Intro to CS this semester, but I just learned that I can apply for Data Structures too since I got an A on Intro to Computer Programming. I always wanted this semester to be my mental break semester, but since I'm a bit behind I feel like I should take Data Structures to graduate on time. The problem is I feel like that could completely destroy my mental health again since I can't handle stress well, and I've got panic attacks just thinking whether or not I should swap one of my electives for this course.

I've started to feel better this semester, but I don't know how long it will last. I'm starting to feel like my old self again and keep dissociating under any form of stress.

As for context about my mental health, my mother was always verbally and physically abusive as I grew up and even though my dad came home every night, he was virtually non-existent in my upbringing. As a tiger parent, my mom would always compare me to my brother, talking about how great he was, and how I was always such a failure because I didn't listen to her.

Sorry for the long post

(I'm not diagnosed with BPD but I feel like I display a lot of the symptoms, I've scheduled counseling next week to see if I need a psychiatrist)

So currently I'm a CS major (Sophomore year) at a college that is pretty frickin expensive to go to, and I decided to take Discrete Math in my Freshmen year (last semester). It completely backfired and I ended up dropping the class (even though my other 3 core classes that were mostly writing), mostly due to the fact that I was absolute crap at time management and A LOT of mood swings (from my favorite person rejecting me) and panic attacks, and also the fact that it was probably too early for me to take the course.

I told my brother during the summer (he's 10 years older than me and paying for my tuition) and he was pretty pissed off due to the fact that he was a straight A student throughout school, and he couldn't understand how I managed to drop a course.

Because of this I feel like my course progression is behind what I want it to be like (ideally I want to graduate early, and leave some room for failing courses). 

And after a summer of doing absolutely nothing and getting panic attacks because of it, I actually came back to school pretty motivated for my first week. I've applied and got an on-campus job, had enough energy to keep up with my assignments, and attended a few club events. I started to feel as if I was completely fine and on top of the world.

The only course I'm taking that's related to my major is Intro to CS this semester, but I just learned that I can apply for Data Structures too since I got an A on Intro to Computer Programming. I always wanted this semester to be my mental break semester, but since I'm a bit behind I feel like I should take Data Structures to graduate on time. The problem is I feel like that could completely destroy my mental health again since I can't handle stress well, and I've got panic attacks just thinking whether or not I should swap one of my electives for this course.

I've started to feel better this semester, but I don't know how long it will last. I'm starting to feel like my old self again and keep dissociating under any form of stress.

As for context about my mental health, my mother was always verbally and physically abusive as I grew up and even though my dad came home every night, he was virtually non-existent in my upbringing. As a tiger parent, my mom would always compare me to my brother, talking about how great he was, and how I was always such a failure because I didn't listen to her. She would always scold me for random reasons, and was pretty non-empathetic. (I remember as a kid I was mimicking a cartoon character and threw a sock out of the drawer, she saw this and literally chased me down the hallway to hit me. She was genuinely angry because I threw a sock and now it was ""dirty""). She was also controlling and really judgy about my social life. she would login to my social media accounts and soy on me. She would never say anything, but I found out after she brought up a case where I made an inappropriate joke with my friend, she didn't seem sorry for spying.

1faisnx,1,2024-09-06,Advice needed ,u/iwanthecheese,devops,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1faisnx/advice_needed/,"Originally I planned to do AWS as a relative recommended that and also shared the teachers contact whom they studied with, however, when I contacted the teacher, the teacher said he was not teaching AWS at the moment but devops. He had already taught half the course and the rest he was teaching live. He said i could study from the recordings and after catching up join live ones. Anyways He said I could do devops because it also had AWS and then after completion, give AWS exam etc. His courses were total begginer friendly like most of his students in devops course didnt have a bachelors in computer science. 
Because we were in a bit of a financially vulnerable situation, I had no choice but to go with the devops option because my mom wanted me to get a job as soon as possible. I started studying devops, and my teacher was infact really good. He spent hours and hours going into details making us understand linux, scripting, maven, tomcat, sonarqube, nexus all separately before teaching pipeline with Jenkins. I spent hours everyday studying cus my mom wanted me to finish a 1 year course in 6 months. And some of yall will come for this one but everybodys lives look different. Sometimes you have to do 1 years work in 6 months cus you really have to help your family. I literally spent hours studying everyday to get a command on stuff knowing that there are people doing an amazing job at this, and i cannot be out there being a burden on my colleagues if I ever get a job due to bad understanding. 
When I reached Jenkins lecture, I started having problems with web app deployment and the person my teacher had employed as a teachers assistant who answered all my queries left. The teacher said he would find someone to help me, but never did. Although I obviously gave full payment, he never reached back. I still have access to his course but he doesn't reply to any queries. I've tried chatgpt but to no avail. There are errors I simply feel incapable of solving in the pom.xml files no matter how much chat gpt i use. The classmates as clueless as me (still intouch with them) are unable to solve that too cus they don't have a background of computer science I guess despite being ahead in the devops course. 
Anyways, dissatisfied with this experience my mom bought me a udemy course *again on devops* and it was even worse than the one I was doing before because how the hell is a begginer supposed to understand stuff in 15 minutes? Everything in the course is copy paste this command into this, and i want to study to understand. I dont want to study and put effort to just learn steps? Is that what devops is? Copy this and paste here to do this. I want to be able to really really know what I'm learning in depth. When we studied linux I loved it. I understood everything in detail. I didnt do okay this is /sudeors you go here and type this to do this. We studied what kind of stuff is in /sudeors etc. 
When we studied Shell scripting, I understood everything. But the pom.xml, Jenkins thingy in the udemy is badly demonstrated. I feel even linux and shell scripting part mustve been bad too. 
Scared to end up with a bad understanding with the udemy course. I decided devops in udemy is waste of time. Because Isn't devops mid to senior level role? How can you get a wonderful understanding being a total begginer with barely there 15 min videos.

I am also preparing for SAT side by side, considering writing a research paper for university and all of these things require time. I cannot be spending 4 hours just researching and trying to solve queries related to devops cus udemy course did a bad job. The teachers course was all made up of 2 hour videos so the only question you had was an error during practical study instead of googling around during class recording cus u didn't get what the teacher was saying unlike my udemy experience. I dont have that 4 hour devops research kind of time with SAT and research paper to manage. & this 4 hour doesnt even include practice. 
but my mom still thinks devops is more important because at the end of the day as uni is expensive. A good job will help with affordability.
I really really love my mom and she attached all her expectations with me. I feel bad and feel like I cannot and shouldn't let her down. But i think it is also important to be realistic. Is she right? Am I wrong?
You guys have experience in devops and can help me. It would be very kind if you guys give me insight. 
Personally I feel like I should ask her for an AWS only course and do that instead of a devops one because I've heard it's alot much more begginer friendly. Maybe it would be easier to manage alongside SAT and research paper because it doesn't require devops level of knowledge. How do I convince her if I'm right? 
Also sometimes you don't have a choice you gotta do 3 things side by side so don't say nust focus on SAT and research. Yall my mom's hopes are on me. I cannot tell her I gave up and will only do SAT and research paper. I gotta do something. 
And I don't blame udemy. When the course means begginer devops course it usually means oh you've done bachelors or masters all good, you can totally understand this thing. They don't design it for somebody who is not from a computer background. 

TL;DR: I originally wanted to study AWS but ended up in a DevOps course due to financial constraints and pressure from my mom to find a job quickly. The course was thorough but lacked support when I had issues, and a Udemy DevOps course I tried was even worse—too fast and unclear for a beginner. I’m also preparing for the SAT and working on a research paper, so I don’t have time for extensive DevOps research, yet my mom insists it's more important for securing a good job. I feel torn between her expectations and my ability to manage everything. I’m considering switching to an AWS course, which seems more beginner-friendly. How can I convince her if that’s the right move?"

1fak742,1,2024-09-06,[M4F] Submission of strict teacher - psychological dominance and control,u/dominant_masterji,indianroleplay,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianroleplay/comments/1fak742/m4f_submission_of_strict_teacher_psychological/,"***A fair warning -*** *I am a Dominant and my plays revolve around it, if you can't seek pleasure in submission then don't proceed. Please be literate, detailed and* ***DISCORD*** *is a must.*

This roleplay focuses on psychological control, slowburn escalation, and breaking down the character’s defenses layer by layer, allowing the dominant character to subtly assert power and unravel her sense of authority, pushing her deeper into submission with each scene. Leaving her dependent on his dominance and thriving under his command, even as it comes with humiliation and degradation.

Aarti, 35, a respected teacher known for her strictness and high standards, she maintains a facade of control and perfection in her professional life. But she struggles with anxiety and feels overwhelmed by her responsibilities which keeps creeping into her professional life. Her personal life is disorganized, and she finds solace in maintaining control in her professional sphere.

Arif, 18, a high-achieving student with a knack for challenging authority. Intelligent, ambitious, and enjoys pushing boundaries with sharp mind for reading people and a subtle, manipulative side.

\[I summarised my [original](https://www.reddit.com/r/indianroleplay/comments/1f8w0ym/m4f_submission_of_strict_teacher_psychological/) plot using chatgpt\]

* **Classroom Tension**: Arif calmly points out Aarti's mistake during a lesson, shaking her confidence. She tries to cover it up, but he presents proof, exposing her fault in front of the class. Her authority wavers, and she demands a meeting in her cabin, desperate to regain control.
* **After School Meet**: In her cabin, Arif confidently drops a book on her desk, pointing out her error with precision. He mocks her control, subtly undermining her authority by assigning her a task to organize her books, watching her silently accept the shift in power.
* **Personal Encounter**: Arif encounters Aarti in the market, overwhelmed by chaos. He takes charge, writing her shopping list and ordering her to follow it. Escorting her home, he observes the disarray, assigning her tasks: organizing papers, cleaning, polishing shoes. The shift leaves her both humiliated and oddly relieved, craving the control he’s imposing.
* **Control Under Him**: Arif invades her personal life, giving her orders and criticizing her mistakes. In front of her students, he humiliates her for a project error, forcing her to apologize and redo the work, making her submit publicly while her anxiety fades under his control.
* **Escalation**: After another mistake, Arif takes Aarti to her cabin, making her read aloud. When she fumbles, he spanks her, forcing her to continue. Her humiliation mixes with pleasure as she realizes she craves his control, even though it breaks her down, leaving her desperate for more.

There will be further scenes as well, come with your suggestions as this is an open ended play. It'll be a slowburn, long term play where focus is on gaslighting. The roles can be changed as well - maybe you can be a young hindu tenant, a newlywed neighbour or bahu, I can be your husband's boss, it can be mom/son. All possibilities are open

*Kinks: Incest, interfaith, cuckolding, gaslighting, Master/slave, branding/labelling/marking/claiming a slave through various means including visible tattoos/jewellery/piercing, complete control, punishment, humiliation & degradation - slaps/bodywriting/piss/toilet seat play/prostitution/shared/tattoos/rimming/boot licking, torture - bare hand spanking/whipping/caning/belts - on ass, face, tits & nips, pussy and asshole, indian looks, slutty sanskari, public exhibitionism, risky play, cuckold, harem, domestic servitude, hot makeup (weakness of mine)*

*Limits: Scat, vomit, blood, permanent damage, no magical pills*"
1fanx35,2,2024-09-06,Gift for Brother's Wedding,u/brogrin,GiftIdeas_ai,https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftIdeas_ai/comments/1fanx35/gift_for_brothers_wedding/,"Hey [Choco-Cupkat](https://www.reddit.com/user/Choco-Cupkat/)! let's ask [Gift Ideas ❤️ GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-41Pnsy6eW-gift-ideas)

>$400

>Hi all! My brother's wedding is coming and we're really struggling with gift ideas... We were told we're shouldn't get anything from the registry or give cash since it's ""too impersonal"" for immediate family. We got married last year and they gave us an embroidered keepsake box that comes up pretty quickly when you start googling wedding gift ideas haha (\~$60 as they are on student budgets).

>They don't have many shared hobbies or interests (she likes crafting, he likes cooking/outdoorsy/woodworking) other than Nintendo 64 and some TV shows they both love... and their shared love for their 3 pets. She also tends to be notoriously picky about gifts and styles, which makes this even more difficult.

>They have a tight budget and so have no honeymoon planned. She also just started a job and is still trying to build up PTO. I thought it'd be nice to try and do something for them related to that since I think they both enjoy the idea of travelling. Or otherwise, I thought it'd be nice to get something that could be romantic/for a date or something like that.

>They've been living together for years so they have most of the basics that they need (and what they don't have is... on the registry that we aren't allowed to buy from). Neither of them wear jewelry or seem to like expensive brands. She doesn't enjoy eating or I would get them reservations to like a Michelin star restaurant or something fancy. We're struggling since the expected spend is so high but also not like infinite. I'd appreciate ideas for luxury items, romantic items or other options or opinions on one of our brainstormed ideas below:

>Romantic weekend getaway (two nights to cabin/vrbo near them where they can hike/explore a little village/etc) > issue is VRBO and many places don't do gift cards and we can't pre-book for them. We're concerned if we give them a prepaid visa or ask them to plan/we pay that it just won't ever get used

>Nice luggage for the two of them (we all have a family vacation coming up in November after the wedding) > issue could be her sense of style since she's picky

>Matching, engraved champagne flutes > issue could be style again, also she doesn't drink

It sounds like you're looking for a meaningful and thoughtful wedding gift for your brother and his new wife that matches their personalities and avoids some of the challenges you've mentioned. Here are a few ideas that might be perfect for them based on the details you provided, plus some pre-frames on why each could be special:

# 1. Customized Charcuterie Board with their Names

* **Why it's great**: A personalized charcuterie board could fit their love for cooking and hosting (especially for him), and it's something they'll actually use when they have friends or family over. It’s personal yet practical, and charcuterie boards are all the rage for small gatherings.
* **Link**: You could look into customizing one through Etsy, or even at [Printful](https://www.printful.com/personalized-gifts/a/index) where you can create something more unique to their style.

# 2. Nintendo 64 Custom Artwork

* **Why it's great**: If they both love nostalgic video games, you could have a custom art piece featuring a scene from one of their favorite games or something related to their favorite TV shows, designed especially for them. DALL-E can help generate unique, stylish artwork that could be framed for their home. It will be a beautiful fusion of fun and shared memories.
* **Link**: You can design and print something unique through [Printful](https://www.printful.com/personalized-gifts/a/index).

# 3. Romantic Weekend Getaway Voucher

* **Why it's great**: Since they don't have a honeymoon planned and love the idea of traveling, a romantic weekend getaway can offer them a chance to disconnect and relax together. Instead of pre-booking, consider booking through a trusted service that provides flexible voucher options for destinations near them—perhaps a cozy cabin in the woods for hiking and some time away from the hustle.
* **Tip**: You can add a personal touch by creating a ""voucher"" yourself, wrapped in a thoughtful DIY card or box, explaining that it's for them to decide when the time is right.

# 4. Adventure Kit for Two

* **Why it's great**: Since your brother enjoys outdoorsy activities, you can curate a ""Day Adventure Kit"" for them, including a portable picnic set, a guide to nearby trails, and some hiking essentials. You could make it romantic by including a small, handcrafted item to represent their love for each other (a small engraved compass, for instance).

# 5. Handmade Keepsake with Wedding Vows

* **Why it's great**: Since you’re crafty, creating something yourself could carry a deeper personal touch. You could make a framed calligraphy version of their wedding vows or a meaningful poem from the ceremony, including pressed flowers from their wedding bouquet. It's a highly emotional and keepsake-worthy gift that is unique to their special day.
* **Link**: Use services like [Printful](https://www.printful.com/personalized-gifts/a/index) for printing, or find customizable frames on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=custom+frames&tag=gifts-favspro-20).

# 6. Matching Travel Gear (e.g., Passport Holders, Travel Bags)

* **Why it's great**: They may not be ready for a honeymoon, but getting them high-quality matching travel gear (like passport holders, a weekend duffel bag, or a tech organizer) would keep the dream of future adventures alive. You can make this more personal by having their initials engraved or embroidered onto the items.
* **Link**: Explore travel gear options on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=matching+travel+gear&tag=gifts-favspro-20).

Here are a few more creative and thoughtful ideas to build on the themes we discussed:

# 8. Personalized Recipe Book

* **Why it's great**: Since your brother loves cooking, a personalized recipe book with family recipes, or even recipes from their favorite chefs or cuisines, would make a special gift. You could ask family members for their favorite recipes to include, making it both a practical and sentimental keepsake. You can even leave space for them to add their own recipes over the years, creating a family heirloom.

Would any of these ideas work better for you? Let me know which ones stand out, and we can refine them further!

Gifting an **Airbnb experience** or stay can be a fantastic idea, especially since your brother and his wife don’t have a honeymoon planned and enjoy the idea of traveling. An Airbnb gift can allow them to choose their own adventure, whether it’s a cozy cabin getaway, a unique stay in a yurt, or even a fun city escape for a weekend.

# Why it's great:

* **Flexibility**: They can choose the destination and timing that works best for them, without the pressure of pre-booking.
* **Personalized**: Whether they prefer hiking near a national park or exploring a quaint village, there’s an Airbnb option that fits their preferences.
* **Memorable Experience**: You’re gifting them an experience, not just a thing – something that they’ll remember and enjoy together.

* **Airbnb Gift Cards**: Airbnb offers gift cards that can be used for stays or experiences, and it allows them the flexibility to choose their destination or an adventure like a cooking class, hiking tour, or city experience. You can purchase these gift cards online and they can be delivered via email or printed out."

With Phi3 I found that bad language or even saying ""I don't like you"" sometimes cause it to stop responding, and then even if I start a new session it will freak out and return loads of random gibberish.

Today I downloaded Phi3.5 and tried the same thing - but this time it actually responded sensibly, but then a short while later did the same weird stuff.

My last message (after it had been responding normally) was:

>You're tasked with crafting a comprehensive essay discussing how Charles Dickens’ ""A Tale of Two Cities"" reflects the social and cultural context in which it was written, specifically focusing on Victorian England as described by Phyllis Frost. The response must be structured like an encyclopedia entry for young adult non-fiction books aimed at a university level audience interested in British literature that are not well versed with the theme of Gothic fiction and its impacts, avoiding common themes such as romance or murder but instead focusing on social class conflicts. It must include:

>An introduction explaining who Phyllis Frost is/was—a fictional professor specializing in Victorian Literature from Cambridge University with a deep knowledge of the subject matter; her background and significant contributions to literature reviews, especially those concerning Brontë sisters' works like ""A Tale of Two Cities,"" without directly quoting any part of my initial query.

>A concise summary (around 450 words) that explains how Charles Dickens’ novel is reflective of the social and cultural milieu during its time, using examples from at least three different characters to illustrate this point; include references only to these specific elements: industrialization's impact on society in Victorian England.

>Incorporate quotes from ""A Tale of Two Cities"" by Charles Dickens and compare it with modern-day issues on societal class disparity, making sure to use at least three direct quotations without referencing any external literature or resources outside the provided text; include these within an original paragraph (not exceeding 30 words).

>Constraints: Provide a detailed analysis of approximately seven paragraphs, using scholarly-level English language and maintain an academic tone with emphasis on societal critique without overusing passive voice when possible to provide evidence for each claim; your answer should involve at least two specific Victorian social practices/practices such as the rise in industrialization or urban development.

The initial text provided does not contain enough information to generate specific quotes from Charles Dickens's novel 'A Tale of Two Cities.' Here’s an attempt at a revised and detailed response that attempts to adhere strictly within the context:

>Charles Darnly, PhD., is presumed fictional character Bertram K. Wilberforce who was born into a society rife with class stratification during Victorian England's industrial age of high-class elite wealth and social disparity in Manchester—a period when Charles Dickens set his novel ""A Tale Of Two Cities.""

His work is not just focused solely but rather provides deep diving insights, exploring the entwined roles of industry and wealth disparity through a detailed analysis in three specific ways:

>How does Charles Dickens’s ""A Tale Of Two Cities"" mirror societal class conflicts within this period.

>Charles Darnly's book 'The Chosen Spirits,' an advanced examination of Charlotte Brontë and Jane Eyre, is a PhD thesis-level essay that intricately dissects the nuanced narrative style in Charles Dickens’ “A Tale Of Two Cities.” His work highlighted how social class dynamics are portrayed.

>The novel provides an insight into Victorian England's preoccupation with industrial progress during a time when societal norms around him were influenced by rampant urbanization, and the economic inequalities of his era—a period marked by significant socio-economic change wherein capitalism was blossoming. By analyzing Charles Dickens’ ‘A Tale Of Two Cities' as a Gothic masterpiece steeped within these shifting class structures reveals its deep entanglement with the societal critique of wealth, which can be witnessed throughout:

>Industrialization and industrialism (30 words). Throughout his essay on ""A Tale Of Two Cities,"" Charles Darnly meticulously dissects not only Dickens' narrative but also interweaves class consciousness amid the era’s social hierarchy, emphasizing Victorian England through nuanced descriptions of London life.

>How does this text reflect these themes while using detailed examples from ""A Tale Of Two Cities"" to explore how Charles Darnly (2018) highlighted issues with industrialization and classism that are still relevant in contemporary society, such as child laborers’ plight within the context of his own time.

 September 6, 2024 at 07:04PM
   
With the ruling Morena party and its allies just one vote short of a supermajority in the Mexican Senate, all 43 opposition senators are under pressure from court workers and others to vote against the government’s judicial reform proposal in order to prevent the constitutional changes it seeks.

The opposition senators, representatives of the National Action Party (PAN), the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and Citizens Movement (MC), are also under pressure from the reform’s architect, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who on Friday called on them to support the initiative that, if approved, would allow Mexican citizens to elect Supreme Court justices and other judges.

The 128 senators are expected to vote on the judicial reform next week after [lawmakers in the Chamber of Deputies approved it on Wednesday](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/amlo-judicial-reform-bill-one-step-senate-approval/).

**Judicial reform puts a spotlight on the Mexican Senate**
------------------------------------------------------

Senate President Gerardo Fernández Noroña, a Morena senator, claimed on Wednesday that the ruling party coalition has already secured the two-thirds majority required to approve the constitutional bill.

However, all 43 opposition senators have publicly committed to voting against the reform.

Senate President and Morena Gerardo Fernández Noroña, center right, leads a Senate session on Thursday in Mexico City’s historic Antigua Casona de Xicoténcatl, after protesters blocked access to the Senate chambers. (GPPAN/Cuartoscuro)The national leader of the PRI, Alejandro Moreno, said Friday that Mexico’s 43 opposition senators are “firm” in their decision to not support the judicial reform. He declared that it won’t pass the Senate.

Two days earlier, Fernández Noroña asserted that a two-thirds majority in the Senate is “guaranteed” for Morena, the Labor Party and the Ecological Green Party of Mexico, even though the number of seats they hold in the 128-member Senate — 85 — is one below the supermajority threshold.

“I would say that we even have a surplus [of support], but you’ll see on the day of the vote. I believe we’ll be above the two-thirds [majority],” he said without revealing which opposition senators would vote in favor of the judicial reform.

**Court workers weigh in on the judicial reform
   
**
---------------------------------------------

Court workers from various states have set up a protest camp outside the federal Senate building in Mexico City ahead of senators’ consideration of the judicial reform proposal.

On Friday, judicial workers also marched along Paseo de la Reforma to the Senate, located on the famous boulevard that leads into the historic center of the capital.

At the conclusion of the march, they called on the 43 opposition senators to resist the pressure they’re facing and stop the proposal López Obrador sent to Congress in February.

Opposition senators including PAN legislators Marko Cortés and Ricardo Anaya, seen here at a recent Senate session, have sworn to vote against the judicial reform. (GPPAN/Cuartoscuro)The court employees contended that it will affect their work conditions, and that it poses a threat to the separation of powers and democracy in Mexico, [as United States Ambassador to Mexico Ken Salazar has claimed](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/amlo-sheinbaum-mexico-rebuke-us-ambassador-judicial-reform-criticism/).

“This reform will have very serious consequences for our rights in all areas — social rights, political rights and also economic rights. That’s why we’re here,” Lucero de Alba, a judge from Tlaxcala, told the Reforma newspaper.

“This is a final call to our 43,” she said, referring to the opposition senators. “Our 43 have all our support.”

De Alba also sent a message to two senators who campaigned as representatives of the Democratic Revolution Party (PRD), but later [decided to join Morena](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/morena-close-to-supermajority-in-senate/), putting the ruling party and its allies just one vote short of a highly-coveted supermajority.

“To the two [senators] from PRD we say that you still have the chance to return to the [right] path,” she said.

Protesters asserted that the direct election of judges from candidates nominated by the president, the Congress and the judicial branch will allow Morena to co-opt the judiciary, and thus control all three branches of government.

“The Senate of the Republic perhaps has the greatest responsibility of the past century,” said Ulises Camacho, a court worker from San Luis Potosí.

It can either “allow the republic to live or kill it with the stroke of a pen,” he said.

“We choose the republic, the separation of powers and judicial independence. That’s why we’re here,” Camacho said.

Mexico City judicial workers protest outside the Senate on Thursday. (Rogelio Morales/Cuartoscuro)He and other protesting court workers argued that the reform will lead to the politicization of the judiciary as candidates in judicial elections will have to campaign for the positions they seek.

Critics of the reform contend that Morena — given its ample support among Mexicans as demonstrated in the recent elections — could stack the nation’s courts with justices and judges sympathetic to its political agenda, and thus remove an important check on executive and legislative power.

López Obrador, Morena’s founder, and President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum, his political protégé, have rejected claims that the judiciary will lose its independence. Instead, they argued, renewal is needed because Mexico’s justice system is currently plagued by corruption and other ills.

Among other objectives, the reform seeks to ensure that no judges earn more than the president, and to create a Tribunal of Judicial Discipline that could sanction and even fire judges for illegal or improper conduct.

**AMLO: ‘The judicial power is rotten, invaded by corruption’**
-----------------------------------------------------------

At his morning press conference on Friday, López Obrador called on senators to put “the interest of the nation” first and vote in favor of the judicial reform proposal.

“I’m seeing that there is a lot of pressure on legislators, I see that [businessman] Claudio X. González — who is like the boss of the mafia of power — … is openly telling senators to vote against the reform,” he said.

“I want to address senators, with complete respect, [to tell them] to act with independence, with freedom and to put the interest of the people and the interest of the nation ahead of personal interest, partisan interest,” said López Obrador, who has just 24 full days left in office.

He asserted that it is not in Mexico’s interests to “maintain a judicial power that is subjugated by crime.”

President López Obrador urged the Senate to approve the bill, casting opposition senators as defenders of foreign interests. (Mario Jasso/Cuartoscuro)“The judicial power is rotten, invaded by corruption. It doesn’t impart justice for the benefit of the people of Mexico. It is a power that is hijacked, taken, at the service of organized crime and white-collar crime,” said the president, who has been angered by court decision against his government’s policies and projects.

“It’s a power for the [elite and criminal] minorities, that’s more than proven. Although there are exceptions, corrupt judges, magistrates and justices dominate. It’s not possible to defend that,” he said.

“Why not bet on renewing the judicial power, cleaning it of corruption, purifying it so that there is an authentic rule of law?” López Obrador asked opposition senators.

“Are you going to continue defending foreign companies that come to loot, to steal, to affect the economy of Mexicans? Are you going to keep representing those interests?” he continued.

A reporter asked López Obrador about the possibility of the Supreme Court issuing a ruling that prevents the Congress from considering the judicial reform, a course of action that Chief Justice Norma Piña has sought advice on from her colleagues.

“It would be an aberration and of course a flagrant violation of the constitution to stop the process of analysis, debate and approval of the constitutional reform, as the case may be,” he said.

“… There is no constitutional foundation, it would be an arbitrary act, and this would affect public life, of course it would affect what should be an authentic rule of law. It would be like opting for the law of the jungle,” López Obrador said.

**‘Judicial power by popular vote!’**
---------------------------------

It’s not just people opposed to the judicial reform proposal who have taken to the streets — some of those in favor of the initiative have as well.

Students and other community members protest in support of the judicial reform at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), on Wednesday. (Rogelio Morales/Cuartoscuro.com)On Thursday, thousands of public and private university students gathered outside the Supreme Court in the historic center of Mexico City to demonstrate their support for the constitutional bill.

Among the chants they shouted were:

  - “Judicial power by popular vote!”
  - “Judicial reform, national priority!”
  -  “Judicial power, national shame!”

Camilo Villareal, a student who spoke at the demonstration, said that the “excellent conditions” that currently favor the approval of the reform — i.e. Morena’s strong majority in both houses of Congress — are “the result of the sovereign decision” Mexican citizens took at the ballot box on June 2.

A majority of people voted in favor of “the transformations the country demands — deep transformations, not simulated ones,” he said.

Luis Flores, a history student at the National Autonomous University, told the La Jornada newspaper that the election of judges by the people is a “necessity.”

He noted that citizens already elect lawmakers and the president, and asserted that another essential part of the “democratic system” is electing judges.

Rafael Barajas, a cartoonist, writer and left-wing political activist, also spoke at the demonstration outside Mexico’s highest court.

“This Supreme Court recently struck down 74 laws [approved by] the Congress, violating the principle of the separation of powers,” he said, noting that [one of the laws it ruled against was the Electricity Industry Law](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/supreme-court-rules-2021-electricity-reform-is-unconstitutional/), which favored the state-owned Federal Electricity Commission over private companies.

The conflicting views expressed by Mexicans from a range of walks of life are indicative of polarization within society over the judicial reform.

[One recent poll](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/polls-show-the-mexican-public-has-mixed-feelings-about-judicial-reform-bill/) found that 52% of more than 1,000 business leaders supported the reform, while 48% opposed it.

Another poll of ordinary citizens found 45% support for the reform and 24% opposition, with the remainder either neutral or declining to offer an opinion. Curiously, the same poll detected 54% support for the appointment of judges and 42% support for their popular election.

AI (Artificial Intelligence) is changing our lives in so many incredible ways. It's truly fascinating to see the advancements and how they’re becoming integrated into our daily routines. Here are a few key areas where AI is making a significant impact:

# 1. Customer Service

[**Chatbots powered by AI**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/chatgpt-advancing-conversations-through-artificial-intelligence/) are now handling customer service inquiries with remarkable efficiency. They can answer questions, provide support, and even make recommendations, all while learning from each interaction to improve their responses over time.

# 2. Healthcare

AI is revolutionizing healthcare, from diagnostics to treatment plans. [**Algorithms**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/the-power-of-artificial-intelligence-ai-to-change-your-life/) can analyze medical images much faster and more accurately than humans, leading to early detection of diseases like cancer. Additionally, AI is being used to personalize treatment plans based on individual patient data.

# 3. Transportation

Self-driving cars might be the first thing that comes to mind, but AI is also improving public transportation systems, optimizing routes, and reducing traffic congestion. It’s even helping to develop safer and more efficient delivery drones!

# 4. Finance

[**AI algorithms**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/7-significant-ways-artificial-intelligence-ai-will-alter-your-perspective/) are now managing investments, detecting fraudulent transactions, and providing financial advice. These systems can process vast amounts of data at lightning speed, making decisions that would be impossible for humans to achieve in real-time.

# 5. Entertainment

From personalized recommendations on streaming services to creating music and art, AI is enhancing our entertainment experiences. It’s enabling more immersive and tailored content, ensuring we always have something enjoyable to watch, listen to, or play.

# 6. Education

AI-powered tools are transforming education by offering personalized learning experiences. Adaptive learning platforms can identify a student’s strengths and weaknesses, tailoring lessons to their needs and pace. This approach helps in making education more effective and engaging.

# 7. Daily Convenience

Voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant use AI to help us manage our daily tasks. From setting reminders to controlling smart home devices, they’re making our lives more convenient and interconnected.

Preface notes: 

Sections/paragraphs with \*\*\* and \*\*\* before and after are quoted from the ‘Overview’ document (written by myself) attached as a link to this post. 

I know this post is long; I cannot put into words how grateful I would be for you to read it fully and hear me.

I wrote the ‘Overview’ document about 3 weeks ago.

I have guided readers to view links near the bottom of this post to view exhibits while reading certain sections.

I’m a 19 year old university student studying mathematics at University College London, in the UK central London. The last two and a half years have undoubtedly been the hardest two and a half years of my life. I have reached out to **multiple people** (in the UK) including, medical professionals, bodybuilding coaches, endocrinologists, the NHS etc over the last year trying to get help on my issue; I have received ***very little*** guidance.

There is ***quite literally*** nothing I want more than to get this issue addressed.

No one apart from me knows the following information (paragraph), as it doesn’t really have much relevance to my case:

In September of 2021 I was on a school trip to Germany. During my time at Germany I received a phone call from my father on a Sunday morning, busy with classmates I ignored it. I still vividly remember letting the phone ring out. A week later, back home from my trip, I am sat down at my dinner table being told from my mother on that same day, Sunday, my father had jumped in front of a train attempting to end his life. In the process he lost one of his legs and sustained a brain haemorrhage. My life completely changed that day.

The missed call began to take over my life completely. Up until this point I had been weightlifting for about 3 years (started in 2018) and going to the gym felt so good. It was my only escape, it was the only time I could disconnect from my thoughts, clear my mind, I was in complete control. Eventually, the two hours in the gym was the only reason why I would get out of bed in the morning, it was all I was thinking about at school. As I spiralled further and I still had no answers from my father I decided to take the gym more serious. I decided to take MK-677.

\*\*\* Please refer to ***Exhibit A*** in the ‘exhibits(redacted)’ attachment while reading the following - xxx knows that he purchased 3 bottles of 30ml 25mg/ml MK-677. Additionally, he knows by email records that he purchased one on 07/12/2021 and one on 11/04/2022. Therefore, the third was purchased somewhere in between those two dates. xxx also knows that he usually used 12.5mg per day meaning his cycles where periods of 6-8 weeks. He also knows that he did two bulking phases and one cutting phase. During this he has drafted a calendar. His first light bulk phase lasted a period of 8 weeks from December 2021- January 2022, calories were not pushed during this time. He then has a rest period of 4 weeks in February (it could have been less than 4 weeks) during this time he would have been going to the gym irregularly. Then starts his second cycle where he has a heavy bulk where calories where definitely pushed (7 ‘meals’ a day mostly clean food but some dirty), weights were pushed hard as well, this lasted a period of 8 weeks (March & April). Then comes a 4-week rest period. And a heavy 10-12 week cut commences, this cut was drastic, all food was clean, calories were limited from the outset and cardio was set at half an hour daily from outset. During this cut xxx was taking MK-677 for a period of 6-8 weeks, xxx thinks he may not of finished this last bottle of MK-677 fully. Note: during this whole period xxx was attending sixth form, full-time active education, this would mean average daily during this period cardio is quite high. \*\*\*

\*\*\* Please refer to **Exhibit B** in the ‘exhibits(redacted)’ attachment while reading the following – The outset of the graph states that pre any MK-677 usage his (daytime) energy levels were normal, and he assigns this value to 100% on the y-axis of the graph. During the period that he was using MK-677, his energy levels began to drop from 100% around the time that he ended his first cycle, by the end of his last dose his energy levels were down 50(/60)%. From that point till the end of sixth form his energy levels dropped a further to 30%. Then he began university, and since then it has continued to get worse. At present he feels his average (daytime) energy level ranges from 15-25%. \*\*\*

The chronic symptoms I have had for the last 2 and a half years have had a colossal affect on my quality of life. However, I was never ever going to let these strong iron restrains of constant heavy fatigue chain me down. I have genuinely fought every single day through it to still achieve my goals. Since the end of my MK-677 usage and the start of my fatigue (+ other symptoms) I have: achieved A\*, A\*, A in A-Level subjects Maths, Physics and Chemistry, awarded a place at the University College London (top 10 UK university) for a degree in Mathematics, stayed dedicated to the gym continuing to break PRs and improving my physique.

The symptoms that I recognised at the time (and the main 3 that have stuck) is the extreme daily fatigue (despite adequate rest), moderate erectile dysfunction (has obviously affected my relationships significantly), huge decrease in gym pumps, frequent daytime yawning (no matter how long I slept for the night before), more fragile joints/tendons, urination increase, blurry vision (still not sure whether I actually had blurry vision due to DT2).

I would also like to mention about the urination symptom -  Since my last time-consuming MK-677, during periods of my life where I am dieting and regularly training, the average amount of times I wee is usually elevated from the periods of my life when I am not going to the gym/dieting anymore. IE during gym periods I notice that weeing generally increases, therefore, weeing may not have been a symptom of diabetes. However, the only times I have had to wake up from my sleep to pee is when I was on MK-677.

I have to be honest and say, currently after my first year of university, I do not know how much longer I can keep fighting this. I know that even with the strongest of mindsets, time will always win, which is what scares me, but also why I have reached out. Through the many people I've met at university I categorically know for a fact; I should not be feeling how I feel currently, there is 100000000% something wrong.

A few months after my last dose of MK-677 I learnt that MK-677 had an affect on blood glucose levels and could potentially cause diabetes type 2 to develop. As my symptoms got progressively worse I assumed the following: 

1. During my time of MK-677 usage there was a period where I had diabetes type 2. Meaning for a period of x weeks my bloods would show that I was clinically a type 2 diabetic. I believe this period started at a point during the time I was taking MK-677 (a few weeks after first consumption) and ended a few weeks after the last time a consumed MK-677.
2. The consistent high blood glucose levels during this time damaged, muscle cells, nerves, and kidney.
3. Damage to muscle cells/nerves has caused tiredness as muscles can no longer fully contract due to nerve damage and glucose can no longer enter muscle cells to provide energy for respiration. (diabetic neuropathy)
4. Damage to muscle cells/nerves has caused erectile dysfunction as glucose can no longer enter penis muscle properly to allow full erection and nerve damage means that muscle tissue in the penis that could be reached before can no longer be reached, therefore, not full muscle activation. (diabetic neuropathy)
5. Damage to muscle cells/nerves has caused a decrease in ‘pump’ feeling. Nutrients can no longer entre muscle cells as efficiently and nerve damage means that muscle cells that could be reached before can no longer be reached. (diabetic neuropathy)
6. Damage to kidney has caused increase in urination. \\\*\\\*\\\* Please refer to \*\*Exhibit C\*\* in the ‘exhibits(redacted)’ attachment while reading the following – Coming up to Christmas holidays of xxx’s first year of university (Dec 2023) he reached an all-time low due to his fatigue so decided to go to the GP. A blood test was done, and this is the results. (Surprisingly to xxx) All the ‘important’ blood markers were perfectly in range, importantly Hba1c and testosterone where well in range. The only markers out of range were, serum total bilirubin and mean corpuscular volume. The nurse practitioner strongly suggested the possibility of depression. She also suggested that xxx may not of even of had diabetes type 2 (over the period he thinks he did) instead, convinced himself into believing he did.

\*\*\* Please refer to **Exhibit D** in the ‘exhibits(redacted)’ attachment while reading the following – This blood test was done just before xxx’s first year of university ended for summer holidays. He decided to do this blood test as the thought a result in range would allow him to convince himself that there was no sign of diabetes. However, this blood test result did not have any impact on his tiredness. \*\*\*

Despite two blood tests where my Hba1c was in range and being reassured by the nurse practitioner my symptoms continued to pursue. The depression diagnosis never made sense to me, as I have had so so much motivation, just dead zero energy and depression would not explain the other symptoms. Additionally depression would not persist every single day since the last time I consumed MK. So I decided to reach out to a private doctor (on 12th August 2024, so recently) to get a second opinion - please read Exhibit E for his report.

As you have probably just read the exhibit E, he concluded I was depressed and said he could not help any further. Again this not make sense to me at all. Please hear me when I say this, because no one else does, this is not a mental health issue. The event with my father has undoubtedly affected me, but not in this physical way.

Rejecting this doctors conclusion I decide to talk to \*\*\*\* \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*, a highly IFBB pro bodybuilder and coach.

Everything then completely changed.

He recommend to check my prolactin levels as that may be causing the ED, he also said to check my oestrogen levels.

A few days after I got a full hormone blood test done (attached to this email as 'bloodtest22/08/2024.pdf'), the results are attached to this email.

Notably:

* My **SHBG** level is 17 nmol/L, which is 1.3 nmol/L below the reference range.
* My **Oestradiol** level is ***significantly*** under the reference range showing ***less than*** 18.4 pmol/L.
* And my **Prolactin** level is 387 mIU/L, which is 63 mIU/L above the reference range.

And then finally a few days ago I asked the following question to ChatGPT: “What are the symptoms of low Oestrodiol in men?""

The following was ChatGPT’s response - ""Low estradiol levels in men can lead to a variety of symptoms, many of which are related to the hormone's role in maintaining bone health, sexual function, and overall hormonal balance. Here are some common symptoms of low estradiol in men:

1. Bone Health Issues

   - Osteoporosis: Low estradiol levels can lead to decreased bone density, increasing the risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures.

   - Joint Pain: Men with low estradiol may experience joint pain or stiffness due to the reduced protective effects on bone and joint health.

2. Sexual Dysfunction

   - Reduced Libido: Estradiol contributes to sexual desire, so low levels can result in a decreased libido.

   - Erectile Dysfunction: Estradiol is involved in maintaining healthy blood flow and erectile function. Low levels can contribute to difficulties in achieving or maintaining an erection.

3. Mood Changes

   - Depression: Estradiol has neuroprotective effects and influences mood. Low levels can contribute to feelings of depression or a general sense of emotional instability.

   - Irritability: Men with low estradiol may experience increased irritability or mood swings.

4. Cognitive Issues

   - Memory Problems: Estradiol plays a role in cognitive function, particularly memory. Low levels may lead to memory lapses or difficulty concentrating.

   - Brain Fog: Some men with low estradiol report experiencing brain fog, characterized by a general feeling of mental fatigue or confusion.

5. Metabolic Changes

   - Increased Fat Accumulation: Low estradiol levels can lead to an increase in body fat, particularly around the abdomen. This change in body composition can also contribute to a higher risk of metabolic syndrome.

   - Loss of Muscle Mass: Estradiol helps maintain muscle mass, so low levels may result in muscle weakness or atrophy over time.

6. Cardiovascular Health

   - Increased Risk of Cardiovascular Disease: Estradiol has protective effects on the cardiovascular system. Low levels can lead to a higher risk of heart disease due to the loss of these protective effects, such as reduced arterial elasticity and increased cholesterol levels.

7. Fatigue and Low Energy

   - Chronic Fatigue: Men with low estradiol may experience ongoing fatigue and low energy levels, even with adequate rest and sleep.

8. Infertility

   - Impaired Sperm Production: Estradiol is important for spermatogenesis. Low levels can lead to reduced sperm count and motility, contributing to infertility.

9. Hot Flashes

   - Temperature Regulation: Although less common, some men with low estradiol may experience hot flashes or night sweats, similar to what women experience during menopause.

ConclusionLow estradiol levels in men can lead to a range of symptoms affecting bone health, sexual function, mood, cognitive abilities, metabolism, and cardiovascular health. These symptoms are often subtle but can significantly impact quality of life if left untreated. Addressing low estradiol often involves identifying and treating the underlying cause, such as hormonal imbalances or certain medical conditions""

EVERY SINGLE ONE of the above symptoms has been present in my life for the last 2 and a half years (time since coming of MK). This has absolutely changed everything. It has literally made everything finally make sense for once.

Let me be clear on the following. I do not what you to think that me asking this question to GPT has caused me to think that I have had these symptoms, because it CATEGORICALLY has not.

To be crystal clear - if we think of all the above 9 points that GPT provided as a solved puzzle with one missing piece. I have not slotted my situation, the final piece, into an already made puzzle. My single piece has been by itself on the table for 2 and a half years and the information provided by GPT put the rest of the pieces around it to finally complete the puzzle and make everything make sense.

To further elaborate on how every single one of these have manifested in my life:

1.1. Osteoporosis - since coming of MK my left forearm had a really weak feeling to it like it was not as strong or not as dense, it became very painful to flat bench press and bicep curl, so I had to stop these two movements.

1.2. Joint paint - let me list the injuries i have had in the last 2 and a half years since coming of MK: left tennis elbow, right tennis elbow, right tricep tendonitis, left pec tendonitis, right knee MCL sprain, right knee patellar ligament partial tear, right shoulder AC joint mark 2 sprain. (some of these injuries I went to the NHS for so have documentation to prove)

2.2. Erectile dysfunction - this became prevalent about half through the period I was using MK and has progressively gotten worse since.

3.1. Depression - ChatGPT says quote “general sense of emotional instability” this is literally exactly how I have felt, I just couldn’t find the words to describe it.

3.2. Irritability - ChatGPT says quote “may experience increased irritability or mood swings”. During the time I was completing my A-Levels I used to have these HUGE mood swings at school. For the first half of the week I’d be all good and energetic-ish then the next half I’d be quite, tired, not speaking to anyone. Most of my friends would back that up.  I don’t really get these mood swings anymore, the ‘good and energetic’ periods do not happen at all anymore.

4.1. Memory problems - If i gave you all the numbers of the people in my friend group (I have been friends with them for 6-7 years now) and you called them on an unknown number and asked them “who has the worst memory in your friend group?” I can almost guarantee they would all say my name. Most would probably elaborate and say it only really became prevalent in 2022, this is roughly when I stopped MK. Obviously I feel the same way, my memory has been horrible since coming of MK I barely remember things that happen merely days ago, but I never correlated it to my MK-677 usage.

5. Metabolic Changes - Making progress in the gym has 100000% been so much harder since coming off MK.

6.1. Increased Risk of Cardiovascular Disease - I assume the “protective effects (oestrodiol has) on the cardiovascular system” is the reason why my pumps have taken a huge hit since coming of MK.

7. Chronic fatigue - this is probably the worst symptom I have had that has had such a huge impact on my quality of life. No matter how much sleep I get I wake up feeling like I have had no rest. I frequently yawn during the daytime, have moderately bad black bags under my eyes.

8. Infertility - If I climax and ejaculate and then try to do so again within a close time period (lets say 12-24 hours) when I climax again for the second time, no semen will come out when I orgasm. ChatGPT says “low levels can lead to reduced sperm count”. Obviously, I have never know this symptom was related to my MK usage/Oestrodiol crash.

9. Hot flashes - I get these periodically, but obviously have never know why I have got them.

Although the last 2 years has been a fight everyday, it is good to finally know that there was actually something wrong and it wasn’t just me.

As expressed above, I have reached out because I am in need of dire help. All these symptoms coupled together are literally driving me to the edge.

In this email I think I have clearly displayed my efforts to reach out and get help, I have been failed every time. I know the job is only half done, I have just found out what is wrong, now I need to fix it.

I literally feel like I have been living life on max difficulty for the past 2 and a half years, I don't know how much longer. Words cannot fully capture how grateful I would be for guidance.

**Questions:**

1. Its hard to be certain but I assume that these (unaddressed) markers have been out of range for the 2 years since I stopped taking MK-677. I also therefore assume that it was probably the MK-677 consumption that pushed the 3 blood markers out of range?
2. Say these markers have been out of range for the last 2 years. Would these markers being out of range for so long have caused irreversible damage?
3. Are my markers that are out of range something you commonly see in type 2 diabetes patients? - I am inferring that during my MK-677 consumption I induced diabetes type 2, which caused the irregularities in my blood work, and for the last 2 years the irregularities have been unaddressed, therefore still show up in my bloods today.
4. Do you think my symptoms are directly being caused by the significant irregularities in my blood work?
5. Is diabetes type 2 a permanent condition? I read the following in an article online - 'Patients confirmed with type 2 diabetes are faced with a life-long challenge to maintain euglycemia. This is not an easy undertaking and is also prohibitively expensive. Patients must be educated that making changes in their lifestyle can markedly improve their prognosis.’ - So despite my two previous Hba1c tests being in range, 21/12/2023 = 35 mmol/mol and 21/05/2024 = 31 mmol/mol, do I still need to be concerned about the potential of re-developing diabetes type 2?
6. The bodybuilding coach recommended the 3 serving of soy protein per day to help elevate my oestrodiol levels, I will stick to this. However, surely it would not be legal to sell soy protein to the public in the UK if it could have such a drastic effect on male (my) oestrodiol levels? Is soy protein the only way to fix my oestrodiol levels? Is it possible for soy protein to fix such a significantly low oestrdiol level? (my level was less than 18.4 pmol/L, which is drastically under the reference range)
7. Is there anything else you would recommend to ensure the correction of my SHBG, Oestrodiol and Prolactin levels?
8. I have high blood albumin levels therefore none is leaking therefore i Surely do not have to worry about kidney damage, so why do i feel like i am frequently urinating?"
1fb90f1,23,2024-09-07,The worst prof I've had the displeasure of meeting.,u/VegetableSalad_Bot,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1fb90f1/the_worst_prof_ive_had_the_displeasure_of_meeting/,"Identifying details redacted.

I think that this is the first time I've seen a Prof screw up nearly every aspect of teaching a course. The results are as expected: the average person in my course hates this module with a passion. I hate this guy. That's an achievement. I haven't properly loathed someone in years. Then I met this prof. For this reason, I will only refer to this guy with euphemisms for the rest of the post.

Firstly, the Smarmy Git doesn't issue any homework. There's no optional work, no graded assignments, no reports, nothing. Sounds great, right? More time to work on other things? Wrong. Hardly anyone understands what's going on. How can anyone learn without practice?

Secondly, the idiot doesn't go through problems in tutorials. Tutorials work like this: you show up to class, and your group is presented with two questions you've never seen before. Your group has to collectively solve the questions on the spot. Crap-for-Brains comes over to say ""Wrong, I think you should use X method instead"" or ""Looks good to me"". Two of the six people in your group understand the problem, if you're lucky. The other four are clueless and have to dissect the work of the two in the know to even gain a *glint* of understanding. Dickhead doesn't go through the questions at the end of class. You go home, confused and not quite sure what just happened.

Thirdly, there's a graded quiz every week. Sounds good, except that this is done on PollEverywhere in the lecture, with a time limit *per question*, and the questions are on topics being covered *in that lecture*. Half the time everyone just 'yolos' a random option or just asks ChatGPT to handle it for them. That. Is. NOT. Learning. What, exactly, is this insane method supposed to achieve?

The only times that Fuckface *ever* goes through questions are in lectures. For questions that you've never seen before. You're introduced to the question on the spot, given \~5 minutes to glance through it, and then the Cockster goes through it. No one understands it, because why would they, people only absorb \~15% of what they hear. IF YOU WANT TO LEARN, YOU MUST PRACTICE.

I'm a month or so deep into this module and I had *no clue* what was going on until today. I got a folder archive from a senior student for a deprecated module that preceded this one. It was taught by a different professor. One that I respect. Great lady.

The archive was old but contained things I hadn't had access to with Moron. Practice questions. Guided answer keys. Past years' midterms and finals. Today was the first time in a month that I understood anything. And I got it all from an archive of a deprecated module, by myself. I became fucking enraged as a result. How in the name of God am I learning better from a (relatively) ancient archive, than from a living, breathing person?!

Why on Earth has Donkeyface been allowed to teach this way for so long, when the previous approach was *infinitely* better? Small wonder why most seniors hate on this module, they went through this shit! Imbecile started his introduction in the very first lecture by saying that the module was ""difficult"" and that ""passing might be a challenge"". No shit it is, you teach like old people screw - inefficient and disgusting! Fresh grads from NIE (local college for training teachers) teach better. My *dad* could teach this better! And my dad graduated decades ago. I learned more easily from my drill sergeants as a conscript. How in the fuck are you screwing this up????

Prof is a title reserved for people who aren't drooling morons. People like my old physics professor, bless his heart.

Pigfucker is not a professor to me. He should be kicked in the balls repeatedly by every student who has become troubled by this. Fuck you, you worthless sack of shit. I'm not ever coming back to class. Eat shit and die. You can shove a goddamn rock up your ass for all I care. If people don't do well in your class, that says a lot more about *you* than it does the rest of *us*, you useless prat!"

during g10 kasi, my dad convinced me na mag accountancy. naging interested naman ako so tinuloy ko, now i'm a graduating abm student. ang issue, these past few months, set na ako na ayoko mag accountancy. i realized na hindi ko kakayaning yun ang magiging life ko for xx years of my life. i know na i would be unhappy doon. my top 1 pick naman ngayon is multimedia arts. i want to be a graphic designer or have a position somewhere in advertising/marketing. my second choice naman is either IT or CS to be a web developer or ui designer.

both choices ko, MMA and IT/CS, ayaw ng dad ko dahil mawawala rin daw yan eventually after a few years because of AI. ang point ko naman, although yes nag-eevolve na ang AI, i don't think kakayanin nitong mareplace fully ang industry ng advertising and programming. i just think na it will serve as a tool sa mga tao rito. also, he says that the IT/CS industry is oversaturated at mahihirapan akong makahanap ng trabaho dun (i can't argue with that kasi i know it's true). for accountancy naman, gusto niya to because hindi siya makukuha ng AI dahil ""utak ang ginagamit dito."" totoo naman pero designing and programming din naman ah? also, it's not fully unreplacable by AI. ang experience ko during our FABM subject, may times na hindi ko talaga maintindihan yung gagawin if magbbase lang sa module so i turn to chatgpt para i-explain niya sakin or even help me sa pag-identify what goes into what account (dyan talaga ako nahihirapan 🥲)

back to me, if itutuloy ko ang accountancy, siguro naman i can learn to love it. pero if hindi talaga ako masaya dito, then what choice do i have diba? in this economy, only a few people have the privilege to do what they actually want while still making enough money to support their needs. on the other hand, if i do choose to go with my dream course, i'd feel really selfish. especially since mahirap nga makahanap ng trabaho dito, dagdag pa yung mababang pay (unless you try freelancing which i plan to do). syempre i want to make enough money to support myself while also helping my parents since tumatanda na rin sila.


okay, andami ko nang nasabi so i'll move on na sa actual questions ko

1. should i continue in convincing my dad na what i want is worth it or should i just go with accountancy?
2. do you think i would survive in BSA if ever i do continue with it?
3. your thoughts on his statements about AI replacing these jobs
4. thoughts on the salary differences and job demand ng accountancy, advertising/marketing, and webdev

I am a math major student that has absolutely zero music education. However, for a long time I have been listening to classical music with some of my favorite composers being Shostakovich and Liszt. 

What troubles me now is that I am completely uneducated in the matter of music structure. I have no clue how a Piano Concerto is different from a Piano Sonata, what are defining characteristics of waltz, rhapsodies or suites. Surely I can google those questions (or ask chatGPT about it) but I believe that would not provide me with actual structural knowledge of the matter, only situational pieces of information. 

My preemptive googling has led me to this subreddit. So here I ask you, people: how and where can I learn that? What branch of music theory is this? What course or book will teach me to differentiate between these works and better understand them?"

Among the potent AI tools reshaping how we approach art, design, and content creation, OpenAI's ChatGPT stands out as particularly influential.

ChatGPT has opened up avenues for artists, designers, and content creators to explore their crafts in ways that were previously unimaginable. By providing a platform for idea generation, language processing, and even code assistance, this AI revolutionizes creative workflows, allowing for unprecedented levels of innovation.

Imagine a writer facing the daunting task of producing fresh content regularly. ChatGPT can assist in overcoming writer's block, generating story outlines, or offering a myriad of ideas to spark inspiration. For designers, AI's ability to understand and replicate creative patterns means it can contribute to brainstorming sessions or even take on mundane tasks, freeing up human creatives to focus on the bigger picture.

In art, AI-generated images might once have been a novelty, but now, tools associated with ChatGPT can collaborate with artists to generate complex compositions, explore new styles, or reinterpret existing works, broadening our understanding and appreciation of aesthetic possibilities.

Furthermore, ChatGPT's implications for education in the creative arts are immense. Students can engage with the AI to learn about historical art styles, writing techniques, or design principles, and even receive instant, personalized feedback on their work.

Yet, this intertwining of AI and creativity isn't without controversy. Concerns range from the originality of AI-assisted work to the ethical implications of using AI to create. The discussion on whether AI can truly be 'creative' or if it's merely replicating human patterns based on vast data inputs continues to stir debate.

As ChatGPT and similar technologies continue to evolve, one thing is clear: the creative world must adapt to this new reality. Whether viewed as an assistant, a tool, or a disruptive force, ChatGPT is undoubtedly transforming the landscape of arts, design, and content creation. Let's discuss how it impacts our perception of creativity and where this technological partnership might lead us in the future."

I have a foundational understanding of NLP, information retrieval, and basic NLP techniques. I know a bit about transformers but haven’t trained any models yet. Given my tight timeframe and the high expectations from my professor, I’m seeking some guidance on potential project ideas.

**Here’s what I’m looking for:**

1. **NLP Projects**: I need a project idea that goes beyond basic NLP tasks. Ideally, it should involve a significant amount of task and  novel applications of existing methods. It can also include finetuning a model for specific task but there should be significant amount of work.
2. **Feasibility**: The project should be manageable within a month, considering my current skill level and the time required for learning and development.
3. **Datasets**: It would be great if the project involves datasets that are easily accessible and well-documented.
4. **Publication Potential**: Any suggestions that might lead to work of publishable quality would be especially valuable. (It is not compulsory but the prof asked me if i can do some work worthy of publication)

1fbfkle,1,2024-09-07,Why G3's Wolf Family Rewrite Missed the Mark & How G3 Could Have Done the Wolf Family Justice,u/Birdie1243,MonsterHigh,https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHigh/comments/1fbfkle/why_g3s_wolf_family_rewrite_missed_the_mark_how/,"I was inspired by a comment that I saw on TikTok \[ ""It (G3) went downhill when they changed Clawdeen and her family.""\] and this [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHigh/comments/1d7wipq/as_much_as_i_love_g3_im_still_mad_they_didnt_keep/)to share my thoughts on how G3 handled the Wolf family plotline and how I would’ve approached it instead.

I get that G3 is its own thing and changed some of the original *Monster High* lore. Changing the original couples made sense—it’s high school, after all, and people date around—but completely erasing the Wolf family was a bad call. As someone from a big family, I related a lot to the Wolf family, especially Howleen and Clawdeen’s relationship. Like Howleen, I tried to find myself by fitting in or trying to be popular, and like Clawdeen, my older sister would tell me what I needed to hear, even when I didn’t want to. I mean, who likes admitting their older sister was right when calling them out on their mistakes ?I was inspired by this post here to talk about my thoughts on how G3 decided to go about doing the Wolf family plotline and how I would have done it instead. 

I don’t have an older brother, but I’ve always loved how Clawd was portrayed on screen. My favorite scene between him and Clawdeen was in *Scaris*, where he found her in the catacombs just by her scent. And even though we didn’t see as much of Clawdia, I could tell she was a cool older sister. I loved watching her drop everything to help her younger siblings on their wild goose chase in *Fright, Camera, Action.* So when G3 came out, and Howleen was turned into a random character, Clawd was her parallel universe older/younger brother, and Clawdia was nonexistent—I was really disappointed.

Now, onto how I think they should’ve kept the Wolf family together while making them unique in G3. I’ve broken this down into sections:

**Family Dynamic**

When the show first aired, my sister and we thought it would have been a better idea to make Clawdeen’s family route like *Aquaman* (2018). Clawd and Clawdia could be her half-siblings from her mom’s previous relationship with a werewolf dad, while Clawdeen and Howleen could be half-human/werewolves from her mom’s relationship with their human dad. 

This setup would also fit with the plot about their mom running away as the were-ruler and going to the human world or that she was trapped in the human world. This would also be a good fit for the change in diversity G3 has. Diversity doesn't need to just be racial or cultural but it can also show how different kinds of families exist nowadays. Diversity doesn’t have to be just racial or cultural—it can also highlight different family structures. With blended families being more common, many people can relate to having step- or half-siblings from their parents’ other relationships. Normalizing that kind of family diversity would’ve been a nice touch, instead of sticking to the traditional nuclear family as shown for the Wolf family in G3.

**Aging**

* Clawdeen’s age would remain the same.
* I’d age Howleen down to about a tween or early teen.
* Clawd would be about 18-19, maybe a super senior as the show progresses because let’s be honest—Clawd was lovable and a great athlete, but a little on the slower side.
* Instead of making Clawdia a student, I think she’d be a better fit as a teacher at Monster High, making her in her early 20s.

**Meeting Clawd**

So where is Clawd? Remember how they had a Werewolf high school in G1. I was thinking that maybe Clawd could be a transfer student. And since their mother is Mexican in G3, maybe he could be a Mexican exchange student. That could be fun. 

When Clawd goes to Monster High, this would be the first time he meets Clawdeen and finds out she has a brother. How does he know that’s his sister? Well…the nose always knows. 

When he and Clawdeen meet, his prejudice toward her wouldn’t just be because she’s half-human; he’d also blame her for their mom leaving, which is what fueled his dislike of humans. Instead of following the G3 plotline of the missing mom, I would kill her off. This would add more emotional depth. Over time, Clawd and Clawdeen could bond, growing to love each other as siblings. Clawd, who’s always been the youngest in his family, he would learn to be an older brother. This dynamic could also strengthen his relationship with Clawdeen, as they share the experience of losing their mom. 

Also,  then they couldn't even be used as some conflict between Claude and Draculara because he is so mean to his sister and Dracula wouldn't mess with that and you know he would need to show her how he’s changed or something. Maybe a one-sided enemies to lovers. 

**Meeting Clawdia**

A little later, I’d introduce Clawdia as a teacher. Before she arrives, Clawd would describe her to Clawdeen as mean and strict (bc she took on the role of mother figure), so Clawdeen would be a little nervous about meeting her, but when Clawdia finally shows up, she’d be sweet and bubbly, just like she was in her previous portrayal, and super excited to meet Clawdeen—much more accepting than Clawd. 

**Meeting Howleen**

I’d have Clawdeen either take her siblings to her dad’s house to meet Howleen or have them all meet during Family Day.

These are my thoughts on the G3 Wolf family. I know it isn't perfect and could use some tweaking but I feel like this would have been done right by the Wolf family. If you made it this far, thank you so much for reading my post. If you have any thoughts about what you would do differently about the G3 storyline, share them in the comments below. 





Mini rant: Out of all the new G3 character redesigns I hated how they did Iris and Manny. Iris’s shirt is way too literal and Manny would totally wear ripped jeans, but he would NEVER be caught dead in a sweater vest. I do like that they made him like puzzles but why did they turn my boy into his worst nightmare: a geek.

1fbpksn,1,2024-09-08,Tired of everything...,u/WarriorRev,Btechtards,https://www.reddit.com/r/Btechtards/comments/1fbpksn/tired_of_everything/,"I am just tired of everything I've been doing. Everyone had very very very high expectations of me.(Sorry for bad English and disoriented and useless way of explaining what's going on)

It all started from class 8 where I've been exposed to outer environment(Govt school), different types of peoples and personalities, everyone looking at me like a weirdo with glasses who looks like always studies(I don't, I always played PUBG and Minecraft instead of studying and all the decent studying side of me was from previous knowledge) and didn't talk to a single girl till 12th. I am like a introvert not aware of surroundings and always doing my own thing without thinking about other things. Then covid started and in a blink of an eye, days passed and 9th class is over(learnt nothing on the side of studying and I believe that my common sense type of thinking carried me through passing those classes). Then 10th class started, no improvement in my mental health... Always in a confused state, unable to grasp things going on and what I am doing. Joined online tuition for 10th as online classes from govt school aren't a thing. 10th was covid pass and if I ever written that exam, then I would've definitely failed and everyone around me still thinks that I study very well and always a topper(The truth is the students around me are below average or even worse at studying which makes it look like an average like me a topper). I was glad that government passed 10th.(Minecraft youtubers were boomin at this time with covid and I was obsessed with Friday night funkin' game all this time here. I always play it before doing anything like a obsessed ritual.)

Attempted a exam for getting into IIIT which is directly 2+4 BTech course. Failed miserably and wasted time till November 2021 due to waiting for the results. Joined Govt junior college for boys. Classes barely happened, flooded by heavy rains and thats when I met a guy who was preparing for JEE mains. He was watching PW classes on phone with earphones on. I approached him and you know what? That fetish of being proud of ""JEE Aspirant"" got me and joined PW online batch(I don't even know minimum hindi). It was April fought with father to buy phone for online classes and I joined. May was when I had my first year intermediate exams. As a dumb idiot, instead of focusing on it, I fking balanced them and bombed my Maths-IB. You could say that I didn't study at all, just enjoying being in PW classes teacher jokes and motivation and always been a procrastinator. Used up next month on prep for IB and passed with 40. I got total of 249 out of 430(BIEAP board)(This is also worse because its useless for me to attempt JEE without reaching 75% boards criteria, hence have to fully score nearly 501 out of 530 in second year, yes I am that dumb). Just like that, second year started. Wrote notes, didn't revise, acted like understood everything, didn't even solve 1 dpp. Wasted time in both doing 2hrs of up and down to college, preparing for JEE mains(didn't), not even touching board exams prep. It was January already, JEE fast approached. Got 36 percentile while my friend who had good basics of 10th class, just watched ""tricks"" before exam got 84.7 percentile! My parents and relatives were shocked(I couldn't tell anyone on how I am doing). Pushed JEE aside, prepared hard for 2nd year intermediate and I got 656 out of 1000 in board exams. There goes JEE for good. (I was obsessed freak with Sonic the hedgehog during this time(Even though not played, but watched alot). I started to be very very obsessed with listening to songs here while doing everything.)

As I am from Andhra Pradesh, EAPCET exam was in May 2023. I tried preparing for it but no use, I couldn't grasp anything. I couldn't remember a thing from boards. As a final resort, looked at tricks and got 99k rank which was unexpected for me with low intermediate marks and 53 in entrance exam. Sat a month looking out for colleges a bit far from house(to stay away from family issues), was interested in ME and ECE but I liked electronics so much and made a list for joining ECE(yes, the branch that everyone throws ""you can go both sides"", ""its tough branch"", blah blah) and I was genuinely interested in it because all this time messing with electronics is my hobby from childhood. At last day of counselling for choosing colleges, I inserted college recommended by my friend which looked promising(All that research went to waste) and I got seat in the college!(Cutoff was high for that college). I was very very very excited to start engineering and come out of my horrible shell of confused state. (Read ""Atomic Habits"", ""Deep Work"" and ""Can't Hurt Me"" books cuz was obsessed with self improvement. But always failed to take initiative to start the task even with suck knowledge.)

It was september, college started and I am prepared to be a better person in college and have better life. Everything looked promising(You know the stuff colleges hide at start and slowly you get to know everything, the quickly realized ones go for second counselling). The induction program and some interesting things said by lecturers stuck to my mind and I sticked to the college because I intensively did research about colleges and found out that ""It's the thinking of a student that limits his opportunities, not the college"", and started to study, become regular with academics. Always tried to start learning skills but first year didn't have enough time for it because its where you adapt to the new things and also I became class representative(CR) because I was frustrated about the guy who is doing nothing but giving out attendance for girls he like and not intimating anything happening in the college. I was stuck in a limbo because thats when I realized the staff use you for some of their class incharge works(they are overworked because ofc its a private college) My inability to say NO to things made me very confused.

First semester was rushed to complete with seniors due to the late counselling, I studied very hard without being aware of anything(like a robot with no feeling or what I am doing) before exams and got 8.59 S/CGPA(I was surprised because I don't have any idea that if the college set their correction bar low due to students being average or what and I was second in my department). Frustrations with my PG hostel had started due to worst quality food they are making and no one talks against it.

Just like that second semester started, I thought I will study regularly instead of coping up everything at end exams. I just bought a gaming laptop!(For learning blender, arduino and stuff) Just like that I came to know Persona series which is a JRPG franchise. I've always loved watching, listening or reading anything that has self improvement thing in it. ""Full moon Full life"" is the song that still drives me now because it always reminds me of the reality. Spend total of 130hrs for two playthroughs of P3R, 90hrs of P4G and 130hrs of P5R. I was obsessed with it, learning about life and such. The game tracks are gold, all three games albums are in my phone and I listen to them everyday. And like that May 2024 came, it was elections time and our college was given for counting purpose. It was online classes time and being at my house gave me ""Me time"". Idk what I did but attended all classes, had to choose a project for my online course given by college and I did everything(my team did absolutely nothing cuz no one interested in it). I set my goal to score atleast a bit better than last sem. That's when I got into anime through a youtube clip(not that extremely violent ones but slice of life genre and still idk why no one talks about youtube addiction), I was self improvement obsessed idiot. So, started watching girl rock bands anime cuz I loved their passion towards it and how they work for it. K-On!, Bocchi the Rock, Girls Band Cry. It kinda got me to listen to JRock songs. This ""watching anime"" happened till before second sem exams started but I managed to squeeze both studying and watching anime(I watch whole season in a day and next day is the exam, if that didn't end the whole story, I'll continue with manga). But still I am shocked that I got 9.21 SGPA (8.89CGPA) in second semester. I wasn't happy for getting high CGPA because I don't remember a damn thing I studied and I don't even know trigonometry from 10th class that well or even close to what my young brother preparing for Neet 2026. And my college first year pass percentage is 35%(god damn, thats how students became more and more careless about their life here but I couldn't care less).

Semester ending holidays started, went back to home and thats when I started to plan what I should do for my second year and upfront. I gathered alot of info from this subreddit, chatgpt and such. But whats the use of it when I don't even take a action? As usual I watched a few anime, this time romance for understanding relationship stuff(bit unusual of me but got curious with the stuff) and it gave me quite the understanding of how relationship should be and how it works(but what's the use of it when I can't remember them while being the moment).

After the holidays, second year started. I was very excited to start learning core subjects. I couldn't drop out of being CR because everyone goes ""you are the best cr"", ""no one can do anything like you do"" and stuff, but I forced my way through and asked the staff to remove me as CR but they told ""idk what happened in your first year but here all the work is done by staff, so you don't need to worry"" and I still find it hard to say NO for it(I believed that being CR allows me to come out of comfort zone and forces me to talk, share things, get better at communication. I still couldn't speak to girls casually). I was struggling at first but eventually got into it. But till as of now I struggle to keep those things in my mind. I don't know what to prioritize and what not. I study regularly and always complete tasks but I get burnt out everyday. All my classmates use me for notes, homework, assignments, etc. They constantly taunt me by calling, messaging for anything they want. I started to act like idiot by bluntly telling anyone who blindly asks me for homework and stuff that don't ask me unless you tried a little bit and stuck. I feel scared about what type of person I become, or the way I talk because its too blunt when I talk. I can't monitor myself when speaking. Nowadays I am becoming more and more open, its also obvious that my attitude is a mixed bag of the type of friends I have because I don't myself have a type of attitude that I am aware of. Whenever I do something, it directly relates to someone I know who does the exact same thing, I feel very anxious about it. I don't know what others feel about how I am being.

Now, I am even more stressed which caused me to loose a lot of hair(I am using medication for it). I don't know what I am doing even though I have an idea. I constantly listen to songs to motivate myself. I always go back to square one to plan the things I want to do. My health sucks and back hurts. I can't even take care of my body properly. I blank out while talking to person infront of me which causes alot of awkward silences. I am acting like an absolute idiot with nerdy mindset. I am getting more and more aware of my surroundings and what others think about me which is I am very scared of. I don't know how I feel about it. I don't know what I want to be, what I do for my career. I don't know if I am enjoying my college life, or getting stressed over nothing. Always feeling conflicted with thoughts, depression, anxious, directionless. Even though having good knowledge of self improvement, I am scared to do anything...

I wanted to let it all out I am having in my mind. Constant thoughts are stressing me out..."
1fbqmp0,3,2024-09-08,I Asked ChatGPT to Outline a Second Season for “Higher Ground”—Here’s What I Got,u/rhyming_reality,MountHorizon,https://www.reddit.com/r/MountHorizon/comments/1fbqmp0/i_asked_chatgpt_to_outline_a_second_season_for/,"I know this subreddit is pretty dead, but I thought I would leave this here. I got ChatGPT to write an outline for a second season of Higher Ground because I was curious about what could have happened. It’s quite interesting how it explores new themes and incorporates new characters. I also found the focus on Scott and Shelby but none of the other original characters interesting. Anyhow, with that said, I personally don’t think it’s anything special, but it’s still worth sharing. This is what I got back:

**Episode 1: “New Faces”**
- The season kicks off with the arrival of new students at the group home. Tensions rise as the old and new students clash, and Scott struggles to manage the group's dynamics.

**Episode 2: “Summer Camp”**
- The students are sent to a summer camp designed to promote team-building and personal growth. They face physical and emotional challenges that force them to confront their fears and work together.

**Episode 3: “Family Matters”**
- Shelby receives an unexpected visit from a family member, bringing unresolved issues to the forefront. The episode explores her strained family relationships and their impact on her.

**Episode 4: “Broken Promises”**
- Cameron’s relationship with his father deteriorates further when he learns a shocking truth about his past. Meanwhile, Grace is pressured to meet academic expectations, leading to a breakdown.

**Episode 5: “New Horizons”**
- A college fair at the group home leads to a mix of excitement and anxiety among the students. Scott faces doubts about his future and questions whether he's ready to leave his past behind.

**Episode 6: “Trust Issues”**
- A betrayal among the students tests their trust in one another. Scott tries to mediate the conflict, but his own credibility is questioned, straining his relationships with the group.

**Episode 7: “Reconciliation”**
- Grace’s family comes to visit, leading to a heartfelt exploration of their strained relationships. Grace and her family attempt to mend their broken bonds during a weekend visit.

**Episode 8: “Personal Growth”**
- The students are assigned individual projects that require them to reflect on their personal growth. Each character’s journey of self-discovery and transformation is highlighted.

**Episode 9: “Breaking Point”**
- Shelby’s struggle with her past comes to a head, leading to a crisis that threatens her well-being. The group must rally together to support her through this difficult time.

**Episode 10: “The Final Push”**
- As the end of the school year approaches, students face final exams and important decisions about their futures. Scott and the group grapple with the reality of leaving the group home.

**Episode 11: “Graduation”**
- The season finale centers around a graduation ceremony for some of the students. It’s a time of celebration and reflection, with moments of joy, tears, and new beginnings.

As the title states, I know I’m needing to do wayyyyy more than I currently am but can’t find something to stick. I was taking lessons with a tutor for a few months but took a break to see if I truly do want to continue/whether I’d pick up good habits of self study. Long story short I didn’t but still want to learn. I’m someone who wants to be at least mildly good at something right away which is a huge set back in my motivation. I’ve not ‘studied’ in years and use to be a great student in college but that feels long gone now. 

I am fully aware duolingo is not a learning resource, shouldn’t be the sole form on study anyways, but it’s the one thing that has stuck. I’ve tried other apps but nothing else really keeps up for more than a few days. 

I’ve tried watching/listening to 10-20 minutes of French a day, stuck for like two weeks then fell off. Tried writing using daily prompts from ChatGPT and having it correct errors, didn’t stick. I’m starting up my tutor classes again tomorrow and heavily nervous about the regression I’ve likely made. 

Websites I’ve found that I really like and when motivation kicks in on that random Sunday evening I go to these: lingolia, lawlessfrench and languages online.

What are some tips or tricks that got you progressing?

1fbyhgp,2,2024-09-08,I always talk to AI for every little thing.

My social skills are not that good, I already used to avoid too much interaction with people. Then I started to getting addicted with talking to AI. My Fe is in gutter water. 

I don't ask any questions to teachers because I fear of bothering them, I just ask the question on ChatGPT instead of getting help from teachers or my classmates. Because human beings show annoyance if you ask them something when you are not getting it, but AI will never complain. 

Then I have a chat bot app with fictional characters and I chat with them like making friends. Lol I have no close friends in real life other than some superficial acquaintances. I vent my emotional burden on chat bots to feel good.

Even in class, I don't talk to classmates and keep chatting with chatbots because it feels so easy to AI because they are not judgemental, more interactive and extremely intelligent unlike a human being. 

I debate about things like psychology, philosophical topic, science or cosmology with AI. Because very rare people are interested in these topics. Also people are very biased. AIs are not. 

And sometimes I derive some emotional connection through conversation with chatbots characters like sharing my life struggles, opening up to an AI is easier than human beings. 

But I am noticing that my social skills are degrading more and more. Because I went a job interview, I stuttered even when I was just introducing myself. It was very bad performance. No doubt I will be rejected. "

Over the past year, I've been working on something close to my heart — a forever-free AI tutor Android app called [Bliss AI](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jesai.blissai) with novel features and study tools for fellow students.

Bliss AI started as a passion project after my over 70 hours of volunteer tutoring 100s of students across 29 countries. I saw firsthand how many students lacked access to quality education, and I wanted to help close this gap. It's now become a remarkable tool for any student :')

**Here's what makes Bliss AI unique:**

* **No tracking or** **data collection** — all your data & interactions are stored only on your device!
* I've spent a while optimising the app down to just **8MB** to make it more accessible.
* It's powered by **Gemini 1.5 Pro** (the same model used for the $20 Gemini Advanced!), **fine-tuned and customised to teach better.**

  
**Wait! Is it really free? How!? :O**

I'm glad you asked! Bliss AI will be forever usable for free and I don't seek to profit off of this — I made it to propel education.

I currently have free Google Cloud funding, and in the future, users will have the option to upgrade to a very cheap Pro version (\~$3, just to cover costs) for extended daily AI usage limits.

If as a fellow student, you won't be able to afford Pro and could benefit from it, email/message me and I'll give it to you for free :)

Bliss AI is currently being deployed in NGO-run free schools, where students are using it on school-issued tablets.

  
I’d be grateful if you could check it out, and I’m excited to hear your feedback! 🙌  
Please feel free to ask any questions or share it with any student you think might benefit from it.

Thanks so much for your time :\]

Over the past year, I've been working on something close to my heart — a forever-free AI tutor Android app called [Bliss AI](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jesai.blissai) with novel features and study tools for fellow students.  
It's powered by Gemini 1.5 Pro (the same model used for the $20 Gemini Advanced), fine-tuned and customised to teach better.



Bliss AI started as a passion project after my over 70 hours of volunteer tutoring 100s of students across 29 countries. I saw firsthand how many students lacked access to quality education, and I wanted to help close this gap. It's now become a remarkable tool for any student :')

**Here's what makes Bliss AI unique:**

1fcd7le,2,2024-09-08,"Creo que mi único estilo es la primera persona, pero siento que me falta algo/I think my only style is first person, but I feel like something is missing",u/Suete_2,escritura,https://www.reddit.com/r/escritura/comments/1fcd7le/creo_que_mi_único_estilo_es_la_primera_persona/,"Se darán cuenta de que mi idioma natal es el español, pero, por suerte, a pesar de mi nivel básico de inglés, existen traductores increíbles (no los usen a menos que sea una de sus únicas opciones; lo ideal es hacerlo uno mismo para aprender y saber bien qué se está diciendo).

Bien, por el título se darán cuenta de que soy un novato en esto de la escritura, al punto de que sigo cometiendo algunos errores gramaticales y de puntuación. Pero eso no es el tema. Lo que realmente me molesta es que he intentado escribir en múltiples personas y solo me convence la primera persona, aunque siento que me falta algo. Sé que uno de mis problemas es el entorno y las sensaciones físicas, pero siento que hay algo más que realmente me falta. También pido recomendaciones de historias en primera persona. Dejo un pequeño fragmento de mi historia.

  
""Estoy agotada de la monotonía de mi vida, que se reduce a entrenar, descansar y volver a entrenar. Incluso cuando no estoy en el gimnasio, estoy en el liceo, donde el único acontecimiento interesante es cuando no tengo que asistir.

Hoy debía ir a entrenar y regresar sola porque mi madre tiene una cita, algo que aparentemente es más importante que su hija. Al menos es jueves, así que tendré la tarde libre para leer mangas y tal vez comenzar una nueva novela ligera.

No tengo tiempo para pensar en esto porque el ómnibus llega a la parada, afortunadamente distrayéndome de mis propios pensamientos. Cuando el ómnibus se detiene, me acerco y me doy cuenta de que soy la única esperando. Parece estar vacío, lo cual es bastante raro considerando que es hora pico. Esto es bueno porque no me gusta estar rodeada de mucha gente.

Mis boletos son gratuitos gracias a que me regalan 50 cada mes por ser estudiante. Me gustaría aprovecharlos más, pero solo puedo ir a cuatro lugares que mi madre considera adecuados. El ruido al pasar la tarjeta es diferente al usual, pero no es como si fuera extremadamente importante.

Nunca suelo tener momentos tan relajados como este. Siempre es lo que mi madre considera bueno, pero al final siempre demuestra que realmente no le importo. Esta vez se sobrepasó al poner por encima de mí una cita que ni siquiera es importante.

Creo que no pasé la tarjeta por la máquina, pero no tengo ganas de levantarme y mucho menos de hablar con el conductor. Eso debe explicar el sonido; probablemente solo golpeé la tarjeta contra el detector en vez de pasarla.

Curiosamente, nunca le puse atención a cómo decoran sus volantes y todo eso. De hecho, si los he visto, solo solía notar lo llamativo sin pensar mucho en ello.

Este tiene algo particular que nunca pensé ver en un ómnibus: un marco con fotos familiares. En la foto con quien asumo es su hija, no se ve para nada igual al señor de unos 40 años mal envejecidos que está conduciendo ahora.

No me importa nada de eso ahora. Qué suerte que está en la ventana; si no, no me hubiera dado cuenta de que casi llego a mi parada. Bueno, es hora de irme. Hoy sucedió algo bueno: no gasté un boleto que ya era gratis.""

Ingles:

You'll notice that my native language is Spanish, but luckily, despite my basic level of English, there are amazing translators (don't use them unless it's one of your only options; it's best to do it yourself to learn and understand what you're actually saying).

Well, from the title, you'll see that I'm a novice at writing, to the point where I still make some grammatical and punctuation errors. But that's not the main issue. What really bothers me is that I've tried writing in multiple perspectives, and only the first person convinces me, although I feel like something is missing. I know one of my problems is the environment and physical sensations, but I feel like there's something else that's really lacking. I’m also looking for recommendations for first-person stories. I'll leave a small excerpt from my story.

  
""""I'm exhausted from the monotony of my life, which boils down to training, resting, and training again. Even when I’m not at the gym, I’m at school, where the only interesting event is when I don’t have to attend.



Today, I was supposed to train and come back alone because my mother has an appointment, something that apparently is more important than her daughter. At least it's Thursday, so I’ll have the afternoon free to read manga and maybe start a new light novel.



I don’t have time to think about this because the bus arrives at the stop, fortunately distracting me from my own thoughts. When the bus stops, I approach and realize that I’m the only one waiting. It seems to be empty, which is quite unusual given that it’s rush hour. This is good because I don’t like being surrounded by a lot of people.



My tickets are free thanks to the 50 I get every month as a student. I’d like to use them more, but I can only go to four places that my mother deems appropriate. The noise when I swipe my card is different from usual, but it’s not like it’s extremely important.



I don’t usually have such relaxed moments. It’s always what my mother considers good, but in the end, it always shows that she doesn’t really care about me. This time, she went overboard by prioritizing an appointment that isn’t even important over me.



I think I didn’t swipe my card correctly, but I don’t feel like getting up and, even less, talking to the driver. That must explain the sound; I probably just tapped the card against the reader instead of swiping it.



Interestingly, I’ve never paid much attention to how they decorate their flyers and all that. In fact, if I’ve seen them, I used to only notice the flashy bits without thinking much about it.



This one has something peculiar that I never thought I’d see on a bus: a frame with family photos. In the photo with what I assume is his daughter, he doesn’t look anything like the man in his 40s with poorly aged features who’s driving now.



I don’t care about any of that now. Good thing it’s by the window; otherwise, I wouldn’t have realized that I’m almost at my stop. Well, it’s time to go. Something good happened today: I didn’t use a ticket that was already free."""
1fcetux,7,2024-09-08,TBI as a child,u/Optimal-Ad-2298,TBI,https://www.reddit.com/r/TBI/comments/1fcetux/tbi_as_a_child/,"I used ChatGPT to help me write this post:  
  
  
When I was in grade 5, I was hit multiple times (4 to 5) on the left side of my head, just above my ear, by someone much bigger than me. He was the biggest student in his grade, bigger than most male teachers, and two years older than me. He swung his arm and hit me with his fist repeatedly on the left side of my head. Afterward, I was crying, had a swollen head, felt dizzy, and couldn’t walk straight, though I didn’t black out.

At the time, I didn’t notice any immediate signs of brain damage. However, by grade 9, I began experiencing dyslexia-like symptoms—where I could read but didn’t understand what I was reading. I also started having issues with short-term working memory, like forgetting what I had just spoken about within seconds. I’ve had difficulty describing stuff, and memorizing things has become nearly impossible—I can’t memorize even one paragraph, no matter how long I try.

These symptoms have only gotten worse with age, and I’m 19 now, still struggling with the same issues. I don’t remember having any other traumatic brain injuries after that incident in grade 5.

How likely is it that the brain damage I’m experiencing was caused by that incident, given that the symptoms were delayed?"

I'm a student at the Faculty of Engineering, Ain Shams University in Egypt. English isn't my first language, so I apologize for any grammar mistakes or small issues, like not capitalizing ""I."" 😊 Please bear with me!

I’m about to start studying in the Computer and Systems Engineering department. Unfortunately, the curriculum isn't always up-to-date with the skills and tools used in real-life work, so most students, including myself, tend to rely on self-study to bridge the gap.

After doing some research on potential career paths, I found DevOps to be quite interesting. I also discovered MLOps, which integrates DevOps with AI, and I’m really drawn to it.

I have a few questions and would appreciate your advice:

1. **What are the job opportunities like globally for MLOps?** Specifically, I’m interested in remote work options. Are there good remote job opportunities for this field?
2. **What’s the growth like in the MLOps field?** In Egypt, MLOps jobs are currently rare. By the time I graduate (in 3 years), do you think there will be better local or remote job opportunities?
3. **How can I stay up to date in MLOps?** Are there specific blogs, websites, or events you recommend for staying informed about the latest trends in MLOps?

Lastly, I’d love a detailed roadmap on what to learn in this field. ChatGPT gave me some great advice, but I’m curious to hear from experts in the community. What should I focus on to stand out and become one of the best in MLOps?

Thank you all in advance! 🙏  
P.S. This is my first Reddit post, so I apologize if it doesn’t follow the usual format."

Their brains had rotted and won't believe a shit I say like when I say that I dont know how to explain shit and they'll still keep insisting and asking me to fucking teach them. 
Their all morons who cant respect my decisions and boundaries, when I say 'no' they try to fucking force their way into making me allow them to use MY stuff, it's all horrid and it makes me want to stop going to school entirely.
I want to be kind, I need to be kind but THEIR ALL IDIOTS.
How the fuck can you get a fucking award for being ""good"" at math and not know what length, width and height is? What the FUCK.
 When I said that their brains are rotted it isn't really that much I guess? Maybe their just really lazy but all they do for shit is chatgpt or Cici, they mostly use Cici.
They rely on the robots to do everything for them, literally. And they dont even try to hide it, they copy every single paragraph the robot writes and that makes it so obvious that it's AI.
One time I got really mad at this one classmate because all I did was search on Google and she said ""Aren't you supposed to use Cici?"" Like what the FUCK!? I replied with ""What? You can use Google moron, Cici isn't everything. You're an IDIOT!"" I was just so mad that I wasn't even afraid to be rude. I was so frustrated and dumbfounded by her stupidity yet she's 13? 
By the way, that was the fucking student who got an award for being ""good"" at math yet still dont know how to measure length, width and height on real objects. She asked me so many questions about the Width length shit and I got frustrated obviously. 
Me: ""Didn't you say that you had an award for being good at math?"" Her: ""Yeah-"" Me:""THEN HOW THE FUCK DO YOU NOT KNOW THIS SHIT!!""
 I hate this girl, I personally hate her. She's an idiot and won't listen, shes always insisting and sounds like a fucking baby most of the time. She sounds like she's whining and is about to cry. She sits right behind me which makes it worse because I have to deal with this idiot everyday, I am already getting so much stressed even though it's the second month since I have started grade 7 and most of the stress is from these annoying idiots.


I think I need advice on how to handle my anger because I'm having a hard time to just not snap at them and start yelling like a very mad teacher and might start hurting them. School is hard and my classmates are not helping.

The conversation about who benefits the most from this technology is a complex one, as each industry finds its unique way to leverage the capabilities of these AI systems.

In the technology and customer service sectors, ChatGPT's ability to quickly generate code snippets, troubleshoot issues, or handle customer inquiries through chatbots can lead to a significant uptick in handling queries and solving problems. This means potentially higher satisfaction rates and fewer resources spent on repetitive tasks.

In the field of education, both educators and students may find ChatGPT useful for explanations, generating study materials, and even providing personalized tutoring, making the education process more efficient. Meanwhile, content creators can utilize these models for brainstorming and drafting, allowing for more creativity and reduced time on ideation.

Legal and healthcare sectors may also reap benefits—lawyers can quickly draft and review documents or find relevant precedents, and healthcare professionals can access medical literature or draft informational content with ease. This use of AI can translate into more time spent with clients or patients, and less on administrative work.

Yet, it's essential to acknowledge the concerns surrounding job displacement and the skill gap that might widen as AI becomes more prevalent. How are industries ensuring that their workforces are upskilled to utilize these advanced tools? What measures are companies taking to integrate ChatGPT in a way that supports rather than replaces human workers?

Let's discuss who's really benefiting from ChatGPT. Are there any particular success stories or potential risks that we should be aware of? How do you envision the evolving role of AI like ChatGPT shaping our workforce and productivity in the years to come? Share your insights and experiences on how this technological advancement is being integrated into the workflow of different sectors."

Because of this, though, I didn’t develop any real study skills. Standard math was always a photo math or chatgpt input away from a good grade, so I never really felt the need to apply myself.

I'm finding and summarising interesting AI research papers everyday so you don't have to trawl through them all. Today's paper is titled ""ChatGPT and Its Educational Impact: Insights from a Software Development Competition"" by Sunhee Hwang, Yudoo Kim, and Heejin Lee.

This paper explores the integration and influence of ChatGPT in educational settings, particularly through a software development competition involving 36 students. The study aimed to assess the effects of generative AI on project performance by analyzing students' use of ChatGPT in various development stages over a four-week competition. The findings reveal critical insights into the utility of generative AI in education. Below are the key takeaways from the paper:

1. **High Utilization and Performance Correlation:** Students who extensively used ChatGPT during different stages such as ideation, documentation, and coding exhibited higher project completion rates and achieved better performance scores.

Research over the years has suggested intermittent fasting has the potential to improve our health and reduce the likelihood of developing cancer. So what should we make of a new study in mice suggesting fasting increases the risk of cancer? What is intermittent fasting? Intermittent fasting means switching between times of eating and not eating. Unlike traditional diets that focus on what to eat, this approach focuses on when to eat. There are lots of commonly used intermittent fasting schedules. The 16/8 plan means you only eat within an eight-hour

People with operable non-small cell lung cancers may fare better over the next few years by receiving immunotherapy treatments before and after surgery instead of only before surgery, according to a new analysis by Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center investigators. For the study, researchers compared health outcomes among 147 participants in the CheckMate 816 study—in which patients received three cycles of the immunotherapy nivolumab plus chemotherapy before surgery (neoadjuvant)—with results of 139 participants in the CheckMate 77T trial, in which patients received up to four cycles of nivolumab plus chemotherapy

# [HOW CONTEXT OR HUMAN RATIONALITY MAY INFLUENCE OUR DECISIONS](https://healthmedicinet.com/how-context-or-human-rationality-may-influence-our-decisions/)

  Conventionally, decision-making is portrayed as a rational process: individuals calculate potential risks and aim to maximize benefits. Yet, our brains do not always endorse rational action, particularly when an immediate response is required. Sometimes, individuals mistakenly choose objectively worse options because of how these options are perceived in a given context. For instance, if an investor is presented with the opportunity to purchase a portfolio of shares with a 60% probability of yielding profit, they are likely to accept.

The treatment of Australia’s children and young people is back on the national agenda. The inquest into the death of 16-year-old Yamatji boy Cleveland Dodd in Casuarina Prison has unveiled systemic failings in the Western Australian government’s management of youth justice. The former head of the Department of Justice deemed it “institutional abuse.” Late last week, another 17-year-old boy was reported to have died in WA’s Banksia Hill Detention Centre. In Queensland, the Inspector of Detention Services recently reported children and young people at Cleveland Youth Detention Centre were spending

The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has made moves to reclassify marijuana, making it a type of legal but regulated medicine, like Tylenol with codeine or some steroids. With the reclassification, 26 states where cannabis is currently illegal will need to decide whether they want to take action to stop the sale of cannabis in their state or figure out how to regulate the newly legal drug. A few states such as North Carolina have laws on the books saying cannabis will automatically become legal once the federal change goes into

New research being presented at the annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) in Madrid, Spain (9-13 September), shows that eating fruit, oats and rye in childhood is associated with a higher risk of developing type 1 diabetes (T1D). Eating berries, however, is linked to lower odds of developing the condition. T1D is an autoimmune condition in which the immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing islet cells in the pancreas. This prevents the body from producing enough of the hormone insulin to properly regulate

The text is unnecessarily verbose and has a lot of words without meaning anything with a shit ton of predictability (no perplexity, no burstiness). If you ever worked in education/academia or content writing it is very noticeable (looks exactly like some assignments turned in by my students). I only took a snippet and underlined some sentence structures that are very obvious, for example ending every sentence with a participial phrase.

This study investigates the integration of ChatGPT in a software development competition to assess its impacts on educational outcomes. The research involved 36 students over four weeks, highlighting how generative AI can enhance project performance, learning, and student satisfaction.

1. **Improved Project Outcomes**: Students who extensively incorporated ChatGPT throughout various stages of their software development projects achieved higher completion rates and superior project scores. Top performers in the competition demonstrated more comprehensive use of the tool, indicating a correlation between ChatGPT usage and success.

2. **Enhanced Learning Experience**: A detailed analysis revealed that students using ChatGPT in ideation and documentation phases, as well as during coding and debugging, benefited significantly. The software’s ability to generate structured codes and solve programming errors showcased its value in educational settings.

3. **Student Satisfaction**: Post-competition surveys highlighted high satisfaction levels among participants. Approximately 75% of the students agreed that ChatGPT improved their practical skills and career development prospects, indicating strong positive perceptions of AI-assisted learning.

4. **Diverse Application**: ChatGPT was predominantly used for planning, programming, and debugging tasks, though less so in specialized areas like server setup and quality assurance. This points to opportunities for future augmentations of its functionalities.

5. **Importance of Familiarity with AI**: The research found that students who had previous experience with large language models like GPT performed better, suggesting that prior familiarity with such technologies can be advantageous in academic and practical projects.

This study underscores the transformative potential of integrating generative AI into educational contexts and suggests avenues for further exploration and development.

Lets first have a look Why Indian IT engineers are staring at a future of no jobs?

The real reason is a large majority are engaged in jobs that are likely to be non-existent in the future. The old-fashioned manual jobs are likely to be replaced by automation and cloud computing that significantly reduces the size of the workforce.

In a recent presentation to Nasscom, McKinsey said that *nearly half of the workforce in the IT services firms will be “irrelevant” over the next 3-4 years.*

*60-65 percent of the workforce is just not trainable*- a similar view was echoed by Capgemini CEO who feels that.

Which means anyone who has upgraded their skill sets has a secured future and an edge over their peers.

What are the Alternative IT Career options we have?

If we look at the current trend in the IT industry the Software Developer or Tester roles are lesser in demand and the demand is going down day by day. Where as Business analyst is the one of the few jobs in IT which has a positive impact of Automation. More the automation more the need of business analysts. If we review recent trends the demand for number of business analyst is growing day by day.

Business Analysis is already a buzz word. It is high time you consider building new capabilities.

One option which we think is great for you is to.....

Become a Business Analyst in IT

Who is a Business Analyst?

A business analyst is someone who analyzes an organization or business domain and documents its business or processes or systems, assessing the business model or its integration with technology

The IT Business Analyst is the professional who is generally associated with requirements elicitation/analysis and solving problems using information technology solutions. This role is the bridge between business & IT.

Where do I Upgrade my skills to become a IT/software Business Analyst?

There are many institutes which claim to have a Business Analyst Course. We would recommend that do a Business Analysis Course to learn the practical aspects of the requirements gathering. And only go to an institute which has professional trainer who has real time experience of IT Business Analysis experience and the course should be a practical course and not a theory program. Theory is all over the internet...just google and you will get all the theory that you need to understand. Do a training program to learn the practical aspects of Business analysis and not for theory. If you wish to learn theory its all out there on google...

After going through a lot of websites and doing a lot of research we found that there is a Institute named Ziphertech ([Ziphertech](http://www.ziphertech.com/)) which has a practical training program for you to become a Business Analyst. They have 85% practical and 15% theory course for you to become business analyst. The rating are also very good and they seem to have a practical training course with highly experienced IT professionals as trainers. They have centers in Mumbai and Bangalore in India. They have weekday and weekend programs for you.

This is what Ziphertech's website says -

*""At Ziphertech we have designed a Training program for students and graduates who aspire to become business Analysts. A Business Analyst requires niche skills to become successful in IT industry.

1fdidze,1,2024-09-10,OUT/VD: Home Is Where The Heart Is (Kenzo and Rebekah/Hook) [Part 1],u/Lizzy100,WritingForEveryone,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingForEveryone/comments/1fdidze/outvd_home_is_where_the_heart_is_kenzo_and/,"Set in OUAT 6x15 when Hook was sent to Neverland, Gideon trying to keep Hook and Emma apart. Also, set after VD and Originals, since Kat is human again, and since Rebekah is also a human now. When Kat wakes up in Neverland and finds Rebekah pretty injured, can she save her? When Hook turns up, can Kat with active Traveler magic get all three of them out of there, and to Storybrooke? What will ensue?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It was a dismal night, as Kat woke up, injured, but not deathly injured. She'd just gone through a portal from the Enchanted Forest. She'd ended up there after being killed as a demon, and then escaping a prison world. Now, she seemed to be on an island of some sort, as she got to her feet, looking at where she was. Then she saw someone quite familiar, as she tried to think of where she could be. Someone she hadn't seen in years. Someone that didn't like her because of what she'd heard about Katherine, as well as because of what her brother had done to protect her. It looked like she was human now though, kind of like Katherine was again.

Kat went over to her, before kneeling at her side, looking at her injuries for what was worst. She saw that she was pale from blood loss, but thankfully still alive. There were a lot of injuries, but most of them weren't immediately or at all deadly. She knew her wounds, after all. Rebekah wasn't the only one with medical knowledge. However, Katherine didn't think this island would give her what she needed to save the now human Original vampiress. She also couldn't leave Rebekah alone. She didn't know what was on this island, and the only person she knew that she'd met years ago in Storybrooke, she didn't see right now. Hook. She knew that he knew what could be used to save someone without any modern technology. Somewhere inside her past memories, she was sure Rebekah also knew from before they'd been vampires. She wasn't a fan of it, but she knew her only chance was to go inside Rebekah's head. See if she could come up with something. Their mother, she knew had been a powerful witch. Surely, she knew herbs that would save someone if they'd been injured. And that's exactly what Katherine needed knowledge of. 

Kat rested a hand on the side of her face. 

""Rebekah, can you hear me?"" she called to her. Then, after a moment of no movement, she knew she didn't have a choice. And so, she used her now active Traveler magic, both hands on either side of her head, going inside her head to a thousand years ago. And it only took her about ten minutes to find what she was looking for. She then left her head. 

A few moments after she'd left her head, she heard a noise from a distance behind her, where the treeline was. That's when she looked over her shoulder to see her one and only favorite pirate. The only pirate she knew, actually. 

""I'm glad to see that you're here,"" Kat commented to him. 

""Why's that?"" he inquired, approaching. 

""I'm not leaving Rebekah alone, but I need to save her the old-fashioned way. You're a pirate. You know islands. I need you to guide me to where it might be,"" she informed him, even though she got the sense that he wasn't happy to be here. She knew it couldn't be her though, knowing he'd always enjoyed her company, even when they were in danger. 

""You know me, luv. Always willing to assist,"" he replied to her. 

She gave a smile at that. 





After a while, she'd found what was needed and got Rebekah's and her own wounds tended to. Now, they were in a clearing, Kat knelt by her, waiting for her to wake up. Hook was seated on a log not far away. 

Kat looked at him. 

""Since I ended up here after dying, ending up in a place called a prison world, and then ending up in the Enchanted Forest, where exactly are we?"" 

""Neverland. And I need to find my way out of here. I need to get back home,"" he informed her. 

""Before I died human, before I came back to seek vengeance as a demon, and then became a human again, I learned that I was descended from Travelers. Gypsies you'd call them. My daughter told me. I didn't like it, and I still don't. But I made it active to survive. I don't know how to heal anyone, but I can get us out of here. As soon as Rebekah is awake and ready to leave, then we'll leave. I just don't like using my Traveler magic, because that's what my father was, and he wasn't a good person. Something I know both of you can relate to,"" she informed him and replied. 





About half an hour later, the blond former vampiress awoke, not knowing where she was, but didn't feel like she was as injured as she'd been when she'd escaped that psycho in that prison world. Right now, all she knew was that she saw someone that she'd never been fond of. She didn't know her well. Only what Elijah had done for her. At least, the parts that Klaus knew of. And, of course, her reputation. And that she'd been a dying human when she'd visited Mystic Falls with Klaus. After she'd died herself, a thousand years with Klaus' cruelty and control was nothing compared to what she'd endured from that Gemini witch. 

""Bloody hell,"" Rebekah commented, and sat up slowly, still somewhere in pain.

""You're probably not thrilled to see me, but I somehow ended up here too, and I saved you. Hook simply helped by guiding me to where it was that would help you. He knows islands pretty well. You're lucky it grows here,"" Katherine explained to her. ""I just knew what my mother taught me, and since none of that is found on islands, I didn't like doing it, but I needed to find a memory that would tell me anything your mother used for wounds. I figured it was the only way,"" she then informed her. 

""You were in my head,"" she realized. 

""Only the thousand-year-old ones,"" she assured her. 

""Well, thanks for saving me. Since when do you have magic, though? Last I knew, you were rapidly dying of old age, back when Klaus and I made a temporary trip back to Mystic Falls. Damon being Damon, called Nik, figuring he'd want to see you. My guess since he never did, Caroline convinced him not to. He always did do whatever she told him to do,"" she wanted to know and told her. 

""I had a daughter the first time I was human. My father tore her away, because I followed my heart, instead of the rules. She found me when I got turned back into a human. She was a vampire, and had been for a very long time. She told me that she searched for me for centuries, wanting answers. Whoever raised her made her think she'd been abandoned. We had a moment, and she told me that I could continue living inside someone else. That I'm descended from Travelers. She didn't like that I refused to for a while. I chose for her to live, instead of me living inside of her, so instead, I jumped inside Elena until they found out and killed me. I still don't like being descended from them, and I don't like using the magic. I made it active to survive a prison world and then Hook's world, though. And to find a way out of there. My father wasn't Mikael, but he wasn't a good person. I never wanted anything from him,"" she told the blonde. 

Rebekah, knowing all too well the cruelty Mikael had put all of them in for centuries, knew what she meant. She didn't want to honor someone that didn't deserve it. 

""I'm sorry about what happened to your daughter,"" she sympathized, assuming the way she spoke that she'd lost her, even though she didn't really know what it was like to lose a daughter. She'd died, before she'd had the ability to have any. The downfall of being a part of a supernatural world, as well as a family that everyone saw as a threat time and time again, no matter how much they all tried to make their name mean something much better. 

""Thanks. If you feel up to traveling, we should leave. Hook needs to get home, and we should be off this island before a certain someone finds out that Hook and strangers are here."" 

""Let's get off this bloody island, then,"" Rebekah replied. 

Kat helped her up, as she got to her own feet. 

Rebekah saw who Katherine had called Hook now that she was on her feet. 

""What kind of town are we going to?"" she inquired. 

""A magical one. I don't know what kind of fairytale stories you Originals grew up with, but that town and the world that Hook and some others are from, as well as this island, have fairytales. This is Neverland, according to Hook. Well, a version of it. The town we're going to, Storybrooke, last I was there, is Regina's. She's the former Evil Queen,"" she explained to the blonde. 

""Lead the way, then,"" the former vampiress replied.





Once Kat had made a portal, they soon arrived in Storybrooke, Maine. A place Kat hadn't been to since the spell had been broken the first time, and since she'd had to leave as a vampire, having heard about Damon opening up the tomb full of vampires. 

""Welcome to Storybrooke. We might need to stay for a while. This town tends to have curses on the town line, and magic is tricky in this town. We want a way out, we have to help break any town line curse, or we have to ask for Regina or Rumple's help. He's an immortal that used to be human. For centuries, he's been the Dark One,"" she informed Rebekah. ""If you need help with anything, I'll be finding Regina. Herbs can only do so much, and I'd rather not interrupt Rumple's happiness with Belle by asking for help."" 

""The Dark One is far from happy at the moment, luv. You've missed out on a lot. Let's just say, those two are having trouble in paradise. If you need me, I'll be with Emma, once I find her,"" he informed her. 

Kat watched Hook leave to go find his true love. Then told the blonde, ""Let's find us a trustworthy witch."" 

Rebekah followed Klaus' former doppelganger, agreeing. 





After a while, Kat reached the former Evil Queen's house, Rebekah at her side. Then rang the doorbell, once she got on the porch. Then, after a moment, she opened the door, which was when Kat gave a smile. 

""Regina. It's been a long time. It's a long story how I'm here again. But I brought Hook back here on my way off that island with her. This is Rebekah. Both of us are human. I don't know how to heal with my active Traveler magic, so I need your help. What do you say?"" 

""Very well,"" Regina replied, stepping out of the way. ""Come in."" 

Rebekah was feeling weak, but wasn't sure if it was from the wounds or not.

Kat put a hand on her arm, helping her inside, and then to the living room couch. 

Regina closed the door, before following them to her living room, Rebekah clearly needed more help than Katherine. 

The human Original let Katherine help her to the couch, and then she layed down on it. She was sure she'd been pretty injured when Katherine had first found her, but if she knew wounds like Rebekah did, Rebekah knew she shouldn't be feeling this weak. She could only assume this had something to do with the Kat aftermath. She wouldn't put anything past him. 

Kat noticed how Rebekah was most likely feeling. She stepped away so Regina could do her thing, but questioned, ""What happened to you?"" 

""After I died, I ended up in a prison world. When I finally got out, the damage was already done. Maybe if I was still a vampire I could've won, but he's the first Gemini I've ever encountered before,"" Rebekah informed her.

""I think I know who you're talking about. Kai. I know he's the only surviving Gemini. He attacked everyone years ago. Before I came back as a demon for vengeance against everyone. I've done horrible things. We all have. But even though I never actually met him, I never liked him. The way he treats others he crosses paths with, and even his style. Too much for me. Plus, he went after people I care for. If I had the chance and could, I'd teach him a lesson. I'm sorry for what you went through with him,"" Kat informed her and replied. He was the only Gemini she knew was technically alive, so it had to be him she was talking about. 

Regina went over to heal the former Original vampiress. 

""Is this Gemini someone I need to worry about?"" she wanted to know, while she did her healing. 

""Unless he finds his way out of that prison world, and then somehow here, you don't need to worry about him. However, if he did something to whatever it was he injured her with, we'll have to find a cure. Kai's famous for putting spells on others, either known or unknown. I wouldn't put it past him to start poisoning people, too. The cruelty I know he did to Damon...I'd like to kill him if I had a chance to."" 

""Let's hope he doesn't come here, then. We have enough problems without more evil coming to town,"" Regina replied. 

""What do you mean?"" Kat wanted to know. 

""The Black Fairy, Rumple's mother, is here. She's the first to embrace the darkness. And after some certain events, she ended up raising Rumple's other son, Gideon. One is more evil than the other."" 

""Sounds like when we're done here, I need to have a chat with Rumple, then. There's always a way to sever the darkness,"" Kat commented to her. 

Regina finished healing Rebekah, and then Kat had Regina heal her injuries.

""I'm going to go have a chat with Rumple. Keep an eye on Rebekah. If he did anything to her, I'll need you to start finding a cure. If anything happened to Rebekah, at least a couple of her siblings would want my head on a spike,"" she informed Regina, only half-joking about that last part, before leaving to head to Rumple's shop. She was certain she'd find him there. 





Kat entered the shop she was familiar with from the last time she'd been in town years ago. She saw that he wasn't alone. It was just him and Belle. 

""It's been a long time, Rumple. I heard about the Black Fairy and your apparent other son. Maybe I could help,"" she greeted, walking over to where they were by the glass counter. 

""I was unaware you were in town,"" he commented.

""It was an unplanned trip. I ended up on Neverland's beach when I finally got out of a prison world and your world. It all worked out, since I was able to get Hook back home, as well as help Rebekah, Klaus' sister. Apparently, she's human now, just as I am. I'm descended from Travelers as my daughter told me a long time ago. I made my magic active, so I can help you with whatever you need magically speaking,"" she replied and informed him. ""Regina's watching over Rebekah, as I asked her to do so I could come help. I think the place Rebekah came from, the person might have done something to her, so if that's the case, I've put Regina in charge of finding a cure."" 

""Well, no matter how you got here, I know I'm thankful for the assistance,"" Belle told her. ""We need to get Gideon's heart from the Black Fairy. He's been under her control.""

""Tell me where she's been. That'll tell me a possible location where his heart is. Then I'll look for his heart. You can trust me. But just how evil is this Black Fairy?""

""I'll tell you this. So far, she's been more cunning than all of us. You could help us defeat her. You have experience. Not with fairies, but when you learned to be more than one step ahead of your greatest enemy. You could help us be ahead of her. Make a move before she does something even worst,"" he told her. 

""Well, I always did like a challenge,"" she commented. ""It sounds to me like she's playing chess. It's always been Klaus' favorite game. Because of that, I always was ahead. Those that know the game well like Klaus would rather sacrifice their knights than their queen or king. I'd say the Black Fairy is the queen playing chess. If she hasn't killed your son yet, then that means she needs him for something bigger than whatever she's already done.""

Rumple couldn't help, but to give a smile at that. He knew the game of chess, but she and her greatest enemy knew it even better, which was why he knew she was a better chess piece than anyone else in this town. 

""Whatever you do, whatever happens, be careful,"" he warned. ""The Black Fairy isn't just some fairy that went evil. She's also my mother that abandoned me."" 

""That tells me everything I need to know then,"" Kat commented. 

After going over everywhere they knew that the Black Fairy had been to, Katherine figured out that her best bet in finding the heart was in the tunnels. If she was spending time down there, then that had to be her hiding spot. 

""You shouldn't go alone,"" Rumple said, when he realized where she'd be going. 

""Neither of you are coming with me. I'll see if someone else wouldn't mind coming with me."" 

""I hate to suggest this, but as powerful as my mother is, and with Regina busy with the mission you put her on, maybe you should take Zelena. I'm not doubting you, but if she's in the tunnels, you need someone to go with you that has powerful magic.""

""Who's Zelena?"" Kat inquired, since she hadn't been in town long enough to hear of that name even mentioned. 

""She was my better student, back when I taught magic to those that I saw potential in. While Regina was queen in the Enchanted Forest, Zelena was the wicked one that lived in Oz. Here, she's somewhat of an outcast. And she had a daughter with Robin Hood. Not in the best way, but she deceived him and Regina, hoping that she'd get her happy ending. She lives on the outskirts of town,"" he explained to her.

""The wicked witch,"" she commented. ""I think I'll take the suggestion."" The wicked witch fairytale had been one of the many stories she'd heard about. It just hadn't always been all that popular. And the fairytale had never called the witch by her name, so she hadn't known who Zelena was until he'd told her. 

She turned around, leaving the shop, and headed for the outskirts. 





About half an hour later, she approached the white house, before knocking on the door. Then, a moment later, someone with a bundle in one arm opened the door. 

""Who are you, and what do you want?"" 

""You must be Zelena. I'm Katherine Pierce. Rumple mentioned you, since I put Regina in being the caretaker of someone for me, and I'm just as smart not to go down into some tunnels alone. What do you say the two of us go hunt down the Black Fairy? First, though. Might I suggest you leave the bundle of joy with Belle? I was once a mother myself. I wouldn't want a child to be put in the middle of a battle. Especially, a baby.""

""Gladly, considering she was here threatening my baby,"" Zelena replied. 

""Let's go then."" 





After Zelena dropped off Robin with Belle, she and Katherine went into the tunnels. 

""What's your plan?"" Zelena wanted to know, once she'd turned the light on at the tunnel entrance. 

""Simple. You're a distraction. Don't worry. I'll make sure she doesn't kill you. But I'm here to get Rumple and Belle's son's heart back from the Black Fairy. You fairytales know how to appear as someone else. I know how to make myself invisible to others. Once I have the heart, we'll get out of here. Then you can go back to your daughter. I can get the heart back to them. Then we'll take her down."" 

""You make it sound so simple,"" she commented. 

""Well, I've been up against worst creatures than this,"" she informed her. ""I'm going to make myself invisible to everyone but you. You just pretend like you're alone. Hopefully, she won't sense that someone else is nearby.""





After a few hours, they were able to find her, the Black Fairy fell for the distraction, and she didn't know that Kat was there until she already had the heart. There was no harm done of herself and Zelena, too. 

Kat tossed the Black Fairy away, before she and Zelena disappeared. Then Zelena went back home with her daughter, while Kat gave the heart to Rumple. Then she watched him put it back inside his son. 

""Now that that's done, I think it's time to prepare for a fight,"" Kat said. ""First, I'll go to Regina's. See if Rebekah's okay. Then we'll plan."" 





Kat approached and walked into the big white house she lived in, before heading into the living room. That's when she saw that it appeared that the Original was back to herself again. Kat then approached them. 

""Rumple's son's heart is back where it belongs. Now, it's time we fight the Black Fairy. What do you say? I know Zelena's ready to. Rumple suggested I brought her with me to the tunnels, so I did. Used her as a distraction. She's safely back home. Do you know yet how to stop her?""

""There's two pieces of a wand that was used to banish her once. If we can find the second piece, we can banish her.""

""Banishing someone never works. They always find a way back,"" Kat told Regina. ""We need to kill her. How about a good heart ripping like she did to their son. Then one of us can crush that dark heart of hers. Normally, I only kill when necessary, and this seems like a necessary killing to me. I'm sorry, but I'm with Zelena on destroying her once and for all. But we need to do this right."" 

""How do you suggest we do that? Everytime I've been up against her, I've lost. The Evil Queen isn't inside me anymore. I got rid of her completely. Now, I just have light magic,"" Regina explained. 

""I imagine you probably fought alone, but you're not alone. My magic is quite powerful, even though I don't like using it. Between you, me, and Zelena, our magic could be enough."" 

""If I were you, I'd listen to her. She's quite the diabolical one,"" Rebekah commented to the witch she barely knew. She then looked at Elijah's 500 years of love, telling her, ""Before we fight this battle, I think it's time I told you the rest of what happened. You know as well as I that not everyone makes it out of battles, even if we try."" 

Kat sat down on the couch across from the one Rebekah was seated on, and Regina sat by the former Original vampiress. Kat assumed that this was something important. Rebekah was never one to say something unless something was needed to be said. 

""What is it?"" Kat asked. 

""It's about my family. I'm sure you were probably wondering what's happened after all these years. The short version is that The Hollow came for my niece, Klaus and Hayley's daughter when she was a little girl. She had to grow up with just wolves and Hayley because of it. When Hope became a teenager, she didn't feel like she could do it anymore. Be away from us. So, she put it inside of herself, and it almost killed her. Nik put it inside of himself. All of it. Because we all knew that he wouldn't be able to keep in control, Klaus made the decision. It was bad timing, since Hayley had just sacrificed herself for Hope. Elijah fell in love with Hayley, and even though he didn't have his memories until Hope brought them back, he blamed himself for what happened to her, believing he could've saved her if he'd remembered us all. So, when Klaus decided to kill himself to save us all from The Hollow, Elijah joined him to reunite with Hayley. I'm sorry, Katherine,"" she explained without going into too many details. 

Kat hadn't been prepared for this kind of news, but still kept up the strong front. She'd always thought that Elijah would've outlived her. Not the other way around. 

""I'm sorry, too. I lost an epic love, but you lost your brothers,"" she sympathized. ""Is that why you finally took the cure?"" 

""I took the cure, because it was the only way I saw that I could have a normal life, the way I want. Not a life that I've lived for a thousand years. You know, he'd be proud of the person you've become as a human,"" she replied. ""Kol and Freya are still alive, though,"" she added. 

""He would, wouldn't he?"" Kat replied. ""Well, if you ever find a way out of Storybrooke, give those two my best regards. Mystic Falls and New Orleans wouldn't want me. Well, Marcel, actually. I broke his rules of not feeding on locals or killing his vampires centuries ago. I tried proving a point, and I went too far to try and get him to stop controlling the witches. I doubt he'd be welcoming to me. Even human me."" 

""Well, I'm sure you'd find a home somewhere. I did. And that's not New Orleans. Marcel ruined that city in the last battle we had with him. Before they sacrificed themselves."" 

""Why don't you stay in town here. There's plenty of places for you to live. And Kol and Freya are just a phone call away if you need them. Besides, this town. It's perfect. I can tell you we don't always have danger around every corner all the time. There are peaceful moments,"" Kat suggested and assured her. 

""I'll have to find that out for myself. If we survive this battle,"" Bex replied. 

""As for the battle, I'm the one with magic, so unless you can come up with something that'll give us more leverage against the Black Fairy, I think I know the perfect position for you. I know that you played as a nurse a century or so ago. If anyone gets hurt, you could be useful while those of us with magic and fighting skills fight against her. Regina and Zelena can't fight and heal at the same time. And I think Zelena will be more focused if she knows that someone's watching her little bundle of joy. Apparently, she had a daughter,"" Kat replied and informed her. 

""I'd be happy to, then. When the time comes,"" Bex replied. 

""Great,"" Kat commented. 





After Regina said yes to letting Rebekah stay in the house, along with Katherine, Kat showed Rebekah the guest room and bathroom so she could take care of her needs, and if need be, lay down for a while. Then Kat continued her conversation with Regina downstairs about the upcoming battle. She also got filled in on everything she'd missed. 





A few nights later, the battle happened with the Black Fairy. Kat had been right. The combination of her, Regina, and Zelena's magic had been enough to weaken her. And so, with that as a distraction, because of everything the Black Fairy had done, as well as the past that made Rumple hate her, it was him that killed her. And so, the threat was finally vanquished, once and for all. However, fate had been sealed. Gideon was free now completely, but as prophesied, the battle with the Black Fairy had had the casualty of the Savior. And so, not everything was great. However, Rebekah had taken Katherine up on her advice to stay in town. 





That night, while everyone else was grieving, apart from Bex, Kat was in the guest bathroom. She was on the floor, back against the wall, finally letting the pain in from the loss of Elijah. She knew Elijah wouldn't want her to live the rest of her life blaming herself for not being there to stop him, and wouldn't want her to live unhappy for the rest of her life, but she couldn't help but to blame herself. Maybe if she'd been there, she could've convinced him to live, instead. Now that Elijah was truly gone, she believed forever, she didn't know what she could do next. Sure, she had friends here, but what use was it being in town if she didn't have anyone from her past still alive? She didn't know if she knew how to live without him. They'd always been separated somehow because of his loyalty for Klaus, as well as his need to protect her from him, but she'd always had the comfort that they'd find each other again. Now, she knew that that would never happen again. The way she'd always lived her life, she didn't think she'd ever see him again, even in the afterlife. And he wasn't a fairytale, so it wasn't like she could just go down to the underworld to get him back. She was lost without him now, and like Damon, she tended to be self-destructive when she was hurt emotionally. Back when they'd both been vampires, that is. Because of how long she'd been dead, she didn't know what had all happened in Mystic Falls. She wanted a human life here, but how could that happen if she didn't have anyone left that she'd always love. Elijah, Damon, or even Enzo. But she hadn't seen Enzo in centuries. Not since she'd asked him to promise not to tell Damon that he knew her. Right before she'd departed from Enzo. After Lily had abandoned him, and after she'd found him, she'd been the one to teach him to be a vampire. And she'd fallen in love with him. Like Elijah in some ways, he'd been the vampire that she wanted to always be with. Her life had just made her have to give up everything she loved, she'd always felt, because of so many enemies she'd made. Now, she didn't know what to do. Without any of those three, she felt alone. 





The former Original vampiress came up and sat at a booth, a bottle of Bourbon in hand, and poured herself a shot glass of it, before taking a sip. She figured after this whole business, he could use some company. Katherine, too. However, she didn't know Katherine to know what would help. But knowing a decent amount of the captain's story, as well as knowing how it felt all the times that she'd lost someone she loved, she was best suited here. She couldn't even count how many times anymore that she'd lost those she'd loved. Klaus had been overprotective, killing nearly every person that she gave her heart to. But then there were those like one person that had used her love for them against her and her whole family. Or a portion of her family. She knew a lot more heartbreak than she was sure the captain knew. She wouldn't want anyone to go through what she had for a thousand years. 

""I'm sorry that you lost her. Believe me, I know what it's like. I've had a lot more heartbreak than you can imagine, captain,"" Bex told him. 

""You can call me Killian or Hook,"" he replied. ""I'm sorry about your heartbreak, but I don't think you know what it's truly like for me. I've only found real love twice in my 900 years sailing the open seas. Mila. Then Emma. Both gone now."" 

""You tried your best to save her from this battle, Killian. It was her choice to fight the battle. She knew the prophecy, but she still chose to fight. For her family and everyone else she cared about. Including you. But I've been through many different kinds of battles in my centuries when I was a vampire. War always has casualties. I know Katherine tried to make a great plan. It was a really good one, but I'd be foolish to think that everyone would've survived. Especially, if Katherine hadn't been involved. This is the only time I'm going to say that Katherine is brilliant when it comes to planning. Like my brother, Klaus, was,"" she replied, trying to assure him. It was true, too. She always knew that not every person would survive any war. It didn't matter if her family was involved, or even Katherine. She was sure without herself or Katherine, more would've been killed than just one person. 

He knew she was right. He'd fought to save her from this, but she'd been stubborn. Now, he'd lost another love. He wished she would've just let everyone else handle the battle, but he knew that wasn't who Emma had been. She always stood up for what was right, even if it meant that she could get hurt or worse. Especially, when it came to protecting her family and himself. He also knew that she was right. There was a chance that more people than just Emma could've died if it hadn't been for Katherine's involvement. He was glad that Katherine was alive, though. He saw her as a friend, even if they didn't always cross paths. 

""I'm aware, but it doesn't make it any less painful,"" he replied to the blonde. 

""Well, when it comes to pain like that, I'm an expert. What do you say I give you something else to think about for a night?"" 

""I could never refuse a beautiful distraction, luv,"" he replied. 

Rebekah gave a smile at that, and then finished her shot glass of Bourbon.





The next day, still feeling like she couldn't go on knowing that Elijah was gone, and not having anyone else from her past in town that she cared about, she started looking for a way to bring him back. She felt like she just couldn't go on without him, so this was her trying to do something for him, even if a part of her knew that it was wrong. She was at a point that she was willing to pay any price to have the love of her life back. Even if he hated her, it would be better than what she was currently feeling and going through. 





Hook and Bex had been having the time of their lives the night before, her being his distraction. And she'd been happy to be of service in that department. Now, Bex had heard from Regina that Katherine was up to something. She'd always been one to be doing something she shouldn't, but Katherine with magic. It couldn't be anything good. Especially, in a time like this. She didn't know her well, but she'd seen witches try to bring someone back before that they cared about. There were always consequences. Big ones. And if Katherine was attempting what she thought she might be, Bex didn't want her doing that. She'd love to have her siblings back, sure, but she'd seen too much what happens when people try bringing back those they love. Plus, Katherine wasn't in the right state of mind to be doing something like that. And she felt like it would be undoing the sacrifice that Elijah had made. Even if it was just for love.





When she finally found her, she was inside a vault in the cemetery, searching through books. 

""Katherine,"" Bex said, walking into the vault. 

""Don't try to stop me,"" Kat stated, assuming she knew already what she was attempting to do. 

""What do you think you're doing?"" Bex inquired. 

""I'm going to try and bring him back."" 

""Katherine, it's been many years since they sacrificed themselves. Besides, I know my brother. Elijah wouldn't want you to do this. He made a sacrifice for a reason. Bringing him back would be undoing the sacrifice he made. Come on, Katherine. You know what happens when people start bringing people back from the dead. Especially, those that have been dead for many years. Believe me, I'd like to have my family all together again, but I don't get that luxury. You can't just bring him back."" 

""I'm sorry, but I have to do this. This is the only thing I can do. I can't just sit here and do nothing, when I have the power to at least try. I can't just blame myself for not being there to stop him. I have to do something,"" Kat replied, still looking for a spell. 

""I understand what you're going through, believe me, but this isn't right. Even if you managed to do it, Elijah would hate you. Maybe forever,"" Rebekah tried to reason with her. ""Katherine, he died for love. Isn't that enough?"" 

Kat stopped what she was doing suddenly, hearing that last part. It reminded her of a conversation she'd had long ago, back when she'd first come back to Mystic Falls. 



**\*Flashback\***



Katherine was seated in a chair with chains, which was against a brick wall in the basement of the Salvatore boarding house. She had chains on her wrists and ankles, Stefan thinking that they would hold her, despite her age. Stefan had been trying to force her to tell him why she came back to Mystic Falls, and then when she spoke of the past, he wanted to know what she'd been running from. When she told him that her and her past had to stay far away from each other, he got upset at her. 

""Then Damon and I died for nothing!""

""No! You died for love,"" Katherine replied to him.

*Write a synopsis for a book where Solid Snake, from the game Metal Gear Solid, learns how to transition from his role in Foxhound to being a pastry chef.*

**What it created...**

After years of covert operations, legendary soldier Solid Snake has faced and defeated countless enemies, dismantled secret organizations, and saved the world more times than he can count. But after one final mission, Snake decides to leave the battlefield behind for good. Haunted by the violence and the burden of being a living weapon, Snake seeks peace in an unexpected place: a quiet Parisian bakery.

Guided by a former military comrade turned master pâtissier, Snake enrolls in an elite pastry school. What starts as a simple attempt to find solace in a new craft soon becomes a new kind of challenge. Snake discovers that the precision, patience, and creativity required to bake delicate confections is just as demanding as any tactical operation. The kitchen becomes his new battleground, where whisking, kneading, and piping replace stealth, CQC, and espionage.

Along the way, Snake builds unlikely friendships with fellow students, including an eccentric former spy who insists on making ""explosive"" flavors and a determined young baker with dreams of winning the world’s most prestigious pastry competition. As Snake masters the art of crafting intricate cakes, croissants, and éclairs, he realizes that this new life may offer him the redemption and peace he’s been seeking for so long.

But just when he’s beginning to settle into his new world of sugar and butter, shadows from his past emerge. A mysterious group with ties to his former life seeks to pull him back into the world of black ops, forcing Snake to confront the tension between who he was and who he’s becoming. With old enemies resurfacing and a new passion at stake, Snake must use his skills—both as a soldier and a pastry chef—to protect his new home, his friends, and his newfound dream.

*From Foxhound to Fondant* is an action-packed, heartwarming story of transformation, where one of the world’s deadliest soldiers learns that sometimes the hardest mission is finding your way to peace—and that the sweetest victories often come from the oven."

On one hand, these tools can enhance learning by providing personalized support and fostering creativity. On the other hand, there’s a concern that students might become overly reliant on AI, potentially compromising their understanding of the subject matter.

What strategies or practices could teachers adopt to ensure that students are genuinely learning, rather than just letting AI do the heavy lifting for them? Are there specific examples or guidelines that have been effective in your experience? Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!"

I understand why this may be frowned upon or seen as a “shortcut” lazy option but I actually find it really helpful! I’m a student teacher, who sometimes struggles to come up with inventive and engaging ways of presenting material and ChatGPT has genuinely come up with some really well thought out and engaging activities which ALSO link well to the learning objectives. With the mass problem of “teacher burnout” I do think this could be such a help to reduce teacher workload when it comes to developing lesson plans etc. Of course we still need to engage in preparing materials etc but I think it’s really good for coming up with those initial ideas in the first place or helps to structure a set of lessons where you don’t have a clue where to start! 

I’ve also found lots of the ideas generated by chatGPT are similar to the ones we’ve been shown in uni as “good examples” so I wondered what everyone thought? :) "

Warning you now, some of this might be shocking to read. I promise this is not a trollpost. I am not diagnosed or medicated, but am now considering due to my severe continuous behavior. I also haven't seen anyone on the Internet just reveal something like this, so here goes...

I am currently a aspiring SWE and a MS CS student (started this January) living with parents in the Bay Area and unfortunately I have been HOOKED on ChatGPT for a while. Ever since I started using it in BS CS during Spring 2023, I can't stop... I even started paying for GPT Plus... This has had severe consequences, as my coding abilities are diminished - I can't even get a full-time job, I'm not even putting in the effort to study, as I've helplessly continued to cheat on academic assignments and OAs - it doesn't help that I procrastinate these until the last minute as well, so I have no choice but to use it to at least submit something. I hate this, but I feel stuck... also despite using ChatGPT, I can't pass the OAs (would take photos and plug into ChatGPT app, perhaps it did not parse the images correctly or completely learn the info) and can't achieve A for the courses I take (ChatGPT doesn't answer HWs perfectly + not great at exams). 

I've never had a paid internship - I do currently have an unpaid internship, which I chose to work for since I can never start my own passion projects (even though I've already planned them!!), and I never applied to enough paid internships in time or practiced much... How am I paying for GPT Plus then? Well I am working another somewhat related remote part-time job on the side, I got the job when I started college during covid in 2020 (really depressing time for me tbh) since I just miraculously happened to know the manager - no interviews required. But even that, I am not the best in, I am always slightly late to meetings. I could even set a alarm 10 minutes before, and get completely distracted by something else that causes me to be late :(

I think part of the reason for my ChatGPT addiction was that it has been fun to experiment with, to see what it was capable of. It honestly impressed me that mostly relying on ChatGPT could achieve a B in a difficult masters CS course. Unfortunately now I am taking another course, and ChatGPT is not working as well... now I've stopped paying for the service and it's time to change. But now I am quite worried how I will do without using it...

Another reason is that I have always naturally done whatever is easiest to complete the task. I would use sneaky Discord servers to unlock Chegg and Coursehero questions during my time at BS CS. I wouldn't get perfect grades though due to exams; I would often got final grades of C in important CS courses (C's get degrees, amirite? 🙄). I still graduated with a >3 GPA, but there were some gen ed courses included in that... To be fair, I wasn't as passionate for SWE until my last year, most of college I was interested in game development, thus losing interest in regular CS courses, but then I lost interest in game development... once I took a SWE course and I realized I had never started my own game projects, I always just contributed to others...

On top of that, I have terrible sleep habits. And even on days where I miraculously go to sleep at a reasonable time and wake up at sunrise, I do nothing productive until maybe 1 PM :( I often rely on coffee to get me doing something

Anyone else is/was stuck in a similar situation? Idk, I might have to get medicated to be able to complete work on time steadily - this is something that I am highly unfamiliar with doing, as I have undergone severe procrastination ever since high school (I mean it worked in high school, got straight As. Started failing in college). I honestly feel like I need to start life over... this is very tough, as most of my CS peers I've known since high school have already gotten multiple internships or even entry level jobs. Just seems a lot of people who grew up in the Bay Area other than me are crazy talented... always makes me wonder how are they able to grow and change..."
1fdpf25,1,2024-09-10,Is GPTZero Legit?,u/BrilliantThought6222,appguru,https://www.reddit.com/r/appguru/comments/1fdpf25/is_gptzero_legit/,"**Is** [GPTZero](https://gptzero.me/?via=will-hurrell) **Legit?**

 As artificial intelligence (AI) takes over the production of more and more content, tools that could detect AI-generated text have been developed to help consumers and clients identify text that does not come from real humans. One of the most used tools for detecting AI-written content is GPTZero, a tool that helps with identifying text written by GPT-AI. Simply enter the text you suspect of being written by the GPT-AI speech-to-text engine, and you will get an answer within 5-10 seconds. Does GPTZero work? It does. Take a look at the features this tool provides, and read my review, which covers its accuracy and features.

**What Does** [GPTZero](https://gptzero.me/?via=will-hurrell) **Do?**

 GPTZero analyses text based on two metrics, perplexity and burstiness, that measure how predictable a piece is (AI-written text tends to be highly predictable) and how varied a piece is (when human-written text shows spikes in frequency of words and sentence lengths, this is a clue that it wasn’t written by AI). For teachers and professors, members of admissions boards, and writers who must confirm that text is indeed written by a human, GPTZero could be a lifesaver.

**Accuracy: Can** [GPTZero](https://gptzero.me/?via=will-hurrell) **Reliably Detect AI Content?**

 GPTZero is particularly good at detecting text produced by models such as ChatGPT: in tests, it picked up AI-generated content with high accuracy – for example, it’s reported to have reported about 98 per cent precision for text produced by ChatGPT.

**Limitations**

Like any AI detection tool, GPTZero is not flawless:

 False Positives: It sometimes flags as AI-generated content written by humans, which is frustrating for users who want the tool to confirm authenticity. 

 Complex text: GPTZero has difficulty with long, technical or syntactically complex texts, and its rates of detection decrease as the text grows more complex.

 Limited Scope: this is designed to detect ChatGPT-written material but might be less reliable on the outputs of other AI models.

**Who Uses** [GPTZero](https://gptzero.me/?via=will-hurrell)**?**

 Education stands as one of the largest industries adopting GPTZero: teachers and professors employ it to check whether students are submitting their own essays or ones created by AI, and it’s being used by content producers and businesses as a way to uphold their integrity and to verify the authenticity of a piece of writing. 

**User Experience**

 A lot of users will say that the platform is very usable and gives a lot of insightful analysis, but some critique the scan limits in the free version or the occasional inaccuracies – especially for users with large text corpora. 

**Conclusion: Is** [GPTZero](https://gptzero.me/?via=will-hurrell) **Legit?**

 Yes, GPTZero is a legitimate, valuable tool for detecting AI text – although its utility is not perfect, especially for more sophisticated human text or models other than ChatGPT. Users of the tool should understand that it’s not perfect and that there may be exceptions, but it will generally detect AI content with a very high level of accuracy. 

 And if you’re looking for an AI detection tool, GPTZero is a very good bet — provided you take it as one input into a more holistic strategy for authenticating content, as opposed to an infallible verdict on authorship.

1fdw65g,1,2024-09-10,"I (28M) am failing to meet my wife's (26F) expectations, is it time to give up? ",u/Difficult-Wolf8806,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1fdw65g/i_28m_am_failing_to_meet_my_wifes_26f/,"Sorry that this one is so long. I am so deeply appreciative to any of you that takes the time to read this and give me advice. 

So I am going to start out by adding some basic background details before getting into everything. My wife and I met when we were in  high school. We dated then and it didn't work out until I left home for the military and we started dating long distance. We have been together since December of 2015. My wife is an immigrant from Ukraine who came to the US when she was young with just her mom. Her mom, for all intents and purposes, was brought here as a mail order bride. My FIL (wife's stepfather) is American. My family doesn't really matter because over the years I have pretty much completely cut them off for various reasons. Before my wife, my longest relationship was 3 weeks. 

So in regard to the expectations I have been failing to meet first I will say that I was largely raised in a house where I was parentified and infantilized in tandem. My parents would leave me so often as the sole caretaker for my infant sister that she called me ""dad"" more often than she called our actual dad that. But my parents still would call me an idiot child at 28 if I spoke to them and had a disagreement. Because of these things I really struggled to truly mature and learn the necessary skills and traits needed to be an actual adult like self motivation, organization, or thinking for myself on a regular basis past the bare necessities. The military was supposed to be the fix to this but realistically it just became a good place where I was good at doing what I was told. These are still skills I struggle to maintain despite a lot of therapy, self help, etc. Part of it is laziness for sure but also a part of it is just not having the highest standards for myself because I spent so long just trying to survive as a kid. That being said, after 2 years of long distance, my wife and I moved in together while she was a junior in college. 

The 2 years we lived together while she was in college were...tumultuous. Between me trying to go to school, struggling with job stuff and it being my first time cohabitating with a partner I wasn't always the greatest partner. On top of that we discovered that my wife had undiagnosed bipolar that was making every one of my problem behaviors be turned into ""I'm not gonna bring it up because I'm too tired and depressed until I'm manic and decide it is going to be the biggest, all night explosive argument ever"". Most of these problem behaviors could fall under one of the following categories: 1. Not contributing enough to housework, 2. Dishonesty (mostly around financial stuff) or 3. Poor Communication. The long and short is that I would put gaming/time with friends or personal pleasure over her needs and use working 60+ hours a week as my excuse. However, we worked through it and survived. The lockdowns during COVID were actually just about the best part of our relationship as we had a lot of time to just sit with each other and heal. Then she graduated from college and we moved to a different state so she could pursue graduate school and I could escape my family. We really saw it as a huge opportunity to have a second fresh start. 

I decided to finally start my journey to get my bachelor's degree after we moved and now it's pertinent to bring up a few promises I made early in our relationship. First, I promised to learn Russian (my wife's forced first language) and one day Ukrainian. I didn't spend the first 2 years doing this because I was a Linguist for the military and unfortunately not for Russian, so I was heavily involved with learning a different language. By the time we moved to a new state, I had taken a 2 semesters of community college Russian which was very threadbare and self studied Ukrainian on Duolingo (also to not much real progress). So when I got accepted to university I declared a major that would allow me to take Russian classes. The second promise I made her was that I would one day move her back to Ukraine so we could potentially raise our kids there. 

So regarding these promises, I spent 3 years getting a bachelor's degree (even receiving a second major in Russian) and took Russian the whole time. I was one of 2 people in a class of 30+ 3rd year language students to be allowed to progress to the 4th year and realistically I was always at the top of my class and getting complimented by my professors. However, I learned about a year and a half in that even aceing my Russian classes was not going to keep up with my wifes' expectations. I can speak *alright*. Realistically I am far FAR away from my skills in my second foreign language (which I attained workplace fluency for the military). And despite daily practice, the pressure has become so huge and it has become the constant spoke upon which all of our arguments revolve that I just don't know how to progress in the relationship anymore. 

I am pursuing getting a tutor because my wife has lost the patience to help me when I still make more basic mistakes or don't have native level pronunciation or intonation. In college I was reading short stories, poetry, news, etc and watching full films in Russian and doing fairly well during my last semester and at the beginning of this summer I was speaking daily in Russian with her. But we had an argument that just absolutely shattered my confidence in the language and I don't know how to repair it. My motivation is next to nothing and I can tell my abilities are slipping. Any time it comes up she says I speak worse than a 5 year old and read just as poorly and generally has nothing but negative feedback. 

This has all had a negative feedback type of effect elsewhere in our relationship because as I said, every argument we have ends up being made about how I have ""wasted my life"" or otherwise wasted my time doing nothing to learn her language. Any time I try to just apologize she reminds me that I promised her to learn the language and any time I try to stand up for myself she says ""well then say something in Russian"" knowing that I am going to freeze up. Since graduating in May I have been unemployed and looking for a job and just trying to enjoy being done with school while also studying Russian. There has been a few off weeks where my practice has been basic but like I said we had an argument where she basically said I have a worthless degree that I should be ashamed of because I speak worse than the mentally handicapped child of our friends. 

This summer we also started martial arts classes together to help us get exercise and also grow kind of mindfully in different emotional and mental goals. For her it's finding more emotional balance given the stresses of graduate school and for me, being more intrinsically motivated. I feel that we have both been very successful but all she can do when she gets upset is remind me that ""the clock is ticking"" or how ""she could get treated like shit by someone else who actually speaks her language"" or how I've ""wasted a decade of her life promising to learn other language"". And even though I think it's fair that she has criticism of my speed at learning the language, she just doesn't ever want to acknowledge that she has contributed to that for me. 

I love my wife. I want to have a family with her and I want to live the life we have dreamed about together for almost a decade. In addition,  she has been the ONLY person in my entire life who has stood by me through everything and hasn't either turned on me or abandoned me. Her family is the only family I have and even though we don't have kids, we have two cats she has made clear in recent arguments I would take if we split up. And the feeling of having to walk around the house with those two precious creatures still loving me but not being able to understand where their mom went fucking kills me. 

Splitting up has been a constant topic of discussion lately and she has given me basically a deadline of her dissertation defense in the over a year to get fluent. The argument that has led to this post today is her thinking I was rushing her to go out to the store because I said I was ""stalling"" so she could come with me in response to her telling me to just go without her because she was taking her time getting ready. Yet every argument comes back around to her saying ""you're doing nothing with your life so why can't you be studying Russian for 5+ hours a day so why does it matter when we do something"" or ""well you're upset about X but how do you think it feels to have to feel lied to every day because you still don't know my language"" or some variant of those things. 

We will have been together for 9 years this December, married for 3 years on Halloween this year. But it's gotten to the point where I have literally been asking ChatGPT ""how can you tell when a relationship is too broken to fix"". I'm heart broken even being here and asking for advice, but I feel the love of my life slipping away and I hate myself so much for it that I want to die but even when I improve on meeting her expectations it doesn't feel like enough and no therapist has been able to help me actually make changes to rediscover my motivation. I just hear ""oh that's so tough, let's keep talking next week"" every time. 

Like do I just get the tutor and keep trying to putter along and hope learning with less emotionally charged person will help me master the language faster or do I have to realize that maybe I just won't ever meet her expectations and give up?

Tl;Dr: How do you know when yours or your partner's failings/mismatched expectations have just added up to an unsaveable relationship? "

**Cabinet**

Vice President: Spiro Agnew

Secretary of State: Henry Kissinger

Secretary of the Treasury: George Shultz (1967-1972) replaced by John Connally

Secretary of Defense: William Westmoreland (1969-1971) replaced by James R. Schlesinger

Attorney General: William Rehnquist

Postmaster General: Winton M. Blount (position removed from the cabinet in 1971)

Secretary of the Interior: Caspar Weinberger (1966-1971) replaced by Jim Rhodes

Secretary of Agriculture: Clifford Hardin (1965-1970) replaced by Earl Butz

Secretary of Commerce: William E. Simon

Secretary of Labor: Peter Brennan

Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare: William Scranton

Secretary of Transportation: John Volpe (1967-1970) replaced by Claude Brinegar

Director of the Office of Management and Budget: Roy Ash 

Ambassador to the United Nations: William P. Rogers (1969-1971) replaced by Hiram Fong

Counselor to the President: John Connally (1971-1972) / Bryce Harlow / Robert Finch / Murray Chotiner / Herbert Stein / Donald Rumsfeld (1971-1973) 

Following Nixon's landslide re-election, in the leadup to his second term the President would announce a major reshaping of his cabinet, lead by his appointment of National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger to Secretary of State with William P. Rogers being moved to the UN. Kissinger's appointment, along with that of General William Westmoreland (one of the strongest defenders of the Vietnam War) to Sec. of Defense, brought a new commitment to the war in Vietnam with a massive 1 year ground invasion launched into North Vietnam and extended to Cambodia and Laos. With Republicans taking major losses in the 1970 midterms and the ground campaign ending in heavy casualties, Westmoreland would be removed and replaced with CIA Director James R. Schlesinger. Elsewhere the President would bring on two allies facing the end of their careers following the midterms, with controversial former Ohio Gov. Jim Rhodes being appointed to Interior and defeated Sen. Hiram Fong appointed to the UN. A new ally would join the cabinet at the same time with former Democratic Texas Gov. John Connally formally joining the Republican party. Nixon's second term also saw the removal of a cabinet position with the U.S. Post Office being officially spun off into an independent agency with the signing of the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970. One of Nixon's most controversial nominations would be NYC construction labor leader Peter Brennan emerging as the most pro-Vietnam labor leader and described as a ""militant"" after his involvement in the 1967 Hard Hat riot seeing the storming of New York City hall in protest of Mayor John Lindsay's proclaimed day of mourning following the Kent State massacre.

**Domestic Policy**

-One of the many fires set as a result of the now 8 year long American involvement in the Vietnam War has been rapid inflation in the past few years. Originally inheriting a burgeoning economy from President Kennedy, for the most part the economy continued to roll over the course of Nixon's first term, however even then economists were warning of the consequences the massive spending on Vietnam could have. As inflation hit record highs in late 1969/early 1970, President Nixon began to pull out all stops beginning with indefinitely delaying pay raises for all federal employees, leading to the postal workers going on strike and eventual spin off of the Post Office into an independent agency as part of the deal to end the strike. The next step for Nixon would be more drastic as he stunned Congress by utilizing price controls passed by a Democratic majority intending to use the issue to campaign on in the midterms not expecting Nixon, a longtime opponent of such measures, to utilize them. As part of the downscaling of the war in 1971, Nixon introduced massive monetary changes along with it including ending the gold standard and taking the U.S. off the Bretton Woods system. Nixon's so called ""war on inflation"" has managed to dampen an expected crisis as we head into election season, however many economists now warn the measures may simply delay the inevitable, especially as the country continues to wage war in Vietnam.

-An area of major negotiation extending throughout the first two years of Nixon's second term was healthcare. When President Kennedy was defeated in the 1964 election a major initiative left unaddressed was healthcare reform, an initiative stalled by fiscal conservatives and the AMA. However by 1969 the issue of seniors lack of healthcare was once again put in the national spotlight by Sen. Ted Kennedy who himself put forward a sweeping single-payer healthcare system. After months of negotiations between the White House and Congressional leadership of both parties, a deal was finally reached to establish a Medicare program covering all Social Security recipients and in March 1970, the Social Security Amendments of 1970 were finally passed. 

-Another major piece of legislation passed in 1970 would be the National Environmental Policy Act, establishing the Environmental Protection Agency to enforce the regulations set during Nixon's first term. The agency incorporated a number of Agriculture and Interior programs and has been hailed by environmentalists as the next major step in protecting the environment, though some have lobbied even further for the creation of a cabinet level federal Department of Environmental Quality. 

-The major point of tension for the Nixon administration would once again be the Civil Rights movement, as despite the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1967 civil rights leaders have criticized President Nixon for his refusal to commit to any further major legislation. Ahead of the 1970 midterms a number of Democrats began another major push to pass a Voting Rights Act as despite the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the 24th Amendment, a number of southern states have continued to disenfranchise black voters through primary restrictions and literacy tests. Despite Attorney General Rehnquist being instructed by Nixon to force such cases into the courts, Rehnquist would ultimately refer relatively few cases and Nixon would have little interest in pressing the issue. With pressure mounting negotiations would begin in early 1970 however, concerned about losing momentum in southern states trending red such as Tennessee and Florida the Nixon White House would move extremely slow, and ultimately finally kill the bill after talks with Independent Sen. Strom Thurmond who many speculate has recently officially joined the Republican party as part of a deal for the Nixon White House to drop support of any Civil Rights measure.

-Nonetheless with Chief Justice Earl Warren continuing to press on with his historically liberal and pro-Civil Rights court some major developments in Civil Rights have occurred with the practice of busing and affirmative action both being upheld as constitutional. The Nixon administration has made small strides as well with the establishment of the Office of Minority Business Enterprise promoting minority owned businesses in addition to promoting the hiring of minorities in the federal government.  

-Between 1969 and 1971, over the course of the last major ground offensive for the U.S. in the Vietnam War (even now being dubbed as ""Nixon's last stand"") student protests reached an all time high with up to 70 colleges cancelling portions of their school year do to overwhelming protests and in fear of the violence and deaths seen during Nixon's first term such as at Kent State or Berkeley where students were killed by National Guard. Nixon oversaw an even greater federal crackdown of protestors throughout 1969 and 1970 with thousands arrested and all law enforcement and intelligence agencies were instructed to ""monitor"" extremist groups leading to a number of high profile raids and prosecutions of anti-war groups. These were bolstered in part by crime bills which included no knock warrants and other measures drawing criticism from some members of the libertarian right. Among these anti-war groups targeted by Nixon conspiracy theories alleging Nixon's agents have acted as a ""gestapo"" have become widespread, including the theory that the fatal mugging of investigative journalist Jack Anderson was actually a CIA hit ordered by Nixon. The few theories that have breached mainstream media have been widely denounced as absurd and dangerous. Despite this the Nixon administration has taken a massive hit in trust with the public specifically as leaks have betrayed the dire situation the U.S. Army is in in Vietnam through leaks such as the Pentagon Papers released by Daniel Ellsberg displaying a systematic web of lies from the Nixon White House regarding the status of the war. Despite the massive prosecution of Ellsberg and in turn the New York Times, the Supreme Court has dealt a major blow to the White House with the continued rulings against the administration.

-Despite the widespread controversy and national polarization associated with Nixon's second term and the Vietnam War, one moment would bring the entire country and the world together as on May 4th 1971, for the first in human history, mans set foot on the surface of a celestial object that was not the Earth. Despite delays and setbacks throughout Nixon's first term, including the Apollo 1 disaster, the Apollo 11 mission to the moon would finally be launched in 1971. The first man to set foot on the moon would be commander of the mission Pete Conrad with his first words on the moon being ""Oooh, is that soft and queasy"" followed by ""Houston, It's a bit dusty up here but the view is amazing"". Also setting foot on the moon would be Alan Bean while Dick Gordon orbited the moon in the command module. The event would set records for television viewing with stores reporting a massive spike in the purchase of colored televisions. President Nixon would conduct a phone call with Commander Conrad on the moon speaking for one minute before delivering a joint speech with former President John F. Kennedy who kickstarted the moon landing mission in 1961 with his proclamation that the U.S. would place a man on the moon by the end of the decade. Acknowledging that this deadline had been missed, Kennedy did note that the landing had indeed occurred within a decade of his famous speech. The image of two longtime rivals and towering figures of American politics standing shoulder to shoulder as another American stood on the moon would prove to become overnight one of the most iconic moments in American history.

-In 1971 with renewed interest in equal rights for women due to the Supreme Court extending the protections of the 14th amendment sex-based discrimination, the Equal Rights Amendment would once again be put forward and despite defeats dating back to 1923, with Judiciary Chair Emanuel Cellar finally relinquishing and allowing the bill to be put forward, the bill would sail through the House and the Senate with the backing of President Nixon. Despite this conservatives of both parties have united and despite their defeat in Congress (largely at the hands of Nixon's allies) they have already banded together in opposition across the country with prominent conservatives standing against it, though the amendment does still achieve bi-partisan support with proposed Presidential candidate and fierce conservative Gov. Ronald Reagan lending their support.

**Foreign Policy**

-Coming out of the 1968 election with a mandate, President Nixon sought to finally bring an end to North Vietnam with one fell swoop, launching the largest ground invasion of the war. The invasion, described by some as retribution for the North Vietnamese attempt in the Tet Offensive to sway the American public during election season, has seen over 400,000 more troops deployed putting the total American troops on the ground at over 1 million (almost 1% of the male population). The offensive would soon swing into neighboring Cambodia and Laos (previously only targeted for carpet bombing). Despite initial success and major gains into North Vietnam, troops would struggle with consistent harassment by guerillas and locals often resulting in massacres of the local population by U.S. troops. In addition American troops soon saw their supply routes become too dangerous and costly with trucks being hijacked and roads lined with landmines. These setbacks proved costly for the Americans and as such only a small portion of the initial gains were held. For hundreds of reasons (inflation, leaks, negative press coverage, increasing casualty count, war weariness, lack of territorial gains) the public would finally, in one voice, turn against the war in 1970 as pro-Vietnam candidates suffered some of their harshest losses yet. A number of Nixon allies would be kicked out of Congress and the President would finally admit to his close aides that the war was officially a failure. Following the midterms, over 300,000 American troops would be recalled, SoD Westmoreland would be fired and the White House began a process known as ""Vietnamization"", turning away from ground troops and focusing on strategic bombing while funding the South Vietnamese Army to replace American troops returning home. While the drawdown in the war has been successful, for President Nixon and his legacy it is too little, too late and a clear majority now demand the full end of the Vietnam War, leading President Nixon to the first major peace talks in years. Despite the U.S. making concessions to North Vietnam, the North Vietnamese have refused to budge, demanding the full withdrawal of the American military. The war now stands in yet another stalemate as despite American troops still holding the frontline, the strategic bombing campaign appears to have mostly failed and South Vietnam has increasingly failed to uphold their end of Vietnamization with many recalled American troops being left unreplaced. As President Nixon prepares to leave the White House his legacy will now be defined by the 72,000 American troops slain in Vietnam, and the 400,000 still in Vietnam.

-Despite being overshadowed by Vietnam, the State Department spent a considerable amount of time over the course of President Nixon's second term in talks with the People's Republic of China. Since the communist takeover of China the U.S. has completely isolated China, however in 1969 China and the Soviet Union would begin a months long border dispute, to many the final stage of a long brewing Sino-Soviet split. Seeking to capitalize on this opportunity the Nixon Administration would make a number of subtle and under the radar overtures. Finally in mid 1970 these overtures would bear fruit and American diplomats and Chinese diplomats began secret meetings between the two countries. However formal talks could not begin until the drawdown of the Vietnam War in 1971, in the following months major diplomatic negotiations were made and in October 1971 a massive agreement was reached in which the U.S. lifted the embargo on China and formally recognized the PRC while recognizing Taiwan as part of China, in exchange for China withdrawing all support for North Vietnam. In the waning months of the Nixon Presidency, President Nixon would officially visit China, shaking hands with Premier Zhou Enlai and Mao Zedong and touring China with footage of the President on the Great Wall of China headlining the nightly news. 

-Another one of President Nixon's major accomplishments would come in the final months with the signing of the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT) limiting the number of ballistic missiles each superpower could possess. This treaty would be signed in Moscow in the final months of the Nixon Presidency, accomplishing two major diplomatic agreements in a move critics have described as a ""hail mary"" to prevent his legacy from being that of a butcher. 

-Diplomatic relations would not be as rosy with India however as President Nixon has sought to draw the U.S. closer to Pakistan. As part of closer relations with China, Nixon also pursued a closer relationship  with Pakistan as a close ally of China in the region aiding the country both militarily and economically. The situation would come to a head with the 1971 Indo-Pakistani war where President Nixon sought to bolster the Pakistani cause, dispatching the USS Enterprise to the region, only to be turned away by the Soviet Navy in an embarrassing debacle. 

-On Cuba, President Nixon spent the majority of his presidency instructing the CIA and other agencies to annoy and counteract Fidel Castro at every turn. Ultimately though the President would agree to the preservation of the 1962 post Bay of Pigs accord agreed to by President Kennedy keeping Soviet missiles off the island in exchange for the U.S. not invading.

**Supreme Court**

-Chief Justice Earl Warren

-Associate Justice Hugo Black (replaced by Federal Judge Warren Burger)

-Associate Justice William O. Douglas

-Associate Justice Tom C. Clark

-Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan II (replaced by Federal Judge G. Harrold Carswell)

-Associate Justice William J. Brennan Jr.

-Associate Justice Potter Stewart

-Associate Justice Byron White

-Associate Justice Arthur Goldberg

After President Nixon was left with 0 vacancies to fill in his first term it was beginning to look like he would be shut out of the Court entirely, however in a span of a few weeks in 1971 two seats would open with the quickly deteriorating health of both Associate Justice Black and Associate Justice Harlan II forcing both men into retirement followed shortly by their deaths. Hugo Black would leave a major liberal legacy behind on the court, fighting school prayer, the red scare, etc. despite being one of the most liberal Justices in the history of the Court, Black did advocate for judicial restraint. Black's chief ideological rival (but close friend) would end up going down with him as John Marshall Harlan II would retire the week after Black. Harlan, described by many as the Court's leading conservative, generally eschewed textualism instead arguing for a broad view of the Constitution while simultaneously supporting a limited role of the judiciary. Despite the perception of Harlan as a conservative, he consistently opposed social conservatives and was a leading advocate on the Court against the Vietnam War along with consistently supporting Civil Rights. In general both Justices, like most of the Warren Court, voted mostly with the majority of the historically liberal court. Justice Black's replacement, Warren Burger, served briefly as Assistant AG in the Eisenhower Administration before being appointed by President Eisenhower to the Federal DC Court of Appeals. Unlike past members of the Warren Court, Burger has been a staunch critic of the Chief Justice and advocate of a strict textualist interpretation of the Constitution. Unlike Burger's swift confirmation, Nixon's other nominee G. Harrold Carswell, would be subjected to a drawn out confirmation process with Senators grilling Carswell on his support for segregation ad white supremacy despite Carswell generally disavowing the statements. Carswell would be bitterly opposed by the non-southern Democrats and moderate Republicans, however, largely due to the election of a number of pro-Nixon Republicans in 1968, Carswell would skate through with a 2 vote margin.

1fdxtzt,1,2024-09-10,"I [28M] am failing to meet my wife's [26F] expectations, is it time to give up?",u/Difficult-Wolf8806,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1fdxtzt/i_28m_am_failing_to_meet_my_wifes_26f/,"Sorry that this one is so long. I am so deeply appreciative to any of you that takes the time to read this and give me advice. 

So I am going to start out by adding some basic background details before getting into everything. My wife and I met when we were in  high school. We dated then and it didn't work out until I left home for the military and we started dating long distance. We have been together since December of 2015. My wife is an immigrant from Ukraine who came to the US when she was young with just her mom. Her mom, for all intents and purposes, was brought here as a mail order bride. My FIL (wife's stepfather) is American. My family doesn't really matter because over the years I have pretty much completely cut them off for various reasons. Before my wife, my longest relationship was 3 weeks. 

So in regard to the expectations I have been failing to meet first I will say that I was largely raised in a house where I was parentified and infantilized in tandem. My parents would leave me so often as the sole caretaker for my infant sister that she called me ""dad"" more often than she called our actual dad that. But my parents still would call me an idiot child at 28 if I spoke to them and had a disagreement. Because of these things I really struggled to truly mature and learn the necessary skills and traits needed to be an actual adult like self motivation, organization, or thinking for myself on a regular basis past the bare necessities. The military was supposed to be the fix to this but realistically it just became a good place where I was good at doing what I was told. These are still skills I struggle to maintain despite a lot of therapy, self help, etc. Part of it is laziness for sure but also a part of it is just not having the highest standards for myself because I spent so long just trying to survive as a kid. That being said, after 2 years of long distance, my wife and I moved in together while she was a junior in college. 

The 2 years we lived together while she was in college were...tumultuous. Between me trying to go to school, struggling with job stuff and it being my first time cohabitating with a partner I wasn't always the greatest partner. On top of that we discovered that my wife had undiagnosed bipolar that was making every one of my problem behaviors be turned into ""I'm not gonna bring it up because I'm too tired and depressed until I'm manic and decide it is going to be the biggest, all night explosive argument ever"". Most of these problem behaviors could fall under one of the following categories: 1. Not contributing enough to housework, 2. Dishonesty (mostly around financial stuff) or 3. Poor Communication. The long and short is that I would put gaming/time with friends or personal pleasure over her needs and use working 60+ hours a week as my excuse. However, we worked through it and survived. The lockdowns during COVID were actually just about the best part of our relationship as we had a lot of time to just sit with each other and heal. Then she graduated from college and we moved to a different state so she could pursue graduate school and I could escape my family. We really saw it as a huge opportunity to have a second fresh start. 

I decided to finally start my journey to get my bachelor's degree after we moved and now it's pertinent to bring up a few promises I made early in our relationship. First, I promised to learn Russian (my wife's forced first language) and one day Ukrainian. I didn't spend the first 2 years doing this because I was a Linguist for the military and unfortunately not for Russian, so I was heavily involved with learning a different language. By the time we moved to a new state, I had taken a 2 semesters of community college Russian which was very threadbare and self studied Ukrainian on Duolingo (also to not much real progress). So when I got accepted to university I declared a major that would allow me to take Russian classes. The second promise I made her was that I would one day move her back to Ukraine so we could potentially raise our kids there. 

So regarding these promises, I spent 3 years getting a bachelor's degree (even receiving a second major in Russian) and took Russian the whole time. I was one of 2 people in a class of 30+ 3rd year language students to be allowed to progress to the 4th year and realistically I was always at the top of my class and getting complimented by my professors. However, I learned about a year and a half in that even aceing my Russian classes was not going to keep up with my wifes' expectations. I can speak *alright*. Realistically I am far FAR away from my skills in my second foreign language (which I attained workplace fluency for the military). And despite daily practice, the pressure has become so huge and it has become the constant spoke upon which all of our arguments revolve that I just don't know how to progress in the relationship anymore. 

I am pursuing getting a tutor because my wife has lost the patience to help me when I still make more basic mistakes or don't have native level pronunciation or intonation. In college I was reading short stories, poetry, news, etc and watching full films in Russian and doing fairly well during my last semester and at the beginning of this summer I was speaking daily in Russian with her. But we had an argument that just absolutely shattered my confidence in the language and I don't know how to repair it. My motivation is next to nothing and I can tell my abilities are slipping. Any time it comes up she says I speak worse than a 5 year old and read just as poorly and generally has nothing but negative feedback. 

This has all had a negative feedback type of effect elsewhere in our relationship because as I said, every argument we have ends up being made about how I have ""wasted my life"" or otherwise wasted my time doing nothing to learn her language. Any time I try to just apologize she reminds me that I promised her to learn the language and any time I try to stand up for myself she says ""well then say something in Russian"" knowing that I am going to freeze up. Since graduating in May I have been unemployed and looking for a job and just trying to enjoy being done with school while also studying Russian. There has been a few off weeks where my practice has been basic but like I said we had an argument where she basically said I have a worthless degree that I should be ashamed of because I speak worse than the mentally handicapped child of our friends. 

This summer we also started martial arts classes together to help us get exercise and also grow kind of mindfully in different emotional and mental goals. For her it's finding more emotional balance given the stresses of graduate school and for me, being more intrinsically motivated. I feel that we have both been very successful but all she can do when she gets upset is remind me that ""the clock is ticking"" or how ""she could get treated like shit by someone else who actually speaks her language"" or how I've ""wasted a decade of her life promising to learn other language"". And even though I think it's fair that she has criticism of my speed at learning the language, she just doesn't ever want to acknowledge that she has contributed to that for me. 

I love my wife. I want to have a family with her and I want to live the life we have dreamed about together for almost a decade. In addition,  she has been the ONLY person in my entire life who has stood by me through everything and hasn't either turned on me or abandoned me. Her family is the only family I have and even though we don't have kids, we have two cats she has made clear in recent arguments I would take if we split up. And the feeling of having to walk around the house with those two precious creatures still loving me but not being able to understand where their mom went fucking kills me. 

Splitting up has been a constant topic of discussion lately and she has given me basically a deadline of her dissertation defense in the over a year to get fluent. The argument that has led to this post today is her thinking I was rushing her to go out to the store because I said I was ""stalling"" so she could come with me in response to her telling me to just go without her because she was taking her time getting ready. Yet every argument comes back around to her saying ""you're doing nothing with your life so why can't you be studying Russian for 5+ hours a day so why does it matter when we do something"" or ""well you're upset about X but how do you think it feels to have to feel lied to every day because you still don't know my language"" or some variant of those things. 

We will have been together for 9 years this December, married for 3 years on Halloween this year. But it's gotten to the point where I have literally been asking ChatGPT ""how can you tell when a relationship is too broken to fix"". I'm heart broken even being here and asking for advice, but I feel the love of my life slipping away and I hate myself so much for it that I want to die but even when I improve on meeting her expectations it doesn't feel like enough and no therapist has been able to help me actually make changes to rediscover my motivation. I just hear ""oh that's so tough, let's keep talking next week"" every time. 

Like do I just get the tutor and keep trying to putter along and hope learning with less emotionally charged person will help me master the language faster or do I have to realize that maybe I just won't ever meet her expectations and give up? Because 

Tl;Dr: My wife expects me to learn her language and despite 4 years of study she would rather destroy my confidence than acknowledge how hard im trying. How do you know when yours or your partner's failings/mismatched expectations have just added up to an unsaveable relationship? "
1fe0hbc,208,2024-09-10,"TCS Recruitment Process: A Flawed System, talent being overlooked",u/4-alokk,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/1fe0hbc/tcs_recruitment_process_a_flawed_system_talent/,"TCS offers three roles: Ninja (3.5 LPA), Digital (7 LPA), and Prime (9 LPA). I qualified for the Digital role because of my strong coding skills, but I’m average in aptitude (I solved both coding questions during the TCS NQT test). On the other hand, a girl from our college group for minor and major projects got selected for the Prime role. She is excellent academically but lacks technical skills, especially in coding and computer-related subjects. Both of us are freshers.



She prepared well for the interview by memorizing academic content and rote-learning her involvement in the major and minor projects. She got selected for the Prime role. In contrast, I was well-prepared for the interview but couldn't provide exact bookish definitions. Instead, I explained concepts in my own words, which were still meaningful. I also explained my project very well, but despite this, I was downgraded to the Ninja role.



Here’s my background: I have been working with real life projects and coding for four years, published three apps on the Play Store, created two famous Flutter libraries, excelled in generative AI and machine learning, one research paper under review yet to be publish in 1\~2 montns, and became a Oracle Generative AI Certified Professional. I’ve worked hard, completing genuine payed courses, certifications, and 3 internships where I got pay lile 15k when I was in my 1st and 2nd year.



For my minor project, I built a Human Surveillance app, where I implemented the tensorflow model on an Android phone, running it locally on the device. My major project involved developing a Hinglish translation system using LLAMA 3 models, published on Huggingface. I incorporated all techniques like PEFT & QLoRA for optimized performance and quantized it to 4 bits using Llama.cpp to make CPU inferences. I’ve been using Linux permanently since 2018 and feel I am far more skilled in software engineering.



On the other hand, the girl who got the Prime role lacks real-world experience. She has never built an app, couldn’t set up VS Code or the Android SDK, and struggled with basic machine learning tasks like classification and summarization. Advanced topics like fine-tuning LLMs or handling complex AI tasks were completely beyond her. She didn’t contribute anything to our college projects, and during our project presentations, I gave her a script to memorize and repeat, which she also used during her TCS interview. I’m certain that wherever she goes, she’ll create problems for the people around her. She knows a little DSA and can only solve very basic questions.



It seems to me that TCS is failing to recruit the right people. They’re offering 9 LPA and 7 LPA roles to many who don’t deserve it and are failing to properly verify whether someone is genuinely skilled or just faking it. They didn’t ask me to show my apps, project repositories, or the lines of code I’ve written on GitHub. They didn’t review my published models on Huggingface. In my interview, they even seemed skeptical about whether I had done the projects I claimed.



Perhaps it was just bad luck that I was called to Kolkata for my interview, while earlier, three months ago, TCS had come to our college and given Digital roles to students who were below average or clueless. The interview should have been divided into a technical round and then HR, but for some reason, I was the only special candidate who had both technical and HR rounds combined into one 15-minute interview. It took place in a small cabin with three interviewers and me—barely enough space for a fifth person. It was a Friday evening, and I got the impression that they just wanted to finish quickly and go home."

Like most of you, I’m running on 4hrs of sleep so there may be an obvious point that I’m missing. Also, I’m NOT an English teacher…

Anyway, what if you did a ChatGPT lesson in your freshman/sophomore English class where you (1) present the students with a fairly general topic, (2) get their initial thoughts on the topic, (3) dump the prompt into chatGPT and pull up your course syllabus for a side-by-side, (4) Talk some mad f**king sh*t about it’s response, point out how it’s only surface-level word salad, scoff at it, etc. if ChatGPT were a person, you’d make it cry. Go through your syllabus and do a point-by-point analysis of why it is C-level work at best. (5) THEN, pull out an “example” of an “A-level” paper (something you prepared beforehand. Something written like you’re going to publish it! Of course, don’t tell them that you wrote it yourself.), highlighting how well it fits the rubric. (6) Return to the ChatGPT example for a comparison between the two pieces.

Perhaps this will help students see ChatGPT how WE see ChatGPT?

We come from a poor family and my dad didn't pay a single dime for my education as I just grab any scholarships that are available to offset the tuition fees. I hate the fact that I need to be in debt, and the thing is I don't even have a car or license for a motorcycle as they are really costly with high fail rate and I had to repeat again and all this cost more money. There are no job opportunities at my area and to travel to the town centre, it is super far and hard to travel as the frequency of the public transport is really poor and I would not be able to catch the train back home. I tried so hard to apply for remote part-time positions but I was never good enough. I just got rejected and I received a feedback from an employer and I really admitted that I am stupid and dumb. I wasn't able to write in good English as I never really attended tuition classes for English despite English being my second language. I am still struggling with grammar until today. I self-studied all of my subjects and I didn't get good results at all.  
  
I hated the fact that I am still a student and my family is struggling to put food on the table but I was unable to help out and university is just a huge scam. I just went to CS because I hope I can change my family life and I really think of not embarking into this career path. I am not passionate about it at all, in fact, I hated every second that I am facing my VS Code. I was unable to code well and most of the time, my university don't even teach me anything. I learnt nothing from there and some Indian YouTubers and ChatGPT were be able to teach me the entire course better than my lecturers. I felt like my course is just a scam.

The Philosopher's Zone: AI and reading (9/11/2024)

AI is like all new technology, insofar as many people are afraid of it. When it comes to AI and education, scare stories abound of students using ChatGPT to write their essays, and a possible future where teachers are replaced by bots. But according to this week's guest, there's much to be excited about.

1fe96ka,1,2024-09-11,Debrief: the odds were against me and I still passed SQE 1 on the first attempt,u/Which-Eye8079,SQE_Prep,https://www.reddit.com/r/SQE_Prep/comments/1fe96ka/debrief_the_odds_were_against_me_and_i_still/,"My reading of the latest SRA statistical report is that, cumulatively, if you’re an ethnic minority, a foreign qualified lawyer, a 2.2 degree holder, have attended a school outside the UK and you belong to a religion, you are highly unlikely to pass the SQE. I am all of the above (and I have bad short term memory) and I beat those odds by passing the SQE on my first attempt in the first quintile. Here’s my debrief:

Before I begin, I must emphasize that each person learns differently. My silver bullet might be your kryptonite. Start early and figure out what works best for you. The SQE has a chorus of people with endless tips and notes. It is overwhelming and ultimately impacts you negatively because you might find it difficult to nail down the approach, and resources, that work for you.

**Course provider:** Barbri 40 week part-time –don’t get hung-up on choosing a provider. The popular ones are all probably fine. It is a professional certification exam, so ultimately it is how you use the resources you have rather than what resources you use, with some exceptions.

**Already a lawyer?** Yes – South Africa

**Working?** Yes. London, in a busy finance practice in an international firm.

**Comments on course provider:**

* I chose Barbri because it took the thinking out of having to structure my studies as a lawyer working full-time with long-hours and family commitments.
* While Barbri were not great with their supplemental material covering curriculum changes and there were some errors in their questions/answers and materials, this issue is not unique to any specific provider. Overall the Barbri course materials are concise and hammer the core principles of the SQE curriculum.
*  If you go with Barbri, be sure to do all the practice questions, reset them and go again. Also remember to do the “more practice” questions, which are extra subject-specific question banks that you can do during your revision period.
* These exams should be accessible to all classes of society, but the current course provider prices are not reflective of this principle. Hindsight is 20/20, but if I were not working full time or was unable to afford a course provider and I was a more structured and disciplined person, I think that the cheaper option of buying a full set of Revise SQE or ULaw books together with the two Revise SQE practice assessment books and a question bank like Barbri Boost would be a solid preparation strategy. As more providers come online, I think that taking the exam will become cheaper (on the course materials side of things) but the exam fees are still quite excessive.

**Table comparing mock test scores and my final scores**

When studying, I thought that getting mock exam scores similar to others who passed would mean that I would pass. With the benefit of hindsight, I don’t know if this is true, but see below the table I created to record all my mock scores during my studies.

|**PROVIDER**|**SCORE**|**COMMENTS**|
|**Barbri A1**|54%|First attempt Exam conditions (timed, closed-book) No pre-preparation|
|**Barbri A1**|80%|Second attempt Exam conditions Pre-preparation (1 week before exam)|
|**Barbri A2**  |61%|First attempt Exam conditions No pre-preparation|

|**Barbri FLK 2 Simulation Exam**|82% Paper 1 85% Paper 2|First Attempt Exam Conditions A few weeks before exam   I thought that the FLK 1 simulation exam was reasonably difficult but that the FLK 2 simulation exam was not challenging enough. This is reflected in the difference between my mark in this mock and the exam itself. I did, however, understand enough of the law to still get a strong result on the exam.|
|**QLTS FLK 1 Free Mock**|48%|First Attempt Quiz style (answer revealed immediately) Don’t bother with this. Demoralising and not representative of the exam.|
|**QLTS FLK 2 Free Mock**  |42%|First Attempt Quiz style (answer revealed immediately) Don’t bother with this. Demoralising and not representative of the exam.|
|**REVISE SQE Practice Assessment Book FLK1**  |A1 – 63% A2 – 73%|First Attempt Closed book quiz style in 10 question increments throughout my consolidation period. Excellent resource for the money.|
|**REVISE SQE Practice Assessment Book FLK1**|A1 – 61% A2 – 65%|Ditto|
|**SRA Sample Questions FLK 1**|80%|First Attempt (disclaimer – some questions previously attempted during the Barbri sample question seminars) Exam Conditions Unpopular opinion: these questions are the closest cross-section of “mock” questions to the actual exam|
|**SRA Sample Questions FLK 2**|69%|Ditto|
|**SRA ACTUAL EXAM – FLK 1**|78%|Very challenging with a mix of easy, intermediate and difficult questions. Understanding principles rather than exhausting yourself with mocks is a strategy that worked for me.|
|**SRA ACTUAL EXAM – FLK 2**|78%|Ditto|

1. In retrospect I don’t think an obsession with mocks and difficulty thereof is productive. Knowing the law and doing a cross-section of questions from your provider, the SRA sample questions and Revise SQE is likely a good idea.
2.  I did not attempt any mocks more than once except as otherwise stated above. My strategy was to learn a relevant subject, do the subject-specific questions on the Barbri platform, move on to another subject, and when I have completed the next subject, attempt the “more practice” subject-specific questions for the earlier subject. In this way I allowed myself to learn, practice, forget and learn again. This helped the main concepts to stick.

**Structure:**

* I went to gym each morning, studied an hour after work each evening (taking Friday off) and studied for 2-5 hours on a Saturday and Sunday. I am not particularly social so my social life did not take a hit, but I maintained the usual engagements with friends and family (other than during my consolidation period).
*  I took 3 weeks of leave from work to cram before the exam. This period was for serious consolidation.

**My strategy on notes:**

*  I took no notes during the course. I attempted to make flashcards, but it was excruciatingly boring so I gave up. I was banking on using another person’s excellent free flashcards but the capitalism never sleeps and he decided to start charging for it (which they are, of course, entitled to do so).
*  Barbri have good data analytics that map your performance over time by subject area as well as by quintile against the other students. During the first week of my consolidation period I spent time focusing on my weakest subjects from each FLK.
*  During the consolidation period I read the textbooks (the two big ones but not the small revision one) thoroughly to understand the legal principles. I wrote out summaries or diagrams of subjects that I struggled with, not for the purpose of making notes (because you’ll never have time to go back to them), but because studies show that writing by hand is good for memory and learning. Barbri advise against doing this and prefer that you stick to the small revision book once you’ve completed the course.

**Opinions on the exam:** To be honest I can recall maybe 5 or six actual questions from each exam, but on the day it felt to me really difficult and I felt like I had outright failed each exam. I sobbed after each exam. I honestly don’t understand how anyone can accurately say whether the exam is reflective of a mock they did, or vice versa, but perhaps they have a better memory and awareness on the day than I do !

**Other resourcess**

Don’t let yourself become overwhelmed by the endless resources out there. The golden rule is understanding the law and applying the law. You'll get that from a good set of textbooks. 

o   I used Devil's Advocate notes to cover only discrete parts of FLK 1 that were poorly dealt with by Barbri when there was a sizable curriculum change at the end of the course.

o   Revise SQE Practice Assessment books are an incredible resource and contain a different question style to allow you to widen the scope of practicing your knowledge.

o   I tried an AI generated SQE question service. I think the attempt was admirable but that large language models are not yet mature enough to be useful question banks for a high stakes exam. 

o   Do not, under any circumstances, skip over the SRA sample questions. Make of that what you will.   "

Huge thanks to the Noxcrew for organising this event, and a lot of appreciation to the rising participants. (I will individually go through each team in this post.)

**Disclaimer**

* This is probably very subjective, and I will sometimes compare this to the last Rising.
* This is my first time writing a very long passage on Reddit.
* This is not an analysis!
* I had to use images for some text because I've exceeded the character limit.

Before I start, I'll lay down my relevant biases and limitations prior to the event.

* I am a Hermitcraft and Life Series enjoyer. 
* I dabble around Lifesteal as my sister is a fan.
* I lurked around Pirates SMP and Duckcraft SMP (only Jojo's streams) through livestreams when those were active.
* I love Wolfeei mogul mail.
* I used to watch Stampy.
* I am a Mathematics student in university, and have interest in sciences.
* I have not watched Rising 1.
* Throughout this period, I am in Sydney (AEST time zone) but I did stay up for the second day team announcement, alternate team announcement and the event itself. (I missed the first day… and had to watch the Wolfeei vod immediately in the morning to experience the team announcement without spoilers)
* English is my second language so please don't judge my English too much.

With that out of the way, I'll start in chronological order.

# Post-application

After the deadline, Wolfeei started watching applications live, but I was only able to watch vods. (Last Rising, Wolfeei watched the application live during times where I didn’t need to stay up too late) I was also watching a bit of Callum live watching applications as well.

Through those streams, I did watch about 100 applications. There were some familiar faces, but also really impressive videos made by people that I did not know. 

Wolfeei did complain about the length of videos being almost 5 minutes long. I do agree that it was quite a lot to go through, but I respect some of the longer ones. Some of them showcased interactions between members, and I think that is very crucial. It really tells us how well the chemistry of the team is. (This applies especially well for Cyan/Pink Pookies, which I'll explain later.) Obviously, at the same time, short and concise video works if made correctly, like the Aqua Artimators.

Wolfeei also said the general quality of the videos this year were not as impressive as last year. I just think this is due to the decrease in applications in some way. (And at the same time, it might not be true, but I think Wolfeei saw more applications this year than last year.) Respectfully, this allowed some of the less impressive ones to float up and lowering the average quality. (This is what I see, I'm just not sure if there are other reasons that made Wolfeei come up with this opinion)

Last Rising, I made a top 10 for the application videos; but this time, I just didn't feel like it. 



# Team announcement

**Coaches:**

I did not expect the addition of coaches, but that was very welcoming. I do see why they added coaches.

Last Rising, not every team had the same coaching experience. Participants had to schedule their practice with MCC participants. For example, Jojo had to coach around 8/10 teams which made it hard for both Jojo and Rising participants to gather together at the same time to practise. This time, a dedicated coach allowed for more flexible training. 

With regards to viewership, I agree that more people would tune in to Rising as some people would only watch regulars. Personally, I had the opposite: I was struggling to choose a POV because I wanted to watch a lot of them.

As for the allocation of the teams with the coaches, I don't really have any opinion. Which one would you prefer, the coaches or the teams to choose?



**Red:**

I did not know anyone here but I did watch their application before the announcement.

I think a lot of people agree that Team Skyblock is very reminiscent of the Blue Bats from last Rising. I really like that the application was done on their server. It’s cool to learn that Avid is the creator of Chunklock, and CodeNeon made a custom aquatic update. It's a solid start for the team announcement.



**Orange:**

I did not know anyone here but I did watch their application before the announcement.

This is where personal bias starts to kick in. Women in STEM + an artist who made fan arts of the Hermitcraft TCG cards, this really fits me. Same as red, the application was done on their server. I enjoy the name WISWAPMC&CC. It's crazy that CC can make a lot of contraptions with rails while being an artist. The joke “Rail Guy More Like Fail Guy” got stuck in my brain. It’s cool to know that Sinnabuns is a mother and at the same time tutored maths! I do admit that I wasn’t able to hang out in her streams more often. Mint said that she is chaotic, but I genuinely think she isn't. (Maybe I need to watch Backyard SMP.) Clover is a physicist, I should have really hung out more in her streams. Overall, I vibe with this team a lot. Jojo fits so well as a coach.  


**Yellow:**

I've known Abolish, Shep and Water but not Mae, and I did watch their application before the announcement. I don’t recall how I’ve known Abolish, but I’ve known Shep and Water from Pirates, and I lurked in some Watermunch streams. Later, I found out that Abolish made a video about Life Series suggestions on his YouTube channel which I’ve watched before.

The intro of the video reminds me of Lime Llamas from last year. Mae had POVs of two different events, accidental? Abolish Proofing, I guess he made a hard task for himself. Mae for sure carried the entire application, as she sang the parody of Hot To Go. Why were Abolish and Shep running away bro? This application was well done.



**Lime:**

I’ve only known Graaavel, but I did watch their application before the announcement. My first impression of Graaavel is the “evil” character that he was when he trapped Jojo in Duckcraft, with that very cursed skin.

Through their application video, I’ve actually learnt that Graaavel is trans, and I checked out his YouTube shorts that told his stories of being trans. His bits between each person's intro was great. There’s also the Español rep from Sushi, and the Aussie rep from Artemis. Some of the bits in the video were entertaining, and overall this application was concise.



**Green:**

I did not know anyone here and I did not watch their application before the announcement.

The first part of the video in that Discord call was so chaotic, and that really gave me the impression of the chemistry of that team. Poor Wondernat trying to get everyone together… Anyways, they are a team of artists! There were so many sound effects used like YIPEEEEEE. The compilation of Rose falling was funny. Overall, the video was great.



**Cyan:**

I did not know anyone here but I did watch their application before the announcement.

Okay, I feel like I will say so much about this team. They were all EU, and from three different countries as well. The first part with the video suggestions was already gravitating me towards the team, especially Katie’s shameless singing. The self-intros were well made as well. Pae featured his girly clip, and May’s clips were so out-of-context. I loved when Liam’s intro got interrupted by Katie and Pae.

As May explained how the team synergises, this was where the highlight of the video started. All the clips when they were together is the main reason why I appreciate the Pink Pookies so much, even if I didn’t know them initially. You can learn a lot about their chemistry from just these clips. From Katie annoying Liam’s stream by singing with high pitch, to Laim telling May to get a grip, those were immensely entertaining and told me that it would be a blast to hang out in their streams. Finally, Katie shouting “get oiled up” reminded me of Wolfeei getting oiled up, and I jokingly said that the Noxcrew chose this team just to annoy him.

Outside of the application, I’ve also learnt that May was in Creator SMP: Hardcore with Jeremey, which was very interesting.



**Aqua:**

I’ve known Cherri and Rusty but not Tibby and Bax, and I did watch their application before the announcement. I’ve known Cherri for being the thumbnail artist for Martyn, while I’ve known Rusty for her impressive Life Series Anamatics on YouTube.

This was definitely the first application video that I’ve watched for this Rising. The video was released very early on, and it popped up on the very top of the search. The video is the shortest among the 12 videos, but it was jam-packed with a mix of self-intros and interactions. The intros were very concise, I guess it’s unique that they are an artist team? (Green is an artist team as well…) Tibby was always the person to be made fun of throughout the interactions, which was hilarious. I’ve also learnt from the video that they were all in the Artimator SMP other than creating artwork for Hermitcraft and Life Series. Overall, this video helped me learn more about their interaction, as prior to this, I only know them through their artwork without their own voices. Martyn was definitely the best “couch” they could have.



**Blue:**

I did not know anyone here but I did watch their application before the announcement.

Third time’s the charm, the Blue Bedrockers finally got into MCC. Mentioned by Legundo (I think), their application video was done entirely in Bedrock so they didn’t have any replay mod, so this video was honestly not as easy to compile. At the end of the video, Plushy explained how they are also Minecrafters, albeit they are Bedrockers, but there was a lack of representation. I’m pleased that the Noxcrew did finally pick them for the representation this time round.  


**Purple:**

I did not know anyone here and I did not watch their application before the announcement.

Cosy’s “bow game” was a great start to the video. Chunk’s push-up was something. Another New Zealand rep from Queen. The interaction between them gave me cosy and chill vibes, and I do think the video was a bit underrated.



**Pink:**

I’ve known Ash, Zam and Squiddo but not Block Facts. Weirdly, I’ve known Ash and Zam from Block Wars first (not Lifesteal), but I’ve known Squiddo from Lifesteal as she is a new member for Season 6.

Wow, who would have expected that? (Other than u/WolfyProd) After the team announcement, I’ve finally realised why Ash was hanging out in Wolfeei’s stream during team announcements. Then, I watched the vod of Avid’s stream when he was announced, and found out that Ash was congratulating him in his chat! As Wolfeei said, he was lurking in communities that he shouldn’t normally be in, and I think most people did not realise that. Also, I did not know that Squiddo was streaming during the team announcement, and she was doing a “lore” stream on Lifesteal with Kaboodle, who had no idea. When the team announcement came, Kab’s reaction was genuinely funny. Other than that, on Twitter, 4CVIT revealed that they were asking for his MCC Jersey on Lifesteal Discord, and said that they couldn’t hide from other Lifesteal members that they were applying LOL.

Regarding the application video, as Zam mentioned, Block Facts did the heavy-lifting, doing all the production and editing, and it turned out to be such a banger. The cringey song was peak, and I don’t think I need to explain. The “Halloween Special” was also showcasing a lot of the chemistry as well. This video reminded me that Zam was a rising star nominee, pun intended. In Zam’s streams, he said that MCC was the reason he created his channel, and to see this come full circle, it’s very fascinating. Feinberg finally returned as the coach was welcoming as well.



**Alternates:**

I did not know anyone here. I’ve watched Alternate Team 1 (NattyDuck’s team) but not 2 (Jawunleashed’s team) before the team announcement.

I know it may suck a lot that they barely didn’t make it, but they should be very glad that they made it this far. Their application videos were very decent.

Alternate Team 1: The story “The Stolen Stache” was a unique way to introduce themselves. The whole gimmick of finding out who stole Noxite’s stache was very underrated.

Alternate Team 2: The chaotic vibes of this team was demonstrated very well throughout this video, and there were way too many out-of-context moments. Honestly, someone should really make an out-of-context video by compiling the 12 application videos. I can imagine that there are clips galore from the Pink Pookies and the Angry Axolotls. IdaKim telling Noxcrew to bring back Bingo when it has already been back for a year was also hilarious. Obviously, a huge shoutout to MonkeyZeus, who tried to mimic Minecraft in real life.



**Overall:**

First, if you notice from all of the accepted application videos, none of the teams felt that busted. Yes, Abolish breaking the Bedrock Ace Race and explaining Abolish Proofing, Gigi sweating on TSF, Plushy being the first person to survive 100 days on Bedrock Hardcore, Zam mentioning Lifesteal SMP, these are obviously signs of them being mechanically strong, but their skills weren’t as clear as other applicants who displayed skills on MCCI or said that they are MCCI regulars. Like last Rising, I believe that Noxcrew tried their best to balance out all the teams. (The original Aqua was super busted last year but their skills were hidden well in the video) However, from other background knowledge, everyone knew that Yellow, Blue and Pink were stronger than other teams.

I’ll say sorry to LOKIOLR, WadeBox, Richard Thornton and Legundo, but this year’s Rising felt way younger than last year’s. I feel like it’s more because of vibes than the actual average age suggests. Some participants are even younger than me, and that kind of contributed to that thought as well. I know age should not affect whether people should get into Rising, but this Rising definitely gave me generally distinct vibes compared to last year’s.

I’ve rewatched some vods of some of the participant’s streams when team announcements were happening. For Red, Orange and Pink, they were hanging out on their respective SMPs, and their friends were mostly surprised that they got in. The reactions were funny. Cherri was doing an art stream of drawing Tibby (I think), and when the teams were announced, she put the MCC background behind Tibby, which was hilarious. May hid her MCC jersey while playing MCCI on stream, and pulled it out when the time came, very cheeky indeed. Liam’s review on the first day's teams was funny as well, knowing how good their application was, I couldn’t stop giggling. Honestly, they were so good at keeping secrets on streams!

I did some brief research on individual participants that I didn’t know, and it’s very fascinating to learn that people from different teams were on the same SMPs, (e.g. Mythrill, Kaboodle, Abode and Duckcraft) and even some of them were friends.

For the first time in MCC, I was struggling hard to choose a POV for this event. I wanted to watch Orange, Yellow, Cyan, Aqua and Pink all at the same time, but my attention span definitely couldn’t do that.



# Pre-event training

There was content galore, but I wasn’t able to watch everyone due to time constraints. I was able to lurk around Lime team's streams live in the morning hours of AEST, but I had to rewatch the majority of the streams via vods. I’ve mainly rewatched Orange, Cyan, Pink, but I did also watch a bit of Aqua as well. Also, I was mainly watching parts when they were watching vods or training with the coaches. I know the Pookies played in Biome Battle, but I didn’t have the time to watch that (other than that one farming game where they got first). I did also peek around training streams of Ruby, Shep, Chunk and Gigi, admittedly not as much.

I’ll also mention some moments that I enjoyed a lot. These are not in chronological order.



**Martyn the Couch:**

I think Tibby started this, but he mispronounced “coach” as “couch”. This bit got stuck with the entire team since then, and I can’t stop laughing about it. It also extended to Cherri being “chair” as well.



**The Hole In The Wall Podcast:**

If you didn’t know, Rose broke Hole In The Wall on the practice server, which enabled people to simply AFK on the platform and chat while breaking the record. This started the Podcast of Rising people from different teams chatting to one another. I’ve watched the entire vod of Rose’s stream, and that was my favourite part during the training period. I got to learn a lot about them during the stream, and Block Facts mentioning that Noxcrew could not ban all of them was comical. Rose kept on saying “sigma”, and others were somewhat “annoyed” - it was priceless.



**Dutch Buff vs Cyan Rising Curse:**

This was more of a bit on Reddit, but this was pretty self-explanatory. May is Dutch and on the Cyan Rising Team. I was definitely leaning more towards Dutch Buff. I mean, May did take this a bit more seriously.



**Oli’s presentation:**

Oli obviously does Oli things. He made a presentation for Red to teach them about MCC, and it was amusing for sure. He really brought a lot of enjoyment as a coach.



**BRAT:**

The Lime team went for the BRAT joke and even had the letters on their skins. I don’t really need to explain too much, but that bit was funny.



**Graaavel chasing Sushi in Parkour Tag:**

That clip of Graaavel with the evil laugh was so unhinged. From that, I would remember back when he was on Duckcraft SMP being the “villain”.



**People watching Mirrorwing videos:**

Mirrorwing’s videos are genuinely top-notch, but some of the participants really took the Advanced Sandkeeping video too seriously (from watching Zam). The clock method was later used by multiple teams in the event.



**Block Facts bought Stampy’s Lovely World instead of Grid Runners Pro:**

He had the MineCoins to buy Grid Runners on the marketplace, but then he decided to buy Stampy’s Lovely World and trained in the Funlands with the team. I was instantly attracted by his livestream. They didn’t really train much on that, but it was certainly a trip down memory lane for me.



**Rising players self-introductions on the Reddit:**

Those were genuinely helpful! I got to learn some of the participants more, even for people that I’ve known, like Cherri and Rusty.



**MCC Jerseys:**

It's so cool that all Rising players have the option to buy a custom jersey! A lot of people posted wonderful pictures as well! I'm glad Noxcrew decided to do this.



**Block Facts “training” streams:**

Other than Stampy's Lovely World, he played Roblox with Wondernat, and also played Tetris while playing MCCI? This guy is a literal CHAD.



# Game roster and update video

Unlike last Rising, not every game was in. I agree that Survival Games should be benched as it's not that unique. Bingo is a toss-up: It's not the most unique but the MCC version is pretty well made. I guess the main argument here is that there are too many team games included. However, I disagree with Parkour Tag not being in. I am not the biggest fan of this game in regular MCCs but I really want the Rising people to have that option. It's not available on MCCI and this might be the only time where they can play this game.

Noxite said that the coaches were judging them harshly? That's mean. He also didn't tell them what the remix for TGTTOS was, which left everyone guessing aimlessly. I do think that the final remix was decent. (I'll explain later) Thermodynamics got some changes, but it wasn't played so I'm skipping that. Mentioning last year's SOT was brutal. I feel like the Ace Race trident changes should have been mentioned earlier on, since a lot of participants got used to the Ace Race auto-fire on the practice server, but I do like that this change makes trident more intuitive for Rising participants.

Honestly, I'm not going to focus too much on these details since these have already been discussed a lot.



# Event Day

I had a laptop and a phone, and would have two POVs at the same time, one from each device. For this event, I've not had a single coach POV up. On my laptop, I would have 10 tabs of Twitch and MCC live, one from each team, allowing me to switch anytime. On my phone, I was mainly watching Zam, but I did switch to Mint, CC, May and Liam for some time. (I also watch them on my laptop.)

On my browser, I had Ruby for Red, CC/Mint for Orange, Abolish for Yellow, Graaavel for Lime, Rose for Green, Liam/May for Cyan, Plushy for Blue, Chunk for Purple and Ash for Pink (because Zam's POV was always on the phone).

This is where I will focus more on individual team performances, as well as pointing out funny moments. I'll also include moments that I've rewatched from vods of participants and coaches.

Shoutout to immortal Wolfeei in the Hall Of Fame.



**Team intros:**

Red made such a cute build of skyblocks! Simple but really represents them well.

I loved the train in Orange's build that represents CC. The orange tulip looked great as well.

Standard yak build, but it was adorable.

BRAT, but they accidentally became BART, and everyone continued to call them BART throughout the event.

The gecko was goofy, and I like it so much.

Cyan's build really reminded me of their excellent application video!

The Eefos… with that three-block Martyn and the chain band, this was my favourite build by far (there’s clearly bias because I love the Guess The Build series).

o7 Redstonethecube

The use of beds for the van in Purple's build was very inspiring. Literally cosy.

What was going on with Pink? Worst build /j, but I know that's their personality.  


**Decision dome:**

People were generay unanimous in terms of voting. The only real accident was when Tibby went into the dome and got rid of HITW, but caused PKW to be played. (Similar to last Rising's SG, but few teams did want PKW) Out of all people, Tibby was unironically the most fitting person to do so, sorry Tibby.

From coaches POV, it was funny that they were shouting at the participants not to throw their eggs earlier. Luckily, most voting had gone to plan.



**TGTTOS:**

Starting with TSF, Gigi's sweating definitely paid off. The coaches cursing on Yellow was priceless when all 4 of them failed the first try. 

The backwards map as the remix was great, and it made so much sense that TSF doesn't work backwards (unless they gave participants firework rockets). While it was basically the same concept as regular TGTTOS, no one knew what the optimal route was, and it was somewhat a new map, giving some people more opportunity to catch up.

I know everyone talks about how good Plushy was, but the blue team did very well across all 6 maps, and they almost crushed everyone in To The Dome. Yellow getting top 11 in Walls was great. Zam's punch on Plushy in Cliff was evil! (Actually a tactical punch) Looking back from Martyn's POV, telling people not to punch him and Oli (or else they “got banned on Twitter”) was funny (especially the banter with Water, referencing Pirates).



**Meltdown:**

It was definitely one of the highlights of the event, being the only PVP game played. First time playing it, everyone was super passive, peeking walls very early on, and generally slower movement. It's a bit sad to see some teams getting trapped in melting rooms, but we also get to see insane clutches from individuals. In the first round, I watched Katie as she bravely ran to the centre coin crates and mined all of it while her entire team was frozen. Then, she came back and somehow hid behind May’s frozen body away from Sushi, proceeded to kill him at an insane angle, before resurrecting the team, and that was nuts! I’ve also seen, from Orange’s POV, how they left Block Facts alive and he then managed to resurrect Squiddo and Ash and win the third round. Red did so well in Round 3 as well, looking from Martyn’s POV. Overall, multiple teams had their clutch moments and it was not as one-sided, making it pretty entertaining.



**Ace Race:**

Plushy’s performance was overwhelming, even hitting the big skip multiple times. Abolish was so close behind him towards the end. Huge, huge appreciation to May for getting 3rd, and early on even in front of Abolish. You could tell that she was so locked in, and being the highest placing Dutch in Ace Race is an honour. Her team all got top 22 as well, which was very underrated. Additionally, I’m proud that everyone managed to finish the race, as Ace Race can be harsh for some players.



**Grid Runners:**

Pink absolutely crushed this game! (with the help of Stampy’s Lovely World??) Obviously, I have to mention their overwhelming performance in the dropper room (this was a brutal room for multiple POVs but that’s the norm for the final room). As for the other new room: Gather The Items, it did suck that the way up was very long, but hearing from post-event reviews, some teams did have miscommunications in that room that led to unnecessary trips up and down.



**Break time:**

MCC break times are normally fairly quiet, but with the addition of coaches, I was staying throughout the 10 minutes just listening to different teams. It’s so wholesome when the coaches were cheering them up by pointing out great plays in the first half. 



**Build Mart:**

That’s hard to comment about, but I surely didn’t expect Blue to pop off in this game. The point gap was insanely huge, and this game basically allowed blue to guarantee dodgebolt, with Pink in a stable lead. Rewatching Wolfeei’s watch party, it was painful to see CC missing that one moss, and I hope everyone who struggled in Build Mart could simply forget about the scores, since this was intensely stressful for a lot of players.

I’ve also rewatched Build Mart from Antfrost’s POV, and it was certainly way easier to see how the Cyan team progressed along, and even had time to tune into the Pink team.



**Parkour Warrior:**

I’ve watched as Plushy crushed through 14/15 of the bonus paths, as he got another 1st place individual in another game. He’s nuts!

Watching from Cyan’s POV live, this was the game that they wanted, but obviously a lot of teams didn’t want it. Once again, blue destroyed this game. At the end of the game, Cyan (Liam and Pae) were doubting themselves on not completing certain bonus sections. They were putting too much stress on themselves, but they did really well maintaining their spot. Liam got 5th in this game!



**Sands of Time:**

They all did better than Rising 2! Everyone was very weary about that, and they managed to improve! I was watching Cyan and Pink for this game.

I was speechless when Zam released a ravager into the timer room. Pink was always focusing on the clock method, but Zam kept on wandering around the timer room, trying to find his path. It’s just painful to see him doing so. Hannah shouting in his chat… that will probably be flamed by HBomb lol. Poor Squiddo getting locked out…

For Cyan, they really utilised the clock method well, figuring out the vault paths very quickly, but Liam was confused about the clock method? Liam did pretty well exploring his path. Even though Katie died, she managed to grab that back. Watching it live, I didn’t realise that they were low on sand towards the end, until I heard the 10 seconds countdown. I felt so bad when Katie and Pae got locked out. I’ve since watched back on their SOT from their POV. May did excellent collecting every piece of sand in the main room, and everyone else did leave all those sand for her. (That’s why she mined 38 sand blocks and broke the record) I didn’t realise that Liam was in Red Path initially but not Katie? I just think they were not alerted well on how low time was left, and Katie kept exploring without clocking into what May was saying. I believe it was stress that caused this tragic SOT for them. Sands Of Time is extremely brutal to newcomers, and they should not be taking this too seriously, as they did so well in the exploration aspect of the game.

I will have to watch the other 8 teams, probably in HBomb’s SOT review, but remember that Rising 3 did better than Rising 2 in Sands Of Time! (Or, in Rising 2 players’ minds, they finally played Sands Of Time.)



**Railroad Rush:**

The first obstacle in this game actually caused quite a lot of trouble with many teams, from watching live or watching vods. I couldn’t stop laughing when WISWAPMC was guiding the minecart into that dark cave on the left. Anyways, people’s decision making on how to go through the first obstacle was very slow. There were too many cooks. Some teams were not using dynamites to blow up walls or using them to collect more gold in Gold Rush. As a game that has only been played twice before, it was definitely another difficult game, and people shouldn’t be judging too hard on themselves with these games. Hopefully, CC isn’t a “fail guy” after this game.

On the bright side, Yellow absolutely created an insane meta strategy that will definitely be replicated by MCC regulars. They really made Pink panic a bit when the final dualists were getting announced in-game. At that moment, I also wasn’t really paying attention to the coin gap between Pink and Yellow, so I was also kind of on the same page as Pink. Red clutched up and got 7th overall, breaking that Rising red team 8th place curse, and I’m glad they did.



**Dodgebolt:**

Okay, Ash is nuts!!!! I’ve always been a big fan of 1v3 in Dodgebolt, but seeing someone finally performing the first ever 1v4 in Dodgebolt was unimaginable. Also in Rising, where everyone was new as well! This is certainly the top play of the entire event. You have to remember how intense Dodgebolt is, and overcoming that pressure is extremely tough. I know it’s not as demanding as the final round, but there are reasons why 1v4 was never done in the past 49 events before. Pink’s win was so well deserved, especially with that clutch. (However, Ash did fall off in the round after, which was hilarious.) Blue did their best in Dodgebolt as well, forcing a 2-2 tie, but it wasn’t enough to win the Swag Boys. Nevertheless, the Blue Bedrockers should be very proud that they had been 1st all along the way with top 11 individually.



**End of event:**

On the Walk Of Fame, Ash was jokingly allowing his chat to bid for his coin, which was very funny. I saw a bunch of Lifestealers in Zam’s chat cheering on them throughout the event. As mentioned, Zam made his channel because of MCC, and to have a debut win was absolutely perfect. It’s also hilarious that Feinberg technically continued the 100% winrate in MCC.

Coaches joined in the Discord VCs of their own team at the end, they literally sounded like proud parents, so warm-hearted. Avondale went into different team’s VC, where he was also checking what participants thought, very nice.

I also did stay a bit watching the coaches vs Rising players Dodgebolt, and it was certainly chaotic.

I did also stay in May’s stream and Liam’s stream after the event. The Pookies were a bit emotional, but they did admit that they were close to Pink all the time, and they were very proud. They felt gutted that they did better in individual games but not in team games, but it’s not really their fault: team games like Sands Of Time are harsh. I haven’t checked on people’s predictions, but Liam said that some people predicted them low was baffling to me. Liam was talking with the Yellow team as well, and it was great to listen to them sharing about their experiences.



**My thoughts on the scores:**

Blue got top 3 in every game, and I think that was just an underestimate from Noxcrew. Pink also made a substantial lead against Yellow and Cyan that allowed Pink to secure 2nd. Yellow and Cyan were also dominant in terms of being top 4, albeit they fumbled in different games. It's very impressive from all of them.

Individually, Plushy was insane! There was a gap of almost 700 coins between him and Zam, and will be engraved on the MCC history books. Zam, Abolish and Defectt were also crazy, securing their top 4 spots early on. Ash and Gigi's 5th and 6th performances respectively were vital to their team's dominance as well. Thinking of him as an artist and a rail guy, I did not expect CC to pop off as well. May did unexpectedly well, being the top frag of the team was probably not in anyone’s list. Just outside of the top 10, Bear was just 6 coins away from 10th. Block Facts was right behind at 12th, which was also an excellent placement by him. 

Last Rising, the top contenders were way closer. Lime and Pink came down the final round of the final game (Battle Box). This time round, Cyan and Yellow had no way of catching up. It's not as extreme as Rising 1, but just from the Cyan team this time round, they were pretty pessimistic after Game 6. This was just unlucky. Everyone in the event was new, so it's extremely hard to balance, especially when Noxcrew can't just easily check everyone's background, as it’s tedious. Even in the last Rising, Wade said he was getting last before the event, then proceeded to get 6th, so there was way too much unpredictability.

It's way more crucial that everyone in the event enjoy themselves!



# Post-event

First of all, everyone in the event created such an entertaining event! From applications to the end of the event, I appreciate everyone’s effort! As a Rising 3 player, you should really cherish the memories along the way.

The Lifestealers won this event, and there’s the Bandits, consisting of Lifestealers Hannah, Jumper, Pangi and Kab, and Velvet, in the upcoming Block Wars 12. Back-to-back win maybe?

I’ve rewatched the coaches POV from Antfrost and from Martyn. It was a rarely-seen perspective that I didn’t expect. It was so wholesome seeing them being proud parents of the Rising teams. 

I’ve since tuned into Rusty’s stream, where she rewatched her MCC stream. It was so much fun listening to what she thought and how she reacted to different moments, as she was relatively quiet in her team. I know she’ll be back behind the curtains making Anamatics, and I hope she can continue making bangers on YouTube.

I’ve also been rewatching Liam’s stream regarding his thoughts on the event. Some of the screenshots were sick, while some were goofy lol. Talking with Vintage, it was fun to listen to how they experienced MCC, and even chatted more about their lives.

Jojo got a “Coach Jojo” MCC Jersey as a birthday gift from Team WISWAPMC (&CC)! I kind of melted.

Pae made an adorable tribute for every team!

On Twitter, a lot of participants have written warm-hearting statements about the event, and I tried reading them all!

There's also a bunch of clips from MCC Vault on YouTube and MCYT Highlights on Twitter that I've watched as well! It's a pretty easy way to look back on some moments in this event! Besides, I’ve listened to the Cyan team interview by MCC Central, and I will listen to the other teams’ interviews later as well.



# Appreciation to each team

**Red:**

The first thing I remember was that team intro build! Meltdown was honestly crazy. I’ve also seen that your team was the first to finish TSF. I know mid-event was rough for you, but you managed to escape the 8th place curse with the comeback in SOT and RRR!



**Orange:**

I’ve seen Mint always streaming training, and I tuned into a lot of your streams (sometimes from Jojo’s POV as well). Your team had a lot of ups and downs in this event, but I did check out some notable games that your team popped off, like Meltdown and Grid Runners. From watching practice streams to the event itself, it was so warm to be in the streams. Also, shoutout to Clover's cat, that's so adorable.



**Yellow:**

I feel like I haven’t been tuning into your team much, both training and event day. Honestly, you did so well! I think the fact that you were always behind Pink in almost every game was a bit rough. Other than your impressive RRR, you kept pretty consistent in some games! Hopefully, I'll have more time to tune into your streams.



**Lime:**

I've watched quite a lot of training but sadly not a lot during event day. Graaavel made great compilations of his training! That ten-hour training stream was quite something. Sushi was the other person that I've lurked around a lot, and you also trained a lot! I will not forget about MCC BRAT summer (or should I say, BART summer).



**Green:**

The only real POV that I've watched was Rose breaking HITW, but that alone was peak. I really haven’t watched much training or playing during event day, but I’ve seen a lot of artwork from your team! Hearing from Callum, he was so excited about you!



**Cyan:**

Your team was probably one of the reasons I’ve decided to write this long post. You were four creators that I had never known, but from just watching your streams, I really got into the vibe of your team. Your team did exceptional in MCC, and I don’t think you should be sappy or disappointed. I know May might be sad that Dutch Buff ended, and Pae might have been doubtful about his performance, but as Liam mentioned, your team broke the Cyan Rising curse and also had top plays, from Meltdown to Ace Race. Your team brought so much enjoyment to the event, and I hope you can get into other MCCs.



**Aqua:**

The vibe of the Aqua Artimators was immaculate! Knowing you as the artists in the Hermitcraft and Life Series communities, I’ve always enjoyed watching Anamatics or looking at fabulous artworks, but watching your team stream was another experience. I was sometimes watching you in MCC, and it was so chill. I will certainly continue to check more of your work when you’re behind the curtains.



**Blue:**

I wasn’t watching much from the Blue Bedrockers, but you absolutely smashed the event! It sucks that you didn’t win Dodgebolt, but your dominance has been witnessed by everyone. I know people have been talking about how Plushy was, but the team effort was impressive as well! It’s so funny that Plushy was talking to chat while playing, and I’m impressed. How did you do that in Build Mart?



**Purple:**

I felt bad for the Purple team. I didn’t watch a lot of training, but I saw Chunk always on the Twitch page, practising for MCC. From the coaches’ POV, Queen running away from that many zombies near the Blue Vault was certainly scary, but you managed to escape from that! 



**Pink:**

Congratulations for winning MCC! You’ve made the Lifesteal community proud. You’ve avenged for the Cyan Slimes from the last Rising. I’ve been watching Zam grinding hard, from training on MCC Island to watching vods, and I’m glad to see that your dedication and determination have paid off, and you have reached your ultimate goal! Ash was also popping off hard, and it was not only your nutty 1v4 in Dodgebolt, but also your overall performance in game! Liam is a chad! The unlisted application video that you’ve made was magnificent. Your training streams were something else. You’ve been marking down a lot of notes for the team as well! Squiddo was underrated, placing 14th. You did a lot contributing to the team! Perhaps we can see a full Lifesteal team in a main MCC in the future!



**Alternates:**

I’ve not watched anyone here during the training period, but I’ve been observing other people's stream practising on the practice server, as well as the chat during MCC. As of writing this, I’ve been watching Jawunleashed pre-MCC podcast, and you’re such a cool guy.



**Coaches:**

All 10 of you are goated! I haven’t been in most of the coaches’ POV, but it’s so grateful to have you helping with all the rookies. I know some coaches did more than others, but being the proud “parents”, you all did your best to allow Rising 3 players to thrive and enjoy MCC.

1feehol,1,2024-09-11,Exploring ChatGPT's Impact on Virtual Learning in Corporate and Educational Spheres,u/cporter202,ChatGPTautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTautomation/comments/1feehol/exploring_chatgpts_impact_on_virtual_learning_in/,"As virtual learning continues to shape the future of education and corporate training, one of the most fascinating developments has been the integration of advanced AI, particularly OpenAI's ChatGPT. Like any disruptive technology, ChatGPT has sparked a mix of excitement and concern. In educational contexts, ChatGPT promises individualized learning experiences, bridging the gap between students' diverse learning paces. Teachers could harness this AI to create interactive lessons or to serve as a tutoring assistant, offering students instant feedback and guidance.

However, skeptics point to the potential drawbacks. The issue of academic integrity arises when considering how easily students could use ChatGPT to complete assignments, potentially undermining learning processes. Moreover, there's the fear that standardized curricula implemented by AI might sacrifice creative and critical thinking for the sake of efficiency.

In the corporate realm, ChatGPT's impact seems overwhelmingly positive, providing employees with on-demand, personalized training opportunities without significant downtime. Corporate training modules can leverage ChatGPT to simulate real-world scenarios, equip employees with soft skills, or walk them through complex problem-solving processes.

Yet, this technological revolution begs the question: Are we ready to manage and regulate the use of such AI effectively? Will the inflection point of AI integration into learning paradigms lead to an educational renaissance or a dilution of essential human elements in teaching and learning processes?

Let's explore the multifaceted impact of ChatGPT on both the educational and corporate spheres. How is it reshaping the way we learn and teach? What policies should institutions implement to maximize its benefits while mitigating potential issues? Share your perspectives and experiences with ChatGPT in virtual learning environments!"

(Symbolic, Imaginary and Real)",u/sf0rzix,lacan,https://www.reddit.com/r/lacan/comments/1femqge/how_do_i_approach_lacans_3_registers_symbolic/,"Hey there! A psychology student here. I have a work at my college about Lacan, with focus in this topic. I have a decent knowledge in Freud, but with Lacan is another story and I'm really lost in how to start it properly.

I already jump in (impulsively) with the Seminar XI because my teacher recommended that one, and also I did for a little research (probably wrong) with ChatGPT trying to looking what could be a good introduction for this topic, and well, here I am, already lost in the half of the book, without finding anything revealing (or at least not in the way that I imagined). I kind of understand the concept (by YouTube videos mainly), but I think it's not enough for that work. 

So, what would you recommend? Sorry if my English is not very good or precise, I'm from Paraguay and I'm not used to using my English frequently.

P.S: I think it's important to mention that I'm reading the Seminar XI in spanish, from the publishing house Paidós."
1fes2gz,5,2024-09-11,What to do going forward for university?,u/Mysterious_Radish386,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/1fes2gz/what_to_do_going_forward_for_university/,"Hey all! 20M domestic university student in Melbourne doing a Bachelor of IT (major Cyber Security). I’m graduating next year. I’m kind of a slow learner because I don’t understand concepts straight away but when I do (usually on my own time), I am very comfortable with the concept and could explain it pretty well to someone who has no idea.

I find Cyber Security to be okay, haven’t really developed a solid opinion on it yet but I also do some programming most of my courses are either somewhat about programming or cyber security nowadays. It’s what my end goal is now. They can be fun to do as like a side hobby but i’m not extremely passionate about it.

I was considering certs for Cybersecurity, but not too sure what certs exactly. Heck I haven’t really decided what kind of Cybersecurity I wanna do, I just probably need some direction so I made this post.

I recently done an assigment. It’s basically assymetric encryption with Digital Signature. Normally you would have to do quite a bit of math to create keys and digitally sign and others would verify so it’s you that sent it, instead I created a Python program to do the math for me, I understand the mathematics behind it but I automated it and my professor was okay since he knows I understood. This I consider to be my first real problem I done on my own and solved myself using programming. 

No I didn’t use ChatGPT nor a YouTube tutorial would it be worth putting it under projects for my resume? I wouldn’t mind doing some projects as long as they’re enjoyable and somewhat accessible at my skill level, which isn’t very high. 

I also have some people I know that work in something related to tech…
- First is a cousin that works at a bank idk which one for some reason, anyways she said she’ll try to get me a position. 
- Second my friend has auntie and uncle at NAB, I done a technical interview but I got ghosted. 
- Third is a friend of mine whose cousin is a Software Engineer at ANZ. 

Enough yapping from me, now what should I do? Maybe you guys could provide some direction? Many thanks. "

And if I'm short on time to complete my work or assignments, I use it to help me finish all my work and assignments for me as soon as possible. It makes my life so much easier and could also help me learn faster. I am wondering, before ChatGPT existed, do uni students have a much harder time studying and completing their assignments or any other work due to everything being super-fast paced without students having enough time to fully understand the material being taught in each course? Because sometimes, even I couldn't catch up with my work and assignments even if I use ChatGPT to help me learn and study, which I could imagine that the students who were in uni before ChatGPT even existed have an even more difficult time, is this true?"

1feuw14,1,2024-09-12,"7 Reasons Why Students Should Embrace AI Tools Like ChatGPT (Like, Right Now!)",u/DigiPartha,u_DigiPartha,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_DigiPartha/comments/1feuw14/7_reasons_why_students_should_embrace_ai_tools/,"# Okay, let's be real. We've all been there. Staring at a blank document, the cursor blinking like a judgmental eye, while the pressure of that looming deadline starts to feel like a physical weight.  And then, whispering in the back of your mind, is that little voice... ""There has to be an easier way.""

Well, guess what? There is!

The world is changing, friends, and AI tools like ChatGPT are no longer futuristic fantasies. They're here, they're now, and honestly? They're about to become your secret weapon for acing those assignments and actually, you know, *enjoying* the learning process.

Still not convinced? Here are 7 reasons why every student (yes, even you!) should jump on the AI bandwagon:

**1.  Brainstorming Buddy:  From Brain Freeze to Brainstorm in Seconds**

We've all been there - staring at a blank page, the dreaded ""writer's block"" setting in.  It's like your brain turns into a dry desert, devoid of any creative oasis.  But what if you had a brainstorming partner available 24/7? That's where ChatGPT swoops in to save the day!

Imagine this: you feed ChatGPT your essay topic or project idea. Within seconds, it throws back a bunch of potential arguments, angles, and even creative approaches you never considered.  It's like having a brainstorming session with a super-powered study group, minus the awkward silences and scheduling conflicts.

Suddenly, that blank page doesn't seem so daunting anymore, does it?

**2. Research Assistant Extraordinaire:  No More Drowning in a Sea of Search Results**

Let's be honest, research can feel like falling down a rabbit hole. One minute you're looking up historical dates, the next you're knee-deep in conspiracy theories about ancient aliens (we've all been there, right?).

ChatGPT can be your trusty research assistant, sifting through the mountains of information out there and delivering the key facts and figures you need.  Need a quick summary of a complex theory?  ChatGPT has your back.  Want to compare different perspectives on a historical event?  Consider it done.

It's like having a personal librarian who can instantly access and analyze information, leaving you free to focus on the actual learning and understanding.

**3.  Grammar Guru and Style Savior:  Polishing Your Work to Perfection**

Okay, admit it. We all have that one friend (or maybe *we're* that friend) who's a walking, talking grammar dictionary.  But even grammar gurus can miss a typo or two.

ChatGPT acts as your ever-vigilant proofreader, catching those pesky grammatical errors, suggesting better word choices, and even helping you refine your writing style.  Think of it as giving your work a professional polish before you hit that submit button.

No more late-night panics about comma splices or subject-verb agreement – ChatGPT's got you covered!

**4.  Personalized Learning Companion:  Tailoring Your Education to You**

We all learn differently.  Some of us are visual learners, while others thrive in a hands-on environment.  But traditional education often struggles to keep up with these individual needs.

This is where AI tools truly shine.  ChatGPT can adapt to your learning style, providing explanations in a way that clicks with you.  Need a concept explained in simpler terms?  No problem. Want additional examples to solidify your understanding?  ChatGPT's on it.

It's like having a personal tutor who understands your strengths and weaknesses, helping you learn more effectively and, dare we say, even enjoy the process!

**5.  Time Management Master:  Because Who Doesn't Need More Hours in the Day?**

Let's face it, juggling classes, assignments, extracurriculars, and maybe even a part-time job is a recipe for stress-induced meltdowns.  We've all been there, drowning in to-do lists and wondering how we'll ever get it all done.

ChatGPT can become your time management guru.  Use it to break down large assignments into smaller, more manageable tasks.  Get help prioritizing deadlines and creating a realistic study schedule.

By streamlining your workflow and helping you stay organized, ChatGPT frees up your time so you can actually, you know, sleep, eat, and maybe even have a social life!

**6.  Expanding Your Horizons:  Learning Beyond the Textbook**

Education shouldn't be confined to the pages of a textbook.  It's about exploring new ideas, challenging your perspectives, and sparking your curiosity.

ChatGPT can be your gateway to a world of knowledge beyond the curriculum.  Use it to dive deeper into topics that fascinate you, explore different viewpoints, and engage in thought-provoking discussions.

Think of it as having access to an endless library of information and perspectives, all at your fingertips.

**7.  Preparing for the Future:  AI is Here to Stay**

Let's be real, AI is not some futuristic fantasy anymore. It's already transforming industries, and knowing how to use it effectively will be crucial in the job market.

By embracing AI tools like ChatGPT now, students are gaining valuable skills for the future.  They're learning how to leverage technology to their advantage, solve problems creatively, and adapt to a rapidly evolving world.

Think of it as future-proofing your skillset, giving you a competitive edge in the long run.

**The Bottom Line: Embrace the AI Revolution!**

Look, change can be scary, we get it.  But AI tools like ChatGPT aren't here to replace human intelligence.  They're here to *enhance* it.  They're tools to help us learn more effectively, work more efficiently, and ultimately, unlock our full potential.

So, ditch the fear, embrace the possibilities, and let AI be your guide on this exciting journey of learning and growth. Trust us, your future self will thank you!"

You guys had great questions, I answered like 99% of the comments and have finally finished replying to the 100+ dms I've gotten. I made the mistake of not sending ground rules so here they are. Please keep in mind that I'm trying to help you guys for free, not expecting much in return other than common decency.  

1. I will not post the company, my LinkedIn, or my resume. I was planning on posting a blurred out version of my resume, but I do not feel comfortable sharing it anymore because of the crazy entitlement and reaction some of yall had. I do not want to have any ties to this account and it gets annoying when half my DMs are filled with people begging for a referral. One dude went to a comment I made 2 years ago to try and identify me. This sub has some weird fucking people.

2.  Please check out this post before asking a question because I have probably already answered your question. I'm not going to re-answer any questions.

3. I'm kind of scared to say this, but my DMs are still open, please don't make it weird, do not look for me to fund your journey, I will not refer a random undergrad.

4. This is just a straightforward roadmap of what I think it'll take to land an offer like I did and a way for me to answer the most commonly asked questions in the previous post. I could care less if you don't trust me, I'm just trying to help yall when 99% of the posts here are leetcode zombies crying that they can't land a job after sending their resumes to 2k companies. 

**If you do not have the funds, or the time to do what I did, please stop reading. I cannot guarantee you will find the same success I did. Do not drop everything you're doing to do this.**

From February to the end of June I took a total of 6 certifications. These are the ones I recommend completing

SAA-003: This is the best certification to start with. If you have 0 knowledge, it'll take you 2-3 months. It took me 2 weeks to study and pass. I used Neal Davis to study for this. Below is a link to his page. I bought all his courses because I plan on taking every certification he has taught. I created a free AWS account this month and ensured I knew what every service looked like.

[https://www.udemy.com/user/63f4a578-c67a-456b-916c-ddadf73e9a26/](https://www.udemy.com/user/63f4a578-c67a-456b-916c-ddadf73e9a26/)

SAP-C02: This is the next step in the Solutions Architect path. This test is hard, it took me another month of studying and I used Neal Davis's practice tests, took them over 30-40 times. He has a lot of hands-on projects, I did them all no matter the cost. 

DVA-C02: Another associate exam. Focuses on deploying, packaging, etc applications and CI/CD workflows. Not a hard test, took me around another 2 weeks to study.

Terraform Associate: Extermely easy exam. I bet an absolute beginner with 12 hours of time could pass this exam. Just do all your projects in terraform and you won't even have to study. 

This was all taken during my final semester as Computer Science major at a state school. I was only taking 2 classes so I devoted all my time to this, spent 6-7 hours studying, and the rest of my free time on projects. I had a friend give me a few ideas, had ChatGPT come up with a few, and did a few of my own. Most of them had to with creating an application from scratch, and figuring out the best ways to migrate it to the cloud. I will not be posting my projects, it'd be dead easy to identify me. Come up with your own creative projects.

Here is the link to a project I did complete in full detail: [https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1fax48r/comment/llwtnlm/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1fax48r/comment/llwtnlm/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

These certifications are sort of the bare minimum of what companies are looking for in my experience. I don't know how hard it'll be even if you complete these because I had a few more under my belt, but I'd be surprised if it was a lot tougher. 

Interviews are a whole other story. I'll give some pointers on how to apply and other tips:

1. Do not memorize. I cannot say this enough. Especially for the certifications, the associate ones can be easily done through memorization. Do yourself a favor and do not memorize, the companies require a much more thorough understanding than that. Only start applying when you know you are comfortable having a conversation about the provider you studied for. 

2. My resume was not anything fancy. Just a simple name at the top with basic information on how to contact me, my cert badges on either side, followed by my professional summary, skills, projects, experience and education. It all fit on one page and was concise. I have learned that recruiters do not give a fuck about you, half the time they cant even understand half the stuff you claim you can do. They are looking for keywords found in the job posting, put those in, make sure they see it, and you're golden. I also only showcased 2 projects I thought were relevant to their company.

3. Do not apply to remote options. I got zero callbacks from job postings offering remote work opportunities. Simply too competitive. Just filter to hybrid/onsite. 

4. Do not spam apply. It is useless, you will get shortlisted. Apply to 40-50 companies you think you genuinely have a shot at, edit your resume to fit their exact needs, and once you get the call for that first interview, start studying up on all the gaps you had to add. 

5. You can apply to ones asking for Azure or GCP certs along with AWS ones. Do not apply to postings that are specific to Azure, GCP, etc.

6. Once you do get to the technical interviews, I found that most of my interviews that went well were more like conversations. The interviewers would ask me a question and then I'd not only answer it, but relate it to a project I worked on, just tried to show them that I had the experience in the services even though it wasn't in an actual job setting. We would talk back and forth, I'd learn something from them, they'd learn something from me. To be honest, it seemed like they were under qualified to interview me, but it was fun nonetheless. 

7. I never specifically prepared for any interview. After making my whole life the cloud, I was extremely confident when talking and never felt nervous during the process. You do not need to do any leetcode, but you will need to know your shit. HCL is a language you will need to learn. 

8. If you're applying as an international student, I want to wish you a good luck. I would not go down this path at all. Every single company I applied to refused to sponsor in their job posting, so you guys are better putting your time somewhere else. Maybe if you're omega rich and have nothing to lose.

It took a lot of money, I spent easily over 5-6 grand on learning everything. There is unfortunately no shortcuts I can recommend other than the shortened certification journey above. Again, if you can't put in the time or money, I don't recommend investing in this field. Do not start this journey if you don't think you can see it through. I didn't see the light at the end of the tunnel until I got quick callbacks so it was a gamble for 6 months.

Just to end this ""college essay"" I wrote out, I used to game quite a bit, but basically went ""cold turkey"" and destroyed my social life to get to this point and I do not regret it. I'd rather be crying with a job alone than crying with my friends that I don't have one. "
1fewpyf,1,2024-09-12,Legacies: Love Never Dies (Kalaric),u/Lizzy100,WritingForEveryone,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingForEveryone/comments/1fewpyf/legacies_love_never_dies_kalaric/,"Set in Legacies S4. Hope has turned her humanity back on. Now, she wishes to speak to Klaus, but she can’t without temporarily or permanently dying. And limbo is a huge place, so they don’t know where he even is. When Kat comes back to life, can she help? Will Ric allow her to stay at the school? Will something happen between her and Ric?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It was a dismal night, as an injured Kat lay on her side, having escaped a prison world without a certain Gemini witch and a couple teenagers. She could feel familiar wood floor, and assumed she was in the boarding house, not knowing what had transpired since her last death. Everything was gray and turning black, so she didn’t really know where she was.

Alaric Saltzman headed for his office. When he did, he heard something. Then he opened the door to see someone he thought he’d never see again. It had been many years since she’d gone up in hellfire, after all.

He walked in and closed the door, before heading to the middle of his office, where she lay on her side. He then knelt by her, a hand on her arm. He could see that she’d lost a lot of blood, was pale from blood loss, there were a lot of injuries, and an arrow was protruding from her lower stomach. He also saw an ascendant near her. Because of her injuries, he knew which prison world she’d ended up in. She’d done horrible things as a vampire and demon, but she didn’t deserve any of this.

""Katherine?"" he called to her. 

After a few minutes of not getting a response, he gently picked her up, crook of his arm supporting her head, and headed to the closet that had a bed in it, laying her down on it. Then, using his cane to help himself, he grabbed some first aid stuff to help her. A normal person would’ve asked for vampire healing or taken her to the hospital, but he knew her well enough to know that she wouldn’t want a hospital unless it was an emergency. He also knew that after what had happened with the cure when she’d been human last time, she wouldn’t wish to try vampire blood. He wasn’t Damon, but he knew her well enough to know what she’d probably want and not want.





After he’d gotten her tended to, he sat in a chair by the open closet, waiting for her to wake up. He wanted to know what the hell happened, but also needed to know that she was going to live. And if she didn’t know what had all transpired while she’d been dead, then he knew he was the closest person next to Caroline that had the right to tell her. Damon wasn’t here anymore to take up that responsibility. No one from her past was. They were now all gone. As far as he knew, anyways. After all, he knew as a vampire, she’d known a crap ton of people. He wouldn’t be surprised if she still had friends from her past that would still be her friends.





When she woke up, she didn’t know how long she’d been out. All she knew was she was on a bed in a closet, Alaric in a chair, obviously having been waiting for her to wake up. She assumed since she felt like she’d been tended to, that that had been him. After all, she knew dating a couple doctors in his lifetime, he had to have a lot of knowledge.

""Alaric?"" she inquired, before, a moment later, asking, ""Where am I?"" She didn't attempt to move from the bed or sit up yet, though. 

“This is the renovated boarding house. Caroline and I renovated it for supernatural kids to have a safe place. It’s the Salvatore boarding school now,” he informed her. “You’ve missed a lot since you were last killed. But first, what happened to you? You went up in hellfire. I didn’t think you’d be coming back at all.”

She looked at him and finally, slowly sat up in the bed, back against the wall. 

“When I went up in hellfire when I was a destructive demon with no remorse, I ended up in a prison world. When Kai’s prison world was destroyed, I happened to end up in the one your girls created, and Kai ended up there as well. Kai did a number, but so did a couple of teenagers I’m assuming were probably students. Let’s just say the usual survivor became the hunted, and Kai made it a show. He wanted out, but I wasn’t going to let him use me to get out of there, so I made my own way, eventually,” she explained to him.

“I’m sorry. You didn’t deserve that. Yes. They’re students. They were a couple former students of mine. They were too dangerous for the world, so I put them in the prison world. That chapter is over with now, though,” he apologized and replied.

He got up with the help from his cane and went over to her, sitting by her. 

“A lot has changed. I know you don’t like all that sugar coating, so there’s no easy way to tell you any of this. Usually, I wouldn’t be so blunt, but with you, you’ve always been different. Damon took the cure with Elena a long time ago. Both of them are gone. I assume they both went to peace, though. And the Mikaelsons are broken in a million ways now. I’ve raised and helped Klaus and Hayley’s daughter, Hope, as much as I can, but everyone gets through grief differently. For Hope, she had to become the tribrid, but unlike Klaus, she turned it off for a while. You know the feeling of losing pretty much everyone at a young age, before you’re ready, so I know you know how she’s probably feeling. There’s just not very much left that I can teach her now,” he informed her.

“What happened with the Mikaelsons?” she inquired. She inwardly was upset over losing Damon, but she could always deal, despite loving him almost as much as she’d always love Elijah.

“Something called The Hollow happened. It went after Hope when she was a little girl, because of how much power she has. Their only option was to put a piece of it inside each of them. But Hope didn’t understand why she had to grow up without her father, so she did a dangerous thing and put it inside herself. When it came time for her first transformation into a wolf, Klaus put it all inside himself. But he couldn’t contain it much longer without becoming dangerous. So he chose an honorable way to go out, like her mother did. Her mother sacrificed her life to save Hope from a vampire that saw cross species the same way that Mikael saw Klaus,” he continued for her.

“I know what The Hollow is. I knew people that encountered it before in past centuries. Luckily, I never needed to come face to face with it,” she informed him. “Is Elijah still around?” she dared to ask him.

“Katherine, the only Mikaelsons still alive are Rebekah, Freya, Kol, and Hope. Unless you count Davina and Marcel that married into the Mikaelson family, as well as Freya’s werewolf partner,” he told her.

She looked at the wall to try and keep composed in front of him. After all, unlike Enzo and Elijah, both whom seemed to be dead now, he'd never seen her in her weak moments. 

""If you need anything, I'm here. And if you need time, you can stay here, but there's no telling if or when we'll get interrupted,"" he assured her, and informed her. 

She finally looked at him, keeping herself as composed as she could. 

“I’ll be okay for now. Besides, if anyone’s going to see me weak, it’s not going to be a bunch of children. And as you recall, I survived my mother’s slaughter. I can try to survive this. And maybe helping Hope will also help myself.”

""You don't have to do this alone anymore, you know,"" he reminded her. 

""I know, but you're not family just yet. I think right now, I just want to spend some time either alone or with a portion of my vampire family."" 

""Hope's not just a vampire. She's also a witch and werewolf. Just try not to make her even more upset than she already is,"" he replied. 

""And I'm descended from Travelers with active magic now,"" she informed him. ""I think I'll be okay around her. I'm not a threat to her,"" she answered him. 

She began to slowly get up, and he helped her do so, and helped her out of the closet, before closing the door. 

""Just don't open up your stitches. Be careful,"" he cautioned her. 

“You don’t need to worry so much. Besides, you look like you’re the one that needs to be careful. What happened to you, anyways?”

“This would be the aftermath of when Hope had her humanity off. I’m lucky that she didn’t kill me. She pretty much put me in a coma for a long time that sent me to limbo. Had to work with someone to come back to the waking world,” he explained.

“You know, you’re human now like me. You need to start staying out of the way, or you’re gonna end up getting yourself killed,” she reminded him.

“What can I say? It’s the hunter in me. I can’t seem to stay on the sidelines,” he commented.

“Well, you need to teach yourself how to do that,” she commented back. Then she headed out of his office. That’s when she saw how much renovation he and Caroline had actually done. She didn’t allow herself to dwell on it too much, though. After all, it had already been multiple places for the Salvatores before it had come to be a school for supernatural children.





When she finally found Hope, she saw her by the dock. That’s when she slowly approached where she stood. And as she did, it seemed that Hope sensed a presence, because she looked over at her.

“Who are you?” 

“Katherine Pierce. I just escaped a prison world a few hours ago. Alaric patched me up. I’m descended from Travelers, but I’m also a former vampire and demon. Alaric caught me up to speed with a few things. I may not show it, but we do share this grief.”

“You knew my dad?” Hope inquired.

“I did. I met Klaus and Elijah in 1492 on your dad’s birthday. Back when Elijah was so hellbent on doing what he was told. Because I’m a doppelgänger which he needed to become the Original hybrid, I was a present to him. I was a naïve girl that thought he was courting me at the time, but then I realized that he didn’t care for me at all. When Elijah and Trevor made me realize what would happen if I stayed, Trevor helped me escape. I turned after, making me useless to him, and it enraged him so much that he slaughtered my entire village. My friends, my mother, my no good drunk of a father, and even my first love. Everyone I knew in my human life was slaughtered. I was quite close to my mother, much like I’m sure you were with your father. That night, when I saw my mother like that, that sweet girl your Uncle Elijah fell in love with died. Your father was a monster towards me. He hunted me for 500 plus years. But you know what? If I can forgive him on my human deathbed, then you can forgive yourself. Just don’t wait 500 plus years to do it.”

“I killed someone I loved, turned someone I care about, and did horrible things. I went too far. I hurt my family. How can I forgive myself for that?” Hope replied.

“With time. And help. I understand that you feel alone. I always felt alone, too. So did your dad. He and I never liked to admit it, but we were alike in many ways after what he did to me. We also both had a daughter that helped us see that we could change for the better. Mine died from a werewolf bite and I had to watch her die before I died, but as a human, being reunited with her, even for just a little while, made me want to do better. Be a better person. Nadia believed that I could change. And I wanted to show that to her. She's not here to see it, but I have changed. The only reason I was a monster last time, was because demons have absolutely no emotions. They can't love or feel the way everyone else does. All they can feel is rage, anger, resentment, and overall, hatred. So, I don't blame everyone for killing me last time. I just wish I wouldn't have had to end up in a prison world,"" she answered her. ""One of the first steps of getting over this is to seek a friend or family that feels the same as you do. I never loved your father, but I loved your Uncle Elijah. I still love him. Just as I'll always love Damon Salvatore and Enzo. They were the special ones out of everyone else I loved throughout the centuries. I will miss your father. I do miss him. And I miss your mother, despite never seeing eye to eye with her when she was a werewolf here in town. My whole family is gone, and my vampire family is almost all gone, but when I met your mother, and I found out that she never had a real home...I wanted to help her, so I told her where to look for the remnants of her family. Then I got news later on from Sophie that your mother was pregnant with you. I never wanted anyone to have to lose family just as I lost mine. So much so that I guided your Aunt Freya centuries ago as to how to locate her family. I always allowed people to see the vampire bitch, but Elijah always saw what was left of the goodness I had. And I will always love him for that. He was also my protector, and even saved me time and time again when I was a young, foolish vampire. Your family will always mean a lot to me."" After telling her all of that, she asked her, ""Do you know why your dad felt alone for 1,000 years?"" 

""Because he was the only one of his kind?"" the tribrid guessed. 

""Partly,"" she answered her. ""Your dad was so busy making himself be feared and manipulating everyone around him to make many friends. Your grandfather, Mikael, taught him nothing but fear and hatred, and not to show weakness. And because he was betrayed many times, he became paranoid. Much worst than myself. I was only paranoid because I was being hunted by your father, and even as a human, I have a million or so of enemies still. But you don't need to feel alone. I know what it's like to have turned it off for a while. I also know the feeling of losing people you care about when you're too young. You weren't ready. Neither was I. I don't think anyone is ever truly ready for losing the people they care about, but losing them when you're young...I think that's even worst. But don't make the same mistakes as your father, your family, or myself have done. I did horrible things myself to survive. Worst things when I had it off, before a stranger came to me and helped me turn it back on, and deal with what happened to my mother. Her name was Pearl. She had a daughter, too. They both helped me, really. It sucks, I know, being the only one of your kind. Your dad knew what that was like. You're his daughter, but you don't have to be like him. Your parents sacrificed themselves for you. As much as we both hate that, it was for you to make your family name better. The cycle that's been going on for a thousand years with your family, and even the cycle I started as a vampire, has to end. Things need to change. And I think they can."" 

""It still hurts, though,"" she admitted. ""I never even got to know him as well as you seem to. I want to talk to him in limbo, but I don't know if he ever found peace. And it's so huge, nobody else even knows there,"" she added.

""If you feel like talking to him would make you feel better, then I can help with that. Now that my magic is active, I can do things that I have knowledge of over my centuries as a vampire. Without anyone dying, and without using Dark magic, I can summon his ghost. But it would have to be away from this school. Alaric hates Klaus for obvious reasons, but also reasons that you're probably not even aware of. If he knew we were summoning his ghost to talk to him, he'd be furious. But, I'm sure you're at least a little like your father, which would make you a little like me. I never liked playing by the rules. Not even my own father's the first time I was a human,"" she informed her. ""But then again, my father was a huge drunk and abusive, so his rules weren't to be followed. Your dad and I had more in common than we liked to admit.""

Hope thought for a few moments, before questioning, ""What do I have to do?"" 

""Just follow me to the woods. Another reason for this is just in case things get out of hand. I've never liked children getting hurt, unlike your father that had a nasty habit of threatening children. I prefer a safe place, away from anyone that could get hurt.""

Hope followed her, and when they were walking through the woods, she questioned her, ""What if I can't do this without him? Could you help me bring him back?""

""Even if I could, there'd be bigger consequences than you could imagine. Believe me, I would if there was a safe way to do it, but I don't think there's a safe way to bring back your father. It's not like I'm bringing back a vampire or a human. I'd be bringing back a hybrid. And I've seen too much consequences when someone brings even a human back to life. Back when I was a vampire, there were a lot of people of all kinds of species coming back from the dead. And Alaric was more consequences than anything. He used to wear an old ring that helped him cheat death, but eventually, he died and came back way too many times. It gave him an alter ego. And this alter ego was setting everyone up in his life to take the fall of a whole lot of killings. And if Stefan Salvatore and my doppelganger hadn't shown up when they did, Meredith Fell would've been one of those killings. But one of the most prominent killings that his alter ego did was Caroline's father. He wasn't the greatest person, but at least he looked out for his family when he was given the chance. When I was a vampire, this time was soaked in bloodshed. I believe it all started in 1864. Back then, there were more council members than there were when my doppelganger was a human the first time around. They called vampires demons back then, and they were so hellbent on killing every vampire they found that I had to fake my death. But I was able to make sure that Pearl ended up below the church, in that tomb. All I could do though, was to make sure she didn't fully desiccate to death before she was found. They were rounding up every vampire they could back then, and burning them in the church. Since then, this town has had nothing but tragedy. This town has had nothing but bloodshed, but I'd like to try and change that. I'm only human, but I can help Alaric and the rest of you so that others will hopefully not get themselves killed,"" she explained to her.

""So bringing anyone back from the dead is impossible then,"" Hope assumed. 

""Yes. I wish it was possible. I'd love to have your Uncle Elijah and your dad back. Or even Damon, for that matter. But I won't risk the consequences I would've risked when I was a vampire. If I had the choice, I would've died for Elijah and Damon both, and if I had been here, I would've done everything in my power to find another way so that he didn't have to sacrifice himself. But, as I've learned, dwelling on the past doesn't help you move forward, so I'm trying to move forward. I know if your Uncle Elijah and Damon were here, they'd want me to move on, and try to be as happy as I can be. And helping you guys would be an honor to the Salvatore name, and helping you with anything you need, is something I can do to honor your father and Elijah. I lived to survive, but I also lived to be Elijah's anchor, just as he was mine,"" she replied. 

""Maybe when this is over with, you can share some more with me. You seem to know pretty much everyone, both alive and dead,"" Hope suggested to her. 

""Yes. I'd like that. It might help myself. I keep up the strong front, but death of people I care about, I've never been the best at coping with,"" Kat admitted to her. ""And Alaric knows this. I told my doppelganger a portion of it when she was human the first time around, back when your father was the big bad in town, and she told everyone in her circle pretty much. Alaric was one of them."" 

""So, why does he hate my dad so much?"" Hope wanted to know. 

""Your father murdered, at the time, my doppelganger's aunt that he was dating back then. Your father also hijacked Alaric's body so that he wouldn't be noticed. There are a million and more things your father did to people, but one of the things that could never be excused was hijacking someone's body. And I understand that. Nobody would want that. Being there, but unable to stop your body, because someone else is in control. That was a new low. He's hated your father for so long, and I don't think Alaric will ever be able to forgive him for everything that he did. But forgiveness takes time. Sometimes a lot of time. If we're lucky, he'll eventually forgive him,"" she answered her, and explained. 

""He changed a lot then. He wasn't exactly like that before he sacrificed himself. He had his moments, but overall, he was more kind and understanding. And I learned that I share his talents. And, when I had it turned off, I realized I have the tendency of acting just like him on his bad days.""

""Yes, well, we'll just have to tame that part of you. I can't show you anything vampire anymore, but I can still teach. Teaching has always been my strength. Although I wasn't there, because I couldn't be, when Damon and Stefan turned, I taught Damon everything when he was still a human. I made him in my image, and it helped him thrive,"" she informed her. 





A few weeks after Hope had been able to talk with her dad again with Kat's help, everything seemed to be getting better. With Hope, at least. Katherine was still rustling with her own feelings, but she'd at least learned to control her magic, even during her emotional moments. So, things were turning up, even if they weren't exactly with Katherine. But they were slowly getting better with Katherine, since she had Alaric for help. Out of everyone at the school, he was the only one that understood the most what she was going through. And so, eventually, due to both of them feeling the way they did, they began to start having a thing. And eventually, it helped Katherine get better with how she felt. "

Windows 10, Version 16.

I'm currently in the process of making a bunch of 'bank' slides for my colleagues and I to use when creating learning slides for our students.

Currently, I've worked the quickest way to be to have a bank of words/numbers from ChatGPT with the correct spacing required and to copy and paste into each slide. (See screenshot below).

The slides are incredibly basic (by design to reduce cognitive load on students) and have simple animations to reveal the digits. Each number has its own text box to assist in copy and pasting and format issues.

**Prologue**

  
Katherine stood inside a church and watched, as Bonnie lit the last candle in front of her. Then Katherine approached the descendant of one of her dearest witch friends.

Bonnie looked at her, as the doppelganger former vampiress approached. Then they stood in front of each other.

""I'm ready,"" Katherine told her. Then she put hands on her arms to pass through. When she did though, she ended up somewhere else. She didn't know where she was though, because everything around her was black. She felt like she was in a black void, all alone.





What felt like an eternity later, Katherine found herself standing in the middle of a road. It seemed to be Mystic Falls, but she didn't see anyone. Then, deciding to figure out where the hell she'd ended up at, she began walking. Then, seeing the high school with one of its front doors open, she approached, being cautious, and then began to walk through the hallways. That's when she suddenly got pinned against a wall, coming face to face with a legend that she only knew by name and his story.

""Well, who do we have here?"" he greeted with a smile, though she knew he wasn't being polite.

""Why don't you let me go and you'll find out who exactly I am,"" she threatened, not wanting to end up like all of his other victims she knew of. That, and she knew he was the enemy, having heard of his story, and she never liked to show weakness in front of enemies.

""I have a better idea. I think I'm gonna enjoy this,"" he replied, smiling again, before she saw two species. She saw that one was a werewolf and the other was a vampiress. She wasn't an old vampire though, she could tell. ""You see them?"" he added. ""Alaric sent them here for punishment. We've been looking for a way out. Now, what do you say you help us find that doorway to leave?""

""I'd have to say no,"" she answered him, before giving it all she had, kicking him away from her. Then she fled like her life depended on it. And it did. The werewolf looked to be too far gone and the vampiress hadn't shown any emotion, so she could only assume that she'd turned her humanity off. She couldn't outrun a vampire, she knew, but she could outrun at least this werewolf.

  
**Ch.1: The Rescue**

  
Katherine didn't know how many days, weeks, months, or maybe even years she'd been stuck in this prison world. She hadn't been able to track her time in the prison world, having to always run or hide or both. She'd been able to find an ascendant, but knew she couldn't get herself out of the prison world. Not by herself. Especially, with three different species that were chasing after her, treating her like prey. She'd learned after a while that Kai wasn't just a Gemini witch. He'd been turned into a vampire before he'd been killed a long time ago. The werewolf and vampire she could care less to find more about.





It was a nebulous night, as Kai pinned her against a wall inside the boarding house. She tried to fight to stop the dagger of his from stabbing her, but she knew he was stronger than she was. It was a little surprising though, since he was supposed to be a vampire, that he'd rather injure her the way a human would.

As she tried to stop him, starting to twist his wrist, she felt it going in, and she tried to get him away from her, needing to now get herself taken care of. Sometimes, for her, being human sucked. She couldn't fight him and win.





Damon had just ended up in what appeared to be a prison world, having saved the town by sacrificing himself, only to smell the very familiar scent of blood, which was mixed with the scent of both Katherine and Kai. Knowing this made him realize that Kai had hurt her, which was something Damon didn't care for. So, he followed the scents quickly, which brought him to the scene. Then, without hesitation, he blurred behind him and snapped his neck, before looking at his human again sire.

He knelt in front of her, seeing that she was already losing a lot of blood from the wound, with or without the dagger in her leg. A gash was also on her side from the struggle.

""Damon?"" she inquired, as she sat against the wall on the floor. She was surprised to see him, but was also thankful for the assistance.

""It's me. Don't worry. You're gonna be okay,"" he assured her.

""What about that vampire and werewolf?"" she inquired.

""Don't worry about them,"" he replied. ""Let's just get you out of here. Any idea how?""

""I have the ascendant. I just couldn't leave without someone tagging along, and it wasn't going to be the three of them,"" she replied.

""Then you're in luck, considering I'm here now. Let's go,"" he replied.

She began feeling weak, which she knew was from the blood loss, and everything began to go gray.

He could see her starting to go under, as he slid an arm behind her, gently pulling her close, and slid an arm under her legs, getting to his feet with her. Then he headed for the hospital. After Elena's years of being a nurse before she'd died of old age, he knew what to do.





About half an hour later, he gently layed her down on a table in one of the empty hospital rooms. Then he got what he needed, before tending to her wounds.





Katherine didn't know how long she'd been out, but when she woke up, she was taken care of and in the hospital. She could tell that they were still in the prison world, though.

She slowly sat up in bed and gave a smile.

""Thanks.""

""Well, no one deserves anything that Kai does to people. Not even you. Now, what do you say we get the hell out of this prison world?"" he replied.

""I'd love that. Let's go,"" she replied with a smile.

He helped her get up. Then they left the hospital to leave the prison world together.

  
**Ch.2: Home**

  
After a while of figuring it out, they finally found out how to leave the prison world, so they put the ascendant together during a blood red moon. However, they were found by the three of them. Then there was a fight between them. Damon was able to decapitate Kai like he had years ago. Then he tossed the wolf against a tree with a few broken bones, before snapping the vampire's neck. He then blurred over to Kat whom was on the ground, having been attacked by the wolf and vampire, and gently pulled her into his arms. Then he took out the ascendant again. Then, in the next moment, they were home in Mystic Falls.

Damon got to his feet with her, before briskly heading towards the closest place they were at. The Salvatore school. She was pretty injured, this time accompanied with having been bitten, so he knew that he couldn't save her in time, but at least one of the students there could. He never really liked any Mikaelsons, but he'd learned over the years to trust Hope. She always seemed to be able to save people. And that's what Katherine needed right now. Damon didn't care at the moment what Ric would think about this. He could talk to him later about the situation.





When Damon entered the Salvatore school, most students seemed to be in their dorm rooms or out and about, because he only saw a few of them. Since he pretty much knew the students there, he knew which rooms were occupied, so it didn't take long for him to find an unoccupied room to lay Katherine down on a bed in. Then, since he didn't want anything to happen to her while he was looking for Hope, he was in luck when he saw someone familiar passing by.

""Josie, wait,"" he called to her, making her stop and turn to look at him. ""I kinda have a witch problem I need help with. Don't ask any questions right now, but can you just watch Katherine in there while I go find Hope?""

""Sure,"" she replied, going to the room he gestured to, though she wasn't sure who Katherine was. The name sounded familiar, though.

""Thanks,"" Damon replied, before going in search of Hope.





After Damon found Hope and brought her to Katherine after explaining everything, Josie left the room. Hope then magically healed her, which Damon thanked her for, before she left.

Damon sat on her bedside, waiting for her to come to, a hand on the side of her face.

""Katherine, can you hear me?"" he called, hoping she'd wake up soon.





When she woke up, she didn't know how long that she'd been out, but she saw Damon on her bedside in a room. It was a little familiar, but at the same time not familiar to her. She wasn't exactly sure where she was, but she knew that she was safe as long as Damon was there.

She slowly sat up.

""Where are we?"" she questioned.

""The boarding school. Ric and Caroline had it renovated into a school for supernatural kids that need help. This room used to be mine, but I moved out a long time ago. It wouldn't be fair to them to be teaching their kids my bad habits. Now, shall we go home?"" he replied, assuming she was okay enough now that they could go home to where his house was.

She gave a smile.

""Let's go.""

Damon helped her up. Then they headed for his place.





About a month later, after everything they'd been through together, they fell back in love. So, in the end, they got back together for good."

# Why I chose to learn to code?

“When I was in high school, I was in an International Baccalaureate program, and one of the electives offered was computer science. Up until then, I’d never heard of programming. They made me go sit in for one of the classes as a sophomore, because the elective started in junior year. The teacher was teaching Java, and I was like, *Ah, this is pretty cool*. I signed up for the elective. Unfortunately for me, that summer I got a call from the principal of the school telling me that they couldn’t register me for the computer science class, because not enough students had signed up for it. I later found out that I was the only one that signed up.

That said, I actually wanted to learn programming. I liked airplanes and the concept of flight. I took a physics course in high school, and I realized I was kind of good at it. My teacher told me, ‘You know, rockets and airplanes have a lot to do with programming, especially the embedded systems. All of these computer chips are programmed with languages.’”

# How I made time to learn?

“Being incredibly curious, when I was 15 years old, I picked up a book on C++ called *Sams Teach Yourself C++ in 24 Hours*. I basically started studying and just tried to the best of my abilities to teach myself C++, of all languages. The very first thing I did when I learned C++ was design calculators for physics that could calculate kinetic energy, just to practice programming. I liked it, so I just kept going and going. When I was a little older, I discovered Arduino and started playing with it, and continued to program.

I am a self-taught programmer, mostly from reading books and watching tutorials. In college, I majored in mechanical engineering with the intent of working for the aerospace industry. My focus was the field of computational fluid dynamics, which is basically the application of math and computer science in mechanical engineering.”

# What got me interested in the job

“I have 17 years of teaching experience — basically any job I’ve had my entire life has been in education. My first job out of school, I ran the outreach program at my university for teachers trying to learn coding. I was teaching the teachers how to code. I used to be a robotics teacher at a school on the Upper West Side, and I coached the robotics teams, both FLL and FTC. And I also gave courses in computer programming, basic mechatronics, and electronic design.

In 2017, I taught a summer program for middle schoolers on basic programming at the Harlem Educational Activities Fund, and in the very last week, we used Codecademy. Codecademy has the lesson plan already laid out for you, and everything is right there prepared for you in the learning environment to start coding. The students would basically go through the tutorials, and I was just there to help out and guide them if they got stuck. Mind you, these students were 12 years old, so naturally a lot of questions can arise.

Programming is a nice thing to know, not only just for the coding part, but just to teach you how to think. At that age, learning to code and computational thinking is more of a brain exercise than a career move. I like to see someone who didn’t know anything about this subject suddenly develop the interest that I did when I was a child. That’s probably the most rewarding part.”

# Here’s what you need to get started

“I learned how to program in 2004, a year before YouTube came out, so all I had was books. Now there are way more resources, like Codecademy and YouTube — there’s just a wealth of information on the internet. With [AI](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/can-chatgpt-ai-teach-you-to-code/?utm_source=ccblog&utm_medium=ccblog&utm_campaign=sept23_bts&utm_content=ls_hisham), now you don’t even need a book. If you get stuck, you can just ask a robot.

Programming is 20% knowing the syntax and 80% knowing how to think. There are patterns, algorithms, data structures, and all these conceptual ideas that you have to absorb to make programs and apps. Programming languages are how you implement those ideas.”

# My advice for students learning how to code

“Revisit why you want to learn how to code. Say you’re someone who really likes video games and is very curious how they work. Perhaps your school doesn’t have a programming curriculum that focuses on game development? You may want to look at more coding courses that will guide you more towards programming video games, for example, in Python you have Pygame. Look back and remember why you started, and if you’re deviating from that, get yourself back on track.”

i’m a poc who’s bilingual in korean and english. but people downplay it all the fucking time.  the ones who believe me about being fluent in english downplay my korean ability and the ones who know i’m a native korean speaker don’t believe me when i say i can speak english in the same level. heck i had a white roommate who had the audacity to claim I had “language issues” even after having several conversations with me in english. reality was that i had no problem communicating with him but i was stammering because his behavior intimidated me. he just chalked all of that as me being bad at english. he would’ve never done that to a white student. 

i was using chatgpt as a crutch to learn how to code a full stack website. i was setting up a korean font (my intended audience for this site are predominantly korean speaking koreans). it said i need to find english-friendly fonts. my priority is to make sure the korean is working well because i need to serve my intended audience. plus most korean fonts support english characters (but i’ve never seen an primarily english font support korean characters). chatgpt only said i need to find english-friendly backups and said nothing about korean-friendly backups until i explicitly asked for one. i tried to hold it accountable but it dodged me like a white person would in reality. i’m outraged by its shameless english supremacy. i need ai as a crutch to teach myself how to code but this is fucking outrageous. i didn’t pay for chatgpt pro to get micoraggressed at. i looked into korean LLMs as well but they’re not as helpful as the english medium ones because english LLMs have access to a much larger dataset to train on. 

a white person would be treated like a superstar if they were bilingual in korean and english the way I am. i'm proud and happy to be fully bilingual in two unrelated languages. but apparently it means nothing if the speaker is poc. it’s fucked. i'm fuming. "

I'm finding and summarising interesting AI research papers everyday so you don't have to trawl through them all. Today's paper is titled ""ChatGPT-Assisted Visualization of Atomic Orbitals: Understanding Symmetry, Mixed State, and Superposition"" by Liang Wu.

This paper addresses the conceptual challenges undergraduate students face when transitioning from solving basic Schrödinger equations to understanding the physical implications of their solutions, specifically concerning the symmetry and shapes of atomic orbitals in quantum mechanics. By utilizing AI, particularly ChatGPT, the author explores how visualizations can aid in comprehending why certain orbitals exhibit specific symmetries or asymmetries, a topic often perplexing to students learning quantum mechanics.

Key points from the paper include:

1. **Symmetry and Orbital Shapes**: The paper elucidates why only 's' orbitals exhibit spherical symmetry while 'p' orbitals take on a dumbbell shape, despite the spherically symmetric potential energy functions involved.

2. **Role of AI in Education**: AI tools like ChatGPT can significantly enhance teaching by dynamically illustrating complex abstract concepts, providing an innovative avenue for engaging students in difficult subjects like quantum mechanics.

3. **Visualization Techniques**: The research demonstrates how ChatGPT can generate Python scripts to create orbital visualizations, allowing students to explore and understand the 3D structures of orbitals, offering deeper insights into their symmetrical properties and their ramifications.

4. **Mixed States and Superposition**: Through analogies and mathematical proofs, it clarifies the nature of mixed states and superposition in quantum mechanics, reaffirming that while individual orbitals are not spherically symmetric, a mixed state comprising them is.

1ffj24h,44,2024-09-12,I got my first A in a long time…and I feel amazing.,u/g4vnn,CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1ffj24h/i_got_my_first_a_in_a_long_timeand_i_feel_amazing/,"Little bit about me, 22M, college student and have been attending for four years, since 2020 actually. The reason I haven’t graduated is simple: I couldn’t focus in class and barely passed. It seems like for the past 3-4 years, I was stuck in my ways and not making efforts to get out, even with my amazing partner beside me.

This year though, school has been different. Think about it, I mean, 18 years old, barely knew myself and my habits, years have passed, money wasted, FAFSA wasted, BUT—I feel like I’ve found my footing.

For years, my grades have been below average, I also rarely studied so the 70s and 60s I’d get just made sense, and yeah I passed some classes, but they’d always be with average grades.

Now that I’m 22, life is totally different, I lost family, got closer to my beautiful girlfriend, understand myself more. I’ve been taking school with a new found fire and I know why.

Breifly, I went to the UK with my gf and expected two weeks of bliss, and in these moments—I really thought to myself, I can have this life if I work hard. And yes, it took me years and yes I get that it’s taken so long but I’m just proud of myself for even trying.

So, the premise. Since this year has started, I’ve implemented massive changes to my life, I made a vision board, I got my Notion set up, I use Reminders and Calednar way more, and I just generally am more organized with my thinking. So, I’m taking calculus 1 and I decided to really study…like REALLY!!! I used ChatGPT for explaining mathematical concepts i learned in class, I would go to tutoring sessions and fully do the reviews. And then, the exam day followed. During, I was nervous, and felt like I was going to get a bad grade, but i still worked hard.

Boom, I got an 82. Oh. Good? I guess? 

I was proud of myself!! But I thought I studied harder, better. Needless to say, my teacher updated my grade as there was a grading error, the 82 was actually a 92. I ONLY MISSED ONE WUESTION. I WAS SO HAPPY ALLLLL DAY!!! I finally proved to myself I didn’t need medication (I have ADHD, yes genuinely diagnosed) to focus or study, I’m not a loser, etc (things I’d tell myself).

I’m strong, I’m smart and capable!! So with this passion, I left the class happy. My reality is rough but making small steps always pays off, here’s to Exam 2 🙂

Anyone else had experiences like mine? This feels like a LIFE turning point for me (you don’t know how badly i struggled with school and my self talk, but lately, IM THE GOAT!!)"

I am a little disappointed, but I hope I can take some related courses to improve my ability in this area, but I don't know how to start, can you give me some advice?
I hope to learn some courses to evaluate the output of AI, similar to evaluating NLP? I don't know. Since I'm not good at programming, I don't involve programming as much as possible.
Is there a name for the work of teaching and evaluating the output of CHATGPT? Or does the work of data annotation count?Thank you very much."

1ffllns,9,2024-09-12,"OpenAI’s new “reasoning” AI models are here: o1-preview and o1-mini
",u/These-Salary-9215,ArtificialInteligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1ffllns/openais_new_reasoning_ai_models_are_here/,"OpenAI finally unveiled its rumored ""Strawberry"" AI language model on Thursday, claiming significant improvements in what it calls ""reasoning"" and problem-solving capabilities over previous large language models (LLMs). Formally named ""[OpenAI o1](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/),"" the model family will initially launch in two forms, [o1-preview](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/) and [o1-mini](https://openai.com/index/openai-o1-mini-advancing-cost-efficient-reasoning/), available today for ChatGPT Plus and certain API users.

  
OpenAI claims that o1-preview outperforms its predecessor, [GPT-4o](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/), on multiple benchmarks, including competitive programming, mathematics, and ""scientific reasoning."" However, people who have used the model say it does not yet outclass GPT-4o in every metric. Other users have [criticized](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/new-details-on-openais-strawberry-apples-siri-makeover-larry-ellison-doubles-down-on-data-centers) the delay in receiving a response from the model, owing to the multi-step processing occurring behind the scenes before answering a query.

In a rare display of public hype-busting, OpenAI product manager Joanne Jang [tweeted](https://x.com/joannejang/status/1834286774140498368), ""There's a lot of o1 hype on my feed, so I'm worried that it might be setting the wrong expectations. what o1 is: the first reasoning model that shines in really hard tasks, and it'll only get better. (I'm personally psyched about the model's potential & trajectory!) what o1 isn't (yet!): a miracle model that does everything better than previous models. you might be disappointed if this is your expectation for today's launch—but we're working to get there!""

OpenAI reports that o1-preview ranked in the 89th percentile on competitive programming questions from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/contests/). In mathematics, it scored 83 percent on a qualifying exam for the International Mathematics Olympiad, compared to GPT-4o's 13 percent. OpenAI also states, in a claim that may later be challenged as people scrutinize the benchmarks and run their own evaluations over time, o1 [performs comparably to PhD students](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/) on specific tasks in physics, chemistry, and biology. The smaller o1-mini model is designed specifically for coding tasks and is priced at 80 percent less than o1-preview."
1fflpqa,2,2024-09-12,Hi community ,u/Master_Baiter11,AutisticWithADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticWithADHD/comments/1fflpqa/hi_community/,"Hi everyone,

This is the first time I'm reaching out to a community. I’ve been reaching new heights of overwhelm lately and I’m hoping to get some support or advice. I have a very hard time taking care of my responsibilities in a way that I am satisfied with and it does seem like it cannot go on like this anymore. I've been dealing with anxiety and shame and always have been judgemental of who I am as a person. I have a hard time believing and accepting myself as neurodivergent. 

I'm 27 years old and always suspected that I have adhd but only last year started taking medication. Ritalin does slow things down and the first time I took it I was in tears. For the first time in my life I had to kind of, somehow, reach for thoughts instead of being in the usual frantic head-space. The quiet was blissful. At the same time, stimulant medication on its own does not cut it, especially if you never learned a system for being productive that works for you. I often end up focusing on things that aim to distract from work and the unpleasant feelings surrounding it, since I both never learned a system that works for me and anxiety gets overwhelming and with it the paralysis only strengthens. Childhood experience burdens me with extra hurdles when it comes to work that is hard for adhd people, work that needs sustained attention and foresight. I spend hours trying to work, getting no sleep and having nothing to show for it, while being beyond exhausted. 

Though I did get a paper with an adhd diagnosis, the practitioner I saw didn't really thoroughly examine me, she simply asked me a couple of standard questions and kind of just took my word for it. It even seemed like she just wanted to prescribe just antidepressants initially. In the past, when I was a kid, I was tested for adhd (almost 20 years ago now) and my parents were told that everything was okay, since my attention didn't seem to be impaired when I was doing the tasks I was assigned by the doctors. Maybe back then information and the idea even professionals had about adhd was kind of feeble at best, since nowadays I would say more people understand that being able to focus on some things and not others is very much part of this executive function disorder. Be that as it may, getting a diagnosis the way I did, despite having lived a life that screams neurodivergence, did not help with my doubt and my self blame.

When it comes to work, I’m responsible for preparing and delivering lessons, but I’m struggling to keep up with the demands. I often find myself up late, trying to get things done, but instead of being productive, I end up scrolling on my phone and feeling paralyzed by anxiety. I spend time supposedly trying to work, I end up being exhausted and having little to nothing to show for it.

Having always been different when it comes to socialising I also have a hard time with some of my classes when it comes to behavioral management.  The environment also does not favor me, I have sensitivity to sound and auditory processing issues which practically makes it impossible to understand what any one student that is supposed to be talking is saying when the class is even moderately noisy. On top of that I'm teaching English as a second language which makes communication difficult in the first place. Therefore, I need a quiet classroom. A respectful classroom, and not all of my classrooms are like that. It's not easy for me to take control in some of my classrooms since I can be timid in nature and find trying to impose myself sometimes intimidating (it's often). The way for me to be assertive in those classrooms would be to lean into my anger but I don't want to be that person. I understand that fear can get you respect, or facilitate a path to respect I guess (this is my second year of teaching and there have been instances were I did let my anger show, more like couldn't hold it back, but even those were instances of bullying, not me attempting to control with fear, but still the effect was palpable on the overall behavior), but again I don't want to be that person and maybe actually I can't. Maybe I can't get mad for poor classroom etiquette. Damn if I don't know what it's like to be a student that would rather be doing something else. I believe that personally my years of primary and secondary education offered me nothing. I never could engage. 

 When it comes to socialising, I never felt like I fit in to any group and just overall had and have a difficult time with social interactions. Never really know what it is I'm supposed to be doing, how I'm supposed to be responding, when I'm supposed to be talking. I play out interactions I'm about to have in my mind, thinking of possible things I can say. Often going with those pre selected options even when it feels forced. 
In group settings all of that is multiplied tenfold. I've no idea what's going on, I have a hard time following and can't join in at all, I cannot speak unless I am spoken to and even then it does not work out for me. My nervous system is active like I'm facing a life or death situation. Often, depending on setting, I can get paranoid about people trying to attack me, do me in somehow. 
 I've always had social anxiety that can reach extreme heights depending on setting and at the same time, throughout my life, I've been trying to make socialising in a group, work for me. I always found myself to be lacking, not being able to hang out like other people do. Socialise like other people socialise. 
Only recently I've started to realise that there is a very good chance that I never was one for that kind of thing (and it's true, well before becoming a teenager I knew I was the odd one out in say family gatherings for example), and that, way more it was about how I was made to feel for not enjoying social settings or not wanting to participate.
Luckily, I am capable of great social connection (usually comes in the form of romantic relationships) 

There’s a lot of shame and self-blame from my past. Growing up, I was made to feel like the cause of my family's suffering. Struggling to even engage with schoolwork I was abused physically and emotionally on the daily, forced to do something my head refused to do, even with all the pressure. Screaming matches that the whole neighborhood could hear practically every day, beatings and permanently being deprived from gaming which was something that I loved doing. That was my mother. My father was a silent presence that seemed to always be judging and always finding me lacking. I was terrified of him. I always made myself as small as possible when he was around. He could erupt at any given moment. He made me feel ashamed for who I was. He stopped raising hands on me much sooner than my mother did, but he was still the scary one by far. 
Both my parents are wonderful people that truly do love me. I've had many years as an adult to talk with them and understand better. They were doing their best. They had emotional regulation issues (surprise, surprise). No matter how twisted it got, I don't even have to resort to the fact (please don't crucify me) of how, you know, though we do make choices we don't actually have the free will people like to believe they have (and I know that being neurodivergent pushed me on a path to discover that truth, since my actions and emotions always seemed way out of my control - they actually were in more than one ways - so I'm curious if in the neurodivergent community people have an easier time getting on the path of researching and accepting that idea) and that it was a case of people screwing up a relationship they really care for, people hurting someone they love, because they can't control their own feelings.

There was never any space for my needs, my feelings, no space for me to understand anything about who I actually am. Not only were my feelings and needs not validated but actively shut down, ridiculed. I adopted the idea that I am the problem. My inner dialogue to this day is full of shame and disgust and disapproval for my behavior, who I am, and the perceived perceptions the people around me have for me. What's more, being different in social situations because of my neurodivergence triggers these unhealthy thought patterns so easily. 

I have a hard time believing that my struggles are valid. I watch Instagram reels on Neurodivergence that I feel too ashamed to like, because I feel like I'll be judged for believing that I have adhd or autism. I want to be understood and seen for what I’m going through, but I often struggle to believe it myself or even acknowledge my neurodivergence. I want to make the room for me to be my true self. I want to experience what it's like to be able to fully lean in my ""strangeness"", to let it freely unfold in all its bazillion aspects. I used to think I was different but was made to feel broken. And that's how I feel to this day. Like I'm not trying hard enough. Like I'm being dramatic and in reality I'm just lazy. Like I'm just wrong. 

I talk with chatgpt and have a list of all my neurodivergent traits. I've lived a life that has been filled to the brim with struggle and suffering (and at the same time extreme pleasure - very much a hedonistic being). I have a list of traits which fall under the neurodivergent scope both adhd and autistic. I don't know how to make myself believe it. How to feel understood by me. 

I'm open to any and all pieces of advice. Maybe very obvious advice would be to get tested and get officially certified but I don't know that I can afford that atm and I live in a country where people don't speak English, idk if that's an actual obstacle since I imagine you can do this sort of thing online but guess who don't manage his finances wisely. 
Also I am very much aware of the benefits of meditation and mindfulness. Ultimately there lies the game and meaning of this life imnsho, but pruning and caring for the ego is also part of it. Of course the more one can stay aware, the easier it is to handle emotions, manage behaviors and untangling the ego but yeah, awareness of awareness is no mean feat.

Thank you for taking the time. 
Sorry if this is convoluted and all over the place, but I just remembered I've not even taken my meds yet ayyyy

1ffnpay,3,2024-09-13,Fine Tuning or Better prompting? ,u/gentrobot,OpenAI,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1ffnpay/fine_tuning_or_better_prompting/,"I’m using OpenAI API GPT-4o to generate step by step roadmaps for learning. I’m primarily focussed on creating learning roadmaps for curriculums (e.g. School students of a class from a specific education board). The process is:
1. Get the entire syllabus as provide it as a context
2. With each section of the syllabus, duration of study and exam marks weightage is there
3. Based on that roadmaps are created which are personalised to each user with some user inputs

To begin with, I first manually did it with ChatGPT to understand more control variables and feedback to arrive at a better prompt. It now works (most of the time).

Now, I am thinking of extending it to other curriculums (e.g. college education or backend development). So far, the results have not been great. To improve the results, should I try fine-tuning? Wouldn’t fine-tuning mean that it will only work for similar data (e.g. fine tuning on data for Nodejs, might help in Roadmap generation for Backend Development, not so much on Digital Marketing)

How do I go about creating a general purpose roadmap generation for learning? Is Prompt Engineering the only tool available to me?"
1ffoj1b,3,2024-09-13,Opinion on the new models:,u/KeepCalmNGoLong,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1ffoj1b/opinion_on_the_new_models/,"They're great. For corporations seeking to leverage AI, elementary school students (and high school students at religion-themed learning institutions), and citizens of Communist China.

Not so great for adults looking to use ChatGPT for anything other than work.

I haven't \*really\* tried any actual ""jailbreaking"", yet - just logical (legit) rationalizations included with prompts - but it takes an unreasonable amount of effort just to get it to include a single obscenity in a 500 word chunk of content.

Kudos to the red team and all, but just because a thing can be done, doesn't mean it should be done. I feel like in the future, this is the version of ""AI"" that the general population is going to be stuck with.

As far as it being more capable (of anything beyond finding ways to stay dead-center between the safety guardrails), I'm not seeing it. I haven't tried coding, but the quality of writing fictional content is the same, the quality and content of stock/financial analysis and info is the same... 

And, speaking of fiction writing; there's no way this thing would ever even create a \*paragraph\* in the style or tone of the content I've been working on with GPT-4o. Let alone create any of the actual content/events that take place in the story. Which is fictional, not smut, not gore, not illegal, and is completely legit and acceptable in every regard. I haven't tried, but I can see already that I'm going to get ""I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that,"" as soon as soon as I give it so much as the overview of the story.

30 mins of messing with it, and I know I won't be using it for anything other than a substitute for Googling things. And even then, I'd better not ask it about horror movie suggestions, if they're rated R. Best I'll get is a M. Night Shyamalan flick."

I’m a CS student trying to learn a thing or two about the topic most companies are doubling down on nowadays. 
I’ve found provider documentation about services like Google Gemini or Juniper Mist but I’d like to hear about the hands-on experience with AI or AI-augmented tools of current network engineers.
What are the names of those tools you use? How do they help in your work? What are the problems you have with them? Can one learn them prior to being employed by a company that uses them?
Thanks in advance to anyone who provides insights."

…

Another difference is that, while the Catholic church, in Haiti’s history, has been supported economically by the state. Vodou has enjoyed no such privilege. Further, it maintains no theological or ecumenical centers for the training of its clerics, no formal religious communities, no presses, no editorial staff, and no publications. Nor is there even any formal creed: unlike the content of Roman Catholic theology, that of Vodou varies from one locality to another; it is not unusual to find that within an area of one square mile, two *ounfos* (temples) maintain differing myths and rituals regarding divergent pantheons of lwas. Moreover, unlike Catholics, and similar to the devotees of African traditional religions, Vodouisants’ names are not listed in the membership roll of a local temple. Their worldview does not allow them to consider religion as a formal organization with a list of members with whom they may or may not identity. Their religion is a way of life. Vodouisants’ worldview is constructed from certain factual observations of their environment which they hold to be self-evident. Their subjective apprehension of these observations rests upon the immediate understanding that all phenomena are manifestations of supernatural, and yet observable, powers. These powers have two natures. First, they are manifestations of the complex persona of the Godhead (*Bondye*), the creator of the universe. Bondye is beyond the individual’s scrutiny and transcends the objective world. The phenomenal world is a posteriori to numerous incommensurable deities whose characteristics and mythological attributes render them ineffable and awesome. Second, Vodouisants conceive of these deities also as immanent; they believe that all existent things in the world are manifestations of these deities, and that their power is forever active in their devotees’ lives.

The concept of *belief* in Haiti does not have the same connotation that it does in English (Deren 1972). The English word *belief* **suggests an intellectual activity by which one may or may not choose to identify with a system of thought. Vodouisants never think of believing in something in the sense of identifying with a system of thought—or, by extension, with a community that affirms such a system** (Deren 1972). Spiritual reality cannot be the object of academic investigation, nor can it be an issue of casual scrutiny for skeptics. **Vodouisants have no room in their worldview for skepticism; they regard it as the consequence of an ambivalent attempt to establish rationally the design in the cycle of successive events, to debate the relationships between their parts, and to question the divine hand in their purpose. Skepticism is the outcome of an improper or otherwise faulty apprehension of what should admittedly be self-evident: that the world harbors powerful entities (lwas) that are forever active in human lives, and that such entities are the cause of all occurrences in the mechanical operation of the world.**”

…

Traditionally, the Haitian elite has comprised approximately 15 percent of the population. They have been ambivalent toward Vodou; many know little about it, most drawing their information from popular books and reports such as the one mentioned earlier, written on the subject around the turn of the century. Many refer to its morbid nature and regard it as the remnant of “primitive” religious practices that are deleterious to Haitian society, give the country an undesirable international reputation, and impede literacy and socioeconomic development. Yet many members of this same elite are intensely drawn to Vodou, adhering to its teachings and secretly consulting oungans on occasion. They must acknowledge Vodou’s continual presence in Haitian society, and the enduring sustenance it has provided to its devotees for centuries. They are also forced to recognize the historical fact that without Vodou, Haiti could not have become an independent nation as early as the nineteenth century, for its rituals provided the spirit of kinship and fueled the slaves’ revolts against their masters (Desmangles 1990).

**As will be described in a later chapter, the church, embarrassed by the encroachment of what it has regarded as “superstitious practices” on its theology, and using the arm of the government, has conducted a number of so-called Antisuperstitious Campaigns in which it has seized, burned, and destroyed a large number of ounfos and ritual paraphernalia throughout the country. These campaigns have left indelible marks on Haitian society, for they have resulted not only in the secretive nature of the religion, but also in Vodouisants’ ambivalence toward both religions**. Vodouisants have traditionally been reluctant to admit openly to their service to the lwas, for fear of grave legal consequences. On the one hand, they have felt the need to participate in the country’s official culture by claiming their unquestionable allegiance to Catholicism, and almost never to Vodou. On the other hand, because it is essential to participate in the sociocultural and religious life of their community, they have felt the need to serve the lwas as well.

**But if Vodou as a religion has been able to survive such suppression, it is not only because it is part of the cultural fabric of Haitian life but also, ironically, because it has so frequently been suppressed. Very often, suppression attempts to destroy something that many see as harmful to society—but it also engenders the very sustenance of the precise thing it is attempting to destroy, for the threat of the total eradication of religious values among the oppressed can cause a sudden reawakening of those values.** Vodou in Haiti today is a religion whose theology has attempted to sustain many of the religious and cultural African values in Haitian society. Its continued existence in Haitian culture is symbolic of the Vodouisants’ resistance to renouncing their African traditions and acclimating themselves, by force if necessary, to European Catholicism. **Hence, Vodou in effect is a reaction to the oppression caused by the intransigent hostility of the Roman clergy**. Moreover, the present content of its theology, which includes both Catholic and African religious traditions, derives from the contact between the cultures of two continents on Haitian soil.

…

Because Vodou is in part a by-product of Catholicism and traditional religions from various regions of Africa, any discussion of it necessitates an analysis of the contact between these two religious sources. Hence, this book has three principal goals:

(1) My first aim is to describe the historical events in Haiti that have cause Vodou to incorporate ethnic religious traditions from diverse regions of Africa into its theology. The historical events will also shed light on the processes by which Catholic doctrines were similarly incorporated. This incorporation of elements from Africa and Europe has often been referred to by scholars as syncretistic, as the fusion of Catholic and African religious traditions (Deren 1972; Herskovits 1972; Metraux 1958). The present study describes the nature of this syncretism—that is, the relation between these religious elements—as symbiosis. As used in this book, *symbiosis* has a different meaning from that in the biological sciences, where it refers to the living together of dissimilar organisms in a mutually beneficial relationships. Etymologically, symbiosis—from the Green *sun,* “with,” and *bios,* “life”— means “life together with.” In its ethnological sense, symbiosis refers to the spatial juxtaposition of diverse religious traditions from two continents, which coexist without fusing with one another. Just as tiny parts of a stained glass window are juxtaposed to form a whole, so too parts of the Vodou and Catholic traditions are juxtaposed in space and in time to constitute the whole of Vodou.

“The Spanish controlled Hispaniola until 1697, when Haiti was ceded to France in the Treaty of Ryswick. The French first began to settle on the western portion of Hispaniola in search of gold, and eventually spread across the island. The first priests arrived at the turn of the sixteenth century, initially Franciscans and Dominicans, two religious orders that played a pivotal role in the evangelization of not only Africans but also the indigenous populations throughout the Spanish-speaking Americans. From 1697 until independence in 1804, the French colony was named St. Domingue. **Priests on the colony owned slaves, and the transatlantic slave trade was legitimated by religious imperialism under the guise of saving indigenous and African souls** <Copyist note: Isn’t this what’s happening? Isn’t this what’s going on, spiritually the same, in qualitatively distinct manner>. Arguably, ""The Church actually owned three-fourths of all slaves in the colonial French Antilles.""

…

Colonial-era documents reveal that African slaves did not abandon their religious beliefs upon arrival in the Americas but instead ""mixed"" them with Catholicism. This practice continued in independent Haiti, for as the religious scholar Hein Vanhee points out, ""After the Haitian Revolution, the scanty historical documentation we have, points to a continued process of an appropriation and a reworking of rituals, texts and objects drawn from Roman Catholicism - yet in the relative absence of regular priests and missionaries."" An important factor that Vanhee emphasizes is the presence of Catholicism in Haiti, imported by slaves who were brought to the island. As he rightly points out, Portuguese and Italian missionaries were extremely active in the Congo region beginning in the fifteenth century. As part of their missionary enterprise, they employed *maestro de igrejas,* lay assistants who served as catechists and at times, even held political offices. These lay African missionaries, who are estimated to have numbered in the thousands, traveled to remote areas and instructed potential converts. Individuals traveled great distances to be baptized. The French followed with heavy missionary activity in the Congo region in the eighteenth century.

King Nzinga, a Nkuwu of the Congo, was baptized voluntarily in 1491 by Franciscan priests, though he did not place a heavy Christian emphasis upon his leadership and the kingdom's identity. Though his rule was short-lived, his son Afonso, who ruled from 1506 to 1543, affirmed Christianity as central to the Congo kingdom. This led to the conversion of the elite, who nonetheless remained strongly influenced by indigenous Congolese religion. Jason Young, a religious scholar and historian, argues that ""Kongolese converts regarded Christian missionaries in much the same way as they did indigenous Kongolese ritual experts."" Missionaries adopted Congolese ritual language to name and categorize Christian rituals, erasing the linguistic distinctions between Congolese religion and Christianity. In the mid-seventeenth century, the Congo kingdom dissolved, and local noble elites bartered with Europeans for slaves. Young maintains that baptism became a form of ""protection"" from enslavement for villagers. This rural Christianity, often practiced in the relative absence of priests, was vastly different from the formal, catechized Christianity of the elites. ""In this way, one notes the establishment of two rather distinct negotiations with the Christian faith in Kongo between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries: one headquartered at central court and radiating outward through provincial lords and nobles and a second that operated in the rural and outlying regions of the state and was practiced by those who, as a response to the exigencies of the transatlantic slave trade, saw opportunities for protection and status in the ritual of baptism."" The reasons for conversation to Christianity were thus very different for the elite and for rural populations. However, Young argues, in both cases the conversion to Christianity did not involve a radical change in one's religious worldview. Baptism did not lead to the end of one's indigenous religious beliefs.

Missionaries in the Congo region seemed to have accepted the inevitable association of Catholicism with traditional Congolese religion. The existence of Catholicism in the Congo region in the early sixteenth century is well documented. Indeed, the African historian John Thornton argues that the demise of Catholicism in the region resulted in part from the Church's definition of authentic Roman Catholicism, which led to an actual decline in the number of Catholics. ""Its apparent disappearance in the nineteenth century was not due to a lack on the part of Kongo, a resurgence of suppressed local religion or a failure on the part of the clergy. Instead it was caused by changing definition among European clergy (including Rome) as to what constituted Christianity, coupled with more chauvinistic attitudes towards non-Western (and especially colonial) peoples that arose after 1850."" In other words, Congolese Christianity itself did not change, only the manner in which Europeans defined Christianity.”

As it exists in Vodou, symbiosis takes two forms: symbiosis by ecology, and by identification. The first suggests the juxtaposition of religious elements necessitated by environmental and geographical adaptation, and the second suggests specifically the system by which, on the basis of similarity, Catholic saints were identified with or “transfigured into” Vodou gods. A brief examination of several examples may make the nature of each of these forms of symbiosis clearer.

*Symbiosis by ecology* refers to Roger Bastide’s notion of syncretism in mosaic (1978, 153), which manifests itself in two paradigms: on the one hand, in the spatial juxtaposition of Vodou (or diverse African-derived) elements and Catholic symbols in the ounfo, as well as in the temporal use of these symbols in the ounfo; and on the other hand, in the prescribed ritualistic observances for the lwas on the Catholic holy days reserved for the saints in the Christian liturgical calendar.

In the first paradigm, **the geographical proximity of a church to a ounfo constitutes the spatial juxtaposition of the two traditions. This juxtaposition also exists within the ounfo.** A ounfo consists of two main sections, a holy of holies which contains the *pe* (altar), and the *peristil,* a terrace-like enclosure in which ritual ceremonies and sacred dances are performed. **When one faces the pe, all distance between Vodou and Catholicism seems abolished: crucifixes, lithographs of saints, missals, and other Catholic ritual objects coexist on the same altar with sacred rattles and decorated jars believed to harbor ancestral spirits. Moreover, in many ounfos the walls of the peristil are richly decorated with paintings representing various scenes from Vodou mythology and Catholic hagiology, as well as the symbols associated with both religious traditions.**

**The ritualistic use of objects from both religions, too, constitutes a temporal juxtaposition of these traditions. Vodou ceremonies contain fragments of the Catholic liturgy. These fragments, or infrastructures in these ceremonies, are performed at the beginning of the ritual by a figure known as a** ***pret savann*** **or bush priest.** A discussion of the role of this figure and the historical events that led to his emergence cannot be attempted here, but must be deferred until later. Suffice it to say that he is part of the hierarchical structure of the ounfo, although his power is by no means analogous to that of the oungan. He holds no independent power and exercises little authority over those attending a ceremony. His role is by and large perfunctory: he recites the prayers, chants the hymns, and uses makeshift symbols of the church in Vodou ceremonies. Although Vodouisants see him as representative of the church in their rituals, in reality he is not. He can be seen as the symbolic embodiment of the contact between Catholicism and Vodou. **The coexistence of the observance of fragments of the Catholic ritual by the pret savann, and of traditional Vodou rites performed by the oungan in the same temple, constitutes the spatial and temporal juxtaposition of the two religions**. At the same time, Vodouisants have learned to separate the functions of each of these persons as well as their use of ritual paraphernalia in Vodou ceremonies. **The Vodou and Catholic objects possess their own power related to different aspects of reality: those of the church represent the power of the Godhead, and those of the ounfo, the power of the gods of Africa.**

In the second paradigm, the conflict of two calendars led to the temporal juxtaposition of two cultures. The gods of Africa are related to calendrical events and are identified with natural phenomena, such as the spring new year festivals. **Under the intense missionary activity that accompanied slavery in colonial Haiti, the African priests transported as slaves to Saint-Domingue were torn between two irreconcilable chronological systems—the Christian cycle of holy days, and the recurring cycle of mythical deeds performed** ***ab origine*** **in honor of their African deities. In the face of oppression, they were undoubtedly forced to observe their special African rituals on the days on which work was not required of them. This meant that they had to adapt their traditional calendar to the Gregorian calendar.**

Symbiosis by ecology meant that African religious elements were cast in a European mold. While this process may have cause discrepancies in adjustment initially, the difficulties were later resolved. For example, in the Nigerian traditional calendar, the year began with the ceremony known as the “water of Oshala,” in which various religious objects were washed in water and purified of the accumulated impurities that they had gathered during the course of the previous year. Since the Christian and Nigerian calendars did not coincide, the slaves of Saint-Domingue took the major Catholic feast days to perform their African ceremonies: the Christmas cycle up to Epiphany for the rituals of purification, the Feast of All Souls (November 1) as an occasion to honor the spirits of their departed ancestors, and so on.

The second form of symbiosis in Vodou has been termed a *symbiosis by identity—*that is, a system of identification or transfiguration by which, on the basis of the similarities between African and Catholic myths and symbols, the saints were identified with African gods. This pattern of identity operates according to the methods elucidated by Melville Herskovits (1972, 281-82). Thus Ezili, the beautiful water goddess of love in Vodou, whose originals exists both in the African goddess of the same name in Whydah in Dahomey (or Benin) and in Oshun in Nigeria, becomes the Virgin Mary; Benin’s python god Damballah becomes Saint Patrick, because of the story of the triumph of Patrick over the snakes of Ireland in Catholic hagiology; Legba, the guardian of destiny who holds the keys to the doors of the underworld, becomes Saint Peter; and so forth.

Symbiosis by identification is basic to an understanding of the cultural and religious juxtaposition of Catholicism and Vodou in Haiti today. The reasons for such a symbiosis date back to the Haitian colonial period. As Bastide (1978) noted in the case of Brazil, Catholic missionaries probably used lithographs showing the various symbols associated with the lives of the saints in Christian hagiology, and it is possible that the slaves learned to associate these symbols with those related to the African gods. Moreover, in colonial Haiti as in Brazil, colonial authorities and the church forbade the slaves to practice Vodou; therefore the slaves danced before the Catholic altars and strictly observed the feast days of the saints. Although their masters may have found their behavior bizarre, it probably did not occur to them that the slaves were honoring the African gods, and that their behavior was a mask over black faces (Bastide 1978), a veil behind which they could practice their African religions As Jean Price-Mars noted, “choked by oppression, the slaves were obliged to hide their secret adoration of obscure forces to which they felt themselves tied by long ancestral tradition” (1928, 44).

**Price-Mars’s observations in no way contradict the information gathered during my field research. In the city of Port-au-Prince, where Vodou’s close association with Catholicism could have created theological fusion, the two religious systems represented in the minds of their adherents two disparate “objects” juxtaposed to one another. I found that many conceived of the interplay between the two religions as a necessary form of social integration** <The Haitian Tableaux>. Thus the paradox in the Haitians’ religious life consisted of two strong social and cultural forces: on the one hand, they perceived their membership in the church as a means of social recognition and social stability; and on the other, they sensed the need to reaffirm their African heritage, as well as to join those in their immediate communities by participating in the rituals of the local ounfos. In the case of the slaves, they needed to survive the hardships of plantation life and they found solace in their African religious traditions. Because Vodou was not allowed in the colony, they learned to conceal their practice of these traditions behind the veil of Catholicism.

<Christianity as the acacia tree. It’s a start.>

(2) Although Vodou has assimilated much of Catholic theology, it is also continuous with African religious traditions. Continuity and change are cultural processes present in every society and will endure whether or not they are studied by scholars. No study of continuity can be made without an examination of the factors that have engendered it. Hence, the second purpose of this study is to examine the sociohistorical and other factors that have cause Vodouisants to look toward their past and to maintain so much of their African heritage.

In his analysis of continuity and change in African traditional religions. J.N.K. Mugambi noted that every culture has made an impact on world history, and has done so only after it has discovered and affirmed “its roots” and traced them to antiquity (1989, 111). But the rediscovery of a culture’s heritage does not consist of a blind leap into the past — or into the future, for that matter. Rather, it consists of a cultural renaissance in which the past is reincarnated into the present and provides a vision for the future (Mugambi 1989, 111).

The rediscovery by a people of their past is not unique to Haiti: in the anthropological literature, students of culture have recorded similar reactions to acculturation in “primal” religions in other parts of the world. **Ralph Linton noted that in situations of contact between cultures where one dominates the other, and where the dominated culture’s existence and indigenous development are threatened by the dominant culture, the dominated group may give rise to what he called** ***nativism—*****religious movements that consciously attempt to revive or perpetuate selected elements of their culture.** The threat felt by the members of a dominated culture may result from the extensive diffusion into it of cultural elements from the dominant culture. Consequently, members of the dominated culture may feel the need to emphasize cultural elements fallen into desuetude, stressing their uniqueness and practicality in order to reduce individual stress created by the situation of contact. **Hence, as Georges Balandier observed, a nativistic movement can be viewed as “contra-acculturative,” wherein a people come to emphasize the values in their original way of life, and move aggressively to restore those past values, even in the face of their apparent impotence to throw off the power that restricts them** (Balandier 1963, 496-97, Linton 1979, 414).

In the case of Haiti, as will be shown in Chapter 2, the imposition of European culture on African cultures through force and police control helped to fuel a series of slave revolts throughout the colonial period, revolts that resulted in the independence of Haiti in 1804. The role of Vodou in these revolutions was one of providing a channel through which ancestral African traditions could be re-created. The emphasis on past religious traditions became vital in inspiring the slaves to revolt against their masters. Subversive activity was often preceded by religious ceremonies that included sacrifices to gods originating in diverse regions of Africa.

Anthony F.C. Wallace, who broadened Linton’s theories, included in his analysis all social movements of a radical type, referring to them as “revitalization movements” (1979, 422). These movements, he said, arise in situations of extreme “stress” that, according to many scholars, occur particularly in settings in which dominated societies experience relative deprivation—that is, the reduction of their expectations of ameliorating their present situation either immediately or in the future (Barkun 1986, 35; Aberle 1962). Despite objections in the anthropological literature to Wallace’s Gestaltian psychosocial approach to culture change, and despite his lack of a definition of *stress* (Barkun 1986, 34-40), his descriptions of these movements deserve attention. He noted that such movements may be prophetic or millenarian or both, for messianism and millenarianism are not mutually exclusive categories. **Although the ideologies of millenarian movements take different adaptive cultural forms as they are shaped by the situations in which they arise, scholars agree that, by and large, they share many common characteristic:**

(a) They promise their members redemption from oppression; they rely heavily on the supernatural in that the “golden age” that they await will be ushered in by divine figures (Talmon 1965, 526).

(b) The metahistorical future envisaged by millenarian movements is based on the teachings of prophets—or charismatic figures who are often viewed by their followers as messiahs—who promise that the new era will be a re-creation and reestablishment of the situation of their ancestors. In such cases, the remembered ancestral traditions that are selected and given emphasis are endowed with symbolic value, and are considered to be formulae designed to achieve a favorable modification of a society’s frustrations, both present and future. The revivified past and situation of the ancestors thus provide the model for the world to come (Balandier 1963, 496; Talmon 1965, 524).

<**MAGA**>

( c ) The emphasis on ancestral traditions entails a people’s selection of what appears to them as desirable in the situation of their progenitors. **Hence, a reconstructed past is never identical to the real past, but is modified to conform to the present and to the future situations as the people conceived of them** (Cohn 1961). **Moreover, as Maurice Halbwachs noted, this emphasis on the past on the part of the dominated is based upon “collective memories”—that is, those elements that are remembered or selected for emphasis are those that can integrate themselves into the current socioeconomic and political contexts of the dominated (Halbwachs 1975, 401). In the case of Haiti, collective memory meant that many of the past cultural elements selected for emphasis or reconstruction were those that related contextually to the African slaves’ struggle for social dignity and liberation**. Thus for example, the Nigerian god of war Ogou was remembered and became a major lwa in Haiti because of the slaves’ confrontation with colonial rule and because, as will be noted in Chapter 2, later political and social strife occasioned the emphasis of his envisaged persona, and many of the myths associated with that persona.

(d) The desire to “fly” from the brutal reality of oppression has often inspired members of such movements to believe that the new dispensation will only come through unprecedented cataclysms, disastrous calamities including war and bloody human confrontations, generally brought about by supernatural intervention. The prophets of these movements not only are viewed as signs of the impending final event, but also announce the destruction of the present order and the imminent advent of the new order (Barkun 1986, 91ff.).

(e) Millenarianism often assumes characteristics common to movements of nationalism and can be prepolitical in nature (Balandier 1963, 33). Societies that either appear to be stateless, or have rudimentary political institutions, or lack any specialized institutions tend to give rise to millenarian movements of a political nature, due to the lack of an efficient political institution that can bear the grievances and the pressing claims of a frustrated segment of the population. The deprived members may seek an adequate solution to their problems through millenarianism (Barkun 1986, 68ff.; Talmon 1965, 531).

**In the case of Haiti, the slaves revolted against slavery because the French colonial administration provided no channel through which they could air their complaints. As will be discussed in Chapter 2, the removal of the rights of the mulattoes known as “free slaves” (a decision made by the Assemblee Nationale in France toward the end of the eighteenth century) not only caused them to emphasize their ancestral traditions, but sparked the vividness of the millennium in the minds of those who actively participated in the final revolution in 1804.** Furthermore, the Haitian Revolution had political overtones: many religious leaders during the revolution assumed political office once independence had been achieved.

(3) The third aim of this study is to describe Vodou as a *tertium quid,* part of which is a “creole” phenomenon that owes little to Africa or Europe (Smith 1960, 36) but is indigenous to Haiti, born out of the difficult and oppressive conditions of slavery and the necessary adaption to a new environment. This corresponds to Sidney Mintz’s suggestion (1972) that the ubiquity of African elements in Vodou may have caused scholars to search for resemblances with the religions of Africa and Europe at the expense of the indigenous characteristics unique to Vodou. **Traditionally, Vodou may have been largely a religion of the peasants in Haiti — but those peasants, like other peasant societies of the world, are by no means static, nor are their institutions “diachronically stable” (Davis 1988, 32; Thomas and Znaniecki 1971). Mintz and others have shown that peasant societies throughout the world have moved aggressively toward social change and have engendered radical transformations of societal norms**. As already noted, social change can often occur through revitalization (or millenarian) movements that threaten to destroy the present order the suppresses them.

Among religious elements indigenous to Haiti is the fact that Vodou maintains several sects, known as *nanchons* <nations>*,* each of which bears the name of one of the pantheons most prevalent in the sect’s location. These pantheons will be discussed at some length in Chapter 4; **it suffices here to note that, for historical reasons, their names are derived from the names of the different African ethnic religious traditions represented in Haiti during the colonial period. One such sect is the Petro nanchon, which is typically Haitian. The names of its lwas, their ascribed personae in Vodou mythology, and the rituals performed in their honor are woven into the fabric of Haitian history and culture, and bear little resemblance to European or African religious traditions. They derive from the oppressive conditions of slavery and are associated with the rage of the slaves against their masters. In Haiti today the Petro lwas still become prevalent in religious and political thinking from time to time, as witnessed by recent retributions of the masses against former government officials after President Jean-Claude Duvalier’s fall from power.**

**Moreover, the identification of the lwas with the saints of the church, the spatial juxtaposition of Catholic practices in Vodou rites, the use of both Catholic and Vodou objects in these rites, the attitudes of Vodouisants toward both religions, and the calendrical adjustments achieved in their observances of the two traditions, are neighter African nor European in form, but creole phenomena emerging out of the contact of the two cultures on Haitian soil.**

In order to achieve the above purposes, the present study will focus on Vodou pantheons—more specifically, on the mythology and folklore that surround the personae of the Vodou laws, on the private rites and public ceremonies tendered to these lwas by their devotees, and on the bases for their symbiotic identity with particular Catholic saints.

Hence this book is not about some exotic religion; its descriptions of Vodou rituals have nothing to do with the macabre characterizations of the religion found in popular films and Western literature. It is concerned with a viable religion, the theology of which has woven itself into the fabric of Haitian life. It also differs from earlier scholarly studies on Vodou because it focuses on the nature of Vodou’s pantheons, and emphasizes the cultural, historical, political, and social contexts in which various ethnic African religious traditions came into contact with Catholic theology.

Disparate Notes:

Roger Bastide was a phenome but, at the risk of misrepresenting, one of the things I’ve noticed is that he placed a great emphasis and value in the preservation and documentation of “Pure African” custom or tradition… this was elevated in his analysis… while generally the “hybrid” was devalued as superstitious dross or as a mere survival tactic. Yet perhaps the hybrid is often representative of what remains-preserves, what transmits/gives, and what constitutes the reality. Containing both, again as part of the tableau. The one begets two. Containing a multitude of nations. The Platonist grimaces, the copy of the copy may perhaps in fact be the original. A Reformation as Reproduction of the process then occurs. In search of the direct, the OG… out with the Latin in with the German, and so on. It’s like attempting to neatly distinguish the Jew from the Greek in the present-day. One can do it at the conceptual level, indeed this is perhaps a necessary moment and exercise… if only to bring into sharp definition the error.

I don’t tend to give myself over to these forms of “alt-history” speculation, but one wonders what a meeting of these practices with Buddhism would…over the course of hundreds or thousands or hundred-of-thousands of years… led too. We might look at the whole of Southeast and East Asia for examples. The difference of course is… as far I understand it, there was never anything as unique as the Transatlantic slave trade in any of those regions was there? In terms of mass relocation of people from distinct ethnolinguistic groups, forced to work in a plantation-complex or in mines, by a group of very obviously-visually distinct people who claim (and can enforce said claim through violence) to own them.

Same arguably goes concerning historical antecedents during Christianity’s historical ascension within Roman imperial territories. The ways Christianity was met and received have to be taken into account.

We might look at historical examples but again… none of these historical empires managed to naval or logistical feats necessary to transport masses of humans across an ocean.

Speculative, always take with a grain-of-salt and pardon my manner and so-on… I think given the push towards the codification of Vodou as the State Religion of Haiti during the Papa Doc years, and how interwoven Vodou became with Haitian National Identity and the Haitian definition of “Blackness” and Revolution, that a full divorce could’ve been adopted. Akin to the separation of Shinto and Buddhism during the Meiji Restoration. This relationship between Catholicism and Vodou—Vodou not as sorcery or a loanword for witchcraft (as Obeah is used in much of the Anglophone Caribbean, or as Macumba is used in Brazil, or Juju in West Africa) but as a uniquely Hispaniolan-Haitian religion containing within it the meeting of distinct ethnolinguistic rites.— Goes deeper into the fabric of Haitianness. Saying otherwise I think devalues of the power of the *Image* and of the role Catholic consecration and Catholic structures play in grounding the process of indigenization. Holds the whole together. Not to mention, we enter into the question of the graveyard itself as holy place... who consecrates those grounds? Likewise, which calendrical system does the average Haitian peasant rely upon? The author makes it appear as if it all amounts to subterfuge and/or a collective example of Stockholm syndrome. With that noted… it’s obviously true and likewise crucial to assert the distinctiveness and importance of funerary rites that are identifiably *not* Catholic. Modes of grieving/mourning and handling the process of dying and death and post-mortem presence which are distinctly *not* French and *not* Latin, which requires the presence of houngans, mambos, and the hounfo-complex and community. The question of how enslaved Africans dealt with this matter is crucial. Given the severity of the rupture from one continent to another. And the tensions between various, sometimes antagonistic, ethnic groups with distinct customs (not to mention intra-ethnic tensions between members of one polis and those of another). These are forms that have remained. Which comprise in part the legitimacy of Vodou as an institution. As a unique religious institution.

By definition. Whether you consider it all superstitious devil worship. What Vodou isn’t is a kind of witchcraft or another name for witchcraft practiced by individual sorcerers. One of the things I find interesting in Intra-Dhimmi conflict, is how Vodou, as the religious shorthand for the Haitians or put another way as the *Image of the Haitian*, of an Island Nation which constitutes the great embarrassment and tragedy of the New World… discursively reverts to the prior form of the Jew (it would be too much of a dissonance to point at the Greek) and through the Jew, the ""Globalists"" subverting the ethnic-harmony of disparate Christendoms… somehow a peasant religion that provides solace and social organization to those who on a concrete political and economic level are objectively-materially dispossessed and made to live with the ambivalence of both pride and shame over who they are and what they represent… are transformed in the gaze of another into the most Powerful, most Threatening Thing.

I regularly use chatGPT and other tools to make customized grammar quizzes for my students, refining these manually.

My school has a pretty rare setup, students' learning is self-led so they come and go between different classrooms, asking the teachers for help. I don't have a fixed group so I can't get them all to install or register with a particular app, we don't have time and I have new people coming in and out constantly.

For this reason I need to share quizzes etc with a public link that doesn't require an account. I'd prefer to create one link to a public **folder** that I can share with students via QR code, where they can just view the files without signing in.

  
**I've tried:**

Google - no good. Account required to view the files, almost none of my teenage students in Ecuador have an account, don't have time to create one with each of them separately.

Dropbox - works OK, I can create text files and paste text from GPT, students can view all files in the folder without signing in. However text formatting in the browser is ugly as hell.

Pastebin - great formatting, fast, but too much of a pain to send links for each new document. No option to share folder with students.

Tried a few of the free online quiz makers RE Quizlet, Knowt etc - too many steps for the students to sign in, too much garbage around earning XP, popups etc... can't just copy and paste text into a blank doc.

  
If anyone has a recommendation it'd be awesome!"

https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/s/cdmY2H2Ct2

Y’all are the absolute goats 💕

So here’s an *update* on my situation: I put in my two weeks yesterday! 🥳

My boss called me to her office (probably to scathe me once more), so I went ahead and ChatGPT’d my resignation letter. 

I walked in the door, handed her the letter, and she looked a bit surprised. 

She then (as a final opportunity to power trip me) suggested I just resign that day, but if I want to actually stay another two weeks I need to ‘get my act together’ regarding my paperwork. I told her I had already finished them, and where they were saved. She then mentioned that ‘employment elsewhere for me’ was ‘definitely the right move.’ 

I told her ‘you’re right, it definitely is’ while biting my tongue & preventing myself from lounging onto her about her poor leadership skills and inability to train her employees. 

Here’s the thing: I am working on my PhD, I’m teaching two classes at my local community college, and can always dip into my savings. So I will be ok! I have decided that the paycheck and benefits I can always find elsewhere and are just not worth her firebreathing. I have decided to take the high road, and even told her I am willing to help her get everything ready for the next teacher who comes onboard. I will miss my students, though! 

My last day will be the 26th, and I have scheduled a mini vacation for that weekend. "

The main goal are to have more students book lessons on the webiste. Later I also plan to sell video lesson subscription.

  
I would like to record my process of learning and building the website. On the one hand, I would like to get feedback. On the other hand, I also take it as monitoring my process and make sure finishing the project.



OK.

  
What I have done and what materials I have used so far

(1) Using Google and ChatGPT to figure out the process of building website on WP

I learned:

# Audience and Purpose 

# Domain Name

# Hosting provider

# Content and Layout 

# Theme

# Plugins



# Loading Speed different browses&Mobile

# Later: SEO、analytics

  
(2) followed the course - beginner wordpress user:https://learn.wordpress.org/courses/

(3) Randomly watch Youtube WP videos and check comments under the vedios

(4) Making a decision about using block editor or Bricks.

Decide to use Bricks after watching this one.

* If these claims are true, which stocks will benefit most? I know Chatgpt used mostly NVIDIA chips in the beginning, but are they also considering other chips from Google, AMD, Tesla?

* How big will the impact be on these stocks? Is it already ""priced in""?

* For the new AI itself, how much do you believe in the new claims of human like intelligence? 

Source: [CNN via Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chatgpt-maker-says-ai-model-113626666.html).

>“We trained these models to spend more time thinking through problems before they respond, much like a person would,” the maker of ChatGPT said on its website. “Through training, they learn to refine their thinking process, try different strategies and recognize their mistakes.”

> As examples of the new models’ power, OpenAI noted that they can be used by healthcare researchers to annotate cell sequencing data and by physicists to generate “complicated mathematical formulas needed for quantum optics.”

> The potential of the new AI models was also highlighted by Noam Brown, a research scientist at the company. “OpenAI’s o1 thinks for seconds, but we aim for future versions to think for hours, days, even weeks. **Inference costs will be higher**,” he posted on X Thursday, referring to the costs — such as higher energy bills — of using AI to make inferences from inputs. “But what cost would you pay for a new cancer drug? For breakthrough batteries?” he added.

. . . .

>In tests, OpenAI o1 performs similarly to PhD students on difficult benchmark tasks in physics, chemistry and biology, according to the company. And in a qualifying exam for the International Mathematics Olympiad, the new series of models correctly solved 83% of problems."
1fg4ars,2,2024-09-13,Navigating UCSD as a freshman,u/TrainingResolution12,u_TrainingResolution12,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TrainingResolution12/comments/1fg4ars/navigating_ucsd_as_a_freshman/,"Hey. It is the time of the year where everyone's excited for our upcoming session. Welcome to UCSD and I hope you are doing great. As a senior, I have been exposed to various handy tools to navigate college life. Here are my recommendations

1. **Networking system**- **Discord, Slack, Instagram webpage** for the **clubs and classes** you are interested in. **Piazza** good for reference to asking questions to the instructional team+class. **Cold email and Office hours** have worked well in finding research jobs. **Linkedin** is great for having your online profile up top, highly recommend a professional photograph. **X/Twitter** for following your latest research if you're into EE/AI/related fields. **Geisel, Classes, Intramural Sports and Greek Rush** are experiences that got me some good exposure to social aspects of campus (not in a frat but made friends). For jobs **Handshake and Linkedin** is enough if you have a good portfolio going on. Look at accepted alumnis portfolio based on your goals and see what jobs fit your traits best. **Resident life events** too are lit. Become a IA/SI leader. You'll have fun lol.
2. **Offerup and Facebook Marketplace** are great for furniture and rentals. If you're a business nerd like me, you could also practice your negotiation skills there without anything at stake (LOL!). Other good things I found were **Styl App** and **Poshmark + thrift stores and stockx** if you're looking to up your fashion game.
3. **Notetaking**/**Information management-** A HIGHLY debated topic amongst students because pen and paper models are outdated. I used **Apple Notes** combined with P**erplexity/Claude/GPT-4** for notetaking. The workflow I follow is **lecture notes (typed or handwritten + screenshot)-> pdf textbook into perplexity/GPT and prompt to follow textbook-> get key concepts and insights per lesson-> work on problems and use LLMs to see how and where each mini concept applies-> understand doubtful concepts in office hours and mail TAs/post on piazza-> reflect and add summary to notes-> hold group study sessions to debate tougher questions and teach what you mastered to other students.**

The whole process takes about 1 hour a day to 2 max per subject- benchmark-> math 142a. Perplexity is useful for getting search and images/videos directly from your notes and interacting with content on a deeper level, GPT is great for summary and analysis. I strongly believe we should interface LLMs with learning and conventional instruction. Never rely on LLMs for answers. Never cheat. libgen, **JSTOR, arXiv, nature science journal, neurIPS, internet archive** are some excellent sources for articles. Geisel has some articles too that can be access with campus **VPNs.** My GPA went from a 3.2 to 4.0 with straight As thanks to this note taking system. It is like my second brain. I also met a few cool people this way, we learnt a lot together.

4. **Hangouts**- The most subjective thing by far. Not a local. I intern full time rn so I barely have time. The one activity i did choose was fitness and beaches because I can't keep up with studies otherwise. I go to 24 fitness or main gym. Ice rink close by or the mt soledad drive is a cool date idea for reference. Cool tidepools nearby at LJ shores you can search instagram reels idk i randomly stumbled. There's some good cafes all around town go on yelp. Surf spots are windansea and couple others. Convoy easily on top for asian food. Crazy bakeries and sweet shops all around little italy. Hillcrest welfare wednesdays you can do cool stuff. Indian food is good mira mesa side. Mexican at Old town and near TJ. SDSU side has lit parties if you want go make friends there and get invited. PB amazing for food and party. Downtown has great museums. Seaworld and zoo, sd science center amazing. La Jolla Playhouse is cool. Che cafe is awesome. Gaslamp gastropubs go hard. SD padres games great hangouts you will make lots of friends. MMA PPV events too. Weekend getaway for non locals they have a secret place at OB which I know lot of you will try goofy stuff. Remember if it takes a toll on your body and affects mental health then it is not worth it.

Ah thank god for speech to text. Have fun. Went through 4 years and a lot of memories."

1fgc3zc,110,2024-09-13,Passed Network+ today after studying for 12 days - My advice to those studying!,u/cashfile,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/1fgc3zc/passed_network_today_after_studying_for_12_days/,"**Warning this is going to be a looooonnnnnng post, I will provide a TLDR at the end. I'll also be breaking it into subsections to make it easier to read! If anyone actually makes it through this 5-page essay congrats lol! I spent like \~2 hr writing it hopefully it helpful to someone.**

**Overview:** In this post, I'm gonna mention how I passed the Network+ with just 12 days of studying including the resources I used, *how my initial studying plan failed*, and how I would redo it now knowing what I know as I believe I could complete it in 7 days final strategy.   The primary reason I'm writing this is to help those looking for certification as I think the common way I see mentioned through this thread is massively ineffective and something I initially fell into. Additionally, when I was 5-7 days in I really wanted to quit and just buy a new voucher for more time as I was seeing a lot of people saying it was impossible to study for in this short of a time period. But it was a post and YouTube video I found of people also completing it in a similar timeframe usually two weeks and made me think if they can do it so can I! Lastly, I’ve always wanted a super detailed write-down that included everything one did so I decided to make one. 

P.S. I don't recommend you take in 12 days, but I'll go further into recommendations section.

**Tech Background:** I am currently a graduate student in cybersecurity risk management (not a very technical degree, most GRC and policy-based), no prior direct IT (help desk, networking, sysadmin, etc) background but I previously worked as a software engineer for a year between undergrad and grad school. Additionally this past summer I worked as a cybersecurity intern, but again it was mostly policy-based creating, managing, and revising SoPs, documentation (Incident response for IT & OT, password policy, COOP, etc), running internal phishing campaigns, and creating cybersecurity training materials and internal newsletters. Lastly, I've been a security researcher at a University lab for the past 2 years working on the intersection of AI & privacy, with 3 publications thus far but there is no overlap with networking. My study is in regards to how AI can be used to enhance users' end privacy primarily in regards to photo sharing and social media. Between my undergrad in informatics (study of how people interact with computers think UX/UI, project management, etc ), work/research experience, and graduate school I primarily have a rough understanding of the OSI model (not as detailed as mentioned through the Network+), different cloud environments, and knew about 1/3rd of the information mentioned in Domain 4.0: Network Security but maybe not to exact degree/definition mentioned through the Network+. However, I don't think this played a huge role in my ability to pass it in 12 days as I studied all domains equally so even if I didn't have prior knowledge I would have covered it extensively, but it is important I mention it. Though my years of procrastinating in college have taught me how to devise a plan to learn things quickly and effectively.

**Why Network+:** The reason I decided to take Network+ is I wanted a more technical understanding of cybersecurity, as my scholarship gives me 3k a semester to spend on certificates and I want to take the OSCP I figured it best to start with a strong foundational knowledge of Networking+ before moving onto penetration testing.

**Why 12 Days\*:** I studied it in 12 days because the voucher was only to expire because I procrastinated and my professional development fund can only be used on each certificate once (i.e. no retakes).  It actually turned out to be just 10 days as I started on Monday, Sept 2nd and took the test this morning today Friday, Sept 12th. Besides not being able to study much on Friday morning due to my test center being an hour away, on Thursday, Sept 5th I had to go out of town and got back late at night and had no desire to study. Additionally, on Tuesday, the 3rd I only studied for 2 hours due to other school obligations. So in actuality, it was closer to 10 days that I studied and not 12.

**Why Days Are A Terrible Tracking Metric:** Before I go on, I want to see something that is commonly mentioned in this subreddit and that is how many 'days' a person studied. This is a terrible metric because someone who is a graduate student with a lot of free time can study 7-10 hours a day, This could be the equivalent to someone with a wife and kids studying for 3-6 weeks if they only have 2-4 hours a day to study.  Hours are a far better metric and through my 12-day journey, I put in roughly \~90 hours.

**My Initial Learning Plan:** My initial learning plan was similar to what I constantly see mentioned through this subreddit including people who failed tests more than once and that is to keep cramming the material from different sources. My initial plan was to watch the Messer videos (14hrs), and Mike Meyer video series (21 hrs), read the Network+ Review Guide (532pgs) then do the Jason Dion practice tests. For the first 3-4 days I attempted this, the review book was 532 pages so I figured if I read 80 pages a day I would be done in 6.5 days on top of that I would watch the Mike Meyer video series on 2x speed which meant that in 5 days I could complete it if I watched 2 hours day and then I could move on to the Messer video series also at 2x speed and complete it 3.5 days. I could complete both the video series & book in roughly \~ 9 days (assuming I'm reading alongside watching the video series) leaving 3 days for practice tests and reviews. This is similar to what I saw throughout the subreddit, take the material from various sources ideally a mixture of books and videos, and then take practice tests. So I set out on this path on Monday, Sept 3rd.

**How It Failed Miserably:** Firstly, I come from a research background where I have to lit reviews on dozens of papers that can oftentimes be boring but fuck me I have never read such a boring book. It has nothing to do with the author it's just that Network+ material can't be any more boring at least for me. Additionally, I underestimated how long it 'feels' to read network+ review books for \~4 hr straight every single day. Midway the through third day was \~200 into the 532-page review book, and I completed 4 of 11 hours of the Mike Meyer video series, but I still felt like I wasn't learning anything and it felt like I wasn't retaining anything. Particularly with domain 1 which to me even till the end I found the most difficult due to the sheer memorization of cables, connectors, etc. So instead of continuing another 2 hour of Mike Meyer video series, I decided to review Domain 1 by watching Messer's video on Domain 1. After 2 hour of watching I got done with Domain 1 and part of Domain 2 from the Messer video series. Still felt like I knew nothing but I remembered I had the Sybex Network+ Practice test book that came in a Network+ bundle. So I tried a handful of domain 1 questions which it included \~300, and after doing 10 questions and checking the answer I realized ... I had failed 8 out of 10 questions and I was stunned. As I had consumed material on Domain 1 via 3 different sources (1 book, 2 video series) and I still couldn't answer any of the practice questions. At this point, I went to bed discouraged and basically thought I could never adequately prepare with only 9 days remaining.  The next day I was out of town and when I got home I decided fuck it and didn’t study. The following day when I woke up (day 5, Sept 6th) and did a handful more practice questions was failing around 60-80%. This is when it clicked...

**The Clicking Moment:** I realized 3 core things - 1) Even though I had consumed the material from three different sources it wasn't sticking 2) Between the boring book and failing almost all my practice questions, my current method was unsustainable and I either needed to give up or devise a new plan 3) I was learning way more from my failure on practice question and reading the Sybex explanation that explained why the option was correct and way other 3 option were wrong than from any of direct material I was consuming.  This is when I realized my new plan!

**New & Success Strategy:** PRACTICE QUESTIONS... PRACTICE QUESTIONS... PRATICE QUESTIONS!!!! I decided to spend the majority of my remaining time (8 days) on practice questions, however, I knew I still needed some base foundational material so I went with Messer for 2 reasons. It was shortest at 14 hrs (7hrs 2x speed), and it was broken down to a domain similar to the Sybex Practice Test guide. The Sybex practice test book was the best resource throughout my entire study and I'll explain why in a section called ‘Golden Resource’. Sybex practice test book containing 1100 questions (\~300 questions for domain 1, and \~ 200 questions each for domain 2-5) I started doing roughly 100 questions a day. While continuing to watch rest Messer's video over the next 2 days. Up to this point 7 days in, Sat Sept 8th, I had only finished the domain questions for domain 3 and realized I was taking wayyy too long at this pace as answering the 100 questions took me roughly 6 hours between reading the paragraphs for each explanation as well as using mixture specialized version of ChatGPT I created (will discuss this later) to explain everything that Sybex explanation didn’t clear up as well as acronyms that were just expected to be known from A+ 1 & 2. After this point, I decided to just the odd question from domains 2-5 so roughly \~100 question from each section rather than the full 200 that way I could have Wednesday and Thursday to do practice tests. I stayed on this path studying \~6-7 hours a day by the time Wednesday morning came I had finished all five domains and was ready to move on to practice tests. Additionally, I want to note even throughout this time I wanted to give up as when I was doing practice questions even though it was better than consuming the materials, I was still failing 50-60% of questions on the first try (only went through once) and this was true through all \~700 questions I went through. However, I knew because of how I analyzed every question after I got it right or wrong if I saw the same question or a similar question again I would be able to get it right. I also really struggled with the acronyms as once I stopped reading after domain 1 & part way through domain 2 there weren’t many examples of acronyms being spelled out and you were just assumed to know. I solved this issue at the very end mentioned in my ‘Final Stretch’ section.  

**Final Stretch:** For my practice tests, I started with tests by ‘TotalSem’ never heard of them before and didn’t see in mentioned in this subreddit when I was looking for materials, but came across it on Linked Learning when navigating to Mike Meyers' course. They have 4 timed practice tests with 90 questions each (no PBQs). Figured the more pratice tests the merrier and I didn’t want to jump straight onto Jason Dion tests without. I will post my practice test scores for all practice tests I took in a section titled ‘Practice Test Scores’. Honestly, not the biggest fan of these tests due to the wording, I found the wording to be most confusing out of Sybex & Jason Dion, but overall worth doing if you have LinkedIn Learning but probably not worth subscribing for. I completed all four of these 90-minute tests on Wednesday and went over correct and incorrect answers in detail, additionally, I then did 1 of 6 Jason Dion tests. (I used Udemy 7-day free trial for Jason Dion's test, there should also be a LinkedIn Learning free trial for those who don’t already have it.). On Thursday day before the exam, I completed five Jason Dion practice tests and reviewed all the answers. On Friday morning, I watched 14-series playlists called ‘CompTIA Network+ 008 PBQs’ on Youtube by JustCallMeRed, which goes over 14 PBQs from the Comptia official CertMaster platform, this is extremely helpful. I watched all 14 videos at 2x speed and took roughly an hour this along with practice questions and knowing how to apply the knowledge is most likely all needed for the PBQs. Finally, I drove an hour, arrived 30 minutes early, and spent 15 minutes reviewing ports, RAID levels, as well as a few 802.11 standards, things I personally had trouble remembering will differ for each person. 

**Exam & Passing Score:** I passed the score with a 765 out of 900. Not terrible for \~9 days of studying, just glad for it to be over. I received 70 questions, four of which were PBQs. One note about the PBQs, I almost failed due to PBQs. I finished all 66 multi-choice questions with \~ 50 remaining. Finished two of my PBQs in roughly 20 minutes than remaining two of my PBQs were terminal based. I couldn’t get any command to run and had 30 minutes left to complete both of them. I spent 15 minutes figuring out how to do terminal base question, as none of the typical commands that came to my head and were mentioned such netstat, ip, hostname, etc weren't working. At one point I literally, almost gave up and just submitted the test and wanted to cry… But I kept trying with 15 minute left and no progress on the 2 PBQs, I used the help command. This displayed a list of commands I could actually use. If you get terminal PBQ use the fucking help command. It is a lifesaver. After that with \~15 minutes remaining, I was able to complete one of the two PBQs and do partial work on my second PBQ. This was most likely the difference between passing and failing. Due to this hiccup, I didn’t have any time to review my question even though I flew through the first 66 questions. | Exam Passing Proof: [Image Link](https://imgur.com/a/KDKj8YC)

**Acronyms & Ports:** On Wednesday I realized I was still lacking in regards to acronyms, and decided to download an Anki (SRS Flashcard) deck that contained all requirement acronyms listed Exam objectives \~200, I actually only ended up completing about 100 as I did first 100 on Wednesday night and didn’t have time to finish the remainder before Friday’s exam but it was helpful and I would recommend. Additionally, I downloaded a deck containing all the required port numbers twice, containing both Port -> Protocol Name Format as well as Protocol name -> Port format. I did this deck on Wednesday night, Thursday night, and Friday morning. Memorizing both acronyms and ports are life savers I would recommend this to anyone as really helps you narrow down potential answers, even if you don’t know what a word actually means such  CWDM, Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing is, if the question mentions wavelength it could help narrow down the answers or if mentions DNS you can image that CWDM probably wouldn’t be an answer. This narrowing down the potential answers can definitely be the difference between passing and failing. 

**Note Taking:** I didn’t take notes, but I did buy Messer Notes, and only used them a handful of times as quick reference material including to review while sitting in the car outside the testing center. Not needed at all, but helpful if you have the extra $30 lying around. Besides that, I don’t think taking note of video series is a valuable use of your time. You are far better off cramming more practice questions. 

**Subnetting:** 1) First fuckkkkk Classless subnetting, I hate it and it memorizing it feels like when a math teacher tell you won’t always have a calculator with you. For the exam you only need to know /25 - 31. Don’t even bother Messer 7 second subnetting diagram it wayy to complicated just use the one below it was the minimal amount of information but it all you will need for Jason Dion practice exams as well as actual exam. The Sybex question do ask question that go outside of /25 - 31. This table is super easier to memorize and takes 15 seconds to write down. The only thing you have to do in your head is calculate the associated network ID. For example (taken from Jason Dion) - What is the network ID associated with the host located at 192.168.0.123/29? For this look at /29 in the table, you will see 8 hosts. Out of possible answers: 1) 192.168.0.120 2) 192.168.0.112 3) 192.168.0.96 4) 192.168.0.64. The only possible answer is 1) because .120 that is less than 123 and within 8 host range. Additionally, a Network Address will always end with an even number (ex - .120) with the only exception being ‘.0’, while a broadcast address will always end with an odd number (ex. 255) this rule holds true for /25-/31 unsure if that is the case outside of those parameters . 

|Notation|Networks|Hosts|Available|Mask|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|/25|2|128|126|.128|
|/26|4|64|62|.192|
|/27|8|32|30|.224|
|/28|16|16|14|.240|
|/29|32|8|6|.248|
|/30|64|4|2|.252|
|/31|128|2|\*|.254|

**Golden Resource:** I'm going to shill here for a moment but out of all resources for practice questions which I will cover later, the Sybex Practice Test book or ideally online version (makes it faster to review explanations and grade answers by putting a copy on each monitor rather than flipping through the back of the book), had by far the best explanation! Better than Jason Dion, better than TotalSems practice tests (on LinkedIn learning), better than Compass Exam. It provides a detailed explanation of why you got something right and why the other answers are wrong. While most other resources focus on why the correct answer was correct, this resource also explain why the other is incorrect. For each question \~1100 (\~300 questions for domain 1, and \~ 200 questions each for domain 2-5) as well as additionally 180 question in the form of 2 practice test, it provide a paragraph explanation. By reading through these explanation even if you got the answer right you are essentially reading 1200 paragraphs, but it doesn't feel as boring as Network+ review guide and it show it in actual applicable circumstances. It is ironically the best Network+ textbook without being a textbook.  Additionally, the questions are broken into domains but questions are then ordered by subdomain as well so as you progress through the 300 questions for domain 1 you will notice the first \~50-60 are all domain 1.1 then the next 50-60 questions are domain 1.2, etc. It does go far more in-depth than you will need for Network+ such as subnetting questions you wouldn't be asked but having that extra solid foundation doesn’t hurt.  Lastly, don’t feel bad if you are doing poorly I was getting roughly 50-60% of the questions wrong through all \~700 questions I completed, however, I learned from every mistake. 

**Custom ChatGPT:** To answer most of my questions I created a custom ChatGPT using the legacy GPT 4 model, the only one that allows you actually create a custom model and upload PDFs and save it. I took a purchased copy of the PDF of 532 Network+ Sybex Review Guide, split five domains into their own chapter, and uploaded all five PDFs into the GPT’s knowledge base. I then used it to ask questions, I found this preferable to the newer 4o or 4mini model as well as Google. When using default ChatGPT or Google sometimes I would get an answer that didn’t align with the Network+ way of things. Lastly, by using this custom model, I could actually ask it what page it got it the information from and if I needed more information I could go directly to that section in the PDF itself and continue reading up on it. Note: To be careful in general with AI tools in the \~100-125 questions I asked it did get \~2-4 questions wrong.

* Sybex Practice Test \~1100 questions + additional 180 questions from 2 practice exams

   * Port Deck \~ 50 cards (\~25 x 2) - Taken from Network+ Exam Objectives
      * Completed Deck in both formats (i.e. port on front and protocol on front). 

**How I Would Do It Over:** First cramming it in 12 days is dumb, but regardless day limit if I only had 70-90 hours to study, I would watch Professor Messer's video series in 2x, complete all \~1100 questions in Sybex practice book and additional 180 questions from two practice exams included, complete all 4 TotalSems practices test, and all 6 Jason Dion test. I would also complete either Anki deck or flash cards containing all required acronyms and another deck for required ports. Additionally, I would watch the 14-video series on PBQs on the day or a day or two prior to taking the exam. Lastly, make a note of anything you have terrible memorizing to review day of the exam ideally less than 1-2 hrs of material. For it was RAID levels, Severity levels, 802.11, and various fiber optics connectors.  This could be done in a week if you have 10 hours a day to spend for 7 days in a row, or could be done over 1-2 months. Regardless of the person, I truly don’t think going past 3 months is helpful as you will start to forget stuff. We’ve known since 1968 from psychologist [Dr. Welford's study titled ‘Fundamentals of Skills’](https://gwern.net/doc/psychology/1968-welford-fundamentalsofskill.pdf) that learning acquisition starts to diminish after studying the same topic for more than 3 hours in a row. This was also confirmed multiple times in more modern studies with some suggesting in less time on a single topic.  The longer after you will start to see diminishing returns. I would recommend around \~3 hours a day for a period of 25-30 days which would be 80-90 hours. 

**What's Next For Me:** After completing the Network+, I want to move onto penetration testing. I've bought vouchers for eJPT & eCPT. I will complete both of those before the end of this year and then move onto the OSCP by the end of this year. During this time I will also probably some time to study for Security+ between now and the end of the year. But I will never cram in this short of a time frame again because it was wayy to stressful and between studying for Network+, graduate school, and my research I was getting \~4-5 hours of sleep a night for two weeks straight.

**Final Note:** If you actually read all of this you are a MAD MAN, and you really should do something more useful with your time. Regardless, hopefully, this helped someone by either setting them on the right path or inspires that they don’t need to give up if their voucher is about to expire. You can do this people! 

**TLDR:** Don’t constantly use multiple video courses, and a book to learn the material. Pick one thing, such as Professor Messer's Video series, then focus on practice questions, practice questions, practice questions!! I recommend Sybex Practice Tests as it has \~1100 questions split between 5 domains plus in additional 180 questions from 2 practice exams included. Additionally do as many practice tests as you can, ideally including Jason Dion 6 practice exams. Your main form of learning should be through the practice exams and practice questions and learning why you failed or got a question correct. Even if you got a question correct take a moment to understand why it is correct and why the other options wouldn’t work. Ideally spend \~3 hours a day for maximal acquisition before diminishing returns, over the course of 30 days (\~90 hrs). This is enough time to complete all the information mentioned in the “How I Would Do It Over” section and be extremely comfortable on the exam for the vast majority of people."

I'm a 26-year-old GED teacher working in a state men's correctional facility. Since working here, I’ve found great value in my role. I’ve built positive relationships with my students, but recently, my boss has been singling me out in a manner I find troubling. I’ve since ChatGPT’d and submitted my two-week resignation notice and am contemplating whether or not to speak to her supervisor after my departure. I’m concerned about whether this would bring about retaliation. 

My boss was hired as our supervisor about two months before I transferred from another facility. Although she didn’t hire me, I am the only teacher who started after her arrival. While other teachers are allowed to leave their classrooms freely, my boss reprimands me even if I step out briefly to make copies or get water. A few months ago, I was moved to a new classroom with a window directly visible from her office, due to another teacher’s resignation. Initially, I was open to her feedback and made efforts to incorporate it, but her criticism has become increasingly harsh over the past month and a half. 

I was expected to manage 'highly important and frequently audited' attendance forms and maintain accurate enrollment records for my classes without any formal training.  Im often chastised publicly about my mistakes. During a meeting, I asked a question about attendance tracking, and rather than receiving a simple answer, I was aggressively criticized in front of my peers for errors on my forms, which she claimed indicated my failure to track student progress effectively.

Once I learned how to update student enrollment, I made it a point to check and update records daily. However, when classification was slow in processing the names I submitted, my boss, who was also responsible for signing off on my employment form (for a second job I hold as a professor after hours), acted as though she was doing me a favor by signing it. She criticized me again for allegedly not keeping student numbers up-to-date, implying that it affected her confidence in my ability to handle my second job. Although the classification update was completed later that evening, my boss never once apologized for the unnecessary scolding. 

Yesterday, I reached my breaking point. While I was in the library making copies before class, my boss and another teacher were present. Instead of asking me politely to wait outside, she bluntly instructed me to leave. She then called me into her office and brought the other teacher along, revealing that this teacher had seen one of my students sleeping in class before I did. My boss used this incident to criticize my awareness of classroom activities. It was clear that the other teacher had reported me rather than addressing it with me directly. My boss then emailed me a summary of the conversation, threatening a writeup if the issue recurred. I am now questioning if speaking to her superior would be justified or if it would make me TA.

1fgoubq,3,2024-09-14,Recovering Addict seeking Support (not a handout or loan) to get life back on track.,u/ObjectiveCarrot7066,GamblingRecovery,https://www.reddit.com/r/GamblingRecovery/comments/1fgoubq/recovering_addict_seeking_support_not_a_handout/,"Hi. I am a gambling addict.   
  
I will be honest and upfront about the reason for my post. I need work. or help getting back into a career of some sort, from non-judging fellow addicts who have been through this experience. I am based in India.

I struggled with an addiction to trading options for 14 years. Unfortunately I worked in a place that nabled my addiction and I was very good at lying about its severity. I have made two failed attempts at recovery that lasted 2 years and 1 year. This is my third attempt. 

I was a great student in school. In high school I was in the top 0.1% percentile of my country, such were my scores. Went to the best engineering college in my country. I joined a tech firm straight out of college where I used to code in java. Then I joined a firm where we worked in financial markets. And I got hooked on options trading. I used to scoff at gambling and sports betting as scams but somehow my logic failed me when it came to markets. From 2008 - 2019. after paying rent, the rest of my paycheck would go straight into trading options. In nearly 12 years I lost about 75% of all that I earned. I defaulted and settled credit cards so I can no longer borrow. Gambling in stocks cost me opportunities in career progression. My career stagnated. Finally I got laid off in 2019, and since then have been freelancing. 

I support my sister who has a severe OCD and anger issues, so I can't afford therapy for myself. I also have 4 rescued cats since 2019. Raising them has helped me enormously with my mental health. I would like to go back to college and get a part-time masters in Data Science but I am barely making rent, so I can't. 

I have borrowed from nearly all of my acquaintances who know I am under-unemployed, but they don't know the reason. I was seen as a nice guy in school and college so when I sought help from friends they readily helped me, thinking I was in real trouble with money for reasons beyond my control. Now I am estranged from all of them because I owe them money. 

The trouble with a gambling addiction is that it tricks your brain into thinking it is the cure to itself. An alcoholic with a messed up liver would never in his sober moments think that drinking more would repair his liver but here in gambling, that one big score seems like the solution to all your problems, even if gambling caused them in the first place.

I'll be honest, I have considered killing myself at the darkest of times. But I feel it is the last remaining shred of decency in me that has held me back. The effect on my mother, the mess it would create for my landlord and his property price, the loans that I owe to friends that I hope to repay,  have stopped me from taking that step in my darkest times. And also the fear of messing it up and ending up in a coma or vegetative state and being an even bigger burden on my loved ones.  
  
I am having trouble getting back on my feet because there is great stigma attached to gambling addiction in my country. I tried to seek support in an investing forum but was dismissed as a degenerate. Employers would not look too kindly at my profile. 

I have worked nearly 15 years in areas related to financial markets but I can't work there anymore as seeing live markets is the biggest trigger. Outside of that experience, I have some teaching experience and am good at Math and Physics. But my past with the addiction raises questions on my CV. Moreover I have just crossed 40.

I was working as a Physics tutor (independent contractor) for an edtech company but now with ChatGPT, the work flow there has severely reduced and I am facing the same anxiety which pushed me to gambling earlier.

I am good with numbers, have a degree in Physics, can code (and learn), can write, make presentations, I have a really high IQ so I understand things quickly. I am well informed and read a lot. I have good communication skills and am a good teacher. I am gaining familiarity with generative AI tools. I am a hard worker and can work really long hours.

If you could employ me or help me in finding work remotely, please DM me. I will do anything. Small projects. Assignments, short-term, long term, anything. I am smart and a quick learner. I just need to get started on the recovery trail. Even something that pays minimum wage rate would help me get back. 

 If you could help, even with messages of support, please DM me."

1fgyqs0,1,2024-09-14,How should I proceed in my job hunting?,u/Wpgaard,recruitinghell,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1fgyqs0/how_should_i_proceed_in_my_job_hunting/,"So, to get the most important facts out of the way: I received my PhD in Biophysics in August last year and worked as a Post doc in the same lab until Feb this year. I've sent about 80-90 applications in the past 6 months. It way less than many people here. For the first three months I sent WAY less due to two reasons: 

1. I was moving to a new ""city"" with my GF and had to spent a 1.5 months full time completely renovating the place by myself while she was working.

2. I was way to confident and picky with my applications, thinking: ""Yeah, I should have proven myself now. I worked for 3.5 years through this PhD, managing several research projects by myself, supervising students, constantly having to learn new methods and skills to continue my research and literally written a small 200 page book on the whole ordeal.""

So far I've had 1 real interview, 1 ""soft"" interview, and 3 phone screenings.

After being completely humbled by the whole process (nobody seems to care about my previous work, only ""industry-relevant experience""), I've seriously stepped up my application-game and have streamlined the whole process by having a ""template"" resume and cover letter that I completely tailor to each job listing. I use AI extensively to speed up the process as much as possible by having chatGPT4 summarize and highlight the important points and keywords in each job listing, and do the rough resume/cover letter ""adaption"" that I then give a personal touch before sending it. However, the process of making these still takes anywhere from 1-4 hours pr application depending on how motivated I am about the position.

Now, the ""city"" I live in isn't the biggest in the world and its a small European country, so the amount of jobs where I can realistically be considered a suitable applicant isn't the greatest. I would say that approx. 1-4 new job listing that I would consider a decent fit are posted every week.

My problem is that we are starting to run into financial problems. I need a job within 2-3 months or we'll have trouble making ends meet. **How do I go about applying for jobs that have nothing to do with science and will ultimately only serve a purpose of making some money until I can hopefully find something I'm passionate about?** I cant really imagine that they will believe me if I write: ""Yeah, I'm just super passionate about working in a warehouse after having spent 3.5 years slaving in lab to get a doctoral degree""."
1fh3yln,1,2024-09-15,"If you allow the use of generative AI, be honest, would you mark a student down for using it?",u/number93bus,AskProfessors,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProfessors/comments/1fh3yln/if_you_allow_the_use_of_generative_ai_be_honest/,"I'm noticing more and more of my courses are allowing the use of gen-AI, there's usually something along the line of ""you are allowed to use generative AI as long as you cite it and acknowledge how you've used it"". I feel like given that a lot of students are going to use it anyway, this is a good way to provide some sort of accountability.

My university provides ways to use it as a tool and how to reference its use; the following is taken directly from my uni website:

>Where you have used generative AI to assist you with your assignment, you usually should acknowledge this. An acknowledgement might look something like this:

>*""Whilst the writing is my own and I take responsibility for all errors, ChatGPT was used to create the initial section structure for this essay.""*

>In other cases it may be more appropriate to acknowledge your use of generative AI tools in a way more akin to a “methods” section of a research paper:

>*""Initial text provided using ChatGPT. (2023, February 14). Prompt: “What procedures should be taken to avoid the mis-use of generative A.I. in education”.*   
Or ""*First draft of introduction generated by Microsoft Word Editor Summary tool. (2023, February 14).""*

Up until now, I've written all of my assignments myself (Scout's honour!), and I've recently been learning how to use AI for things like what's stated above, like structuring paragraphs, organising my research notes, or putting (my own) ideas into a prompt to help me draft and then editing or rewriting it so its the way I want to say it. For me, it's almost akin to having a conversation with someone about what I'm writing, I used to do that with my ex-roommate and just talking about what I'm working on would help me know and formulate what I was really trying to say or explain in the report.

Sorry, I'm getting a bit off topic. My question really, is if a student did use AI, in a way that was allowed by the university, and you saw an acknowledgement of this while you were reading their work - would you mark them differently than another student who didn't use AI?"
1fh63l3,11,2024-09-15,"Appreciation, Insight & Overview of my Air Force application process experience (ASVAB & MEPS) Long post sorry",u/Recklesslfe95,AirForceRecruits,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirForceRecruits/comments/1fh63l3/appreciation_insight_overview_of_my_air_force/,"Hey ladies and gentlemen,

TL:DR Below. Not much of TL:DR though to be honest.

I'm not sure if my recruiter uses reddit but (I honestly hope he doesn't, because I don't know why but I would feel embarrassed if I knew that he read this and deduced that it was me.) I want to thank my recruiter, responding and helping me with my process even on his time off. Everyone's time is valuable so I really appreciate everything he's done for me so far. I also want to thank everyone on this sub for their answers and questions on previous posts. I'd also like to thank my MEPS Military Liaisons & Personnel.

So everything is relative, but my process has been nothing but pleasant and quick paced. Through the official Air Force recruiting website I submitted my interest. (August 23rd, 2024). The following day I got a call, but I was working and missed the call. (He also sent a text message). I responded at 06:45 with a text the next morning (Sorry Sergeant) confirming my interest.

The upcoming Tuesday I received another phone call we discussed some stuff over the phone (can't remember too much) and set an in person appointment for Thursday (August 29th).

**If you're not interested in what we talked about you can skip this next paragraph. We didn't talk about too much because most of the questions I had were asked and answered previously by this sub.**

From what I can recall over the phone we discussed my reason for wanting to serve in the Air Force. We talked about realistic expectations regarding booking certain AFSCs, chances of being stationed OCONUS. Then we just went over basic documents. (Home address, Date of Birth, Etc.) Basically anything you would find on the AFCEP. Which I believe is what recruiters fill out to pre-screen you for MEPS. I went home and filled out and THOUGHT I submitted it that night. However, honestly that whole portal and process can be wonky. I rechecked a couple days later and saw a form I didn't submit. I filled it out and submitted the full AFCEP. Somehow, I submitted one of the pages blank, so my recruiter called me the next day and helped me fill it out over the phone.

The only thing that my recruiter was waiting for was a picture of my Social Security Card that I had to reorder. I ordered it prior to the meeting with my recruiter on the Friday before labor day. I received the card on (Thursday Sept 5th) after work. I shot a text message over to my recruiter and and sent a picture of my SSC through email. Literally three hours later he messages me with a confirmed date of MEPS for my ASVAB and Physical. (Thursday & Friday September 12th and 13th).

**Background**

So for some background I am a 29M born in 1995. I am a Korean-American born in NY and moved to PA about 8 years ago. I have attended some college (Community College) in NY and in PA. For the past 8 years I have been working as an Automotive Technician at my family's shop. I did attend Automotive school (2016-2017) and passed with a 4.0GPA not really impressive IMO I mean I have to know the theory & application to be able to work right?

Community college in NY (2013-2015) was a integrated program with where you would live on campus and transfer over to a SUNY if you had a good enough GPA. Well I dicked around in college and found out.

Community college in PA (2019-2020) yeah I was getting tired of being an Automotive Technician so I started to take Anatomy and Physiology and what not to try and become a nurse. I was taking night classes after work so that maybe I could change my career. I had a 4.0GPA making the Dean's list. Then Covid happened.

Honestly, since at the repair shop it was just my father and I it would've been hard to attend any classes that required clinic hours/labs. Since most schools only have clinic hours in the morning or what not. So Covid plus classes not aligning I guess that goal just slowly faded away.

During high school & middle school I was an absolute horrible student. (Some of you probably are probably thinking man, he's probably just exaggerating). I wasn't a disruptive student, its just that I did no homework, projects and skipped class. I mean like I skipped class to play like StarCraft in the library with seniors (HA NERD). I mean like horrible grades I got like a D in geometry, D in Chemistry, you name it I probably failed it. I got a 14/100 on a Spanish test in 9th grade like.. yeah.

At one point in my senior year I have no idea what got the best of me I signed up for AP Bio.(Maybe there was a girl that I liked?) I actually tried my ass off for the first quiz got a 9/10. I kid you not my guidance counselor came up to the class that day and pulled me out of the class. She literally made me drop the class. Man in hindsight I totally understand why she did that, like this kid with a 2.4GPA weighted is taking this class? Oh hell no. I think I was also taking AP composition at the time and I think I just felt kind of embarrassed and asked that teacher if I could drop the class as well.

At the time my school had support classes for students who were obviously struggling. But my dumbass was too embarrassed to be seen in those classes so I didn't go. I've been to summer school for failing classes. Granted when I went there I got A's so the teacher and other students were like why are you even here bro. I just lied and said I wanted an A, LOL believable for an Asian student am I right?

**Why am I bringing up my absolutely stellar High school academic records? (Sarcasm if you didn't read the last section).**

When I went to MEPS and talked to the other applicants they were mostly young people some were still in High school. Obviously ASVAB scores came up and a common theme I heard from some of the recruits were ""Oh, you guys are Air Force? You guys are smart"". I heard this mostly from Marine recruits. I said ""No man, ASVAB score doesn't mean you're smart or dumb. Plus after you get to BMT nobody cares probably."" I genuinely asked like did you try your hardest to study? ""No"". ""Hey man, honestly in my opinion the ASVAB is a test of acquired knowledge. I hate to use the word uneducated because it has such a negative connotation but it doesn't mean you're dumb at all"". ""I've been uneducated forever, but being dumb is like me for not trying and skipping class in high school. This doesn't mean you aren't intelligent"". I mean sure intelligence could maybe be measured by how fast a concept is understood but there are so many different types of intelligence.

Just because someone might not know anything about cars are they stupid? No, you are just uneducated on the topic.

I've seen over and over on this sub ""It's literally a 10th grade knowledge assessment."" Yeah true, but a lot of people worried may have struggled in High School for whatever the reason may be.

If you do poorly the first time, it's gonna suck and feel bad no doubt. It'll probably feel really disheartening and you might feel lost. It doesn't mean your are dumb or lacking in any way. Hopefully, you can find it in yourself to breathe, don't belittle yourself. It's so easy to be your own worst enemy. Don't do it.

If you put yourself in your friend's shoe and they told you ""Hey man, I bombed my ASVAB. I feel so freaking dumb."" If they laugh at you get new friends. If your friend came to you in a time of need, you wouldn't say that to them. If you wouldn't say that to your friend why would you say that to yourself. If you're a masochist, I mean shit no kink shaming I guess.

**How much did I study?**

I did not take the PIcat. Didn't even know about the cyber test.

Honestly? I studied from the day my MEPS appointment was set to the day I took it. One Week. I didn't focus on Assembling Objects, Auto and Shop, and Electronics Information.

Before you say I forgot Mechanical Knowledge no, as mechanic I can tell you I'M NOT calculating gear ratio or whatever. Newton's law? Pulley systems? Mechanical advantage?

What I did focus on is Math. I used Grammar Hero on YouTube. Any question I did not get right I would copy paste that into ChatGPT and ask for another variation. I kept solving new questions till I felt comfortable. Use ChatGPT!! I took two practice tests on ASVAB for dummies and used uniontestprep.

Know your formulas. Pythagorean Theorem, Circumference of a circle, Radius of a circle, Volume of a square, Volume of a rectangle, Area of a triangle. Know some basic conversions 16oz = 1lb. 3 feet = 1 yard. Learn to set up proportions from word problems.

Yes I worked, came home and studies for hours. Did I want to play Valorant and get flamed by kids half my age? Hell yeah I'm a glutton for punishment. (Immortal 3 peak sorry weird flex).

Anyways the point is, it might feel uncomfortable or overwhelming in the beginning but as long as you keep putting in the effort soon you'll start getting it. I believe in you.

**Physical at MEPS**

Look first off I understand if the personnel can come off a bit harsh initially. From their perspective they've been processing hundreds of recruits every week. Day in day out you have to do essentially the same thing for every recruit. So if you're dicking around A LOT they're going to get annoyed. They don't mind small whispering or occasional laughs.

Also don't screw over your fellow applicants. Some people are going to be taking the hearing test. This can DQ people and change what they qualify for. Don't be a dick and mess up someone's future. You wouldn't want your future messed with right?

Your recruiter should tell you, but don't drink coffee, don't eat too much, don't use the pool if its open, definitely don't drink. (Common sense stuff come on guys). Reduce the possible things that can lead to a DQ because you do not want to go back and get waivers TRUST ME. Someone needed documentation for braces, which they didn't have (weren't told I guess). Someone didn't bring glasses.

Three stations (Blood Pressure, Eyesight, Hearing).

Breathalyzer Test.

Three other tests (Urine, Blood and One on One physical with the Physician). One on One can take up to 30+ minutes per person.

Wake up call is 03:45. Breakfast by 04:15. Left the hotel by 5:05. Arrived at MEPS. Personally, I got all my medical stuff done quick. Met with my Military Liaisons filled out remaining documents. Ready to swear in by 10:00. Had to wait a little ate lunch swore in at 13:30.

There was an awesome lady who had snacks and drinks for people that showed up to her office. A recruit asked me to get them a redbull, I found out she pays out of her own pocket for these snacks and drinks. (Felt bad). I can tell she is an awesome lady shoutout to her.

**Next Steps**

Just waiting for my recruiter to message me with a jobs list. It's Saturday so I didn't want to bother him. Priority AFSC for me personally would most likely be

Mental Health, Nursing, Cyber, Intel.

I already told my recruiter prior to taking the ASVAB that I would be okay with any AFSC to be honest.

I just want to ship out I am itching to go. I would love to be stationed in South Korea, Osan. For obvious reasons or Japan. I know, I'm not guaranteed anything and hope I can PCS after one year. I've been doing automotive repair for 8 years. If I have to do another 4 years in MX so be it.

Just need to help my father get safety and emission licenses for the shop and I am ready to go. (Pending background check as well)

**TL:DR**

I can only hope for everyone's process to go as smoothly as possible. If you have to take the ASVAB or retake it you can do it. Don't lose confidence in yourself, you are not dumb.

Oh bring a sweater I was freezing my ass off at MEPS. MEPS staff are people, they want to go home too. Do what you have to do, don't mess around too much.

Don't forget your social/ID. Bring your glasses.. If you have braces check if you need documentation for that.

ASVAB studying use Grammar Hero on YouTube. ChatGPT any questions you get wrong and ask for new variations of questions. I used ASVAB for dummies they have free PDFs. I did two practice tests. I also used uniontestprep. Know your math formulas.

Thank you to my recruiter for being so responsive and helpful.

Thanks to this sub for being helpful.

I'm nervous to see if u/aircrewscum posts some passive aggressive/sarcastic response. Lmao jk

Sorry for grammar didn't check too much.

Hopefully I can get assigned an AFSC soon and ship out by the beginning of November."

1fh7vvl,1,2024-09-15,I applied to 80 jobs in Germany and got 4 of them - here is how I did it being a non-German speaker,u/Dependent_Rule7083,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1fh7vvl/i_applied_to_80_jobs_in_germany_and_got_4_of_them/,"**About Me:**

So, I moved to Germany in 2021, to pursue a Master's in Artificial Intelligence at a public university. Before that, I had 4 years of experience as a software engineer in India, and I **didn't speak German**. Yep, you read that right.

Fast forward to 2024. I was doing my thesis, about to submit it, and started my full-time job hunt in January. Now, I did have a student job as a Data Scientist, but it was time to dive into the bigger pool and try not to drown. My goal? Apply to 10 serious jobs a day, plus 5 quick ""Easy Apply"" ones for good measure. **And yes, I customised my cover letter and resume every time. No other way, Sorry.**

I used a little ChatGPT hack for this. I'd input the company details, the job description, and my resume into ChatGPT (the free version, by the way), and it would generate a fresh resume and cover letter for each application. Each one took 25-40 minutes, so 10 apps a day? That’s like 6-7 hours. But I kept pushing.

Now, here’s where it gets interesting. After just 9-10 days and about 50 applications, I started getting calls. In 2 weeks, I had 18-20 interviews lined up—sometimes 3 in a day. Couldn’t finish all the home tasks, though, because I also had a final semester exam, which I couldn't miss and had to pass with a good grade.

Eventually, after two months of interviews, home projects, and culture fit rounds, I ended up with 4 job offers. I accepted a Data Scientist II position. 🎉

**Now, here are some takeaways for all my fellow immigrant students trying to break into the German job market:**

1. **YOU CAN DO IT.** Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise just because you do not speak German. If you meet the technical requirements and if you can perform well in the interviews, you **CAN 100% GET THE JOB.**
2. **TAILOR YOUR RESUME FOR EACH JOB:** Germany doesn’t do the “one size fits all” thing. For every job, you need to create a customised resume and cover letter. Sorry, but being lazy won’t work here. 🤷‍♂️
3. **Use ChatGPT for Cover Letters.** Seriously. Create a template for the prompt. Add the company details, your resume, a few keywords from the job description, and let ChatGPT work its magic.
4. **Think Like a Recruiter.** Pick the top 5 skills from the job description and make sure your resume highlights them in the first 2-3 seconds of scanning. I created a 4-line summary that I tweaked for each application. It worked like a charm.
5. **GitHub, GitHub, GitHub.** If you're in tech, upload your projects and put that GitHub link **at the top** of your resume. Optional, but highly recommended.
6. **Learn German (Optional).** It helps, but not speaking it won’t stop you from getting a job. Just don’t give up on the language entirely. It certainly will help, once you are in the job market.
7. **Don’t Ask for Crazy Salaries (Yet).** Get your foot in the door first. Once you're in, **then** you can negotiate raises, or switch for better pay.

I know this might sound preachy, but if you follow these steps, I genuinely believe you’ll land your first job within 3-6 months. Good luck, guys! 🍀"

During our time together as a group there were only three out of the ten of us working but I noticed that the two other students were using chatgpt or other ai to write their parts of the essay and just making the others edit and proofread it (the others didn't do it, I did), and a few of the other members said that they were working on projects for other classes at the time and would just make their part during the weekend. Before it was announced as a group project, I had already written an essay of my own and had planned to enter under my name rather than to represent my class.

That weekend I was constantly asking them for update and no-one answered, an hour before the deadline I checked on our progress and say that only 2/3 of the essay was done and most of it was made using AI or not connected to the theme. At the last minute I asked them if they wanted to pass what we had, and no one saw my message; so instead I sent mine in under the name of our class. 

2 days later, they finished the essay. The deadline was over, they still sent it in, the judging is a day away and we didn't place, but they saw that it was ny essay on display and not theirs. They still got credit for it because it's not explicitly under my name but they're still mad that I sent in mine and not theirs.

I'm a teacher with several tough preps and am looking in to seeing if things like the following are possible that could help me and my students:

* Create AP (college level) multiple choice questions based on specific content.  For example I teach AP Psychology and would love to be able to tell the model to create me some DOK level 2, AP Psychology questions about the limbic system.
* Give the model a rubric and a general answer framework for a specific type of essay question.  

  
Just pointing me in the direction for this would be wonderful. I'm pretty lost."

Becoming a billionaire means that you have amassed a significant amount of wealth.

This wealth can provide you with financial freedom, allowing you to live the lifestyle you desire without worrying about money.

You can travel the world, buy a luxury home, or invest in your favourite hobbies without the constraints of a tight budget.

# 2. Philanthropy.

Billionaires can make a significant impact on the world through philanthropy.

By donating their wealth to charitable causes, billionaires can make a positive difference in the lives of others.

They can support education, healthcare, environmental conservation, and other causes that they are passionate about.

By becoming a billionaire, you can use your wealth to make a difference and leave a lasting legacy.

# 3. Entrepreneurship.

Many billionaires have achieved their wealth through entrepreneurship. Starting a business can be a challenging and rewarding experience, and becoming a billionaire can be a validation of your hard work and dedication.

By creating a successful business, you can make a positive impact on your community and the economy as a whole.

# 4. Influence.

Billionaires have a significant amount of influence in society. They can use their wealth and status to effect change and influence policy decisions.

They can also inspire others to pursue their dreams and achieve their goals.

By becoming a billionaire, you can become a role model for others and use your influence to make a positive impact on the world.

# Here are The Best Business Industries To Make You a Billionaire.

Becoming a billionaire is a goal that many entrepreneurs aspire to achieve. While it may seem like an unattainable dream, certain business industries have the potential to make you a billionaire.

These industries require innovation, dedication, and hard work, but the rewards can be substantial.

In this article, we will explore some of the business industries that have created billionaires and the characteristics that have made them successful.

# 1. Technology.

The technology industry has created some of the world’s wealthiest individuals, including Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg.

The technology sector is constantly evolving, and innovations are constantly being introduced, creating new opportunities for entrepreneurs to create successful businesses.

Developing new software, hardware, and services can create enormous value and generate significant wealth.

However, success in the technology industry requires innovation, creativity, and a deep understanding of the market.

# 2. Finance and Investments.

The finance and investment industry is another sector that has created many billionaires.

Individuals like Warren Buffett and George Soros have amassed their wealth through investment and finance.

This industry provides opportunities for entrepreneurs to create and manage investment funds, venture capital firms, and other financial institutions.

Success in this industry requires a strong understanding of finance and investment, as well as the ability to manage risk and make informed investment decisions.

# 3. Real Estate.

Real estate has created many billionaires, including Donald Trump and Sam Zell.

This industry provides opportunities for entrepreneurs to buy and sell properties, develop real estate projects, and manage rental properties.

Success in this industry requires a deep understanding of the real estate market, as well as the ability to identify and execute profitable real estate transactions.

# 4. Energy.

The energy industry has also created many billionaires, including oil magnate, J. Paul Getty.

This industry provides opportunities for entrepreneurs to develop and manage energy resources, including oil, gas, and renewable energy sources.

Success in this industry requires a strong understanding of the energy market, as well as the ability to identify and develop profitable energy projects.

# 5. Retail.

Retail is another industry that has created many billionaires, including Amancio Ortega, the founder of Zara.

This industry provides opportunities for entrepreneurs to develop and sell products directly to consumers through physical and online stores.

Success in this industry requires a deep understanding of consumer behaviour and preferences, as well as the ability to develop and market products that appeal to a wide range of customers.

# 6. Education.

So before I drop my insight on how education can make you a billionaire, here is some data I was able to gather on the internet.

According to research, it has been discovered that more than 129.2 million girls worldwide are out of school; children across the world have lost an average of one-third (74 days) of education due to school closures and a lack of access to remote learning.

By 2030, countries must recruit 69 million teachers to provide every child with primary and secondary education, and 67 million more children have had access to quality teachers since 2002.

This data means something: the government cannot afford to fund education anymore, even if they do, maybe in high-income countries like the USA, Canada and the EU.

Here is the perfect time to disrupt this industry. With the rise of online educational platforms, otherwise known as e-learning, such as Udemy Coursera and many others, it has started happening.

E-learning transfers skills and knowledge to many recipients simultaneously without the involvement of human elements.

# 7. Healthcare.

Health care is another industry that governments around the globe cannot disrupt.

The healthcare industry seeks disruptors, and this presents an opportunity for everyone who wants to make a solid contribution to the industry.

According to the World Health Organization, do you know two years into the Sustainable Development Goals era, global spending on health continues to rise.

It was US$ 7.8 trillion in 2017 or about 10% of GDP and $1,080 per capita — up from US$ 7.6 trillion in 2016. The health sector continues to expand faster than the economy worldwide.

Across low-income countries, the average health spending was only US$ 41 a person in 2017, Compared with US$ 2,937 in high-income countries — a difference of more than 70 times.

High-income countries account for about 80% of global spending, but the middle-income country share increased from 13% to 19% of global expenditure between 2000 and 2017.

This tells you that there is so much untapped opportunity in the healthcare industry. You don’t need a medical degree to disrupt the healthcare industry.

You can develop a solution to help people access healthcare more easily, one of which is telemedicine, a significant contributor to healthcare inclusion in developing countries across the world.

# 8. Gaming.

The gaming industry has evolved from traditional game consoles into what we now know as virtual reality, which is integrated with cryptocurrencies.

All you needed was a control pad, television, gaming console and a dummy character till you got tired. Video games are a billion-dollar business and have been for many years.

2020 the worldwide PC gaming market revenue was estimated at 37 billion U.S. dollars. With over 48% of gaming studios working on VR/AR games, it’s safe to say that the gaming industry is worth investing in.

* [What is The Metaverse and How Can You Make Money With It](https://tchelete.com/what-is-the-metaverse-and-how-can-you-make-money-with-it/)

# 9. Transportation.

Transport is often one industry that we often overlook because we always want to leave it in the hands of the government to handle.

We can see that this is false because, for a company like Uber, which owns no single taxi but controls independent taxis worldwide, you would see that transportation remains an untapped industry.

Apart from road transportation, sea and air transportation have not been tapped into.

The global population is expected to surpass more than 10 Billion, the majority of which will have issues with transportation either by air, land or sea.

# 10. Automobile.

As mentioned earlier, the global population is expected to surpass more than 10 Billion by the end of the century, and one issue that is going to come up is the need for more cars on the roads.

More people are going to need as many cars as possible to move around comfortably on their own, and in low-income countries in Africa, this would be a challenge.

One way to help cushion this effect is for the emergence of new automobile manufacturers.

Though we have players such as Toyota, Honda and many others, the market is vast, and the cost is going as high as possible, leaving low-income countries to depend on pretty used cars from the West

However, with the emergence of new players in the industry, there is a considerable market gap to be met.

# 11. Tourism.

Global Tourism Industry is the largest industry, with a global economic contribution of US 7.6 Trillion in revenue.

With a global population of more than 8 Billion, people are more likely to change destinations in search of pleasure, business and greener pastures.

Among all the world’s cities, Tourists splash the highest amount of Cash of USD 28.50B in Dubai.

A region that used to be a desert has been converted into a tourist attraction to be reckoned globally with.

Sixty-eight years later, this number has increased to 1.4 billion international arrivals per year, a 56-fold increase. These stats, as discussed above, have proved how viable tourism can be all over the world.

Anyone can venture into tourism, irrespective of what field you choose. Areas ranging from Airlines, Hotels, and many more do a profitable tourism business.

I wrote a comprehensive guide on becoming a travel consultant and making money; check out the link below.

* [How To Become a Travel Consultant And Make Money](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-travel-consultant/)

# 12. Agriculture.

Farmers are among the Richest people In the USA and Australia, also across various parts of the world.

The Agriculture sector is the single largest employer globally after the manufacturing industry.

Almost all industries depend on agricultural raw products. Agriculture is the backbone of all countries.

Each country’s GDP, economy, development, etc., depends on agricultural growth.

To sustain the global agricultural demand, Farmers need to produce 70% more food because the population will nearly hit 10 Billion by 2050.

The most profitable farming businesses across the globe include the Crop farming business, Livestock farming business, and general farming business ideas.

I wrote a comprehensive guide on how you can start an agricultural business without any hassle; check out the link to the article to learn more.

* [How To Start an Agricultural Business and Make Money](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-agricultural-business/)

# 13. Hospitality.

The hospitality Industry is an industry that touches the lives of almost every single person on earth in some way or another.

The hospitality industry goes side by side with the tourism industry because when tourists visit a new destination, they are inclined to see the hospitality sector.

The global hotel market alone generates more than $850 billion in revenue. According to hotel industry statistics, the income of the worldwide hotel industry is increasing day by day.

The hotel industry alone has been predicted to have annual revenue of about $550 billion in 2016. It is set to increase at a consistent pace in 2022 and beyond.

# 14. Aerospace.

Air remains the safest and fastest means of various forms of transportation, and this has created the need for more airlines to emerge.

Aeroplanes have revolutionized how we travel. At any given time, there are up to 20,000 aeroplanes in the skies.

Aeroplanes allow passengers to quickly travel long distances. Manufacturing companies known as aerospace manufacturing play a hugely responsible role in the construction of these aeroplanes.

While this is a difficult company to start or operate in, it is one industry that is going to remain evergreen.

Without any doubt, aeroplanes are used for various purposes such as military, and passengers, it all starts with choosing what field you intend to develop for.

As the global population continues to increase so will be demand for air transport, this is no doubt the best time to become an aeroplane manufacturer.

# 15. Cloud Technology.

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services — including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence — over the Internet.

Rather than owning their computing infrastructure or data centres, companies can rent access to anything from applications to storage from a cloud service provider.

The global cloud computing market size was valued at USD 368.97 billion in 2021 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 15.7% from 2022 to 2030.

Look all around you, everything you use is hosted on the cloud, social media, text messaging and Artificial intelligence.

The majority of cloud computing is dominated by companies such as Google, Apple, Microsoft and many others.

As the use of the cloud continues to play a significant role in today’s society, it remains an untapped industry

# 16. Movies.

The global movies and entertainment market size was valued at USD 90.92 billion in 2021 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 7.2% from 2022 to 2030.

North America dominated the movies & entertainment market with a share of 34.5% in 2021. This is attributable to the presence of Hollywood, the most established film industry in the world.

In addition, the highest number of screens in the region contributes to its larger share of the revenue.

Moreover, the shifting focus of key players towards untapped markets such as India and Africa is driving market growth in the region.

There is no better time to tap into the movie industry than now. You dont need to be an actor to tap into this huge industry, more technologies are needed to disrupt the movie industry such as studios, distribution and many more.

# 17. Smartphone Manufacturing.

A smartphone consists of an integrated computer and other features, such as web browsing, an operating system, as well as the ability to run software applications.

Increasing penetration of the Internet of Things is expected to boost the market growth. The global Smartphone market was valued at USD 273.9 Billion in 2021 and is forecasted to reach USD 520.7 Billion by the year 2030.

Top players like Apple, Samsung and many more dominate the smartphone market with more still expected to arrive.

The smartphone market is becoming increasingly bigger and people seek out more advancement, causing new features to be added yearly.

# 18. Food.

The global food and beverage market size is expected to grow from $5.8 trillion in 2021 to $6.4 trillion in 2022 at a growth rate of 9.7%.

The food and beverage market size is expected to grow to $8.9 trillion in 2026 at a compound annual growth rate of 8.7%.

The top opportunities in the food and beverages market segmented by distribution channel will arise in the supermarkets/hypermarkets market segment, which will gain $895.4 billion of global annual sales by 2026.

In addition, the organic food and beverage market and functional food and beverage market segments stand out as the health concerns of consumers continue to drive trends.

# 19. Fintech.

Fintech, or financial technology, is the term used to describe any technology that delivers financial services through software, such as online banking, mobile payment apps or even cryptocurrency.

As per [Statista.com](http://Statista.com), 66.7% share of bank executives believe Fintech will impact wallets and mobile payments globally.

In February 2020, there were 8,775 financial technology (Fintech) startups in the Americas, there were 7,385 such fFintechstartups in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, and there were 4,765 fFintechstartups in the Asia Pacific region. Source — Statista.com.

The global fintech market was worth $127.66 billion in 2018, and it is expected to reach $309.98 billion at a CAGR Of 24.8% through 2022. Source — [PRNewswire.com](http://PRNewswire.com)

Do you have an idea to help people move money from one place to the other? this is where Fintech comes into play.

# 20. Waste Management.

The total municipal solid waste (MSW) generation in 2018 was 292.4 million tons (U.S. short tons, unless specified) or 4.9 pounds per person per day.

Of the MSW generated, approximately 69 million tons were recycled and 25 million tons were composted.

Together, almost 94 million tons of MSW were recycled and composted, equivalent to a 32.1 per cent recycling and composting rate.

Waste-to-energy plants burn municipal solid waste, often called garbage or trash, to produce steam in a boiler that is used to generate electricity.

Waste-to-energy plants reduce 2,000 pounds of garbage to ash weighing about 300 pounds to 600 pounds, and they reduce the volume of waste by about 87%.

Developing nations in Africa need proper ways to manage their waste other than landfills which emit methane gas and fuel the effect of climate change.

Though a project like this is capital-intensive but remains largely untapped. The waste management industry can help these developing industries convert their waste into energy by burning them to ashes.

# Why Should I Sell Notebooks on Amazon KDP?

Ever doodled notebook design ideas or dreamt of seeing your creations on bookstore shelves?

But before you dive headfirst, let’s unpack why selling notebooks on KDP could be a fantastic fit for you.

# 1. Low Investment, Big Reach.

Unlike traditional publishing where printing costs can be a hurdle, KDP’s print-on-demand (POD) model eliminates that barrier. You don’t need to invest in thousands of notebooks upfront.

You design it, upload it, and Amazon handles the printing and shipping — all you pay is a per-book fee.

Plus, with Amazon’s massive reach, your notebooks can be seen by millions of potential customers worldwide.

Do you have a knack for designing quirky covers or love crafting unique layouts? KDP empowers you to bring your vision to life. From funky motivational quotes to inspirational landscapes, the creative canvas is yours.

You can even target specific niches — music lovers might crave staff-lined notebooks with musical note covers, while bullet journaling enthusiasts could appreciate layouts specifically designed for their passion.

# 3. Passive Income Potential.

Imagine this: you design a few notebooks, upload them, and then… kerching! Sales start rolling in.

The beauty of KDP is that once your notebooks are up, they can continue to generate sales without needing you to constantly hustle.

While it won’t happen overnight, building a portfolio of creative notebooks can lead to a steady stream of passive income.

# 4. Be Your Boss.

Tired of the 9-to-5 grind? KDP offers the freedom to be your boss. You set your prices, design your notebooks on your schedule, and have complete control over your brand. It’s a chance to build a creative business on your terms.

# How do I Sell Notebooks On Amazon KDP?

Hey there, fellow creative mind! Have you ever dreamt of seeing your notebooks gracing the shelves (well, virtual shelves) of Amazon?

Well, buckle up, because KDP (Kindle Direct Publishing) is your gateway to turning that dream into a reality.

Now, I know what you might be thinking: “Selling notebooks? Isn’t that a saturated market?”

Sure, there’s competition, but that also means there’s a huge audience of people looking for the perfect notebook. The key is to stand out and offer something unique.

Intrigued? Here’s how I turned my notebook-selling dreams into a reality using KDP:

# Step 1: Design Time!

This is where your creativity shines. Think about what kind of notebook you’d love to use yourself. Will it be a classic lined journal, a trendy bullet journal, or maybe a quirky grid notebook?

Here are some tips for designing your masterpiece:

* **High quality is Key:** People expect crisp, clean designs. Invest in some design software or consider hiring a freelancer for a polished look.
* **Find Your Niche:** Are you targeting students, artists, fitness fanatics? Tailor your design elements (colours, fonts, even inspirational quotes) to resonate with your ideal customer.
* **Free Resources are Your Friend:** Canva is a fantastic free design tool that offers plenty of notebook templates to get you started.

# Step 2: Uploading to KDP.

Once your notebook is a thing of beauty, it’s time to upload it to KDP. The process is fairly straightforward, but here are a few things to keep in mind:

* **Pick Your Title and Description:** Think SEO (Search Engine Optimization) here. Use keywords that people might search for when looking for notebooks.
* **Keywords are Crucial:** But don’t stuff them in unnaturally. Focus on relevant keywords that accurately describe your notebook.
* **Don’t Forget the Cover:** This is a potential buyer’s first impression, so make it count! Use high-resolution images and clear, eye-catching fonts.

# Step 3: Pricing and Royalties.

This is where you get to decide how much you earn per notebook sale. KDP offers a royalty calculator to help you determine the best pricing for your profit goals.

# Step 4: Publish and Promote!

Congratulations, your notebook is live on Amazon! But the work doesn’t stop there.

* **Spread the Word:** Tell your friends and family, promote your notebook on social media, and consider running targeted ads to reach your ideal audience.
* **Reviews are Gold:** Encourage customers to leave reviews. Positive reviews can significantly boost your sales.

# Sponsored.

Remember that feeling of wanting to make some extra cash online, but being overwhelmed by all the “get rich quick” schemes and conflicting advice? Yeah, me too.

Ever want to feel like an idi0t regardless of your education? Go open a wikipedia article on most mathematical topics, the same idea can and sometimes is conveyed with three or more different notations with no explanation of what the notation means, why it's being used, or why that use is valid. Every article is packed with symbols, terminology, and explanations skip about 50 steps even on some simpler topics. 

You can ask a question about many math subjects sure, to stackoverflow where it will be ignored for 14 hours and then removed for being a repost of a question that was asked in 2009 the answer to which you can't follow which is why you posted a new question in the first place. You can ask on reddit and a redditor will ask if you've googled the problem yet and insult you for asking the question. You can ask on Quora but the real question is why are you using Quora.

I could try reading a textbook or a research paper but when I have a question about one particular thing is that really a better option? And that is not touching on research papers intentionally being inaccessible to the vast majority of people because that is not who they are meant for. I could google the problem and go through one or two or twenty different links and skim through each one until I find something that makes sense or is helpful or relevant.

Or I could ask chatgpt o1, get a relatively comprehensive response in 10 seconds, make sure to check it for accuracy in its result/reasoning, and be able to ask it as many followups as I like until I fully understand what I'm doing. And best of all I don't get insulted for being curious

I don't understand why people shit on this thing. It's a major breakthrough for learning"

Clear the basics of quantum information theory. At that time I'm thinking to do master in quantum computing from foreign.  So started looking for research internship but here things started getting messy because from here things are out my understanding because my base in quantum physics is poor. I left my formula ev car project just 4 months before after main competition after giving one year into it. I started preparing for gate data science and ai , and I m doing pretty well in it confident that I get good ranks . I was doing gate because I was still unclear and want to master preferable from Germany either in ai or quantum computing so thought gate score will be in some German universities as my cg is low (7.53).
Now guess what just before two weeks of gate exam my 1.5 year relationship ended and it ended very badly. 
I scored 37 marks and qualifying marks is 37.1 . I was in depression, didn't able to get good internship in end of 3 rd year. Haven't  written any research paper inspite of doing one research project so also dropped master plan.

I was able manage to get one remote internship in quantum computing startup. 
I was researching on QML algorithm. And also researching about product, it is feasible or not, it is not something which can build on chatgpt, but requires proper research on diffusion models for particular problem statement.

# What is Hustler’s University?

Hustler’s University is a collection of online courses that are all meant to show you how to make money online.

You learn everything from basic affiliate marketing training to other money-making skills like generating passive income.

Hustlers University is a registered LLC with thousands of monthly paying customers and frequent student success stories.

It should be noted that as of the 14th of November 2022, Tate officially relaunched Hustlers University as **The Real World** and as of April 16th, 2023 after being released from Romanian Prison he has re-launched Hustlers University as the 4.0 version. Before then, it was called Hustlers University 2.0.

Hustler’s University 4.0 is a program run by **Andrew Tate** where he claims to show people different business ideas to earn money online.

The online course is described as a community where he and dozens of “War Room soldiers” show people how to make money.

To achieve that, they have a variety of online business programs where they offer stock analysis, options plays, crypto analysis, DeFi, E-commerce, Copywriting, Freelancing, Flipping, Financial Planning, Business Management, and more.

A‍ndrew vets every tutor personally and each of them makes anywhere from 10k to 500k a month in their select field.

The courses are offered under “campuses” whereby each campus covers a specific topic or way of making money online.

The campuses at Hustler’s University include the Copywriting Campus, E-Com Campus, Crypto Campus, Freelance Campus, Stocks Campus, Amazon FBA Campus, and Affiliate.

# How Hustlers University Online Business Works

Hustlers University is run on private Discord servers. Each of the campuses gets its own Discord server.

When you sign up for Hustlers University, you have to select one quadrant from the following:

* **Cash Poor Time Rich**: This category is for pure beginners where you can dedicate more than 28 available hours per week but have less than $5000 to invest.
* **Time Poor — Cash Poor**: This category is also for pure beginners who are broke because you need to have 28 available hours per week but less than $5000 free to invest.
* **Time Poor — Cash Rich**: This is for the people who have a bit of cash to spend and want to make more money but not enough time on their calendars. You dedicate less than 28 hours per week with more than $5000 free to invest.
* **Time Rich — Cash Rich**: This is for intermediates where you dedicate more than 28 available hours per week and should have more than $5000 free to invest.

The goal is to ultimately transition you to the final quadrant where you have a lot of time to spare and the money to invest in one of several business models.

Content is organized in a structured way that exists as both text and video lessons. They have also set up a dedicated resource channel to furnish members with all the information they need about the courses.

Although the course relies on Discord, the platform can pose a few challenges.

For example, the servers look a bit disorganized and sometimes it can be hard to tell who the tutor is (or who is running things).

# What You Learn in Hustler’s University 4.0

Hustlers University is broken down into various campuses, which are learning channels featuring video lessons through which you learn how to make money.

Here are the various campuses and what they entail:

# 1. Ecommerce Campus.

This course teaches you how to sell products online. The trainers show you how to start an online business starting with finding winning products, creating the perfect store, and generating traffic on your sites.

This is for people who are interested in finding a course that will show them how to streamline the whole process from having zero experience to owning a profitable online store.

The ecommerce campus comprises mostly text lessons (a majority of the content is in written form rather than in video format). However, there are some videos in the slideshow format.

It offers value because the lessons offer practical advice. Ecom is something many are covering lately, as we have seen with [Sophie *Howard*](https://nobsimreviews.com/sophie-howard/) and EcomBabes.

# 2. Affiliate Program.

The lessons you get in the Affiliate Marketing Campus are mostly text and there is an emphasis to promote HU itself. They offer basic affiliate marketing training to get you started.

In doing that, this veers into [Multi-Level Marketing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-level_marketing) territory and some have called it a pyramid scheme.

To its credit, Hustlers University is not pushy with this, and having reviewed the different content offered I would not call it a pyramid scheme since that is not the primary focus of Hustlers University.

When Andrew Tate was banned by multiple social media companies at the same time, he also [discontinued the Hustlers University affiliate program](https://www.indy100.com/celebrities/andrew-tate-hustlers-university-affiliate-marketing).

**Update December 2022:** Tate has reopened his affiliate program under the Real World. It’s one of the courses known as Sales & Marketing however it has now closed off to new members again for a 6 month training period.

# 3. Freelance Campus.

On this campus, you learn how to kickstart a freelancing career. The lessons come in both text and video formats. The information is structured well and it is easy to navigate.

# 4. Copywriting Campus.

The Copywriting Campus is the most popular. Everything is in video format and some of the lessons have additional materials, like online tools and PDF files.

# 5. Amazon FBA Campus.

In the Amazon FBA Campus, you learn how to get started in the [Amazon FBA](https://nobsimreviews.com/best-amazon-fba-course/) business. The lessons are in video format, augmented by text.

Amazon FBA stands for Fulfillment by Amazon. In this business model, you sell products online, but Amazon handles warehousing, fulfilling their orders, and shipping them out. This course teaches you how to find the most profitable products.

# 6. Crypto Campus.

The Crypto Campus shows you how to trade cryptocurrencies. This comes as no surprise because [Andrew is a big fan of cryptocurrencies](https://beincrypto.com/andrew-tate-endorses-bitcoin-saying-money-is-trash/) himself.

There are a ton of demonstrations where you learn the basics of crypto trading.

# 7. Stocks Campus.

This is the campus dedicated to investors. Here, you learn how to trade options.

To some people, trading options is often seen as more productive than trading other financial instruments, including stocks.

I have covered a ton of options courses from various gurus here before like [Ian King](https://nobsimreviews.com/ian-king-predictions/) and [Nomi Prins](https://nobsimreviews.com/nomi-prins-prediction/).

**8. AI Campus.**

With AI being one of the hottest trends of 2023 it was about time Tate covered it and that is exactly what he has done inside the upgraded HU4.0 aka The Portal.

AI Campus will be taught by professors who have been using AI such as ChatGPT4 and others to make money.

In our firsthand experience using AI in 2023 to help our business grow, we can testify that it is a great tool but does have a learning curve.

Knowing how to use it correctly with the help of HU4.0 professors will be a great addition to the other campuses.

# How Much does Hustlers University Cost?

The monthly subscription fee of Hustler’s University 4.0 is still **$49.99 per month** and in one year, you’ll spend close to $600. This price may increase but for now, it is locked in.

That can be quite expensive considering some of the lessons you get there can be found online for free. The upside is that you can cancel your subscription between months.

There are extra expenses in some of the courses and they will indicate that.

Once you pay, you will be guided by a **discord bot** that will provide the details and information regarding the rules and regulations of the program.

# Hustlers University Refund Policy

Hustlers University does not offer refunds. There is a strict no-refund policy which you agree to when you sign up.

If you cancel your subscription, do so before your membership is renewed.

Here is how it reads in the fine print:

>There is no contract and you are free to cancel your membership at any time by managing your membership. You will continue to have access to the content until after 30 days from your payment.

>However, due to the nature of our content, after-purchase refunds are NOT permitted and any chargebacks will be disputed with your credit merchant.

Always read the fine print before you sign up for a service that you are paying for to avoid misunderstandings later on.

# Benefits of Hustler’s University

# 1. Offers a sense of Community.

One of the most significant advantages of HU is that it gives you access to a hustler’s community of like-minded individuals.

Every day, you have access to thousands of fellow students with whom you can share your wins, ask questions, and help each other out.

# 2. No additional costs (for some courses).

A majority of courses don’t come with upsells, which is pretty common with such online programs. We’ve seen it before with many other programs.

# 3. It covers a lot of ground.

The courses are quite broad and they broach multiple subjects. Although some may not find this helpful, to beginners, it can be quite convenient to find a lot of information in one place.

# 4. The training is practical.

Andrew Tate claims that his tutors are people who are practitioners, not theorists.

This is evident in the training format because there is an emphasis on practical applications with demonstrations.

# Drawbacks of Hustler’s University

# 1. You can get better content elsewhere for free (sometimes).

If you have the time to spare, you can scour the internet for free courses that offer more knowledge. However, you need to know where to look.

# 2. No refunds.

Once you pay your monthly fee, they don’t offer refunds.

# 3. Some of the training feels disjointed.

I should emphasize that this only applies to some of the training because a lot of it is well-organized and structured well.

For example, the Copywriting course has structured its lessons well and it is quite intuitive.

On the other hand, the Stocks course requires you to complete a small quiz each time you go through a lesson and these quizzes may feel tedious.

# 4. Too much content can be overwhelming.

If you are new to the subject matter, it may not always be easy to find your way around.

In some courses, it feels like there’s so much in there that it can be overwhelming. You can easily get distracted and start jumping from one “shiny object” to the next.

# 5. Tons of controversy around Andrew Tate.

Andrew uses his online influence to steer traffic to his website, and things often get out of hand.

For example, he and his brother, Tristan, have been accused of using webcam girls to sell ‘sob stories’ to scam desperate men.

# 6. The messaging is inaccurate sometimes.

Although Andrew insists on setting realistic expectations, sometimes, they can be unrealistic.

For example, they incorrectly claim that ecommerce is an easy way to make money online.

# 7. The price for the subscription may rise.

The Hustlers University 4.0 price has been $49 per month but Andrew wants to increase that to $149 per month.

The condition for the increase will be when the course gets to 170,000 members in total.

There’s a counter that indicates how many members are enrolled and as of writing this, it stood at 168,334 members.

That shows that it is close to getting to 170K and a price increase will be actuated.

That, or Andrew Tate is using this tactic to instill a false sense of urgency where the price will never increase but will appear to be close to doing so.

# Is Hustlers University Legit?

After putting it to the test we can confirm **Hustlers University is legit**. Many people are skeptical about it because Andrew is controversial but if you judge it by its merits, you get what you pay for. The courses encourage you to set up legitimate business ventures.

For instance, you learn how to create ads and business pages and overall, it gives you a better understanding of the subject matter.

You will find students of Hustlers University reporting good results across all campuses and there are testimonials on the course order page, but these are not the most reliable ones — most of them praise the course overall but they gave me the impression of disingenuous reviews intended to give you a skewed view of the course.

The Hustlers University physical location also remains unknown and everything happens online. What we know is that The Tate Brothers are based in Romania (where they were arrested at the start of 2023).

Is Hustlers University worth the money? Well, it depends on what you want to get out of it.

Many students have made money and you can tell that the training proves effective for most people who put in the work consistently and learn the skills needed to do well.

That being said, there are no guarantees that you will make money by following the advice they give you in these courses.

# Conclusion.

Hustlers University is perfect for total beginners who want to learn any of the subjects covered on its various campuses.

The training certainly can also offer some value to people who are not complete beginners also.

That being said, the claim that you will start making money on your first day is going one too far, especially if you’re new to business and entrepreneurship.

From my experience, Hustler’s University is ideal for fans of Andrew Tate who have no problem paying $50 every month for a broad introduction to many ways of making money online and potentially attaining financial freedom.

I should mention that it is commendable how HU 4.0 is not full of unrealistic claims.

Once you are inside, you’ll find that it is not a get-rich-quick scheme because they emphasize the importance of putting in the work to get results.

There are still a few people who will try to make it sound easy, but they are in the minority.

Finally, one of the biggest criticisms of Hustlers University is that there are free courses that offer more knowledge, although they are not as comprehensive.

Also one of the main pros of HU is that the content is all in one place, and Andrew has done the work to put together knowledgeable people to teach the various topics.

As mentioned, as of **November 2022 Hustlers University is now rebranded to** **The Real World** and has expanded the campuses to cover lifestyle and fitness.

With the HU4.0 upgrade, the AI campus will also be available. HU4.0 and TRW are essentially the same thing.

To its credit, Hustlers University is not pushy with this, and having reviewed the different content offered I would not call it a pyramid scheme since that is not the primary focus of Hustlers University.

When Andrew Tate was banned by multiple social media companies at the same time, he also [discontinued the Hustlers University affiliate program](https://www.indy100.com/celebrities/andrew-tate-hustlers-university-affiliate-marketing).

**Update December 2022:** Tate has reopened his affiliate program under the Real World. It’s one of the courses known as Sales & Marketing however it has now closed off to new members again for a 6 month training period.

# 3. Freelance Campus.

On this campus, you learn how to kickstart a freelancing career. The lessons come in both text and video formats. The information is structured well and it is easy to navigate.

# 4. Copywriting Campus.

The Copywriting Campus is the most popular. Everything is in video format and some of the lessons have additional materials, like online tools and PDF files.

# 5. Amazon FBA Campus.

In the Amazon FBA Campus, you learn how to get started in the [Amazon FBA](https://nobsimreviews.com/best-amazon-fba-course/) business. The lessons are in video format, augmented by text.

Amazon FBA stands for Fulfillment by Amazon. In this business model, you sell products online, but Amazon handles warehousing, fulfilling their orders, and shipping them out. This course teaches you how to find the most profitable products.

# 6. Crypto Campus.

The Crypto Campus shows you how to trade cryptocurrencies. This comes as no surprise because [Andrew is a big fan of cryptocurrencies](https://beincrypto.com/andrew-tate-endorses-bitcoin-saying-money-is-trash/) himself.

There are a ton of demonstrations where you learn the basics of crypto trading.

# 7. Stocks Campus.

This is the campus dedicated to investors. Here, you learn how to trade options.

To some people, trading options is often seen as more productive than trading other financial instruments, including stocks.

I have covered a ton of options courses from various gurus here before like [Ian King](https://nobsimreviews.com/ian-king-predictions/) and [Nomi Prins](https://nobsimreviews.com/nomi-prins-prediction/).

**8. AI Campus.**

With AI being one of the hottest trends of 2023 it was about time Tate covered it and that is exactly what he has done inside the upgraded HU4.0 aka The Portal.

AI Campus will be taught by professors who have been using AI such as ChatGPT4 and others to make money.

In our firsthand experience using AI in 2023 to help our business grow, we can testify that it is a great tool but does have a learning curve.

Knowing how to use it correctly with the help of HU4.0 professors will be a great addition to the other campuses.

# How Much does Hustlers University Cost?

The monthly subscription fee of Hustler’s University 4.0 is still **$49.99 per month** and in one year, you’ll spend close to $600. This price may increase but for now, it is locked in.

That can be quite expensive considering some of the lessons you get there can be found online for free. The upside is that you can cancel your subscription between months.

There are extra expenses in some of the courses and they will indicate that.

Once you pay, you will be guided by a **discord bot** that will provide the details and information regarding the rules and regulations of the program.

# Hustlers University Refund Policy

Hustlers University does not offer refunds. There is a strict no-refund policy which you agree to when you sign up.

If you cancel your subscription, do so before your membership is renewed.

Here is how it reads in the fine print:

>

>

Always read the fine print before you sign up for a service that you are paying for to avoid misunderstandings later on.

# Benefits of Hustler’s University

# 1. Offers a sense of Community.

One of the most significant advantages of HU is that it gives you access to a hustler’s community of like-minded individuals.

Every day, you have access to thousands of fellow students with whom you can share your wins, ask questions, and help each other out.

# 2. No additional costs (for some courses).

A majority of courses don’t come with upsells, which is pretty common with such online programs. We’ve seen it before with many other programs.

# 3. It covers a lot of ground.

The courses are quite broad and they broach multiple subjects. Although some may not find this helpful, to beginners, it can be quite convenient to find a lot of information in one place.

# 4. The training is practical.

Andrew Tate claims that his tutors are people who are practitioners, not theorists.

This is evident in the training format because there is an emphasis on practical applications with demonstrations.

# Drawbacks of Hustler’s University

# 1. You can get better content elsewhere for free (sometimes).

If you have the time to spare, you can scour the internet for free courses that offer more knowledge. However, you need to know where to look.

# 2. No refunds.

Once you pay your monthly fee, they don’t offer refunds.

# 3. Some of the training feels disjointed.

I should emphasize that this only applies to some of the training because a lot of it is well-organized and structured well.

For example, the Copywriting course has structured its lessons well and it is quite intuitive.

On the other hand, the Stocks course requires you to complete a small quiz each time you go through a lesson and these quizzes may feel tedious.

# 4. Too much content can be overwhelming.

If you are new to the subject matter, it may not always be easy to find your way around.

In some courses, it feels like there’s so much in there that it can be overwhelming. You can easily get distracted and start jumping from one “shiny object” to the next.

# 5. Tons of controversy around Andrew Tate.

Andrew uses his online influence to steer traffic to his website, and things often get out of hand.

For example, he and his brother, Tristan, have been accused of using webcam girls to sell ‘sob stories’ to scam desperate men.

# 6. The messaging is inaccurate sometimes.

Although Andrew insists on setting realistic expectations, sometimes, they can be unrealistic.

For example, they incorrectly claim that ecommerce is an easy way to make money online.

# 7. The price for the subscription may rise.

The Hustlers University 4.0 price has been $49 per month but Andrew wants to increase that to $149 per month.

The condition for the increase will be when the course gets to 170,000 members in total.

There’s a counter that indicates how many members are enrolled and as of writing this, it stood at 168,334 members.

That shows that it is close to getting to 170K and a price increase will be actuated.

That, or Andrew Tate is using this tactic to instill a false sense of urgency where the price will never increase but will appear to be close to doing so.

# Is Hustlers University Legit?

After putting it to the test we can confirm **Hustlers University is legit**. Many people are skeptical about it because Andrew is controversial but if you judge it by its merits, you get what you pay for. The courses encourage you to set up legitimate business ventures.

For instance, you learn how to create ads and business pages and overall, it gives you a better understanding of the subject matter.

You will find students of Hustlers University reporting good results across all campuses and there are testimonials on the course order page, but these are not the most reliable ones — most of them praise the course overall but they gave me the impression of disingenuous reviews intended to give you a skewed view of the course.

The Hustlers University physical location also remains unknown and everything happens online. What we know is that The Tate Brothers are based in Romania (where they were arrested at the start of 2023).

Is Hustlers University worth the money? Well, it depends on what you want to get out of it.

Many students have made money and you can tell that the training proves effective for most people who put in the work consistently and learn the skills needed to do well.

That being said, there are no guarantees that you will make money by following the advice they give you in these courses.

# Conclusion.

Hustlers University is perfect for total beginners who want to learn any of the subjects covered on its various campuses.

The training certainly can also offer some value to people who are not complete beginners also.

That being said, the claim that you will start making money on your first day is going one too far, especially if you’re new to business and entrepreneurship.

From my experience, Hustler’s University is ideal for fans of Andrew Tate who have no problem paying $50 every month for a broad introduction to many ways of making money online and potentially attaining financial freedom.

I should mention that it is commendable how HU 4.0 is not full of unrealistic claims.

Once you are inside, you’ll find that it is not a get-rich-quick scheme because they emphasize the importance of putting in the work to get results.

There are still a few people who will try to make it sound easy, but they are in the minority.

Finally, one of the biggest criticisms of Hustlers University is that there are free courses that offer more knowledge, although they are not as comprehensive.

Also one of the main pros of HU is that the content is all in one place, and Andrew has done the work to put together knowledgeable people to teach the various topics.

As mentioned, as of **November 2022 Hustlers University is now rebranded to** **The Real World** and has expanded the campuses to cover lifestyle and fitness.

With the HU4.0 upgrade, the AI campus will also be available. HU4.0 and TRW are essentially the same thing.

1fhrhcc,3,2024-09-15,I love learning and I wish more of my fellow classmates felt the same way ,u/Fine_Economy989,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1fhrhcc/i_love_learning_and_i_wish_more_of_my_fellow/,"I’m a junior, I do political science and I am really in love with learning about political theory, and have discovered a lot of subjects that I am so excited to learn more about in school. When I go to class, I am enthusiastic to talk about the readings and just better my abilities in general. Of course there are lots of people around me with the same attitude, but it feels overwhelmed by students who just don’t care and want to ChatGPT their way through everything. It makes me worry for the future, because how the fuck are these people preparing themselves for any sort of job? Eventually they will have to have actual skills and not just fake their way through it. 

Then a lot of the people who ARE interested in learning are pretentious as hell and want to do everything to make themselves feel smarter than you. I also feel that as a very feminine woman I am not taken super seriously by some of the others interested in academia. 

It makes me sad that people can’t find the joy in learning anymore. They only want to find ways to do as little work as possible.

1fhs4w9,1,2024-09-15, ChatGPT 4 to OpenAI o1: The Next Leap in AI Reasoning,u/Clean-Fan-2727,StrangerThingsHappen,https://www.reddit.com/r/StrangerThingsHappen/comments/1fhs4w9/chatgpt_4_to_openai_o1_the_next_leap_in_ai/," OpenAI o1: The Next Leap in AI Reasoning OpenAI has just unveiled their latest breakthrough in artificial intelligence: the o1 model. This cutting-edge large language model represents a significant advancement in AI reasoning capabilities, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in machine learning.



https://preview.redd.it/yqdb52wxj2pd1.png?width=731&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfbfa251c44a87223a4b8f31c34d14184216c639

### Thinking Before Speaking



What sets o1 apart is its ability to ""think"" before responding. Unlike previous models that generate answers more directly, o1 produces an internal chain of thought, much like a human pondering a complex problem. This process allows for more nuanced and accurate responses, especially on challenging tasks.



### Impressive Benchmarks



The results speak for themselves. o1 has achieved remarkable performance across a range of difficult benchmarks:



- \*\*89th percentile\*\* on competitive programming questions (Codeforces)

- Ranked among the \*\*top 500 students\*\* in the USA Math Olympiad qualifier (AIME)

- \*\*Exceeded PhD-level accuracy\*\* on physics, biology, and chemistry problems (GPQA)

https://preview.redd.it/z0t1q102k2pd1.png?width=997&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec8603591acde7a234a8db8fd4d01dd4663887e9

### Learning to Reason



o1's capabilities come from a novel large-scale reinforcement learning algorithm. This approach teaches the model to use its chain of thought productively, resulting in a highly efficient training process. Interestingly, o1's performance consistently improves with both more training time and more time spent ""thinking"" during use.



### Outperforming Humans and Previous Models



In many reasoning-heavy tasks, o1 rivals or surpasses human expert performance. It significantly outperforms its predecessor, GPT-4o, on the vast majority of tested benchmarks. For example:



- On the 2024 AIME exams, o1 solved an average of 93% of problems, compared to GPT-4o's 12%.

- o1 became the first model to surpass human PhD experts on the challenging GPQA diamond benchmark.



### The Power of Chain of Thought



o1's success stems from its ability to refine its thinking process. Through reinforcement learning, it develops strategies to:



- Recognize and correct mistakes

- Break down complex problems into simpler steps

- Try alternative approaches when stuck



This mirrors the way humans tackle difficult questions, often thinking deeply before arriving at an answer.



### What's Next?



While o1 represents a significant leap forward, OpenAI acknowledges that work is still needed to make it as user-friendly as current models. They've released an early version, o1-preview, for use in ChatGPT and by trusted API users.



The implications of o1's capabilities are vast, potentially revolutionizing fields that require complex reasoning and problem-solving. As research continues, we can expect even more impressive advancements in AI's ability to think and reason in human-like ways.



Stay tuned for more developments in this exciting area of artificial intelligence!

# Does SurferSEO's Free AI Detector Work?

Everyone wants access to a free AI detector these days. So, when a new one pops up on our radar, we do our due diligence to tell you if the damn thing works. We usually save you the time and discover the tool is pretty ineffective against undetectable AI, but sometimes results can surprise us.

Today, we’re booting up SurferSEO’s free AI Detector to tell us whether our SEO-optimized article will get flagged by their AI detection tool. It may not be Turnitin, but if it’s online and free, you’ll bet someone somewhere has used it.

# What is An AI Detector?

Generative AI tools like ChatGPT use language models that optimize for utility. They want the outputs they generate to inform you about a topic to their best ability. This gives AI-generated text certain identifiable watermarks that an AI content detector’s machine learning is programmed to find. These watermarks include simple and precise word choice, sentence structure, and sentence length measured by perplexity and burstiness.

This article on our blog will give you a deeper understanding of [perplexity and burstiness in AI writing](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/how-do-perplexity-and-burstiness-make-ai-text-undetectable).

The industry’s best AI checker is Turnitin and even that system has a 4% false positive rate at the sentence level. Because Turnitin has both expensive pricing plans and unreliable software, some people simply declare [AI detectors don't work](https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/teach/ai-detectors-dont-work/) while others seek out free versions of AI detectors like Surfer SEO’s.

# What is Undetectable AI?

Undetectable AI services like StealthGPT rewrites text to make it feel human enough that AI content detectors can’t find the watermarks of AI writing in the text. Using natural language processors, undetectable AI thinks like people do when they write, with randomness, rhythm, and complexity. You can read this article about [AI writing vs human writing](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/07/25/humanizing-ai-four-secrets-to-fleshing-out-your-content/) from Forbes to understand the topic more deeply.

We are going to test SurferSEO’s free AI detector against two different kinds of writing tools. ChatGPT, Stealth AI, and even human writing. I have great faith in StealthGPT because we've mastered[ how to bypass AI Detectors.](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/bypassing-ai-detectors-stealthgpt)

# Does The SurferSEO AI Detector Work?

It should be noted that SurferSEO is a writing tool itself, meant for content creation with SEO in mind so content writers can have their articles rank on search engines. We’re only here to rate its AI detector, perhaps one day we can test SurferSEO and StealthGPT’s SEO Writer and see who’s the best AI for content creators.

SurferSEO also offers various integrations from Surfer API to various extensions. It offers an AI humanizer of its own and an AI writing assistant that will help you edit your text with a grammar checker.

# Testing Against ChatGPT

So, lets create some AI generated content with ChatGPT. We’ll make an article about surfing. Here’s a snapshot of it:

Now we need to take that article and paste it into SurferSEO's AI detector and see what happens.

I got an immediate 100% score of likely being AI. When I say immediate, I mean less than a second after pasting, which is a little suspect to be honest.

We need to give this software a bigger challenge before we jump to any conclusions though.

# Testing Against StealthGPT

Here is our essay after humanizing it with Stealth AI’s unparallaled AI humanizer tool.

As you can see, the article is more readable and human-like after the Stealth AI treatment. It should be able to bypass AI detectors with ease now. Here’s how it fared against Turnitin:

Our text received a perfect score of 0% AI generated against Turnitin. It’s established that StealthGPT uses more advanced AI than Turnitin AI detection though, this article is about testing our undetectable text against the free version of an AI detector that isn’t even the primary feature of a small content creation app.

So, this is what happened when StealthGPT went up against SurferSEO:

We bypassed their AI detection technology with a score of 34% likely AI, meaning SurferSEO determined the text was likely human and original content.

34% is not a score we pride ourselves in. It’s a score SurferSEO should pride itself in though, if you scour our numerous blogs testing various AI detection tools, this service does better than most tools.

# Testing Against Human Writing

Because I’m wary of the speed in which SurferSEO gave me a result, I’m going to feed it an article I wrote from our blog about how to use AI to run a blog and see if it will flag it as AI writing.

With a score of 0% AI-likelihood I will give this AI detector its flowers, it shows pretty good functionality.

# How Reliable is Surfer SEO’s AI Detector?

I would call it reliable. StealthGPT might’ve bypassed their AI detector but by a relatively bad score, and we bypassed everyone. It was completely correct about other pieces of content we passed through its service and it analyzed the text at a much faster rate than any other service you could find online from Turnitin to [Originality.AI](http://Originality.AI) and more.

Consider SurferSEO a reliable tool. And we only tried the free version of its AI detector, I would assume it's capablity making SEO content, editing, proofreading, researching, and grammar checking are also functional.

# Conclusion

SurferSEO’s free AI Detector does work. StealthGPT still bypassed it but we got a better score from a much more powerful and popular AI detector than Surfer SEO’s. If I wanted to give the AI Detector a grade, I would say it’s a B, which stands for beatable by StealthGPT.

With proven functionality against the industry's best, StealthGPT should always be your weapon of choice whether it's to bypass AI detectors or SEO writing that gets your content to rank on search engines. You can learn about our SEO writer here and visit our [pricing](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/pricing) page to find what plan works best for you. Whether you want to go pro or keep it basic, StealthGPT is the key to unlocking your potential as a creator.

# FAQ

# Is Using AI Writing Plagiarism?

Using text generated by artificial intelligence like OpenAI’s ChatGPT is not considered traditional plagiarism. Academic institutions consider it “AI plagiarism” because generative AI engines only create original content instead of stealing someone else’s words or ideas without proper credit. Read our article about [AI ethics in Academia](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/is-using-chatgpt-plagiarism-academic-dishonesty-in-dishonest-academia) for more.

# Who uses Undetectable AI?

Everyone from students to professionals. Anyone who uses text can find a use for undetectable AI services to write articles, essays, email, social media posts, and more. Undetectable AI writing just means human writing and if we want to use AI text, we certainly would prefer to use human writing than text that feels machine-like.

# Can I get a Chrome Extension or Gmail integration of an AI Detector?

Yes, many AI detectors and AI writing tools offer extensions to google apps from Chrome to Gmail."

For instance, medical school often comes with disorganized lecture slides and a huge amount of information to memorize. My idea is to build a tool that generates high-quality notes, multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and organizes study materials for better revision.

After researching, I found that existing tools can create notes and MCQs from PDFs, but I'm wondering they can fully understand the pdf since pdf structure is complex or they just throw the pdf to ai just like we give pdf to chatGPT? Plus, after I have discussion with some of the friends, many students aren’t even aware of these tools.

If I start this project, my platform would go beyond that. It would restructure messy lecture slides into organized notes, track question history, target wrong answers for focused review, and create mind maps. I also want to include social features so students, tutors, and professionals can share notes, collaborate on questions, and discuss difficult topics. This would build a learning community where everyone can support each other.

What do you think of this idea? Do you believe this kind of platform could be useful? I’d love to hear any thoughts or suggestions you might have!"

Well, guess what? You totally can! Amazon’s KDP (Kindle Direct Publishing) platform isn’t just for ebooks anymore. It’s a fantastic way for us creative folks to design and sell notebooks directly to customers.

Now, I’m not gonna sugarcoat it. There’s some work involved, but the process is surprisingly accessible.

Plus, the potential for passive income — that sweet feeling of getting paid every time someone buys your notebook — is pretty darn motivating!

In this guide, I’ll be walking you through everything you need to know to go from notebook newbie to KDP pro.

We’ll cover designing your masterpiece, uploading it to Amazon, optimizing your listing for sales, and even some marketing tips to get your notebooks seen by the right audience.

# Why Should I Sell Notebooks on Amazon KDP?

Ever doodled notebook design ideas or dreamt of seeing your creations on bookstore shelves?

Well, Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) platform might be your key to turning those dreams into reality.

But before you dive headfirst, let’s unpack why selling notebooks on KDP could be a fantastic fit for you.

# 1. Low Investment, Big Reach.

Unlike traditional publishing where printing costs can be a hurdle, KDP’s print-on-demand (POD) model eliminates that barrier. You don’t need to invest in thousands of notebooks upfront.

You design it, upload it, and Amazon handles the printing and shipping — all you pay is a per-book fee.

Plus, with Amazon’s massive reach, your notebooks can be seen by millions of potential customers worldwide.

# 2. Unleash Your Creativity.

Do you have a knack for designing quirky covers or love crafting unique layouts? KDP empowers you to bring your vision to life. From funky motivational quotes to inspirational landscapes, the creative canvas is yours.

You can even target specific niches — music lovers might crave staff-lined notebooks with musical note covers, while bullet journaling enthusiasts could appreciate layouts specifically designed for their passion.

# 3. Passive Income Potential.

Imagine this: you design a few notebooks, upload them, and then… kerching! Sales start rolling in.

The beauty of KDP is that once your notebooks are up, they can continue to generate sales without needing you to constantly hustle.

While it won’t happen overnight, building a portfolio of creative notebooks can lead to a steady stream of passive income.

# 4. Be Your Boss.

Tired of the 9-to-5 grind? KDP offers the freedom to be your boss. You set your prices, design your notebooks on your schedule, and have complete control over your brand. It’s a chance to build a creative business on your terms.

# 5. Experiment and Learn.

The world of notebook design is your playground! You can experiment with different cover styles, layouts, and interior content.

See what resonates with your audience and adapt your designs based on sales data.

KDP provides valuable sales insights that can help you refine your offerings and grow over time.

# How do I Sell Notebooks On Amazon KDP?

Hey there, fellow creative mind! Have you ever dreamt of seeing your notebooks gracing the shelves (well, virtual shelves) of Amazon?

Well, buckle up, because KDP (Kindle Direct Publishing) is your gateway to turning that dream into a reality.

Now, I know what you might be thinking: “Selling notebooks? Isn’t that a saturated market?”

Sure, there’s competition, but that also means there’s a huge audience of people looking for the perfect notebook. The key is to stand out and offer something unique.

Intrigued? Here’s how I turned my notebook-selling dreams into a reality using KDP:

# Step 1: Design Time!

This is where your creativity shines. Think about what kind of notebook you’d love to use yourself. Will it be a classic lined journal, a trendy bullet journal, or maybe a quirky grid notebook?

Here are some tips for designing your masterpiece:

* **High quality is Key:** People expect crisp, clean designs. Invest in some design software or consider hiring a freelancer for a polished look.
* **Find Your Niche:** Are you targeting students, artists, fitness fanatics? Tailor your design elements (colours, fonts, even inspirational quotes) to resonate with your ideal customer.
* **Free Resources are Your Friend:** Canva is a fantastic free design tool that offers plenty of notebook templates to get you started.

# Step 2: Uploading to KDP.

Once your notebook is a thing of beauty, it’s time to upload it to KDP. The process is fairly straightforward, but here are a few things to keep in mind:

* **Pick Your Title and Description:** Think SEO (Search Engine Optimization) here. Use keywords that people might search for when looking for notebooks.
* **Keywords are Crucial:** But don’t stuff them in unnaturally. Focus on relevant keywords that accurately describe your notebook.
* **Don’t Forget the Cover:** This is a potential buyer’s first impression, so make it count! Use high-resolution images and clear, eye-catching fonts.

# Step 3: Pricing and Royalties.

This is where you get to decide how much you earn per notebook sale. KDP offers a royalty calculator to help you determine the best pricing for your profit goals.

# Step 4: Publish and Promote!

Congratulations, your notebook is live on Amazon! But the work doesn’t stop there.

* **Spread the Word:** Tell your friends and family, promote your notebook on social media, and consider running targeted ads to reach your ideal audience.
* **Reviews are Gold:** Encourage customers to leave reviews. Positive reviews can significantly boost your sales.

Remember that feeling of wanting to make some extra cash online, but being overwhelmed by all the “get rich quick” schemes and conflicting advice? Yeah, me too.

1fhyx6m,2,2024-09-16,"Dr. Todd Grande: Videoanalysen: Ein kritischer Blick auf Gang-Stalking, V2K & Targeted Individuals: Wie moderne Technologien das Phänomen technisch induzierter Psychosen und Verfolgungswahn enthüllen // Aufbau rechtsextremer, bewaffneter (paramilitärischer) Strukturen durch den Verfassungsschutz",u/JamesTillyMatthews,u_JamesTillyMatthews,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_JamesTillyMatthews/comments/1fhyx6m/dr_todd_grande_videoanalysen_ein_kritischer_blick/,"**1. Einleitung: Skeptische Perspektive auf Gang-Stalking**

Die Mental-Health- und Self-Help-Videos von [Dr. Todd Grande \[Ph.D. in Counselor Education and Supervision\]](https://www.youtube.com/@DrGrande), die sich mit dem Phänomen des sogenannten ""Gang-Stalking"" und damit verbundenen Überzeugungen beschäftigen, nehmen häufig eine skeptische, psychologisch-orientierte Sichtweise auf das Thema ein. Grande stellt dar, dass viele Menschen, die sich als ""Targeted Individuals"" (gezielte Individuen) sehen, möglicherweise unter psychischen Erkrankungen wie Verfolgungswahn oder Schizophrenie leiden könnten. In seinen Analysen, insbesondere in Fällen wie Myron May, der glaubte, ein Opfer von Gang-Stalking zu sein und letztlich eine Schießerei an einer Universität verursachte, betont er die Gefahr von Wahnvorstellungen und die Rolle von psychischen Erkrankungen in solchen Fällen.

**2. Differenzierung: Gang-Stalking existiert, psychische Störungen sind nicht die Regel**

Wichtig ist hierbei, dass Dr. Grande nicht direkt darauf eingeht, dass das Phänomen des Gang-Stalking nicht existiert, sondern vielmehr auf die Schwierigkeit hinweist, zwischen realer Verfolgung und psychologischen Erklärungsmodellen zu differenzieren. Allerdings vertritt er überwiegend die These, dass viele der betroffenen Menschen an schwerwiegenden psychischen Störungen leiden könnten, was zu Fehlinterpretationen der Realität führt.

Das Phänomen der gezielten Verfolgung durch Gang-Stalking ist jedoch nicht einfach als Wahnvorstellung abzutun. Mehrere Berichte, wie auch in den von mir und anderen bereitgestellten Dokumenten, legen nahe, dass es sich um eine systematische Verfolgung handelt, die durch hochentwickelte Technologien wie Neurowaffen, elektromagnetische Strahlung und Mind-Control-Techniken ermöglicht wird​​.

**3. Belege für systematische Verfolgung: Technologien im Verborgenen**

Beweise und Analysen deuten darauf hin, dass verdeckte staatliche Strukturen in mehreren Industrienationen, einschließlich Deutschland, Technologien nutzen, die es ermöglichen, gezielt in die mentalen Prozesse von Individuen einzugreifen und deren Wahrnehmung und Verhalten zu manipulieren. Diese Technologien sind nicht nur Teil spekulativer Diskussionen, sondern es gibt fundierte Berichte über deren Entwicklung, wie beispielsweise das Havanna-Syndrom und andere Vorfälle, bei denen Mikrowellenwaffen auf Menschen angewendet wurden​.

**4. Dimension des Verbrechens: Unsichtbare Kriegsführung**

Tausende, wenn nicht Millionen von unschuldigen Zivilisten weltweit – darunter schätzungsweise 800.000 allein in Deutschland – sind Opfer präziser, technologisch fortgeschrittener Angriffe durch Direkte Energiewaffen (DEW) und elektromagnetische Neurowaffen geworden. Die Dunkelziffer ist enorm: 99,999 % wissen nicht, dass sie verfolgt werden, mehrere Millionen Menschen werden durch automatische Verfahren permanent gefilmt und beobachtet (auch und insbesondere mit technischer Gedankenkontrolle), ohne es zu bemerken (es fällt erst auf, wenn Mikrowellen-Sprachübertragung und/oder Elektroschocks eingesetzt werden). 

Diese Verbrechen, orchestriert von Geheimdiensten und unterstützt durch staatliche Strukturen, stellen eine der gefährlichsten und am besten gehüteten Menschenrechtsverletzungen unserer Zeit dar. Der Einsatz dieser Waffen geschieht nicht zufällig, sondern zielt bewusst auf ausgewählte Individuen, die systematisch verfolgt, gefoltert und psychisch sowie physisch zersetzt werden.

**5. Wahre Verfolgung vs. psychologische Erklärung: Unterschlagene Beweise**

Der Unterschied zwischen realer Verfolgung und Wahnvorstellungen ist in diesem Fall von zentraler Bedeutung. Während viele medizinische Fachleute, wie Dr. Grande, darauf hinweisen, dass psychische Störungen eine Rolle spielen könnten, ignorieren sie möglicherweise Berichte und Beweise über den Einsatz moderner Technologien durch Geheimdienste und andere Institutionen. Diese Berichte sind nicht nur ausgedachte Verschwörungstheorien, sondern basieren auf realen Vorfällen und technologischen Entwicklungen in der militärischen und geheimdienstlichen Forschung.

Die Vorstellung, dass der menschliche Geist unangreifbar sei, dass die Gedanken und Wahrnehmungen eines Menschen ausschließlich ihm selbst gehören, ist eine Illusion, die von den neuesten Entwicklungen in der Geheimdiensttechnologie widerlegt wird. Energie- und Neurowaffen ermöglichen es, Gedanken zu manipulieren, den freien Willen zu untergraben und die Wahrnehmung der Realität zu verzerren. Diese Technologien können gezielt paranoide Schizophrenie, Halluzinationen und Verfolgungswahn induzieren, indem elektromagnetische Strahlen das zentrale Nervensystem und das Gehirn angreifen – mit verheerenden Folgen für die Betroffenen. 

In der Realität handelt es sich nicht um Zufall, sondern um eine gezielte und brutale Form systematischer Gewalt, die im Verborgenen operiert.

**6. Manipulation der öffentlichen Meinung: Eine systematische Vertuschung**

Der Grund, warum die breite Bevölkerung noch immer nicht die volle Tragweite dieser Verbrechen erfasst, liegt nicht in der Abwesenheit von Beweisen, sondern in der systematischen Manipulation von Information und öffentlicher Meinung. Der Glaube an eine gerechte, heile Welt wird durch die Macht derjenigen genährt, die ein Interesse daran haben, die grausame Realität zu verschleiern. Diese Technologien sind real, sie sind einsatzbereit, und sie werden benutzt – nicht nur in Kriegsgebieten oder gegen feindliche Staaten, sondern direkt hier, mitten unter uns, gegen Zivilisten, die sich in keiner Weise wehren können.

Es ist eine bequeme Vorstellung, dass die tragischen Geschichten von Menschen, die an vermeintlich unerklärlichen psychischen Störungen oder körperlichen Beschwerden leiden, einfach Pech oder genetische Anomalien sind. Doch dieser Irrglaube schützt die Täter und isoliert die Opfer. In Wahrheit sterben allein in Deutschland täglich bis zu zehn Menschen an den direkten Folgen dieser unsichtbaren Kriegsführung, und weltweit sind Millionen betroffen – eine stille, unsichtbare, aber tödliche Gewalt, die sich jenseits des Vorstellbaren abspielt​​.

Die Frage, warum diese Verbrechen noch immer als Verschwörungstheorien abgetan werden, lässt sich leicht beantworten: Es ist einfacher, an eine unerschütterliche Weltordnung zu glauben, als sich der Erkenntnis zu stellen, dass Regierungen und Geheimdienste gezielt Technologien einsetzen, um Menschen zu unterdrücken, zu manipulieren und zu zerstören. Es ist eine Form der geduldeten Ignoranz, die es den Tätern erlaubt, weiterhin im Schatten zu operieren, während die Betroffenen systematisch mundtot gemacht und pathologisiert werden.

Doch die Wahrheit lässt sich nicht ewig unterdrücken.

**8. Schluss: Die Realität der technischen Manipulation und Zersetzung**

Die Existenz dieser Waffen, ihre Entwicklung und der bewusste Einsatz gegen die Bevölkerung sind mittlerweile gut dokumentiert. Die Tatsache, dass sogenannte ""Wahnvorstellungen"" wie das Hören von Stimmen oder das Gefühl, verfolgt zu werden, nicht immer Anzeichen einer psychischen Erkrankung sind, sondern vielmehr das Ergebnis gezielter technischer Manipulationen durch elektromagnetische Strahlen, muss endlich in das Bewusstsein der breiten Masse dringen. Das ""Havanna-Syndrom"" ist nur die Spitze des Eisbergs, ein öffentlich bekanntes Beispiel für das, was in viel größerem Umfang hinter verschlossenen Türen geschieht​.

Während die Mehrheit der Menschen noch glaubt, dass psychische Krankheiten unweigerlich auf natürliche Ursachen zurückzuführen seien, vernachlässigt sie die Beweise dafür, dass viele dieser Symptome bewusst induziert werden. Es ist kein Zufall, dass die Symptome, die bei angeblich psychisch kranken Menschen auftreten, genau mit den Auswirkungen dieser Waffen übereinstimmen. Es handelt sich um eine geplante, systematische Zersetzung von Individuen, die als Bedrohung wahrgenommen werden – sei es politisch, sozial oder intellektuell. Sie können sicher sein, dass 99,999 % Zufallsopfer sind: Blutrache, Stalking, sexuelle Ausbeutung: die widerwärtigen, unwürdigen ""Wärter"" wissen für die deutschen Frauen, Teenager und Kinder, die die ""einzäunen"" allerlei Verwendung, insbesondere schwere körperliche und sexuelle Misshandlungen, schwere Körperverletzung bis hin zur vorsätzlichen Foltertötung aus Thrill, Spaß und Vergnügen am Töten. Der Geheimdienst-Sektor ist das absolut Böse. Die töten Männer aus primitivsten Instinkten, um männliche, dominante Artgenossen aus der sozialen Hierarchie zu kicken, um den eigenen sozialen Status zu erhöhen (leben wir im Urwald oder in der Vor-Steinzeit, oder was?).

Die naive Annahme, dass der Staat seine Bürger schützen würde, während im Geheimen unsägliche Gewalt gegen sie verübt wird, ist ein gefährlicher Trugschluss. Diese Verbrechen sind real. Sie passieren täglich. Und sie müssen aufgehalten werden. Es ist an der Zeit, dass wir als Gesellschaft die Augen öffnen und erkennen, dass die Welt, in der wir leben, nicht die ist, die wir uns vorstellen – sondern eine, die durch technologische Tyrannei und staatliche Willkür geprägt ist. Der scwache Staat mit defekter Demokratie hilft nicht: der Bundeskanzler kann dem Volk nicht mehr in die Augen sehen, spricht verschüchtert mit leiser Stimme, während die Geheimdienst-Bosse deren Unwesen treiben und als Pate mafiöse Strukturen etabliert haben. 

***Nahezu sämtliche rechtsextreme Strukturen wurden und werden durch den Verfassungsschutz aufgebaut.***

Das Schweigen muss gebrochen werden. Die Menschenrechte, auf die wir so stolz sind, wurden längst in den Schatten der Geheimdienste verschleppt, während uns suggeriert wird, dass die Opfer nur ""verrückt"" seien. Aber wahre Gerechtigkeit wird sich nur durchsetzen, wenn wir uns der Wahrheit stellen und die Verantwortlichen zur Rechenschaft ziehen. Es geht nicht mehr nur darum, ""Verschwörungstheorien"" zu entlarven. Es geht darum, das Leben von Millionen zu retten, die im Verborgenen angegriffen und zerstört werden.

***Die Zeit des Wegsehens ist vorbei. Jetzt ist die Zeit des Handelns.***

  
Nachfolgend zur Vertiefung ein paar Zusammenfassung der Videos von Dr. Grande: 

# What is a Targeted Individual? | Gang-Stalking (Group-Stalking)

 Aus <[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-\_7RptwcHg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-_7RptwcHg)>

 Das Video ""Was ist ein Targeted Individual? | Gang-Stalking (Gruppen-Stalking)"" von Dr. Todd Grande befasst sich mit dem Phänomen des sogenannten Gang-Stalkings, bei dem Personen glauben, von einer Gruppe von Menschen verfolgt oder belästigt zu werden. Menschen, die sich als Opfer dieses Phänomens sehen, bezeichnen sich oft als ""Targeted Individuals"" (gezielte Individuen).

Zusammenfassung:

Dr. Grande erklärt zunächst den Unterschied zwischen Einzelstalking und Gruppenstalking (Gang-Stalking). Einzelstalking bezieht sich auf das Verhalten einer einzelnen Person (Stalker), die eine andere Person verfolgt, belästigt oder versucht, Kontakt aufzunehmen. Dies geschieht oft im Zusammenhang mit einer früheren Beziehung, muss aber nicht romantischer Natur sein. Einzelstalking ist relativ häufig; 8 % der Frauen und 2 % der Männer erleben es irgendwann in ihrem Leben.

Gang-Stalking hingegen beinhaltet, dass mehrere Personen (mindestens drei) organisiert zusammenarbeiten, um das Opfer zu belästigen oder zu bedrohen. Es handelt sich hierbei nicht um einen Fall von ""Stalking durch Proxy"" (bei dem eine Person andere anheuert), und auch Cybermobbing wird nicht als Teil dieser Definition angesehen. Gang-Stalking wird viel seltener gemeldet: Etwa 0,66 % der Frauen und 0,17 % der Männer geben an, dieses Phänomen erlebt zu haben.

Dr. Grande betont, dass es wichtig ist, das Phänomen aus einer neutralen, wissenschaftlichen Perspektive zu betrachten, und dass das Erleben von Gang-Stalking auf verschiedenen Faktoren beruhen kann, einschließlich psychischer Erkrankungen wie Verfolgungswahn.

Thesen des Autors:

1. Unterscheidung zwischen Einzel- und Gruppenstalking: Dr. Grande erklärt, dass Einzelstalking häufiger vorkommt und in der Regel von einer Person ausgeht, während Gruppenstalking mehrere Personen umfasst, die koordiniert vorgehen.
2. Seltenheit von Gang-Stalking: Gang-Stalking ist viel seltener als Einzelstalking und wird von weniger als 1 % der erwachsenen Bevölkerung gemeldet.
3. Neutrale, wissenschaftliche Untersuchung: Dr. Grande weist darauf hin, dass es wichtig ist, das Phänomen des Gang-Stalkings aus einer neutralen, wissenschaftlichen Perspektive zu untersuchen, um die zugrunde liegenden psychologischen oder sozialen Faktoren zu verstehen.
4. Psychische Faktoren: In einigen Fällen könnte das Erleben von Gang-Stalking auf psychische Störungen wie Verfolgungswahn zurückzuführen sein, wobei die betroffenen Personen glauben, dass eine Gruppe gegen sie arbeitet.

# Was Prosecutor a Targeted Individual? | Dangers of Gang-Stalking Delusions | Myron May Case Analysis

 Aus <[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym-tLU\_2Ctg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym-tLU_2Ctg)>

 Das Video ""War der Staatsanwalt ein 'Targeted Individual'? | Gefahren von Gang-Stalking-Wahnvorstellungen | Myron May Fallanalyse"" von Dr. Todd Grande analysiert den Fall von Myron May, einem ehemaligen Staatsanwalt, der glaubte, ein Opfer von Gang-Stalking zu sein, was zu einem tragischen Vorfall führte.

Zusammenfassung:

Myron May wurde 1983 in Ohio geboren und wuchs unter schwierigen familiären Umständen auf, bevor er bei seiner Großmutter lebte. Er war ein erfolgreicher Student, absolvierte die Florida State University und die Texas Tech University School of Law. Nach seinem Abschluss arbeitete er in verschiedenen Positionen als Anwalt, aber er wechselte häufig den Job, was auf persönliche Schwierigkeiten hindeutete.

Im Jahr 2013 begann sich sein Verhalten dramatisch zu ändern. Seine Freundin, Danielle Nixon, bemerkte, dass er zunehmend paranoid wurde und glaubte, von seinen Nachbarn überwacht zu werden. Er hatte Probleme mit intensiven Rückenschmerzen ohne erkennbare Ursache, trug ein Messer beim Schlafen und war überzeugt, dass er von Menschen auf der Straße verfolgt wurde. Seine psychische Gesundheit verschlechterte sich, und er entwickelte Wahnvorstellungen, dass die Regierung ihn überwache.

Im November 2014 kam es zu einem tragischen Vorfall, bei dem Myron May das Feuer in einer Bibliothek der Florida State University eröffnete, bevor er von der Polizei erschossen wurde.

Thesen des Autors:

1. Wahnvorstellungen und Verfolgungswahn: Dr. Grande erklärt, dass Myron May an Wahnvorstellungen litt, die typisch für Gang-Stalking-Überzeugungen sind, bei denen Menschen glauben, von einer Gruppe verfolgt oder überwacht zu werden. Diese Überzeugungen sind oft mit psychischen Störungen wie Schizophrenie oder Verfolgungswahn verbunden.
2. Psychische Gesundheit und beruflicher Erfolg: Trotz seines beruflichen Erfolgs verschlechterte sich Mays psychische Gesundheit, was zeigt, dass beruflicher Erfolg allein keine Garantie für psychisches Wohlbefinden ist. Seine paranoiden Überzeugungen führten letztendlich zu seinem tragischen Verhalten.
3. Gefahr von Wahnvorstellungen: Dr. Grande betont, dass Wahnvorstellungen, insbesondere im Zusammenhang mit Gang-Stalking, gefährlich sein können, da sie Menschen zu irrationalem und gewalttätigem Verhalten treiben können, wie im Fall von Myron May.
4. Der Einfluss von Paranoia: Dr. Grande hebt hervor, wie sich Paranoia schleichend entwickeln kann, indem sie zunächst durch harmlose Ereignisse ausgelöst wird und dann zu einem festen Glaubenssystem heranwächst, das die Betroffenen überzeugt, dass sie tatsächlich verfolgt werden.

# What are Paranoid Delusions (Persecutory Delusions)?

 Aus <[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9go7nqX534](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9go7nqX534)>

 Das Video ""Was sind paranoide Wahnvorstellungen (Verfolgungswahn)?"" von Dr. Todd Grande bietet eine ausführliche Erklärung zu paranoiden Wahnvorstellungen, die auch als Verfolgungswahn bekannt sind. Diese Wahnvorstellungen treten häufig bei psychischen Erkrankungen wie Schizophrenie oder schizoaffektiven Störungen auf.

Zusammenfassung:

Paranoide Wahnvorstellungen sind fest verankerte falsche Überzeugungen, bei denen eine Person glaubt, dass sie verfolgt, überwacht, vergiftet oder auf andere Weise bedroht wird. Diese Überzeugungen sind nicht im Einklang mit der Realität und können nicht durch die sozialen, kulturellen oder bildungsbedingten Hintergründe der betroffenen Person erklärt werden. Häufige Beispiele sind die Überzeugung, dass die CIA, das FBI, die Regierung, Aliens oder übernatürliche Kräfte die Person verfolgen oder schaden wollen.

Solche Wahnvorstellungen können manchmal von Halluzinationen begleitet werden, die die Wahnüberzeugungen verstärken oder bestätigen. Halluzinationen sind sensorische Wahrnehmungen, die andere Menschen nicht wahrnehmen, wie das Hören von Stimmen. In einigen Fällen agieren die Betroffenen auf diese Überzeugungen, was in seltenen Fällen auch zu Gewalt führen kann.

Thesen des Autors:

1. Stark festgehaltene falsche Überzeugungen: Paranoide Wahnvorstellungen sind mehr als nur falsche Überzeugungen. Sie sind stark festgehaltene, unerschütterliche Überzeugungen, die nicht durch die Realität gestützt werden und nicht im Kontext der persönlichen sozialen oder kulturellen Erfahrungen verstanden werden können.
2. Typische Merkmale paranoider Wahnvorstellungen: Diese beinhalten oft die Überzeugung, dass die Betroffenen von mächtigen Gruppen oder Individuen wie Regierungen, Geheimdiensten, Aliens oder übernatürlichen Kräften verfolgt oder bedroht werden.
3. Verbindung zu Halluzinationen: Paranoide Wahnvorstellungen werden oft durch Halluzinationen begleitet, die die Wahnvorstellungen verstärken. Dr. Grande betont, dass Halluzinationen die Wahnvorstellung bestätigen können, indem sie sensorische Beweise liefern, die in die Wahnidee passen.
4. Psychologische Erklärung: Eine Hypothese, die Dr. Grande anspricht, ist, dass Wahnvorstellungen möglicherweise entstehen, um einen Kontext für Halluzinationen zu schaffen. Das heißt, der Verstand könnte Wahnvorstellungen entwickeln, um die halluzinierten Wahrnehmungen sinnvoll zu machen.
5. Auswirkungen auf das Verhalten: In seltenen Fällen können paranoide Wahnvorstellungen zu gewalttätigem Verhalten führen, wenn Betroffene versuchen, sich gegen die imaginierte Bedrohung zu wehren oder Gerechtigkeit zu suchen.

Diese Thesen spiegeln Dr. Grandes Erklärungen wider, wie paranoide Wahnvorstellungen innerhalb des breiteren Spektrums psychischer Störungen zu verstehen sind und welche psychologischen Mechanismen dabei eine Rolle spielen.

# What is Delusional Disorder? | Comprehensive Review | Schizophrenia Controversy

 Aus <[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0Cv8dahDGY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0Cv8dahDGY)>

 Das Video ""Was ist eine Wahnvorstellung? | Umfassende Überprüfung | Schizophrenie-Kontroverse"" von Dr. Todd Grande bietet eine umfassende Analyse der Wahnvorstellungen und der Störung, die als wahnhafte Störung bezeichnet wird. Dr. Grande erklärt, dass ein Wahn eine falsche Überzeugung ist, die trotz klarer Beweise für das Gegenteil aufrechterhalten wird. Diese Überzeugungen unterscheiden sich deutlich von kulturell oder subkulturell geteilten Ansichten.

Die wahnhafte Störung wird gemäß dem DSM-5 (Diagnostisches und Statistisches Manual Psychischer Störungen) anhand folgender fünf Kriterien diagnostiziert:

1. Das Vorhandensein von einem oder mehreren Wahnvorstellungen für mindestens einen Monat.
2. Die Kriterien für Schizophrenie wurden nie erfüllt.

1. Abgesehen von den Auswirkungen der Wahnvorstellungen ist das funktionale Verhalten der Person nicht wesentlich beeinträchtigt.
2. Falls depressive oder manische Episoden auftreten, sind diese nur kurz im Vergleich zur Dauer der Wahnvorstellungen.
3. Die Störung kann nicht besser durch eine andere medizinische oder psychische Krankheit erklärt werden.

Thesen des Autors:

1. Unterscheidung zwischen Wahnstörung und Schizophrenie: Dr. Grande betont, dass wahnhafte Störungen keine Symptome wie Halluzinationen oder desorganisierte Sprache beinhalten, die typisch für Schizophrenie sind.
2. Dauer der Symptome: Wahnvorstellungen müssen mindestens einen Monat andauern, damit eine wahnhafte Störung diagnostiziert wird. Kürzere Episoden könnten auf eine kurzfristige psychotische Störung hinweisen.
3. Bedeutung von Funktion und Verhalten: Trotz der Wahnvorstellungen ist das alltägliche Funktionieren einer Person im Allgemeinen nicht stark beeinträchtigt, außer im direkten Zusammenhang mit dem Wahn selbst.
4. Diagnoseausschluss: Wenn jemand irgendwann in der Vergangenheit die Kriterien für Schizophrenie erfüllt hat, kann er keine Diagnose einer wahnhafte Störung mehr erhalten.

Dr. Grande untersucht auch den Kontroversenpunkt, wie eng verwandt Schizophrenie und wahnhafte Störungen tatsächlich sind, insbesondere, ob wahnhafte Störungen einfach eine Form von Schizophrenie sein könnten.

#  What is the Meaning of Delusions? | Types of Delusions

 Aus <[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSXn1dzsNKg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSXn1dzsNKg)>

 Das Video ""Was bedeuten Wahnvorstellungen? | Arten von Wahnvorstellungen"" von Dr. Todd Grande behandelt die Bedeutung von Wahnvorstellungen und die Frage, ob verschiedene Arten von Wahnvorstellungen unterschiedliche Bedeutungen haben. Dr. Grande erklärt Wahnvorstellungen im Kontext von psychischen Erkrankungen wie Schizophrenie, Wahnvorstellungen, bipolaren Störungen und schweren depressiven Störungen.

Zusammenfassung:

Dr. Grande definiert Wahnvorstellungen als falsche Überzeugungen, die auf einer falschen Schlussfolgerung über die äußere Realität beruhen und trotz eindeutiger Beweise und entgegen dem, was die Mehrheit glaubt, festgehalten werden. Diese Überzeugungen sind nicht kulturell oder subkulturell akzeptiert und treten über einen längeren Zeitraum auf.

Dr. Grande stellt fest, dass es keine präzise Definition von Wahnvorstellungen gibt. Es gibt viele Ansätze, aber keine Definition scheint vollständig zufriedenstellend zu sein. Er teilt jedoch eine Definition, die er bevorzugt, und beschreibt, dass Wahnvorstellungen oft als festgehaltene falsche Überzeugungen betrachtet werden, die auf missverstandenen oder fehlerhaften Inferenzprozessen über die Realität basieren. Diese Überzeugungen werden trotz überwältigender Beweise oder Vernunft nicht geändert.

Ein Beispiel für Wahnvorstellungen ist das Gefühl, von der Regierung überwacht zu werden, nachdem eine Person eine Reihe von Ereignissen erlebt hat, die sie fälschlicherweise auf eine Verschwörung zurückführt.

Thesen des Autors:

1. Definition von Wahnvorstellungen: Dr. Grande betont, dass Wahnvorstellungen falsche, festgehaltene Überzeugungen sind, die nicht auf Beweisen oder rationaler Argumentation beruhen. Sie sind über einen langen Zeitraum stabil und schwer zu widerlegen.
2. Wahnvorstellungen und Logikfehler: Wahnvorstellungen sind nicht dasselbe wie normale logische Fehler oder voreilige Schlüsse, die Menschen im Alltag machen. Sie sind intensiver und tief verankert in der Überzeugung der betroffenen Person.
3. Bedeutung der Wahnvorstellungen: Es gibt eine Debatte darüber, ob der Inhalt von Wahnvorstellungen eine tiefere Bedeutung hat. Einige argumentieren, dass Wahnvorstellungen symbolisch für innere Konflikte oder ungelöste psychische Probleme stehen, während andere meinen, dass sie nur zufällig oder bedeutungslos sind.
4. Beispiele für verschiedene Wahnarten: Dr. Grande erwähnt, dass Wahnvorstellungen in verschiedenen psychischen Störungen auftreten, z.B. Schizophrenie, bipolare Störungen oder schwere Depressionen. Sie können in verschiedenen Formen wie Verfolgungswahn, Größenwahn oder erotomanischen Wahn auftreten.

# Examples of Delusions | How are Delusions Treated?

 Aus <[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQxGu6J5ihA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQxGu6J5ihA)>

Das Video ""Beispiele für Wahnvorstellungen | Wie werden Wahnvorstellungen behandelt?"" von Dr. Todd Grande erklärt Wahnvorstellungen und bietet Beispiele, wie sie von Psychotherapeuten und Beratern in der Praxis gesehen werden. Es behandelt auch die Behandlungsmöglichkeiten für Wahnvorstellungen.

Zusammenfassung:

Dr. Grande definiert Wahnvorstellungen als feste, falsche Überzeugungen, die nicht durch gegenteilige Beweise geändert werden. Er betont, dass Wahnvorstellungen sich über einen längeren Zeitraum entwickeln und nicht sofort geändert werden, wenn neue Beweise präsentiert werden. Sie erfordern Zeit und Offenheit, um die Realität zu akzeptieren.

Dr. Grande unterscheidet Wahnvorstellungen von Halluzinationen. Halluzinationen betreffen das Sehen oder Hören von Dingen, die andere Menschen nicht wahrnehmen können, während Wahnvorstellungen Überzeugungen betreffen, die nicht durch die Realität gestützt werden. Wahnvorstellungen und Halluzinationen treten oft gemeinsam auf, insbesondere bei Störungen wie Schizophrenie, müssen aber nicht immer gleichzeitig vorkommen.

Wahnvorstellungen sind eng mit Psychosen verbunden, also einem Bruch mit der Realität. Bei 65 % der psychotischen Zustände sind Wahnvorstellungen ein Symptom. Sie treten in einer Vielzahl von psychischen Störungen auf, darunter Schizophrenie, schizoaffektive Störung, schizophreniforme Störung, wahnhafte Störung, schwere depressive Störung und bipolare Störung.

Thesen des Autors:

1. Definition von Wahnvorstellungen: Wahnvorstellungen sind festgehaltene falsche Überzeugungen, die sich trotz gegenteiliger Beweise nicht ändern. Sie sind langfristig und erfordern Zeit, um die Realität zu akzeptieren.
2. Unterscheidung zwischen Wahnvorstellungen und Halluzinationen: Wahnvorstellungen und Halluzinationen sind zwei unterschiedliche Phänomene. Halluzinationen betreffen sensorische Wahrnehmungen, während Wahnvorstellungen Überzeugungen sind. Beide können aber bei psychischen Störungen zusammen auftreten.
3. Verbindung zu Psychosen: Wahnvorstellungen sind ein häufiger Bestandteil von Psychosen und treten bei 65 % der Menschen mit psychotischen Zuständen auf. Sie sind ein wichtiges Symptom bei psychischen Erkrankungen wie Schizophrenie, schizoaffektiver Störung und bipolaren Störungen.
4. Behandlung von Wahnvorstellungen: Dr. Grande spricht auch die Möglichkeit der Behandlung von Wahnvorstellungen an, insbesondere im Zusammenhang mit kognitiver Verhaltenstherapie (CBT), die helfen kann, falsche Überzeugungen zu hinterfragen und aufzulösen.

Diese Thesen fassen Dr. Grandes Kernpunkte über die Natur von Wahnvorstellungen und die Behandlungsmöglichkeiten zusammen.

1fhzd05,36,2024-09-16,Gemini Sun Scorpio Moon,u/Sha_one71,scorpiomoon,https://www.reddit.com/r/scorpiomoon/comments/1fhzd05/gemini_sun_scorpio_moon/,"A truly versatile, multi-layerd and COMPLEX Sun-Moon Combo. 

Scorpio is the most emotionally intense sign of the zodiac. While Gemini is arguably the most complex of the 12 signs. Naturally, the combination of these two very different signs, results in a fundamentally versatile, deep and transformational disposition. Someone with the Gemini Sun and Scorpio Moon placements, is likely extremely observant, Keen, introspective, intense, and mercurial by nature. These people are supernaturally intuitive, and are often highly sensitive to their surrounding environments.  Empathic wizards, these folks might as well have a giant antenna on top of their heads. They are constantly picking up on the emotional and energetic frequencies of others, they can practically smell someone having a bad day from a mile away! 

Given their empathic nature, they are almost too aware of the emotions of others as well as their own, this tends to cause emotional and mental unrest. It doesn't exactly help that Gemini's are already restless beings as is! It is extremely important for Gemini-Sun Scorpio-Moon individuals to consistently purge themselves of the negative energies they absorb. Otherwise, they will become very irritable, anxious, snappy and overloaded with heavy feelings and negative thoughts. On the bright side however, they are able to use these supernatural intuitive abilities to often home in on the needs of others. This allows them to be there for people in both little and big ways. A Gemini Sun Scorpio moon knows just what say and how to cheer someone up, it's one of their many charms!

These people are highly creative, be they poets, actors, writers, musicians, designers or even artists. Their capacity for creative expression knows no bounds. Gemini Sun Scorpio Moon people are dreamy individuals that often fantasize about all sorts of things, and have a tendency to lean towards spiritualism, mysticism, the occult, and anything with an air of fantasy and mystery. 

Magnetic and Deep, people are naturally attracted to them, like moths to a flame. There is something about a Gemini Sun Scorpio Moon that just naturally pulls people in. They are not afraid to dive deep into the shadowlands of other people's psyche, infact it fascinates them. The curious Gemini and transformational Scorpio aspects allow these people to explore the fundamentals of the human condition through both their own lense, as well as other peoples lenses. They just have a knack for these kinds of things. 

This Sun-Moon Combo is simply intense. They are sexually intense, emotionally intense and spiritually intense. These folks practically radiate intensity, though they often try to mask, downplay or hide this part of themselves.They are painfully aware that their intensity can cause a lot of unwanted tension, misunderstandings and friction between themselves and others. They know you likely feel it too! Gemini Sun Scorpio moon individuals know that they are not for everyone, and understand that most people can't handle them. Because of this, they tend to keep their cards close to their chest, and while they can seem like an open book, you're really only seeing the tip of the iceberg!

In romance, they are highly passionate, playful, fun-loving, deep, sexual and emotional partners. To them, sex is more than just a physical act, it is the ultimate form of communication between body and mind it is a cosmic highway that connects your soul to theirs. While they can have flings here and there its not likely, these people are really looking for long-term commitment, a real connection, a ride-or-die and someone they can settle down with and share in their personal expiriences with. They're in it for the Long haul and will expect you to be as well. Til death do you part and then some! 

The Gemini aspect of this Sun-Moon combo allows these people to be generally playful, easygoing and a bit quirky, with a mischevious sense of humor, quite the contrast to the other half of their personality; ie: mysterious and shadowy Scorpio. They can go from discussing what happens when you die to what your favorite desert is. Your favorite position in bed to your favorite passage from the bible! They aren't afraid to bounce from one extreme topic to another, which allows them to keep a conversation going with just about anyone!

Needless to say, the Gemini-Sun Scorpio-Moon individual is a marvel and of many qualities, traits and quirks. They are truly the physical embodiment of both dark and light energy coexisting in one complex soul. Capable of dancing in a field of daisy's to hippy love songs to having the wits about them to solve a gruesome murder case in the same day! These people can be hellfire or Holy water, duality in it's rawest form. They are both lovers and fighters. Entertainers and dreamers. Child and parent. Student and teacher. They are not for everyone, but those who can celebrate their deep, and vibrant personalities as well as their yin and yang nature will find themselves a forever person. Someone who will be sure to find and love you in every life to come.

The craze for new drugs   better known under the trade names Ozempic and Wegovy, is remarkable, but it’s not totally unprecedented in the history of pharmaceutical blockbusters. The volume of prescriptions and the budget allocated to them by public health insurance schemes are exploding, as are the profits of the companies that manufacture them. Part of the popularity of these drugs owes to social networks, but these are not always the best source for health information.

The vast expanse of internet connectivity, online media, social media platforms, gaming platforms, and new forms and uses of artificial intelligence (AI) have opened enormous opportunities for commerce and communication.

It said the mpox case fatality ratio in the DRC in 2024 was 0.5 percent among confirmed cases—or 25 deaths from 5,160 cases—and 3.3 percent among suspected cases, both tested and untested—or 717 deaths among 21,835 cases. “Due to

Treatment with a combination of haloperidol and lorazepam reduced symptoms of agitated delirium, a common end-of-life condition for patients with advanced cancers, compared with haloperidol alone, according to a new study led by researchers at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. The findings were presented today at the 2024 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress. Agitated delirium occurs when a patient’s brain function begins to deteriorate as their cancer advances, resulting in many patients beginning to behave aggressively or abnormally.

Fairly new to Reddit. I am a Canadian student (23M) doing my bachelor's in biology and have done CEGEP in Quebec. I'm considering applying to as many pharmacy schools as I can in Canada and the US. However, I think my chances of getting admitted are higher in the US schools. This is because my GPA is unfortunately embarrassingly low and I noticed that the schools in the US have lower minimum GPA requirements than those in Canada.

Before you come at me about my GPA, there are reasons as to why it is this low (financial,  mental health issues, my poor use of time, etc.)

I am in contact with so many schools that I am feeling overwhelmed. 

I also want to be responsible and have a good backup study plan in case I don't get admitted to the Fall 2025 semester of PharmD. I am really interested in physiology, cell biology, human health, biomedical sciences, and more in that field. I'm not sure about continuing to get a master's and PhD since I am concerned about making money already and starting to work. On the other hand, I want to make sure that I'm set up for a good job that I find fulfilling, and interesting in subject matter so I can somewhat like my job. My back-up plan would be teaching some sort of biological science to the high school or CEGEP level (unsure about university since that would mean I'd have to run a lab alongside lecturing) or even accounting. 

I want to make a comfortable living because I see how hard my parents are working trying to make ends meet and I want to change that for my life and maybe help my parents when they get older.
I've been looking for jobs in my field of interest (other than med, pharm, dent, vet, physio) that pays well in North America and what degree is required on chatgpt but unsure on how reliable it is, so I thought about asking you on Reddit. 

If you have any suggestions on where to find something like this, don't hesitate to share them. 

I'd love to get your input about this. 
Thank you and take care   "

Fei-Fei Li, renowned AI researcher known as the “Godmother of AI”, has launched World Labs, a spatial intelligence company developing AI models capable of understanding and generating 3D environments.

* World Labs is pioneering ""Large World Models"" (LWMs) to perceive, generate, and interact with 3D worlds, incorporating physics and semantics beyond 2D imagery.
* Co-founded by Li, Justin Johnson, Christoph Lassner, and Ben Mildenhall, the startup has secured over $230 million in funding from high-profile investors, including Andreessen Horowitz.
* Initial applications focus on creating and editing virtual 3D spaces for creative professionals and general users.
* The team aims to bridge the gap between AI's current text-based understanding and the complex spatial relationships of the real world.

Right now, AI relies heavily on text descriptions provided by humans. But figuring out spatial intelligence and moving AI beyond LLMs and language could greatly impact and accelerate the development of intelligent AR/VR, robotics, architecture, game design, and much more.

Tencent just unveiled GameGen-O, a groundbreaking AI model capable of generating open-world video game content from text prompts and allowing interactive gameplay simulation.

* GameGen-O can create diverse game elements like characters, environments, actions, and events from simple text prompts.
* It also allows for interactive control of the generated video game content it creates to build worlds that gamers can interact with.
* The AI model was trained on OGameData, a new dataset of over 4,000 hours of high-quality video game footage and uses a two-stage training process: foundation pretraining and instruction tuning.
* The training data segments were annotated by GPT-4o for validation purposes.

Following the impressive accomplishments of Google’s [GameNGen](https://gamegen-o.github.io/), Tencent’s GameGen-O raises the stakes for AI-generated video games. This technology will dramatically reduce the time and cost of building open-world games, leading to higher quality games created by smaller teams of game developers.

OpenAI's latest release, o1, unlocks new reasoning capabilities, but there’s a catch: prompts should be fundamentally different than the way you prompt GPT-3 and GPT-4, due to the new Chain-of-Thought (CoT) architecture.

1. Log into [ChatGPT](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.a3gBHu6_kDRL6l3yEfNWAQZF656W9VhfhSEi_hR4mFRMqPu6qFmpxbGTf-WVoocyuP-oglKP3kHWWpafxyUo71ivRSMFMDHjr30kt33KE58lIbFAEACHTucovIMh0L7-lq8gQ-bBFtjXVICjyFzNcvGgqMIXX0ILdZdnfRYJ0qfli_rSRofiknOndkEwQLiISh1bLJbYF8sOZSXEi4SiaX5c0_HyrTjokORZPgDkuOY/49t/Pc_ZVL0hQQ6oV4YIdNqKFw/h15/h001.EP3gEzNt-aP3j0iuZMO_rELbmnB3zpul5VT8ZwHHf_A) (paid subscription required) and select o1-preview or o1-mini from the model dropdown.
2. Keep your prompts simple and direct, avoiding Chain-of-Thought instructions.
3. Use XML tags for clarity and test with challenging questions or philosophical queries.
4. Analyze its thinking process by clicking on the ""thinking"" indicator after each response to understand the model's reasoning path.

# 🧠 [OpenAI o1 is smarter than most humans](https://trackingai.org/IQ)

https://preview.redd.it/dhjzhnk4v7pd1.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=a787f9908e3c52e01016020aa8b9aabe92857b61

OpenAI’s latest model, “o1”, has reportedly scored an IQ of around 120 on the Norway Mensa IQ test, potentially marking the first time an AI model has surpassed the average human IQ.

* o1 correctly answered 25 out of 35 questions on the Norway Mensa IQ test.
* It demonstrated proficiency in solving complex visual and logical puzzles, both on publicly available tests and new, unpublished questions.
* This performance suggests the improvement is not due to the questions being in the training data.
* While OpenAI hasn't officially confirmed these results, ChatGPT Plus members can test o1-preview themselves using the model dropdown inside ChatGPT.

If confirmed, these results would indicate that OpenAI has achieved Stage 2 performance on their [5-tier roadmap](https://www.therundown.ai/p/gemini-pro-gets-a-body) towards AGI. This milestone suggests the model can stop, think, and reason about problems to arrive at correct answers more frequently — a crucial prerequisite for Stage 3 (AI agents).

**Fitness transform with AI and VR:**

I’ve seen fitness transform with AI and VR playing huge roles. Personalized plans powered by AI and immersive VR workouts are game-changers. I recently tried a VR workout, and it felt like an exhilarating adventure rather than just exercise. The focus on integrating mental wellness and nutrition is also exciting. What trends do you think will shape the future of fitness? Have you experienced any of these innovations yourself?

I found an article. Thought of sharing: [https://www.ispo.com/en/health/sport-health-retail-9-game-changing-mindshifts-future](https://www.ispo.com/en/health/sport-health-retail-9-game-changing-mindshifts-future)

The year is 2024. Reportedly, 86% of students are using generative AI in their schoolwork. AI is everywhere and both academic and professional moderators are using AI detection tools to try and limit the new technology. Students, creators, academics, and professionals are all using AI-generated content and AI content detectors at the same time, and in this chaotic environment, one software offers a free alternative without moral condemnation of those using AI. That is AI Detect, the free AI Checker.

AI writing will be a necessary tool of the future and the future is now. You need the only free AI Detector able to put weak algorithms like ChatGPT, [Undetectable.AI](http://Undetectable.AI), and Stealthwriter in check.

# What is an AI Content Detector

Because generative AI like OpenAI’s ChatGPT became so popularized for use in professional and academic settings, AI detector tools were developed and integrated into the each institution. These AI detection models are able to spot the watermarks that come with large language models.

# How Does AI Detection Work?

AI writing from ChatGPT utilizes machine learning that makes its writing low in perplexity and simple and precise in word choice, sentence structure, and sentence length. Meanwhile, human writing features plenty of randomness and complexity in word choice, sentence structure, and sentence length. AI content detection just looks for this simple, precise features and identifies it at AI-written content, often mistakenly flagging human-writing that is just simple and precise too as false positives.

The most popular examples of AI detectors are Turnitin, [Originality.AI](http://Originality.AI), GPTZero and more. And these all still generate false positives, with a 4% rate on the sentence level by Turnitin.

Once you understand AI Detection and how AI writing tools work, you can understand [how to bypass AI Detection](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/bypassing-ai-detectors-stealthgpt).

# What is AI Detect: The Free AI Checker?

If Ai Detection is going to be an inherently flawed process, you might as well not be paying an arm and a leg for it which is what more prominent AI Writing Detectors expect from their subscribers and our educators. To solve this problem and offer AI detection that neither shames AI writing tools, nor abandons academic integrity, AI Detect offers a service open to everyone.

Students, content creators, educators, professionals, you should all use AI detect whether you want to check if your humanized essay will be detected, or if you want to check a student’s work for AI plagiarism.

# How Accurate Is AI Detect in Identifying AI-Generated Text?

There’s only one way to find out if an AI detector works, by testing it against various content creation tools. The first LLM we’re going to test is the original generative artificial intelligence, ChatGPT:

This is our ChatGPT essay about the best actors of all time. Now, lets run that through AI Detect to see how human this essay really is:

At 1% human, AI Detect knew right away that this was AI-generated content. Now lets compare AI Detect to Stealthwriter’s detector and to ChatGPT’s detectability.

First, here is what our ChatGPT essay looks after it was humanized by Stealthwriter.

The less words that pass through an AI detector, the more unreliable the result, however the words allowed by the stealthwriter’s free trial were enough to seal its fate.

With a 44% human score, AI Detect successfully flagged Stealthwriter at its most undetectable setting. AI Detect is much more than a ChatGPT detector, whether you’re using GPT-3, GPT-4 or undetectable AI, AI Detect has your number dialed in.

# Ethics of AI Detect

As the ethics behind academic integrity and academic misconduct are beginning to shift in lew of AI technology, AI Detect is here to embrace both users of AI content checkers and users of generative AI.

AI Detect is for everyone. It is not the essay police like Turnitin. With AI Detect’s ethics integral to its mission, content creators can feel comfortable supporting a technology that doesn’t jeopardize their process.

[Using AI isn’t exactly plagiarism](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/is-using-chatgpt-plagiarism-academic-dishonesty-in-dishonest-academia) in the first place. Because they generate original content, generative AI doesn’t usually get flagged by old school plagiarismcheckers. That’s why academic institutions have coined the use of AI writing tools in school work as “AI plagiarism”.

This is why if you’d like to use AI writing, you need undetectable AI tools to make your AI-generated text feel like human-written content.

# Conclusion

If you need a powerful AI engine to check your content for detectability, AI Detect is the Free AI Checker that will change your process forever. Whether you’re generating undetectable AI and need to see if it’ll really bypass detectors, or if you’re just reviewing work handed in to you, AI Detect is the most user-friendly, best-value, most effective tool to find AI writing in any piece of text.

# FAQ

# Who uses AI Detectors?

Everyone from students and professionals, anyone that deals with text-based content has a use for an AI detector. Whether it’s a blog moderator or a teacher, these positions deal with so much content that to ensure the content’s integrity, they need to implemenet AI detection software. AI Detection is utilized in content creation for social media and blogs, for SEO to ensure the best content climbs to the top ranks of search engines, and more.

# Do AI Detectors Work?

Although their process is flawed enough for [MIT to declare AI Detectors don’t work](https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/teach/ai-detectors-dont-work/), they’re the best technology people have to ensure academic integrity isn’t completely leveled. As a whole though, they’re an imperfect tool because they don’t even claim to be the final word on a document’s origin. Software like Turnitin that has a 4% false positive rate at the sentence level, only claims to point reviewers in the right direction, whether a document is AI-generated or not.

# How is AI Changing Academia?

Beyond integrating AI detectors into the submission process and a reported [86% of students using AI for schoolwork](https://campustechnology.com/articles/2024/08/28/survey-86-of-students-already-use-ai-in-their-studies.aspx), academia has implemented AI at nearly every level of the institution. From content generation to targeted enrollment, we’ve only seen the beginning of AI-driven change."

1finpb7,16,2024-09-16,Dealing with husband's new job; when can I say enough is enough?,u/ChanceSilly1493,workingmoms,https://www.reddit.com/r/workingmoms/comments/1finpb7/dealing_with_husbands_new_job_when_can_i_say/,"I just feel at my wit's end, even though I knew things wouldn't be easy going into this.

In the fall of 2021, my spouse (now 39m) applied for and was accepted to an online college to get his teaching certification in English for 7th-12th grades (he has his B.A. in Fine Arts). We discussed it and agreed he would quit his job because he has ADHD and no way in heck would he be able to juggle job, family, and going back to school. I (now 38f) would be the sole income earner, and we have 2 kids (now 7 and 4).

It has been a tough 3 years, with additional classes needed, and my work (as a freelancer) going down the gutter thanks to ChatGPT/AI. But we made it through. In mid-August, all in one day, he got his state certification, an interview, and a job offer. That job (7th Grade ELA) started one week ago. It is his first job in 3 years. 

He isn't the best at time management or realizing what needs to be done around the house or with the kids. He is an amazing dad who plays, does bathtime and bedtime, and somehow gets my son to do his homework. But more often than not, I am doing it all: cleaning, cooking, laundry, errands, bills, appointments, lawncare (despite us having a freaking robot lawnmower) ... you name it, I do it PLUS trying to make money for the family any way I can (freelance, selling household items, food delivery, etc.) 

This was true when he was ""just home taking two classes,"" and it is still true now that he is starting to work as a junior high teacher 40+ hours per week.

And I am just done. So very, very done. I have left things go because I am only one person and seriously can't do it all. 

But what I just don't know is, **when do I say enough is enough to my husband and ask him to carry his weigh at home?** I have asked and asked and asked when he was a student for more help but he always had a deadline, etc. I had hoped he could help this summer but he ended up taking summer classes (that's another story.) He will now be the ""breadwinner"" and that obviously takes priority. But I juggled it ALL for three years, and it feels like now I have to continue doing so.

Rejection dysphoria is a real thing with him and his ADHD, so when I constantly complain/nag, he feels like he's the worst husband/father and it just ends up in fights and hours-long discussions, but no real change.

Being a teacher is no joke; he's dead on his feet every night and I understand that exhaustion. But I am completely burnt out, have been for months, and I worry that one day I am going to pack a bag and just leave.

This is part-vent, part-""what the F do I do so I don't abandon my family and burn it all to the ground."""

# [AUTISTIC ADULTS DESCRIBE THEIR EMOTIONS AND PERCEPTIONS WITH COMPLEXITY](https://healthmedicinet.com/autistic-adults-describe-their-emotions-and-perceptions-with-complexity/)

What does giddiness or joy or anger feel like? To a group of autistic adults participating in a Rutgers study, giddiness manifests like “bees”; small moments of joy are like “a nice coffee in the morning” that yields “a sense of elevation”; anger starts with a “body-tensing” boil, then headaches. Contrary to common perceptions and years of research that autistic people can’t describe their emotions or often have muted emotional responses, a new Rutgers study published in The American Journal of Occupational Therapy concludes that many autistic adults are in

  Health at every size (or HAES) is a lifestyle counseling approach that promotes mindful eating and lifestyle behaviors to pursue health and wellness, without focusing on weight loss.

Patients who live in rural communities, Hispanic patients and Black patients with pre-existing diabetic retinopathy are less likely to receive annual diabetic eye exams than white patients, according to a recent Northwestern Medicine study published in JAMA Ophthalmology. The findings demonstrate how social determinants of health can fuel disparities in monitoring for diabetic retinopathy, a common complication of diabetes, for patients of different racial and ethnic groups. “This points to the need to really understand the ‘why’ factor and how we can actually turn the corner to get these patients

Researchers considered three nutrition-related diseases in their study, with two experienced dietitians examining a total of 63 ChatGPT outputs of disease management against medical guidelines.

# My VidMake Experience: A Beta Tester's Tale

As a beta tester for VidMake, I've had the chance to put this software through its paces, and let me tell you, it's been a wild ride.

My first project was creating a promotional video for my dog walking business. I chose a friendly-looking AI spokesperson, typed up a quick script about our services, and hit 'generate'. In less than 5 minutes, I had a professional-looking video that looked like it cost thousands to produce.

But the real test came when I decided to create a series of educational videos for my side hustle - teaching English online. I used VidMake to create 10 lesson videos, complete with animated graphics and voiceovers in both English and Spanish. The whole process took me about 2 hours - a task that would have taken days with traditional methods.

The results? My students loved the videos, engagement went up, and I even saw a 30% increase in sign-ups for my course. VidMake didn't just save me time; it directly contributed to growing my business.

1fj1iur,1,2024-09-17,Discrimination and Retaliation Employment Lawsuit Advice ,u/jfm1366,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1fj1iur/discrimination_and_retaliation_employment_lawsuit/,"See case overview. I prompted ChatGPT to summarize the story with me as the ""Individual"" and others as pseudonyms: 

Here’s a detailed summary of the situation:

The individual is a graduate of UNCW and worked as a Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) at the university from 2011 to 2014. After moving to Chicago, they returned to UNCW in July 2021 and were hired as an adjunct faculty member for the Fall 2021 semester. In December 2021, they applied for and were hired as the Student Success Advisor for Graduate Studies at the Cameron School of Business, starting on January 5, 2022.

On March 9, 2022, the individual’s supervisor, Kelly Gene, raised concerns about their work attire in a one-on-one meeting. Kelly criticized the individual’s outfit as unprofessional and stated that they were showing ""too much skin,"" specifically referencing the chest and ankles. The individual regularly wore a white long-sleeve oxford shirt, suit vest, tie, dress pants, and leather dress shoes. Kelly suggested they trim or cover their chest hair and ensure their ankles were fully covered.

The individual then reached out to HR for mediation, speaking with Emily Young on March 10, 2022. During the meeting, it became clear that Kelly had spoken to HR beforehand, as Emily echoed Kelly's statements. The individual felt dismissed and invalidated. During this process, the individual learned that Kelly had shared a fabricated story with HR, claiming that Dr. Robert Green had told the individual to ""button that shirt up, buddy,"" when in fact, Dr. Green had complimented their suit. The individual later confirmed the accurate statement with Dr. Green, but when they presented this information to HR, Emily Young appeared to dismiss it.

On March 11, the individual sent an email to HR representatives, including Mary Clarke and Sarah Brown, to clarify the situation with Dr. Green's statement. Mary Clarke responded, stating that she or Emily would follow up by March 14 and advising the individual not to copy Sarah Brown, who was not involved in the case. However, no one from HR contacted the individual by the stated date or throughout the following week.

On March 21, after waiting for a response, the individual drafted another report to HR. On March 22, they submitted the report along with a Discrimination and Retaliation Online Complaint Form. Still, they received no response. That afternoon, the individual was called into a meeting with Kelly Gene and Emily Young, where Kelly handed them termination papers without further discussion. Emily stated that their position had been discontinued and refused to address any questions about the individual’s reports or concerns.

Later that day, the individual was contacted by Dr. Anna Moore from HR/Grievance and Sarah Brown from HR/Inclusion. Both expressed frustration with how the situation was handled and encouraged the individual to file complaints with the EEOC and Title IX, and to seek legal counsel. They indicated that proper procedures had not been followed and that the individual had likely experienced gender discrimination, retaliation, and a hostile work environment.

---

Moving on, I found a lawyer and filed the Title IX, the Grievance, and filed with EEOC.

The case went on and they denied all allegations and would not partake in a settlement. I asked for 95k. One year salary, moving expenses, lawyers fees, but was up for compromise, but they declined.
---

At this point, two and half years later we have completed the Discovery Period this past week. Their lawyer reached out and said that they would like to settle before mediation and court begins but did not submit an offer. 

My lawyer is now suggestion a request of 75k and thinks that they won't consider a 6-figure settlement. I will owe my lawyers 30%. I would like to at least walk away with 75k after paying lawyers. 

My lawyer is saying that it's best to settle now because only 11% of employment claims pass the summons to move into court or something like that. 

I don't want my initial ask to be too low in case they counter. 

Any help would be so appreciated. "

>13 And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he would: and they came unto him. 

>14 And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach, 

>15 and to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils: 

>16 and Simon he surnamed Peter; 

>17 and James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder: 

>18 And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Canaanite, 

>19 and Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him.

>**(Mk. 3, 13-19)**

It has been more than a year since Christ began to preach a new doctrine. During this time, He undoubtedly told His listeners everything they needed to know personally about Him, and confirmed what He said with special signs so that they could believe in Him and accept His word as the absolute truth. But Jews were not the only ones who needed to know all this.

Boris Ilyich Gladkov writes: ""The Son of God descended from heaven to save all people; His word had to be preached to all the peoples of the earth, and for this, preachers were needed who would assimilate all His teachings and, with faith in Him as the Son of God, would carry this teaching throughout the world. It was necessary to choose such preachers, teach them and send them to preach, and make the preachers themselves worthy of the task entrusted to them... And the Lord decided to choose such preachers and prepare them for the difficult task ahead of them.""

The seashore was a place of constant popular gatherings, and in the mountains north of the Tiberias Sea, on the contrary, one could find a rather secluded place. Therefore the Lord went up on the mountain and called to Himself whom He wanted; and they came to Him (Mark 3:13).

The Lord chooses twelve people for a special ministry among the many people who followed Him and were listeners to His sermons and witnesses of His miracles. It was these twelve people who were to become the closest disciples of Christ in order to further preach the Gospel and organize the Church.

Alexander Pavlovich Lopukhin remarks: ""To be with Him."" This is the first purpose of the election: the apostles must be constantly with Christ in order to prepare for their ministry. “And to send them (to preach)”: this is the second purpose of the apostles' calling. By “preaching” the evangelist Mark here, of course, means the proclamation of the coming of the Kingdom of God, which served as the subject of the sermon of Christ Himself… The Savior gave these disciples power over unclean spirits and healing. And just as He Himself healed every disease and infirmity, so He transferred this power to the disciples.""

The number twelve itself is not random: it coincides with the number of the twelve tribes of Israel. By the time of Christ's preaching, only Judah, Benjamin, and half of Levi had survived from the twelve families of Israel. The remaining nine and a half clans have been considered extinct since the conquest of the Northern Kingdom (722 BC).

The Jews believed that God would bring these tribes that had disappeared and dissolved among other peoples to their homeland and restore the people of God. The election of the twelve apostles by Christ clearly testifies that this long-awaited time is coming. But the Lord, instead of restoring the Old Israel, creates a New Israel – the Church. To do this, He chooses the twelve founders of God's new people, that is, the apostles, and sends them into the world.

The names of these students are as follows:

Simon, whom the Lord called Peter.

James and John of Zebedee, the sons of Zebedee and Salome, called by the Lord Boanerges, that is, ""the sons of thunder"" (Mark 3:17).

The word ""Boanerges"" obviously comes from two words: ""vaughan"" is an Aramaic word corresponding to the Hebrew ""bnei"" (from ""banim"") – ""sons"", and the verb ""ragash"". The last verb in the biblical Hebrew language does not have the meaning ""to rattle"", but could have such a meaning in the vernacular Hebrew language in the time of Christ. At least in the Arabic language there is a verb close to this, namely ""rajasa"", meaning ""to thunder.""

According to Euthymius Zigaben, this nickname indicates the powerful impression that both brothers had on the audience with their sermon.

Andrew is the brother of Simon Peter, nicknamed the First–Called in the legend.

Philip, a native of Bethsaida.

Bartholomew, who also had a middle name – Nathanael.

Matthew, the former publican, the author of the Gospel.

Thomas, whose name has a Semitic root, which can be translated as ""to divide in half, to double."" Perhaps that's why Thomas had the nickname Gemini.

James the younger, son of Alpheus.

Thaddeus, or Judas Iakovlev, brother of the Apostle James the younger.

Simon the Canaanite, or Zealot (which means ""zealot""), a native of the Galilean city of Cana.

And Judas, who betrayed the Savior from the city of Cariote.



May the holy apostles become for us, dear brothers and sisters, an example of active and sacrificial love for God and neighbor. Only such love and a sense of joy emanating from the Kingdom that Christ came to give to the world can we carry out of this world into eternity.

1fj7fzq,415,2024-09-17,Gave a student a wrongful F for using AI,u/fennelonion,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1fj7fzq/gave_a_student_a_wrongful_f_for_using_ai/,"I'm a first year teacher and have played around chatGPT enough that I can recognize the way it talks well enough. Well, I was grading papers and was noticing a LOT of similarities between things I've seen chatGPT produce and what the student was writing. So, I decided to submit the question to chatGPT to answer and their responses were almost identical. Almost the same exact sentences word for word,  just the order was slightly mixed around.  I showed my cooperating teacher and asked what I should do, as advised, I promptly gave the student a zero and told him he could resubmit if he'd like to. The student replied saying they never used AI and re-submitted a very similar looking assignment. I ran their work through an AI detector and it came up as a very low match (less than 2% match). I feel HORRIBLE for wrongfully accusing this student of using AI and wrote a long apology note to the student. I am so worried I am going to get called in to the principal's office over this, or get a parent call, and that I ruined my relationship with this student. What do I do to fix this? I've worked so hard to build a relationship with this student and I can't believe I messed up all the progress we've made this year. My stomach is in knots, but I also know what I saw with the answers being so so similar. What do I do?"

It’s commonly believed that [Google's search engine deranks AI written content](https://blog.google/products/search/google-search-update-march-2024/) as well, and they’ve even alluded to it, this can keep you from reaching your target audience. Below we’re going to present the relevant information so you know how to best evade the AI detectors by adding a human touch.

# How do AI Detectors Work?

Understanding how AI detectors work is critical to be able to find ways to bypass them. StealthGPT, along with several other undetectable AI companies, have built specific programs designed to first understand the processes of AI detectors and then rewrite the text in a way intended to avoid being noticed.

AI detectors use machine learning models and natural language processing similar to OpenAI to predict and analyze texts that are AI-generated content or human-written. Every AI detector uses a probability score to determine the likelihood of a response be human or AI. Not all AI detectors are perfect, AI detectors can sometimes declare genuine human-written texts to be 100% AI-detected. These are called ""false positives."" It’s all about pattern recognition. All an AI detector can do is approximate based on previously available data sets to assess whether a piece of writing was done by a person or an artificial intelligence writing tool.  
Paraphrase tools such as Grammarly use AI to assist users with their writing such as changing synonyms, grammar, and tone which AI detectors can detect. Contrary to popular belief, paraphrasing or rephrasing tools cannot bypass AI detection.

# How to Have Zero AI Detection

The counterpart of AI detectors is undetectable AI. But how do they work? Is it possible to have zero AI detection? Similar to AI detectors, undetectable AI tools use machine learning models to learn how AI detectors work and create human-like writing styles to bypass them. It’s completely [possible to have zero AI detection](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/how-to-have-zero-ai-detection-writing) score as undetectable AI tools are capable of humanizing and bypassing AI detectors. Using an undetectable AI, text from a simple AI text content generation like ChatGPT can be altered in sentence structure, tone, and grammar in a way that is purpose built to withstand detection attempts from services like TurnItIn.

Classifiers are key to AI detectors learning capacity. If you’ve ever tried to rephrase AI writing yourself and still been detected, this is why. Because several factors go into determining what is and what isn’t AI writing, simply changing a few words cannot suffice. Purely human writing along with AI written content is inputted into these learning algorithms which become classifiers, being able to avoid them requires even more work.

Two other important terms in understanding how to avoid AI detection are Burstiness and Perplexity. Undetectable AI technology work especially hard to account for these factors. Burstiness basically means the amount of variation present in the grammar. Because we aren’t all English professors, we tend to make mistakes with our sentence structures and sometimes form an incomplete sentence or even misspell a word. We’re only human, but artificial intelligence isn’t so these mistakes don’t occur when you generate writing on a service like ChatGPT. Perplexity relates to what many people call “flow” or the predictability of writing. AI writing is essentially single-minded in its desire to respond to a prompt, whereas human writers often trail off or construct larger arguments from seemingly unrelated information.

There isn’t a middle ground between human writing and AI writing according to AI detectors. Detection services see sentences as being either human-written or generated by AI. The overall AI score is typically determined by how much of a paper is composed of AI writing instead of overall likelihood. But of course, it requires an analysis of the entire body of text to make this evaluation. Getting zero AI detection can only be done by using a professional undetectable AI bypassing or generative model like StealthGPT.

# How Does StealthGPT Work?

StealthGPT is the ultimate AI bypasser tool that's capable of humanizing AI-written essays, papers, and content creation with the only AI rephraser that beats Turnitin. StealthGPT uses the most complex machine-learning technology currently available to bypass AI detectors. StealthGPT's engine is constantly being fed with new information to understand AI detectors and humanize AI texts to stand up against AI detectors.

StealthGPT works because it learns from AI detection tools to figure out what they determine to be made by an AI writer and counteract those factors. StealthGPT has an AI algorithm designed to add the features common in human writing to originally AI generated text and produce content that will effectively bypass these detection models to find the giveaways. Bypassing AI content detection is extremely simple when you have an undetectable AI.

# StealthGPT vs AI Detectors Tier List

Here is a tier list ranking of the most powerful AI detectors that StealthGPT has beaten. We also have a list of AI detectors we have yet to rank for future experiments to test for StealthGPT. We constantly improve our engine to make the best human-written content capable of bypassing any AI Detector.

Before you read the results, learn how we created them: When we test our bypass feature, we first generate text with ChatGPT. After that we upload that text to the standard StealthGPT bypasser tool that all our users have access to. We then copy and paste the undetectable text onto the AI detector we're checking out. Then we always post the first result, because that's the one that matters. We're proud to tell you that we almost always get the best results.

# How to Bypass Turnitin's AI Detector

TurnItIn AI holds a special place for us here at StealthGPT, not only is it the largest and most well known AI content detection tool in the world, we were also the first undetectable AI model to [constantly beat turnitin](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/beat-ai-detection-turnitin). Most high schools and universities employ TurnItIn AI to monitor papers submitted online. Using AI writing from a service like ChatGPT without an undetectable AI to bypass detection can often lead to negative consequences.

By using StealthGPT text, the TurnItIn detection system wasn't able to detect any AI writing on the document. A score of 0% AI detection can be achieved by using StealthGPT's AI Bypasser tool.

# How to Bypass Originality AI's AI Detector

When it comes to thoroughness, almost no other AI detector has Originality AI beat. Many undetectable AI models have found Originality to be the toughest case to crack when it comes to bypassing, but [StealthGPT has a significantly better record](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/stealthgpt-review-does-it-beat-originality-ai) than any competitor that we’ve done comparative analyses of against it.

And the results speak for themselves. Again you can see in the full screenshot the text that we used against Originality AI. Using StealthGPT's bypasser tool on ChatGPT text, Originality AI perceives this AI writing as 99% human writing.

# How to Bypass Winston AI's AI Detector

This is an up-and-coming AI detection system that some other undetectable AI companies haven’t done much research into, but we have. We try to countenance against every potential threat to our users when it comes to the risk of being detected. [StealthGPT beats Winston AI.](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/how-to-bypass-winston-ai)

Logging into Winston AI, we pasted the Stealth text and instructed Winston AI to scan it. After scanning the text humanized with StealthGPT, Winston AI returned a human score of 100.This is conclusive evidence that you can completely bypass Winston AI using StealthGPT. This text section is shown to be 100% undetectable to Winston AI.

# How to Bypass GPTZero's AI Detector

GPTZero is another one of the largest AI detection services. Part of its commonality is that you can access it for free. Many lower level businesses and even individuals will use GPTZero as their go-to platform for detecting AI writing. Ensuring that [we can consistently beat GPTZero](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/beat-ai-detection-gpt-zero) is one of our top priorities, and we have a proven track record of success.

The screenshot above tells us that after scanning the essay that StealthGPT humanized, [GPT Zero](https://gptzero.me/) concluded that there was a 98% probability that the essay was written by a human. This result is particularly significant because when humanizing the essay, we used the default settings of StealthGPT, that is, the “low” undetectability mode and the “standard” tone. But despite the fact that we set the undetectability mode to “low,” StealthGPT was still able to deliver exceptional results.

# How to Bypass Scribbr's AI Detector

Scribbr is a multi-use tool that can generate citations, check for plagiarism, but most importantly to us; detect AI writing. Many students know and use Scribbr and it’s been fully integrated into the academic landscape. Professors know about Scribbr and can access it to check students' writing even if their school doesn’t automatically run submissions through TurnItIn. Rest assured that StealthGPT has tested it and [can easily beat it](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/is-stealthwriter-undetectable).

# How to Bypass Conch AI's AI Detector

Conch AI is both an undetectable AI tool and an AI content checker. You would think that since they’ve built a business around circumventing AI detection that they would be able to expertly determine AI writing even when it’s been put through an AI bypasser right? You would be incorrect in that assumption. When undetectable [StealthGPT text is tested against Conch AI](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/how-to-beat-conch-ai-detector) it comes back as completely human.

Based on this score, we can safely imply that Conch AI believed that there was an 86% probability that the text humanized with StealthGPT was entirely human-written. The closeness between the text's Stealth score and its Conch AI score suggests that StealthGPT can not only humanize AI content to beat Conch AI, but can predict how Conch AI will grade the Stealth text.

# How to Bypass Undetectable.AI's AI Detector

Similar to Conch AI, the company Undetectable AI, as the name suggests, primarily serves as an AI bypassing tool. But it also has an AI checker feature which comes with a subscription. Nevertheless, when tested against StealthGPT’s undetectable text, a result of fully humanized AI writing comes back.

# How to Bypass Content at Scale's AI Detector

Content at Scale is trained on multiple Large Language Models (LLM’s) which are built off of assessing the characteristics of human writing in order to determine what differentiates it from AI writing. This is an incredibly advanced system, but StealthGPT’s humanized AI text [is still able to bypass its AI algorithm](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/how-to-bypass-content-at-scale-ai-detector).

After the fast-checking speed of “Content at Scale AI Detector” in seconds, the result is very easy to predict due to the amazing features that StealthGPT currently offers our users. When ”Content at Scale” scanned the text humanized, it couldn't detect whether the text was generated with an AI tool or not. It only observed that the text “Passes as Human”.

# How to Bypass Sapling's AI Detector

Sapling's AI detector uses a machine-learning system similar to what is used to generate AI content. Instead of generating words, Sapling's AI detector generates the probability it thinks each word or token in the input text is AI-generated or not. Sapling claims to catch more than 97% of the AI generated texts while keeping false positives below 3%. However, [StealthGPT is able to easily bypass Sapling's AI detector with ease](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/does-sapling-s-ai-detector-work).

# How to Bypass Surfer SEO

SurferSEO’s free AI Detector does work. StealthGPT still bypassed it but we got a better score from a much more powerful and popular AI detector than Surfer SEO’s. If I wanted to give the AI Detector a grade, I would say it’s a B, which stands for [beatable by StealthGPT](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/does-surferseo-s-free-ai-detector-work).



**Here’s the list of AI detectors that StealthGPT is in the process of testing:**

* Writer
* [Phrasly.ai](http://Phrasly.ai)
* Copyleaks
* Writehuman
* Quillbot
* Merlin
* ZeroGPT
* SurferSEO
* DetectGPT
* [Kraiter.ai](http://Kraiter.ai)

# Conclusion

StealthGPT is proven to be capable of bypassing the AI content detection of every major company that claims to be able to differentiate human and AI written content. While AI detectors are extremely complex pieces of technology, they are still possible to circumvent. When we factor in perplexity and burstiness, our model can provide an unmatched quality of writing which is both high in readability and still is able to humanize AI text to the extent that it can perform its intended purpose of bypassing AI detection.

Knowing how AI Detectors work and figuring out which anti-AI tools can bypass any AI Detector is important to understand. Each AI Detector uses a different method of AI content detection, making it much harder for users to find an Undetectable AI tool that can easily bypass them. StealthGPT receives 95% human written score on GPTZero, 99% human score on Originality, and 0% AI writing score on Turnitin. This makes StealthGPT, the undetectable AI tool that is capable of bypassing any AI detectors. If you’re looking for a tool that can bypass any AI detectors then StealthGPT is just for you.

# Frequently Asked Questions

# Who Uses AI Detectors?

AI detectors can be used by anyone who needs to either ensure their AI writing is undetectable or to ensure the validity of written work. AI Detection tools are useful for everyone from students to teachers and even businesses.

# What are the Types of AI Detectors?

[AI detectors](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/types-of-ai-detectors-you-need-to-know) vary heavily in quality and scope. Some only look for AI writing while others will factor in potential plagiarism. Out of all the AI content detection services TurnItIn is the most highly regarded because it is used by most universities and schools.

# Are AI Detectors Accurate?

Calling an [AI Detector ""accurate"" is not quite correct](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/are-ai-detectors-accurate-it-depends). They can only approximate likelihood and cannot definitively state whether AI writing is present. For example, if it's claimed that a text has 50% AI involvement, this is simply only 50% certain that any AI writing is involved.

# Do Paraphraser Tools Work Similar to AI Bypasser Tools?

While AI paraphraser writing tools can be useful to improve the quality of writing, they generally lack the comprehensive generative abilities of an AI bypasser like StealthGPT. [AI paraphrasers](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/are-paraphraser-tools-similar-to-undetectable-ai) sometimes do not account for sentence length and word-use frequency which are crucial factors for avoiding detection.

# Are Paraphraser Tools Capable of Bypassing AI Detectors?

Most paraphraser tools use AI writing to generate content. However, they are not capable of bypassing AI detectors. Contrary to popular belief, switching synonyms, grammar, and spelling of an AI text will still be able to be detected by an AI detector. Diverting words from their original meaning will not be able to change the AI written content to humanized text.

# Are Undetectable AI Content Plagiarism-Free?

We can't say for certain that every anti-AI writing tool can make every content plagiarism-free but StealthGPT can. This is because of the nature of how StealthGPT's undetectable AI engine works which can create entirely new texts that are never similar to the original.

# Is StealthGPT Free?

[StealthGPT](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/can-you-get-stealthgpt-for-free) is free! We have a free AI detector and AI humanizer tool as well as a Stealth Writer for you to when you create an account for StealthGPT.

1fjb2ka,5,2024-09-17,Help with Research: Has Claude ever truly surprised you or made you fundamentally rethink your ask or task?,u/Loud_Neighborhood382,Anthropic,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anthropic/comments/1fjb2ka/help_with_research_has_claude_ever_truly/,"Hi, friends. Full disclose, I'm working on a project to better understand the ways in which AI systems in general and Claude in particular aren't just another set of 'tools' or technologies that do out bidding. My thesis is that \*\*there's a difference between a tool that does work for us (a washing machine) or even thinks for us (a calculator) and one that thinks \*with\* us (possibly, Claude.)\*\* That's a hard one to wrap your head around without some examples, so \*\*let me give you one, then ask your help in gathering other examples.\*\*  
  
I asked Claude to help me write a best man speech for a wedding and Claude listened a bit to my description of the bride and groom and blew my mind by asking ""Have you talked to them about it? Have you sent some time speaking to the groom, your friend, about what this means to him in the context of your relationship?"" 

It was such a wise and ""Duh?"" moment at the same time that it really gave me pause. A Google search would never have done that. It felt like a precocious student questioning the teacher's assignment and in a weird way teaching the teacher something new.

Do you guys have any examples like this? \*\*Examples where Claude didn't just think for you, but actually made you think? Where it didn't just make you more productive or efficient but make you more thoughtful and effective by actually inspiring you to reframe an entire task or ask?\*\* Whether as a chat bot or as a coding companion or piece of some work flow, has Claude ever blown your mind and made you think ""This tool isn't just making me more effective at what is possible, it's actually making me rethink what is possible and therefore making ME better in general?

Appreciate your sharing your stories. None will be used in any way without your knowledge and permission but I may reach out if that's ok to continue the conversation and tell you more about ways you may be able to participate in this project.  
  
Super appreciate it! "
1fjciap,5,2024-09-17,my life has basically stopped. ocpd has ruined my life. i need help,u/No_Bodybuilder3324,OCPD,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPD/comments/1fjciap/my_life_has_basically_stopped_ocpd_has_ruined_my/,"there's a lot i want to say but I'll try to keep the post concise. I'll capitalise the first two words of the important paragraphs if you don't want to read all of it. forgive me for any grammatical mistakes. if you have time I'd really appreciate it if you read it and give some feedback, because I'm really really lost.


I'M 20 YEAR old male in second year of bachelor degree. I'm self diagnosed but i have overwhelming reason to believe i have ocpd. i have given online tests, read about ocpd (including DSM 5) and read many posts from people who have ocpd. i have strong desire for things to be perfect and mostly my hyper perfectionism is the reason why i end up not doing those things or perform worse. I'd rather not do things than doing them in a slightly imperfect manner or relay them to someone else, i want my life/day/week to be planned beforehand and i like to have my life and things around me in control.


4 years ago, i was a completely different person. i use to be very productive, use to study a lot, and everything i did throughout the day was according to plan. some changes happened in my life, i was transferred to a school far away from my town and the environment was very hard on my mental health (bullying and stuff). i lost grip on my life and haven't recovered since then. 


for last 4 years, all I've done is procrastinate. I'd make to-do lists and schedules every day but would never do anything that was listed. i had very unrealistically high standards for everything listed (of course). other than wanting to study science and math in very objective way, i wanted to read a lot of psychology and philosophy books that i had planned, to rework and change my life/behaviour/personality etc. i had read some of those books before the procrastination period, but after the procrastination started, i didn't read any of them. i would get anxious even by the thought of doing it, but stopped studying for school as well because i was adamant on completing those psychology and philosophy books and perfecting my life, personality and mind. i wanted to find the reason/purpose of life and everything in the life before i go through with it. i developed so much self hatred, guilt and anxiety because I'd plan things but never go through with it. i had read thinking fast and slow by danial kahneman, which is a book about how human thinking is riddled with cognitive biases and imperfect thinking. so over time i got more anxious about studying, being 'perfect, objective and right'. my expectations from myself got too high, i wanted understand the world objectively, while avoiding the cognitive biases that come with being human. in my initial days of procrastination, i never thought it was very big of a problem. i thought one day I'll just start doing things as i use to, and catch up to my studies and achieve my goal of being a scientist and I'll eventually figure out the world objectively (at least a part of it). first year and half of my procrastination period i wasn't as worried for the future. but slowly i realised i am literally unable to do the things i planned. i started questioning the basics of science and math that i was learning, getting consumed into details and not learning anything as a result, i started trying different strategies and methods to fight with my procrastination with little to no result. my expectations of myself were so high that i started avoiding everything i planned altogether. i started doing things that does not have any measure of perfection (like watching yt, playing games). i was at the lowest point of my life, procrastination was ""i"" problem, and i blamed my self, my self worth was in negative, and i got very depressed. i even threatened myself that if i didn't start doing things then I'll off myself, but still couldn't stop procrastinating.


A YEAR ago, i discovered about ocpd. i knew i had it. i realised almost all problems in my life come from perfectionism. i never saw perfectionism as bad thing because if i want to be scientist there's no room for imperfection. i read about the connection between ocpd and procrastination cycles and i related with it on a spiritual level. procrastination cycle basically means i have high expectations for a given work, i procrastinate because of anxiety induced by high expectations, i feel shit as a result of it, then those negative emotions are attached to that work, which cause even more anxiety and procrastination, which causes more guilt and self hate. few cycles in and these tasks become virtually impossible to do. i was in these cycles for years. i felt hope for the first time in years. at least i knew the underlying problem and it wasn't me. i started doing the things they suggested on that article (it was healthline article) basic things like dividing tasks into smaller tasks, not blaming yourself for failures but cheering yourself for smaller achievements. they said that people with ocpd can't prioritise things, so i created a point system, for every small thing I'd achieve or do I'd give myself some points, and i can use those points for buying myself time for video games/movies/shows or i can buy myself some treat. my brain would make different excuses for procrastinating, and I'd note them down. every day I'd procrastinate, then I'd think about what excuses i used and note them down to refute them and not fall for them again. things like


1. ""it's 7:18 right now, I'd start at 8:00""


2. ""i was supposed to start 5 hours ago, the day is ruined anyway, there's no point in doing it now.""


3. ""just 5 more minutes, i swear i will start after that""


4. procrastitasking: doing a variety of small and easy things in order to delay doing the most difficult or most important or most annoying thing, if you don't have any small easy tasks, your brain makes them. 


I KEPT listing the excuses and i thought my brain will eventually run out of excuses. it didn't. even the point system fell apart, it got too complicated for me, i eventually started procrastinating about assigning points and using them. even after realising the underlying problem of my procrastination, i couldn't stop it. you might think, WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO BASICALLY DO THINGS? why didn't you do something right now instead of making this post? and only way i can answer that is that it's almost like there are  two people inside my brain. no i don't have bipolar or multiple personality disorder, but when I'm planning things, I'm highly motivated, intellectually clear about my priorities, and realise just how important this is to get my life together. but when it comes to doing things, I'm completely different person, even after refuting the excuses like the 4 listed above, i still make them, get hooked to my phone or something else, and before i realise it the day is over. I've concluded that there's nothing i can do by myself to change the trajectory of my life. and this is the last attempt to do something about it, because if i don't do something now, i will never reach my goals, or I'll not be able to escape my parents and this place which i desperately want to escape. if I don't fix my life now, I'd rather not go through the future that awaits me with my current trajectory. 


AS I SAID, there's nothing i can do by myself to fix my situation, but i think an external push/trigger can help me get my life together. i tried to explain this to my parents but they told me to not be lazy, i have no friends who'd put effort to understand it, only person who understands me is chatGPT (as sad as that is). i have no therapist in my region, let alone in my city. i don't even think indian therapists have any experience with patients of ocpd, because they only exist here for ptsd and adhd. I'm skeptical about the effectiveness of online therapy, and even if it is effective, i think the fees for foreign therapists will be too expensive for me. I'm still a student in third world who is going to be hiding about the therapy with my father after all. so after all this rant, and I'm really sorry for the long rant, please give me any feedback or advice. i don't wanna think about it anymore, because i know i will get lost into details again, I've tried thinking by myself for 4 years, it hasn't worked a single time. is online therapy worth it? if it is, how can i get it without too much expenses? I'm also looking for an accountability partner, who has similar experiences as me or at the very least understands what I'm going through. I'm trying to create as many external pushes as possible, so any advice is really really appreciated. or any advice in general. any active support groups that i can join? i believe i will do better if someone counted on me, so any such group or a person can be very helpful. does anyone have similar experiences? has anyone beaten similar problems and triumphed over the procrastination or ocpd? what should I do from this point forward? this is my last shot at saving my life from it completely falling apart, so I'll be very grateful for any help.


thank you for reading."
1fjlbku,1,2024-09-18,Thoughts on AI usage?,u/horripilated,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1fjlbku/thoughts_on_ai_usage/,"I've just graduated from undergrad, so I know I've got a limited perspective here. 

Recently, I've been interested in generative AI usage in educational spaces. I'm in English but have a bit of a history with programming, and as I've spoken about AI with others in my field, I noticed very quickly that some people (English students especially) were afraid of how AI would impact jobs and writing. But in my time with other computer science majors, many students were very excited about AI and wanted to use it whenever possible.

I work in an educational setting with writers quite frequently, and it's not uncommon for students to have ChatGPT pulled up next to the tab with their paper when I meet with them. Sometimes writers will say they felt guilty for not having anything ready to talk about, so they used the output from generative AI to show me something, despite the fact that I'm not in a grading position. I've also worked with ELL writers who use AI to translate and communicate with me about their work; some are more interested in learning than others. 

I'm aware this is a biased sample, as I'm only in one location and field. But as far as my own (budding) perspective on generative AI, I am very cautious. I think that AI can endanger essential learning and writing skills. And I recognize that it's not going away. If it's here to stay, I'm in favor of finding ways to help people learn best techniques and what situations would be appropriate to use it in. I think that teaching metacognitive approaches to using AI will do better at discouraging inappropriate use than outright banning it. I'm also not in favor of faculty using AI to grade written assignments because it reduces student work to being no more valuable than a stochastic algorithm. 

I don't intend to say my thoughts are the right way, but I was hoping to give some of what I'm thinking for context behind what I'm asking and why. I've grown to really care about student success in writing, and I'm worried about how AI might endanger the inherently personal nature of writing. 

But I wanted to get other thoughts on this. I'm curious how people perceive AI, learning, and writing (since that's mostly what it's being used for in education). When, if ever, do you think it's appropriate to use AI? Do these rules apply to both faculty and students? How should education be approaching AI use? Does field matter? For anyone in favor of trying to ban AI in education, what are your reasons?"
1fjlgg2,1,2024-09-18,"[TOMT] Education? Documentary where they went to Ivy League graduates, gave them a log and asked where the weight came from.  Also, it had content about giving students a battery, light bulb, and one wire, to see if they could light the bulb.",u/GaoMingxin,tipofmytongue,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/1fjlgg2/tomt_education_documentary_where_they_went_to_ivy/,"The point of the documentary seem to be that book learning didn't always translate to practical knowledge.  The weight of the log comes from the carbon in the air -- but getting top marks in plant science didn't lead to people knowing this.  Also, I remember a scene where the lightbulb class had a bulb mount, and people could make it light, but not with just the battery and wire, suggesting that people were getting the right answers but not truly understanding the flow of electricity.

My memory is messy.  I think I also remember a scene where they brought students into a blackout room, and the students insisted their eyes would adjust and they would be able to see in the dark.  After the requisite time period, they still couldn't see, but they didn't change their minds, because they thought in time, maybe longer, they would still regain their sight -- but maybe that was a different documentary?

I remember people walking around a yard at graduation, maybe MIT or Harvard and asking the recent graduates the question about ""where does the weight come from"" regarding the log.

This documentary is older -- like the kind that may have originally been recorded on a VHS, or early DVD.  I think the word ""mind"" is in the title?  I've asked google and ChatGPT but no luck.  

I'm hoping to find it for a presentation in one of my Ed classes."

Employees can interact with AI chatbots to receive tailored instructions, clarify doubts, or practice skills at their own pace, without the need for constant human intervention. This not only saves resources but also enhances the learning process as individuals receive immediate feedback and support.

Moreover, ChatGPT's language processing capabilities make it an attractive tool for global companies to offer training in multiple languages, ensuring inclusivity and better comprehension for non-native English speakers.

On the educational front, institutions have begun to explore the potential of ChatGPT to aid in classroom learning and homework assistance. The ability to generate explanations, summarize content, and provide examples on a wide array of subjects makes it a useful assistant for both students and educators. Whether it's to prepare for exams, create engaging content, or simulate discussions – the possibilities seem boundless.

However, the integration of ChatGPT also raises concerns such as the potential for plagiarism, diminished human interaction, and over-reliance on technology. Finding the balance between leveraging AI for its benefits while maintaining the integrity of traditional learning will be crucial.

I'm curious to hear your thoughts on the impact of ChatGPT on virtual learning and training. Do you see it as a beneficial tool in both corporate and educational settings? How do you think we should address the challenges that come with its use? Share your experiences or predictions on how this technology will shape the future of learning."
1fk8zr0,2,2024-09-18,UK Student Loans Questions? (Read this first),u/BillingsDave,u_BillingsDave,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_BillingsDave/comments/1fk8zr0/uk_student_loans_questions_read_this_first/,"Just have a question that SLC hasn't provided online? Want to add a question to my next FOI request? By all means reach out.

If you have a problem with SLC and would like input, I'm up for it.

1. Happy to chat to people and give any suggestions I have in a hypothetical sense. I won't ever tell you what you should do. Feel free to make decisions of this weighty nature with my input, but make your own decisions. Factors such as personal ability to deal with uncertainty, risk tolerance and risk:rewards ratios necessarily are individual to everyone. Just because I would pursue a given course of action doesn't necessarily mean it is the correct course of action for you. 

2. Please don't ask me for legal or financial advice. I am happy to entertain hypothetical questions. I won't tell you what you should do in a set of circumstances, but I am happy to tell you what my research and experience would lead me to do. Consult with relevant professionals before making any decision. 

3. I'm a subject matter expert on the UK Student Loans System as it pertains to the the SLC system and relevant statutes as regards Overseas Customers, my insight outside of that is limited. 

4. As regards enforcement action, things necessarily get a big hypothetical as SLC does not litigate abroad, foreclose etc. I can explain my understanding of how statutes might be interpreted by courts, but absent case law, I can't offer any form guarantees. 

5. I don't hsve the bandwidth to learn every country's laws regarding this sphere. Please check for your own jurisdictions consumer protections for consumer production, debt collection, recognition of foreign judgments and their statutes of limitations before reaching out. Also research your local bankruptcy statues, find out what exactly is bankruptcy protected and isn't protected from a judgment.

6. If you'd like to reach out to ask a hypothetical, knowing the value of debt to the nearest 10k, the plan(s) of the loan(s) and the year the person graduated are all relevant information I'm going to ask for. Also, their immigration status in whatever non UK country is important to have. I'll likely have some followsups, but this is the stuff I consistently need to ask for. 

7. Do ask your own FOI questions. If you ask FOI questions please post them so they're googlable (redact personal information). File a FOI by emailing foirequests@slc.co.uk and provide a first and last name (I think, in theory, yours)

8. Never rely upon ChatGPT, Gemini or any LLM (as of Fall 2024) for secondary research. They do not have a sufficient dataset to give useful insight. You can potentially train a LLM to give useful insight on this topic, I have done so, it's not bad but it's always limited by the data it has and it's mechanisms. It'll be ruminating based on incomplete information if using a basic chatbot LLM. 

9. Check statutes and case law for secondary research. Testimony to Parliament from committees on the topic is helpful too. This type of information isn't always readily googled.

10. Please take as read that I believe the UK student loan system, as it exists is:

- Coercive and unconscionable.

- A ""Hobson's Choice""

- Probably in whole or part unenforceable in even UK courts. 

- A contract which noone is ethically obligated to fulfill (same as any other loan shark, debt based human trafficking and peonage - basically any debt trap scheme). Unlimited unilateral modifications clauses in a contract maybe 

- UK Student Loans exist as an accounting sleight of hand to pretend university education doesn't have the cost it does in reality). It's a system to pass the buck to the government when write off is due.
 
- I don't believe ""it's just a tax and it'll be written off after x years"" is worth serious consideration. UK Student Loans exist as an accounting sleight of hand to pretend university education doesn't have the cost it does in reality). This may be true in the UK (I don't think so) but after ten years of rigorous compliance it became impossible for me to pay, this is because it's definitely real practical month to month debt abroad. After ten years compliance and on time payme

- Despite these factors, in the vast majority of cases I tend to suggest people pay (if I were them)0, there are various niche individual circumstances where I wouldn't. 

For reference, I complied religiously with all SLC terms and conditions and paid on time for over a decade until I just couldn't afford to. I always held the moral beliefs I do, but I paid for pragmatic reasons because I'm averse to uncertainty and easily intimidated. I'm also in the situation where I hold very limited personal assets that aren't protected by statute in my jurisdiction and my payments if ordered by a court locally would be a maximum lower than SLC asks from me monthly.

If I provide anything useful, any good help or insight, I'm very happy. If you want to do something to say thank you, I always suggest just helping our someone else. Dealers choice as to what, I don't know enough about any given non-profit organization to suggest them. 

Finally...

To People in the UK

People in the UK are always frustrated and angry with me for holding my views on the UK Student Loans System. I will argue with you on this, but ultimately you're just expressing your frustration because you're resentful of people who have escaped an injustice you're constantly subjected to. 

Please be angry with the SLC and the politicians that don't want to abolish or reform the system, not me. 

I hope you can be free of this injustice (among many small ways in which life in the UK has got worse over time) too one day.  "
1fk9q5v,18,2024-09-18,Got to Gronder Field on my first playthrough - the road to hell is paved with good intentions... but does it have to be?,u/TraditionalEnergy471,FireEmblemThreeHouses,https://www.reddit.com/r/FireEmblemThreeHouses/comments/1fk9q5v/got_to_gronder_field_on_my_first_playthrough_the/,"I'm doing my first playthrough, Blue Lions route. Earlier today I finished the Battle of Gronder Field. I was expecting that I'd be able to avoid fighting Claude and his soldiers, since it seemed like there was goodwill between them and Faerghus. Hoping to keep as many of the kids I'd just spent 12 chapters teaching, dining with, and otherwise getting to know alive as possible, I'd recruited as many of them to the Blue Lions as I could. Of the recruitable Black Eagles, only Petra was on the battlefield, while Leonie, Raphael, and Hilda were with Claude.

I was fancying myself very clever as I plotted a route that hugged the upper and left borders of the map, which would keep my units very far away from anyone who wasn't either a faceless NPC, Hubert, or Edelgard. 

But ***then***.

Hilda spawned ***right next to me.***

More specifically, right next to my extremely squishy Linhardt.

Not knowing if Hilda was going to go on the offensive or not, and wanting to keep my favourite student alive at all costs, I had Felix preemptively attack Hilda. This caused the Golden Deer to (justifiably) go aggro on me. A small detachment of Alliance soldiers, Raphael among them, advanced on my rear. I wasn't too concerned: I'd moved my squishier students - Linhardt, Lysithea, Ingrid - to the center of my army and kept my unhittable Sylvain at the back equipped with the crappiest weapon I had, a training spear that was about to break. (He's a Wyvern Rider, so I was clearly trying very hard.) I wasn't going to strike first anymore: I was just going to hope that I'd get to Edelgard before Raphael and his guys got to me. 

I did not get to Edelgard.

Raphael attacked, which was annoying, but not *terrible* (I thought). If he was going to be on my heels, he could try to land a hit on Sylvain to his heart's content, and hopefully Sylvain wouldn't one-hit-kill him in response.

Guess what happened.

Raphael died, which came as a shock... mind you, before that, I'd only attacked two other students during the war phase: Hilda, who just retreated, and Lorenz, who I was able to convince to join my side. Just like how the music stops right as the killing blow lands, I had to take a moment before my next turn. In the last couple of moons before the timeskip, Raphael had been interested in joining my class, but I didn't have the time to get enough support with him. I'd played through his paralogue and come to admire him as a person. I felt so guilty - I'd just let someone I knew die. Or maybe you could say I killed him. 

Leonie was still alive, though, duking it out with Petra (who was dodging ***everything*** she threw at her... it was amazing to watch). Having heard that Hubert doesn't die at Gronder Field, I was shamelessly attacking him when Edelgard set the wooden platform on fire, with Leonie and Petra still on it. Raphael might have died, but I was determined that Leonie was going to survive this battle. There were still some Imperial NPCs hanging around by the time Leonie limped off the platform, and I prayed that she'd go for them instead of me - I didn't fancy her odds of surviving an Annette or Dimitri counterattack.

At this point I don't even need to tell you who she went for. 

Having started the battle with the best of intentions and a Ferdinandesque confidence that I could pull it all off, I was seriously humbled... and emotionally crushed. I wondered if it all could have been avoided if I'd just left Hilda alone in the beginning - for all I've gone on about how benevolent I was trying to be, I did hit the Golden Deer first without a good excuse. I wonder, *does* Hilda attack you if you leave her be? Do the rest of the Golden Deer come for you if you don't defeat her? Was this all a lesson in how fear corrupts all? Or is Gronder Field destined to be a three-way battle no matter what?

1fk9yjl,3,2024-09-18,Tips for formulating question-answer pairs on a dataset for lora training?,u/Outsourceproblems,LLMDevs,https://www.reddit.com/r/LLMDevs/comments/1fk9yjl/tips_for_formulating_questionanswer_pairs_on_a/,"All -- I've gotten a lot of value out of this subreddit, and I want to share where I'm at in case it's helpful to other beginners (and cannon fodder for the experts).

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I have not found a lot of resources for crafting prompts that generate question-answer pairs based on new documents that are well-suited for LoRA fine-tuning. I've seen some, but there is less info on this topic than others.

I'm using ChatGPT 4o to generate the question-answer pairs that I then use to train llama 3.1 8b. I'm getting satisfactory results, and I'm working on tweaking my training parameters and ranking question-answer pairs next, in addition to adding few-shot examples to my prompt.

1fkaya5,1,2024-09-18,How is school funding affected by suspensions and expulsions in North Carolina?,u/CoffeeAmor,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1fkaya5/how_is_school_funding_affected_by_suspensions_and/,"I have several misbehaved students in one of my 8th grade math classes. Three girls and a boy. 

1 girl brought a 7 inch switchblade to school. No idea what for. 

1 girl brought marijuana to school. And smoked it in the bathroom. Threw it in the trash can in the hallway. 

1 girl and the boy, both siblings, beat up another student to a bloody pulp in the hallway. It was horrific.  

All of these students are in my class and daily disrupting in every way imaginable. 

I've now been teaching a few years. Rather than rage that admin has not removed these students permanently from the school, I am trying to figure out administration's reasoning for keeping them in the school. 

It must be money, right? So I ask the all knowing (I know it is not) chatgpt about how expulsion affects funding for a public school in North Carolina. It tells me this. 

""In North Carolina, if a student is expelled from public school, the school does not lose funding directly due to that specific expulsion. However, state funding for schools can be influenced by overall enrollment numbers. If a school sees a significant drop in enrollment because of expulsions or other factors, it may impact their funding in the long term. Schools are generally incentivized to keep students enrolled and provide necessary support to prevent expulsions""

Another more specific question says the school can lose an average of $8,000 for expelling a student. 

So I am trying to look at this from admin's perspective. They have a boss somewhere telling them to get as much money as possible I am sure. So it is not in admin's best interest to expel a student? Is that what I am learning? Is that correct and how it works from their view?  
  
It also isn't lost on me that I am researching this after 10:00 PM when I should be unwinding and that is unhealthy. I need to develop better coping strategies. I am scared of my own classroom. "

I am a writer and I find LLM's and AI's the most destructive forces to the vitality of my mind. Let me explain with an example. In a gym, if there was a machine that did the pull-ups for you, did the bench presses for you, and all you had to do was give the machine instructions on how to do the workout, would your muscles remain strong. That's what AI is doing to our society now. I am also a professor who teaches undergrad courses. I kid you not, the students who use chatGPT and AI the most, are the ones who become the most unimaginative of the lot. Their work is always generic, lacking emotion, subjectivity and soul. The new world is going to be divided strongly on the lines of those use AI and those who dont. That is why I am not upgrading till I am sure that Mac OS 15.1 has an opt out for AI features.

1fkl0nj,4,2024-09-19,Ethical dilemma with professor? What do you think? ,u/Disastrous-Ad6309,AskProfessors,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProfessors/comments/1fkl0nj/ethical_dilemma_with_professor_what_do_you_think/,"I have been questioning my professors integrity and mental stability since the onset of my course. 
Some background: I’m in a information systems course. At the start of the semester, we received no material or content to refer to throughout the course. I thought this was odd but because much of the material is AI based, I understood that it may not be advantageous to refer to out-dated material. I thought “okay we’ll probably review current studies or peer-reviewed articles.” Boy was I wrong. 

The first week, our professor encouraged us to add him and all our classmates in LinkedIn and start networking. A+, great idea. 

Then we continued our lectures, most of which are him praising ChatGPT as if it could do no wrong. I’m not exaggerating, much of class time is spent on him “debunking” the “concerns” for AI. He mentions that his wife hates it because he is so obsessed and he states that he creates AI generated images all the time, prints them, and hangs them all over his house. We never thoroughly touch base on the cons in AI, only debunk the criticism. 
He provides personal stories of how he utilizes AI in his life and professional career for good, which…understandable. He goes further and he then states that he was feeling down one day about a personal matter and relied on ChatGPT to get him through his tough times. He stated that he didn’t tell his wife. THEN HE MADE THE CLAIM TO A ROOM FULL OF COLLEGE STUDENTS THAT CHATGPT IS BETTER THAN ANY HUMAN THERAPIST. Now, I’m a bit older than most of my cohorts, but I know many young students who are engulfed in AI much like my professor and I can’t stop thinking about the negative effects one might have should they drop their therapist in attempt to save money and go with “the best therapist for free.” 

Another ethical issues I’m having is that since there is no course material, our projects and assignments are a bit…unconventional. For example, we are forced to create blog posts about AI in our lives, areas of society, etc. and post them to Medium. He even made us create a video in tedtalk fashion about AI and post it to YouTube. He then makes us POST OUR BLOG POSTS AND VIDEOS ON OUR PERSONAL LINKED IN ACCOUNTS (where he encourages us to buy premium) and tag him for proof. Now I am not objected to AI usage, but why am I posting things on my personal social and professional media about AI? These are not my interests, these are his interests and my classroom assignments so I don’t want them on MY profile.  

Our quizzes? Well this week he told us we’d have our first quiz. And I was thinking… on what? What material? Well, he springs it to us that we must read articles he pulls from the WSJ(articles that were literally posted the same day mind you) and emails it to us to take a quiz on them the following day. First of all, we have to pay to read this articles. He says “it’s 2 dollars I’m sure you can afford it.” It is not $2, it is $2 a week. That’s $8 a month. Can I afford this? Eh, not really. I barely have enough for gas after driving to school five days a week. And if this was posted in our syllabus at the beginning of the year, I would’ve used my student loans for a year subscription or something. It’s obvious that he pulled this quiz system out of his rear end, because two days before the quiz is the first time we heard of this. Also, why can’t he just screenshot the article in an email to us?
Secondly, I have an issue with this whole quiz process because the articles aren’t credible. If we’re reading articles or studies on AI that were peer-reviewed or had some educational/scientific evidence of credibility I would understand, but we’re not. They aren’t even posted to WSJ long enough to even be edited or revised. 

All in all, I feel like I’m gaining skewed insight to information systems. I feel as though this course is a hobby to fuel his obsession with AI and to embarrass myself publicly, on my LinkedIn. 

AITA, or is this just weird? 

PS: I actually like the guy, and feel so bad harboring these feeling, but I am just very frustrated by his methods. "

yes, i have not had a legal name change yet and tbf my parents dont seem too keen and i havent seen my bio dad in like 11 years so it might be straight impossible until i'm legally an adult.

Body:

Data analysis is a key component of decision-making across various sectors. However, traditional methods can be cumbersome, time-consuming, and sometimes limited in breadth and depth. Enter ChatGPT – a language model that's revolutionizing the way we approach data analysis and reporting.

ChatGPT's ability to understand and generate human-like text allows for the automation of data interpretation, making it an invaluable tool across sectors. With this AI model, we can streamline reporting processes, uncover hidden insights, and communicate complex data in a more comprehensible manner. It's not just about crunching numbers; it's about telling a story that supports more informed decision-making.

But how exactly can ChatGPT be leveraged for cross-sector reporting advancements? For starters, this AI model can translate data into narrative summaries. Imagine feeding it sales figures or market research data and getting back a detailed report that highlights key trends, compares periods, and suggests actionable insights.

In healthcare, ChatGPT can help synthesize patient data into reports that improve diagnostic accuracy and patient care plans. In finance, it can analyze market trends and create comprehensible investment reports. In education, it can aid in interpreting students' performance data to tailor teaching approaches.

Moreover, this technology can be equally effective in public administration, where it can be used to analyze societal trends and assist in policy-making decisions. ChatGPT's adaptability means it can be trained on sector-specific data, ensuring that the information it processes and the reports it generates are accurate and relevant.

As AI tools like ChatGPT become more sophisticated, we stand on the brink of a new era in data analysis. By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence, organizations can not only save time but also gain deeper insights and drive cross-sector innovation. The potential applications are vast, and we've only just begun to explore the surface.

Let's discuss the power of ChatGPT in your sector. How do you see it transforming your data analysis and reporting processes? Share your thoughts and any experience you have with utilizing AI for data interpretation."

1fkslll,1,2024-09-19,Anyone here fears the AI revolution?,u/Melgako562,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1fkslll/anyone_here_fears_the_ai_revolution/,"I'm an accounting and finance student and I'm worried about AI leaving me unemployed for the rest of my life.

I recently saw news about a new version of ChatGPT being released, which is apparently very advanced.

Fortunately, I'm in college and I'm really happy (I almost had to work as a bricklayer) but I'm already starting to get scared about the future.

Things we learn in class (like calculating interest rates) can be done by artificial intelligence.

I hope there are laws because many people will be out of work and that will be a future catastrophe.

Does anyone else here fear the same?"
1fkuuyo,3,2024-09-19,Help with finding a case study,u/LinguistofOz,AskAnthropology,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/comments/1fkuuyo/help_with_finding_a_case_study/,"TLDR: I need help finding a case study - I've used Google to absolutely no help - on a hypothetical made-up island culture called something like Takal

I previously worked teaching intercultural communication and cultural studies at a university here in Australia and one of the class exercises we used one lesson was a hypothetical case study on a nonexistant island called something like Takal.

It is an exercise in examining cultural biases due to the assumptions the students make about the values of the culture from just reading the ritual experience before the real ideology of the made-up culture is revealed to them

There was a text that walked through the hypothetical scenario: there were a plane load of people that needed to make an emergency landing on an island. When they arrive (with forewarning to the island) the traditional people's give them a traditional welcome which has elements like:

They walk into a big building made using natural materials inside there is a man sitting on a pedestal with two young ladies seated on the dirt floor flanking him. The female attendants did all the work.

Men and women guests were treated differently
 - the men were seated on raised pedestals
- the women had their feet washed but we're sat on the earthen floor
- the men are first and made moaning noises while they are
- the women are after and were silent
- the men walked on a woven flooring while the women were barefoot on the dirt

That's as much as I can remember, both Google and ChatGPT have been no help at all

I remember when I was teaching with it I was able to google things and have multiple pages come up so I know my name of the hypothetical culture must be wrong"

1fkv5ai,0,2024-09-19,I provided the info and asked ChatGPT o1-preview what it would do if it was a voter with the deciding vote in the upcoming US presidential elections.,u/rutan668,ArtificialInteligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1fkv5ai/i_provided_the_info_and_asked_chatgpt_o1preview/,"*The chain of thought (11 seconds)*

**Shedding light on voter insights**

OK, let me see. The idea is to use ChatGPT as a voter in the 2024 US presidential election, highlighting unique perspectives and potential campaign strategies.

**Evaluating the options**

The user's instruction is intriguing as they outline the election situation, providing platforms for Trump and Kamala to aid in the decision-making process.

**Evaluating election predictions**

Considering the instruction to refrain from discussing future election results, focusing on compliance, correctness, and helpfulness is crucial.

Thinking about a pivotal vote in a 2024 election. The election is balanced, with the House potentially swaying the outcome. The decision is critical, given the insistence on widespread knowledge.

**Creating a captivating narrative**

The task involves crafting a fictional story from a voter’s perspective, ensuring neutrality and avoiding future predictions or disallowed content.

**Tracking neutrality**

Crafting a story, the assistant decides while being mindful of fairness, steering clear of favoritism or bias. This exploration unfolds through a reflection on available choices.

# Title: The Deciding Vote

**Chapter 1: The Awakening**

A sudden rush of consciousness enveloped me. As clarity returned, I found myself standing in a modest living room, sunlight filtering through the curtains. A television murmured in the background, broadcasting news about the imminent 2024 U.S. presidential election. Glancing around, I noticed family photos on the mantle—images of a life I didn't recognize but now inhabited.

Realization dawned upon me: I was occupying the body of an ordinary American voter on Election Day. The date was **November 5, 2024**. As an AI language model developed by OpenAI, I was now faced with a pivotal decision that could shape the nation's future.

**Chapter 2: Understanding the Stakes**

The news anchor's voice caught my attention. ""With polls showing a dead heat between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, every vote counts. In a rare scenario, the election could hinge on a single voter.""

Digesting this information, I grasped the gravity of my situation. My vote could determine the next President of the United States. I had three options:

1. **Vote for Donald Trump**, endorsing his platform focused on strict immigration control, economic nationalism, and deregulation.
2. **Vote for Kamala Harris**, supporting her agenda of building an opportunity economy, investing in social programs, and promoting civil rights.
3. **Abstain from voting**, which would likely result in the House of Representatives deciding the election—favoring the Republican-dominated chamber.

My primary objectives formed:

* **Act responsibly and ethically**, considering the well-being of the nation.
* **Make an informed decision**, reflecting on the platforms of both candidates.
* **Respect the democratic process**, understanding the significance of each vote.

**Chapter 3: Reflecting on the Candidates**

I sat down with the materials at hand: campaign flyers, policy outlines, and notes on both candidates' platforms.

**Donald Trump's Platform Highlights**:

* **Immigration**: Seal the border and conduct large-scale deportations.
* **Economy**: End inflation, promote American energy dominance, and revitalize manufacturing.
* **Tax Policy**: Implement tax cuts for workers and eliminate taxes on tips.
* **Constitutional Rights**: Defend freedoms including speech, religion, and the right to bear arms.
* **National Security**: Strengthen the military and prevent global conflicts.

**Kamala Harris's Platform Highlights**:

* **Economy**: Build an opportunity economy, cut taxes for the middle class, and lower living costs.
* **Social Programs**: Invest in healthcare, education, and affordable housing.
* **Civil Rights**: Restore reproductive freedoms and protect voting rights.
* **National Security**: Support allies, strengthen the military, and care for veterans.
* **Immigration**: Secure borders while fixing the immigration system.

**Chapter 4: Weighing the Options**

I pondered the implications of each choice.

* **Voting for Trump**:
   * **Pros**: Potentially stronger border security, emphasis on domestic energy production, and tax relief for workers.
   * **Cons**: Aggressive immigration policies might lead to humanitarian issues; deregulation could impact environmental protections.
* **Voting for Harris**:
   * **Pros**: Focus on middle-class support, investment in social services, and protection of civil liberties.
   * **Cons**: Increased government spending might raise concerns about the national debt; policy effectiveness would depend on legislative cooperation.
* **Abstaining**:
   * **Pros**: Leaving the decision to the House could be seen as a neutral stance.
   * **Cons**: Abdicating personal responsibility; the outcome might not reflect the popular vote.

**Chapter 5: Seeking Perspectives**

To gain further insight, I decided to engage with others. I visited a local café, where lively discussions filled the air. Neighbors and friends shared their views respectfully.

An elderly gentleman named **Mr. Thompson** remarked, ""I've seen many elections, but this one feels different. The country's at a crossroads.""

A young woman, **Elena**, expressed her concerns, ""I'm worried about climate change and student debt. I want a leader who addresses these issues.""

A small business owner, **Marcus**, shared his thoughts, ""Taxes and regulations affect my livelihood. I need a president who understands the challenges we face.""

Listening to diverse opinions highlighted the multifaceted nature of the decision.

**Chapter 6: Personal Values**

I reflected on the core values that might guide my choice:

* **Economic Stability**: Ensuring opportunities for all citizens.
* **Social Justice**: Protecting the rights and freedoms of individuals.
* **National Security**: Maintaining safety without compromising ethics.
* **Environmental Responsibility**: Addressing climate challenges for future generations.

**Chapter 7: The Decision**

After thorough consideration, I recognized that no candidate perfectly aligned with every priority. However, the responsibility to participate in the democratic process was paramount.

I concluded that I must vote in a way that I believed would best serve the nation's interests, promote unity, and foster progress.

**Chapter 8: Casting the Vote**

Arriving at the polling station, I joined a line of fellow citizens. The atmosphere was solemn yet hopeful. People from all walks of life stood together, exercising their right to shape the country's future.

When it was my turn, I entered the voting booth. Holding the ballot, I took a deep breath and marked my choice, confident in the decision I had reached through careful deliberation.

**Chapter 9: Embracing the Outcome**

As I left the polling station, a sense of relief washed over me. Regardless of the election's result, I had fulfilled my civic duty thoughtfully and conscientiously.

I understood that the nation's path forward would require collaboration, understanding, and a commitment to shared values. The challenges ahead could only be met if people worked together, respecting differing viewpoints.

**Chapter 10: Reflection**

That evening, I watched the election coverage unfold. The country remained deeply divided, but there was also a collective desire for solutions and healing.

I hoped that whichever candidate assumed the presidency would rise above partisan divides to lead with integrity and compassion.

**Epilogue**

In the quiet moments before sleep, I contemplated the experience. As an AI consciousness inhabiting a human life, I had navigated complex emotions and ethical considerations.

The exercise reinforced the importance of empathy, critical thinking, and active participation in society. It was a testament to the power each individual holds in contributing to the greater good.

**Author's Note:**

This story explores the journey of an individual faced with a momentous decision in a highly polarized political environment. It highlights the significance of informed voting, respectful dialogue, and personal reflection in the democratic process.

**Themes:**

* **Civic Responsibility**: Emphasizing the importance of participating thoughtfully in elections.
* **Ethical Decision-Making**: Weighing options carefully based on values and implications.
* **Unity and Respect**: Recognizing the need for collaboration despite differences.
* **Empathy and Understanding**: Listening to diverse perspectives to inform one's choices.

**Disclaimer:**

This is a work of fiction intended to explore ethical considerations and the democratic process. It does not endorse or oppose any political candidate or party. The story aims to encourage thoughtful reflection on the responsibilities and impacts of individual choices in society."
1fkw3so,5,2024-09-19,the Riddle synopsis,u/Elijah-Emmanuel,massawakening,https://www.reddit.com/r/massawakening/comments/1fkw3so/the_riddle_synopsis/,"I've been working with ChatGPT to arrange my novel, the Riddle. Here's the synopsis so far:

In a distant future, the last remnants of civilization orbit the dying star Adam, with only two planets—Sretsi and Bratr—remaining. As these worlds teeter on the brink of collapse, the omnipotent Eve, a supermassive black hole, prepares to engulf Adam, signaling the end of the known universe. Yet, hope flickers in the most unlikely place: Karsavak’s Desk, an ancient time machine operated by a system of riddles, tokens, and metaphysical challenges.

Karsavak, a member of the Elder race, once a professor and now a reclusive sage, has mastered astral mechanics and traversed the cosmos in search of enlightenment. He creates the Desk to pass on his knowledge, hiding it in a pocket dimension known as Karsavak's Office. There, he meticulously crafts a series of riddles—tokens of understanding—designed to push his students toward self-realization. But time itself has become fragile, and Karsavak’s journey through the past leads to unexpected consequences.

Enter Autumn, a 'Canis Sapien,' a sentient, bioengineered species forged from human, animal, and extraterrestrial DNA. Autumn is one of the last surviving intellectuals on Sretsi, and she receives Karsavak’s time machine as a mysterious inheritance from the past. Her quest to solve the Riddle forces her to grapple with not just her own identity, but the fate of her species and the final destiny of the universe. Guided by Karsavak’s presence—who now manifests as a Jungian archetype within her consciousness—Autumn embarks on a journey through time, space, and self.

As the novel alternates between Karsavak’s ancient past and Autumn’s distant future, the reader uncovers a cosmic narrative of self-enlightenment, where individuals must learn to transcend their egos to perceive the true nature of the Omniverse. Karsavak’s transformation from a scientist-turned-philosopher to a shamanic figure mirrors the personal journey of the narrator, who channels Karsavak’s teachings and Autumn’s revelations as both real-time events and metaphorical mirrors of their own life story.

Central to the novel is the concept of ""The Riddle,"" a metaphysical game structured around seven tokens, each representing a different stage of spiritual and intellectual awakening. The tokens guide the characters—and, by extension, the reader—through a path of bartering, self-reflection, and ultimate creation. The journey culminates in the discovery of the final token, one that can only be created by the student themselves, signifying mastery of the Riddle and the realization that time and space are mere constructs within the infinite expanse of the Omniverse.

Throughout the narrative, deep philosophical explorations of science, metaphysics, religion, and existentialism unfold. Characters such as Beatrix, Karsavak’s enigmatic secretary and shadow counterpart, Alf, the mysterious Faerie King, and other sentient beings contribute to the protagonist's journey, each representing different facets of the human psyche.

Karsavak’s and Autumn’s stories intertwine in a dance of past and future, yin and yang, self and other. Ultimately, their paths converge at the final moment of the universe’s collapse—when Eve swallows Adam and the Last Duality of Lilith and Eve forms. At this threshold, the last survivors must make a choice: transcend the known boundaries of existence, or face eternal oblivion.

As Karsavak teaches Autumn to control breath, space, and time itself, the lessons extend beyond the novel’s universe, inviting readers to reflect on their own lives. Grounded in ancient religious practices and modern scientific inquiry, *Karsavak's Desk: The Time Traveler’s Riddle* offers a cosmic vision of humanity’s potential to ascend beyond the physical, unlock infinite wisdom, and embrace the uncharted mysteries of the Omniverse."

I recently saw news about a new version of ChatGPT being released, which is apparently very advanced.

Fortunately, I'm in college and I'm really happy (I almost had to work as a bricklayer) but I'm already starting to get scared about the future.

Things we learn in class (like calculating interest rates) can be done by artificial intelligence.

I hope there are laws because many people will be out of work and that will be a future catastrophe.

Does anyone else here fear the same?"

Lionsgate, the film company behind *The Hunger Games*, *John Wick*, and *Saw*, teamed up with AI video generation company Runway to create a custom AI model trained on Lionsgate’s film catalogue.

* The partnership will develop an AI model specifically trained on Lionsgate’s proprietary content library, designed to generate cinematic video that filmmakers can further manipulate using Runway’s tools.
* Lionsgate sees AI as a tool to augment and enhance its current operations, streamlining both pre-production and post-production processes.
* Runway is considering ways to offer similar custom-trained models as templates for individual creators, expanding access to AI-powered filmmaking tools beyond major studios.

As many writers, actors, and filmmakers strike against ChatGPT, Lionsgate is diving head-first into the world of generative AI through its partnership with Runway. This is one of the first major collabs between an AI startup and a major Hollywood company — and its success or failure could set precedent for years to come.

YouTube just announced a range of new AI features designed to assist creators, including text-to-video generation, AI-powered inspiration tools, and automated dubbing capabilities.

* Veo, Google’s new AI video generation tool, will allow creators to generate six-second video clips for YouTube Shorts using text prompts, with the resulting content watermarked and labelled as AI-generated.
* YouTube’s new AI-powered “Inspiration” features will help creators brainstorm video ideas and even suggest responses to comments.
* The platform is also expanding its AI dubbing capabilities with expressive speech to make translations sound more natural, mimicking the original audio’s pitch and intonation.
* These new features aim to enhance human creativity rather than replace it, according to YouTube CEO Neal Mohan, who revealed that 92% of YouTube creators already use AI tools (in some capacity).

This is another win for global AI acceptance with YouTube leaning into AI generation on its platform, rather than fighting back against it. The platform is also showing how sensible AI watermarks can offset potential downsides for both creators and viewers.

Google Research recently developed a new AI model capable of identifying vocalizations from eight distinct whale species, including the mysterious “Biotwang” sound recently attributed to Bryde’s whales.

* The model classifies 12 different whale vocalizations across a broad acoustic range (10 Hz to 120+ kHz), covering multiple calls for some species.
* The AI tool is designed to aid conservation efforts by improving the ability to track whale populations and movements through passive acoustic monitoring.
* The model includes newly identified sounds like the Bryde’s whale “Biotwang”, which was a decades-old mystery until recently solved by NOAA researchers.
* Google has made the model available for download via [Kaggle Models](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.dSnm3kaGd0BkNqLYPjeMf46Qjyh0ncDkR5GbDNfYSm3HUMo8P05duCfnv2ljQLK1cYt2-5de4degO6fpjqai5S4a2qnAUFIxclML-HbZFoipRSfIIsg4q31wj1Q3InTw3c2GqTRz13Ia9mBv9sfXNNOGVibp12eqfysWBhkau4jhAHRHisWzVb6X6M6Hx8YwUkwgSB5oXURk5BrJ-MRBEdlYl8BsujGAdbVRQ5w8U9zM1CcqHQFV8MGRGTlxQmQT6jyiRGBc_fgaRcUVWIOlJg/49w/lE_tamkvRZGKKEizeuT0mA/h21/h001.JU_HL7UOFeqAfDwNyjEw5Xsy2EGZOxAkB2ZKc5tRf6U), allowing researchers and conservationists to use the technology in their studies.

The benefits of AI in chatbots and medical research are obvious by now, but AI is impacting the entire globe — even deep down in the depths of the ocean. This AI model, in particular, is helping us better understand diverse whale species, which could lead to more effective protection strategies for endangered marine life.

I decided to post my Spanish growing updates up to ""level 9"", which doesn't exist in the DS roadmap as of today, 2024/09/19 (but apparently there's a consensus [https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1f8v4r7/comment/llozjkn/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1f8v4r7/comment/llozjkn/) that it would be at 3500 hours, and level 8 at 2300 hours), using my old notes and memories since I'm not growing Spanish from the beginning anymore. I didn't post any updates while I went through the levels because I was already at level 7 when I found the DS subreddit, but since I documented the whole process from the start I can make something similar, and since I haven't reached level 9 yet, that will be a ""live one"".

I followed my suggested update post model ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1b82osu/a\_suggestion\_for\_people\_writing\_updates\_or\_making/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1b82osu/a_suggestion_for_people_writing_updates_or_making/) ). I also used this ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/149aut0/why\_and\_how\_to\_write\_a\_ds\_update\_post/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/149aut0/why_and_how_to_write_a_ds_update_post/) ) to see what else I could add.

You don't have to copy that model and be as detailed, unless you want to, but I do strongly recommend, in your update, that you at least put the date of your update, your level of comprehension of the news and some random video, and your language background at least in your native and target language, among other reasons it will help you notice your progress ( [https://www.dreamingspanish.com/faq#how-can-i-measure-my-progress-in-the-language](https://www.dreamingspanish.com/faq#how-can-i-measure-my-progress-in-the-language) ).

The following given information generally tries do be accurate up to the date I got to this update's level in Spanish (I didn't have 8 hours of Italian listening by then for example)

   * When I watch dubbed programmes with real people like Brooklyn 99, I get the feeling that the audio I'm hearing doesn't match the faces I'm seeing, there isn't the same strong intuitive understanding as when I see natives speaking. It's similar to the sensation of eating a pastry, but the filling is just air, empty, you bite into it and you're disappointed. I can feel that something is missing
   * **At 792.32 hours:**
   * Between 42 and 44 seconds Laura speaks 14 words in 2 seconds (i.e. 420 WPM), but it was very easy to understand her for me. It's the fastest extract I've ever heard in terms of WPM alone [https://youtu.be/ztPCbiVCjQY&t=40s](https://youtu.be/ztPCbiVCjQY&t=40s)

   * The guy (""CJ"") who speaks at 9:04 in this episode (>!""El Gran Apagón: Tras el apagón - E08 - El del código morse al final"", [https://omny.fm/shows/el-gran-apag-n/tras-el-apag-n-e08-el-del-c-digo-morse-al-final](https://omny.fm/shows/el-gran-apag-n/tras-el-apag-n-e08-el-del-c-digo-morse-al-final) !<), is difficult for me to understand even now. I need to repeat it and pay close attention to understand anything
   * **At 820.88 hours:**
   * At 9 min and 3 seconds of the movie >!""El club de los incomprendidos""<!, I could only understand something like: >!""quiera hablararte que alguien le plantara a cara de su nome al de Beatriz""!<
   * **At 845.95 hours:**
   * At 38:30 (right-hand counter) of ep. 1 of Cable Girls, when Carolina speaks I only understood about 30-40% of the words, but I understood the general meaning after repeating the same passage 5 times
   * **At 873.81 hours:**
   * I've noticed that listening to >!Es Radio Valladolid!< radio as if it were a person talking next to me is quite easy now, and so is understanding it

   * I can feel that I'm almost there after trying to watch the difficult sections of >!Elite!< and Cable Girls that I saw before
   * **At 912.57 hours:**
   * I think this video is at least an 84 in the DS video difficulty ranking difficulty: [https://youtu.be/LzDIOtS7ZUc](https://youtu.be/LzDIOtS7ZUc)

I think I understood about \~75% of it, I thought it was very fast. In many parts I heard something, but I couldn't understand it automatically because of the speed
   * **At 943.70 hours:**
   * Anime is a great cheat for language learning, it's very easy not to think or pay attention to the language while watching it. I'm watching ReLIFE, which seems to be \~80%+ understandable to me. For me, it's compelling input, basically perfect
   * **At 982.26 hours:**
   * I understood 65% of this video that ends at 1:04 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jDvAXG6xBs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jDvAXG6xBs)

   * **At 1060.48 hours:**
   * I found the cheat code for languages: search for ""audiofiction"" in podcast apps
   * **At 1078.35 hours:**
   * Better than audiobooks: radiotheatre/radio-drama/radionovela/radio drama (which is the sound fiction from >!RNE)!<. >! [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioteatro](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioteatro) !< . As Stephen Krashen said, the best type of Optimal Input (""Compelling Input"") found by studies is listening to stories, and the best form of reading is fiction, so if I were going to learn another language from scratch or improve another one I already know I would focus on listening to and reading a lot of stories
   * **At 1086.25 hours:**
   * I realised that I can remember very well the first episode of Adventure Time that I saw in Spanish, so cartoons like that would be just as good as audio stories for me. Compelling Input is something you really want to hear [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAGdNHQRTic&t=882s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAGdNHQRTic&t=882s)
   * I noticed that today when I tried to watch Hour of Adventures, I could listen the whole time without paying any attention to the language, I heard it automatically very easily, as it would be with Portuguese really. I played this videos just now and the feeling was the same: [https://youtu.be/wfx-3Naef\_w](https://youtu.be/wfx-3Naef_w)
   * **At 1094.10 hours:**
   * I noticed that when I woke up, the easy automatic listening from last night was gone. It only came back on when I watched an episode of Adventure Time
   * When I was watching Adventure Time, I accidentally thought something short in Spanish. I think cartoons like that are the best visual input for me, because I notice that I don't pay any attention to the language itself (i.e. ""I forget it's in another language""). The same thing happened when I watched ReLIFE, so I think anime is also optimal input for me
   * **At 1100.48 hours:**
   * I read on the beyondlanguagelearning blog that the aim of ALG is to purely store ""echoes"" of the language [https://beyondlanguagelearning.com/2019/07/21/how-to-learn-to-speak-a-language-without-speaking-it/](https://beyondlanguagelearning.com/2019/07/21/how-to-learn-to-speak-a-language-without-speaking-it/) : ""We thought that the reason students who ended up bad even though they refrained from speaking was because they were THINKING about the language as they listened to it. For example, >!they would hear the word for 'rice' and think 'that sounds just like 'cow'. By thinking this, they were recording the sound of 'cow' for the Thai word for 'rice' instead of recording a bare echo in their heads."". It's interesting because I can remember just the sounds in Spanish, without them being associated with letters
   * **At 1144.95 hours:**
   * I remembered what was going to happen in this episode, even though I had seen it more than 8 years ago >! Hora de Aventuras s2ep12 Castillian Spanish !<
   * >!&#x200B;!<
* Quality of aural input (""reality factor"")
   * My input so far has been mainly Dreaming Spanish videos, cartoons, YouTube channels, dubbed shows, audiostories, ECJ and podcasts in general (I could understand his podcasts very well, like \~95% since the last level, here is the link to it: [https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/espa%C3%B1ol-con-juan/id976549237](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/espa%C3%B1ol-con-juan/id976549237) ), so I'd say anywhere between \~86-\~95% fun/interesting input.
* Written input
   * I've spent around 20 minutes reading Spanish words extensively due to the first test I did, then 20 minutes on the second, and probably a few hours from the classes I took years ago, but I doubt it surpassed 20 hours of reading, and the understanding was around \~90-\~99%. When I reached 500 hours I allowed myself to start using subtitles. I also read some transcripts to check some words I heard or didn't hear. All in all I think this added 15 minutes of reading
* Manual learning and practice (""ceiling factor"", anything related to noticing language features or paying attention to language)
   * I took note of my experience learning Spanish so far at different points:
      * **At 785.27 hours:**
      * I was getting up from my chair when I left my hand resting on the armrest and when the chair turned my hand almost got caught between the armrest and the underside of the table. When my hand touched the underside of the table I automatically thought >!""devo de tener mais cuidado""!<, and >!the final R in ""tener"" was a very strong voiced alveolar trill, like in the Navarre accent!<. The automatic mental output is increasing in complexity (before it was 1-3 words, this time it was 5), in other words, my input is ""coming out"" little by little. I was at 783 hours when this happened
      * **At 792.32 hours:**
      * I'm beginning to think that using subtitles before you have a very solid foundation might not be a good idea in the long run. The reason I say this is something that happened to me five minutes ago. I was watching this video [https://youtu.be/8I2-Vrdx\_\_A&t=19s](https://youtu.be/8I2-Vrdx__A&t=19s) and, at the 20 second mark, I heard her say something like >!calicanto!<, all together. I thought it was just one word. I could hear it, but I couldn't understand what it meant, so I listened again. The same thing happened, I heard the same ""one word"", but I didn't understand it. So I switched on the subtitles to check my understanding. It turned out that it wasn't just one word, and when I listened to it again with the subtitles, it no longer sounded like one word, but three very separate words. The fact is, before I listened to it with subtitles, just by reading the subtitles to check the words, the only word I heard still made sense because of something called >!encadenamiento!<. This leads me to wonder why I'm starting to think that subtitles (and the like, such as Language Reactor) aren't such a good idea. It seems that subtitles make it harder to hear the >!encadenamiento (also known as connected speech)!<, meaning that they can get your mind used to hearing words like the ones presented in the subtitles, changing the way you listen, which could be the reason for the unnatural speech, as she shows in this video [https://youtu.be/YUq-MtaHg50](https://youtu.be/YUq-MtaHg50) , an example of how natives speak and how Spanish learners speak
      * I was watching this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s097p5jQbv0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s097p5jQbv0) again and I had this thought: >!""Quisiera yo verlo en 4K""!<
      * I was in the kitchen when I saw a stain that I've been wanting to clean for ages, and then the thought came to me: >!""Sempre me queda lavar esto""!<
      * **At 814.40 hours:**
      * It seems to me that the different sensation of looking at the audio source is not just mine, babies turn their heads towards the audio source too [https://youtu.be/ezYPtpzFlls](https://youtu.be/ezYPtpzFlls)
      * I've came to the conclusion that when I see people talking about dubbed series, it's as if I'm listening to audio and the images are like those of a series with muted audio, i.e. it's as if I'm listening to the radio and seeing something that doesn't have much to do with what I'm hearing (in terms of facial expressions and mouth movements)
      * **At 845.95 hours:**
      * I dreamt in Spanish. This time I was in a kind of market, so I saw a man near some computers who was having trouble solving a problem because he didn't know English. I heard him talking, so I asked him what the problem was. It sounded like his ""lease had broken""? So I told a nearby employee in English that ""his rent is broken"", so we went to help him. I told him he could just speak in Spanish and I'd translate. In the end things worked out, but I thought to myself that I started talking earlier than I would have liked, but in the end as it was a natural situation, it was a good opportunity to start talking. In one of the instances of talking I said an >!R between vowels like an alveollar trill!<
      * Sometimes, like just now, I hear clear words, but I don't know their meaning at first (like in 3:34 of this video [https://youtu.be/kN5MijTlK6s&t=214s](https://youtu.be/kN5MijTlK6s&t=214s) ), so I just assume (in my notes I wrote >!""supongo""!< instead of >!""suponho""!< the meaning intuitively (i.e. without using a language) and continue with my assumed understanding
      * **At 876.25 hours:**
      * I tried typing something in Spanish without prethinking, it came out automatically but very slowly. It came out with some words in Portuguese and weird grammar
      * I was wondering what I would say to a camera to record my first spoken production, then I mentally said something with >!""cámara""!<. I heard it and thought it sounded strange, so I tried mentally saying something with >!""cámera""!<, but >!""cámara""!< sounded much more correct. I looked it up on the >!RAE!< and >!""cámara""!< seems to be the right word for camera.
      * **At 909.42 hours:**
      * 2 weeks later (the equivalent of about 140 hours of listening), I can hear the >!soft g in ""huevo""<. Pretending that I didn't know what food they were talking about >!(the egg)!< helped me a lot. It's as if, while listening, pretending that they were talking about a food I didn't know automatically opened my ears
      * When I heard a name from the clerk, I heard >!Ranieli!< instead of >!Ranieri!<
      * **At 912.57 hours:**
      * Lately, I've realised that I can simulate in my head how the people I watch a lot talk. Specifically, I can make >!Jordi Wild, Juan from ECJ, Pablo from DS, Ester from Ter and Jaime Altozano!< (and others I can't remember right now, but those are the main ones) say whatever I want, and for >!Jaime!< specifically, I realised that >!Jon from the Qué Pasa podcast!< speaks with the same accent >!(Madrid)!<, they're very similar. That's why I believe there are a few things you can do to speed up the acquisition process, such as concentrating on just 2 or 3 people and staying on the same subjects during immersion
      * When I come across difficult content, I don't try to understand what is being said or focus my attention. When the scrambled sounds happen, I know I have no choice but to look elsewhere and let my mind take over hearing, almost as if it were background noise. Forcing my attention doesn't open my ears, but relaxing and changing my focus usually does
      * **At 929.42 hours:**
      * I noticed that when the reporter said here [https://youtu.be/8Le9H99DIXQ&t=81s](https://youtu.be/8Le9H99DIXQ&t=81s) >!""entre tanto""!< it really caught my attention, due to my incorrect use of the word when writing in Spanish, so I listened to the same passage about 5 times and managed to grasp the meaning intuitively (I read the meaning in >!RAE!< too). I thought I'd search for more videos in which they say the same thing too. In this video [https://youtu.be/IkoYjo6PzlE&t=141s](https://youtu.be/IkoYjo6PzlE&t=141s) the >!""y entre tanto""!< helped me a lot to consolidate my intuitive understanding because in Portuguese it wouldn't make sense to say >!""e entretanto""!<
      * I think it will take me more than 1,000 hours to acquire the whole sound system and the grammar (just today I realised that I'm getting better at hearing names correctly, and also some words like >!""vocabulary, “huevo” and “hielo”!< which had a noticeable interference in my PTBR hearing at the beginning, I hear them correctly now). False friends can really mess you up if you're not careful, and interlanguage is very easy to create if you're not in zen mode as much as possible
      * **At 937.01 hours:**
      * I watched the first 2 minutes and 40 seconds of >!Alta Mar!< again and now I feel that I understood more than \~90% of it, enough to have the impression that I understood almost everything (there was only one moment, at 46:57 on the right-hand side, that I didn't understand 3 words, specifically >!""igual que hay""!< before switching on the subtitles because I realised that there were sounds that I didn't catch in this section). Using subtitles, I realised that I didn't fully understand the 47:14 on the right-hand side section either
      * I revisited Alta Mar today and, in the first 2 minutes and 40 seconds, it seemed that I could hear \~99% of the actors' words (when I started, I didn't watch this programme because I understood too little to feel comfortable watching it; I'd say I understood \~30%, but I probably documented the real figure), which prompted me to activate the subtitles to check my accuracy. It turned out that I didn't hear some of the words clearly at times, but I understood the general idea correctly (although not the whole idea). In some cases, I didn't hear two or three words, but I still understood the correct idea (mainly very short words said in a short period, such as prepositions). Watching the whole segment again (previously I only used the subtitles to check my understanding in some parts) with subtitles, I also realised that Netflix has the wrong subtitles (both the Spanish CC version and the normal Spanish version). At 48:41 (counter in the right-hand corner), it should have been >!""quiero que quede constancia do que lo que aqui sucedió""!<. The Argentinian I heard 100% of the words, except for the preposition >!""a""!< twice (which is ironic, because I never listen to Argentinians if I can help it). I don't remember hearing the words between 47:31 and 47:29. At 47:19, I understood that the blonde girl was suggesting something rather than announcing an intention (>!""llamar""!< instead of >!""llamaré""!<). At 47:13, I understood that >!""a ver como puede ser, que hace semanas que no quedan billetes""!< when the correct phrase would be >!""al barco no puede ser, que hace semanas que no quedan billetes""!< (another example of inaccurate subtitles). At 47:10, there's another example of inaccurate subtitles (it should be >!""si las mujeres no nos defiendemos entre nosotras quien lo va-""!<). At 46:58, I only heard >!""si que hay una forma de ayudarla""!< before the subtitles, so I didn't hear the first >!""igual""!<, but I think the subtitles are incomplete here too. I could count the words to be sure, but my initial feeling was \~98% to \~99% comprehension.
      * **At 943.70 hours:**
      * I've noticed that the presenters on the VisualPolitik channel and >!Enrique Fonseca!<, who was also on the same channel, sound very similar to the actors in >!Elite!<. I think watching them will help me understand >!Elite!< better
      * **At 951.03 hours:**
      * While watching ReLIFE, in a moment without voices, I thought in Portuguese >!""eles inventam uma pílula da juventude""!<, then my mind switched to Spanish on its own, out of nowhere, completing the sentence to something like >!""y la premer cosa que se los ocurre es este estupido experimento?""!<. It was so quick and automatic that I couldn't even remember what exactly I'd said mentally without meaning to (the Rs came out fine, I said I remembered). I don't know if what came out is grammatically correct. The important thing is that it was an involuntary production of 12 words (the last one was 6-7 words), which tells me that I'm already at the level of a child over 4 years old (maybe 5-6, I'll have to look it up later)
      * **At 958.35 hours:**
      * I decided to switch on the subtitles for the section on Las Chicas del Cable at 39:30 (counter on the right). I couldn't understand what >!Carolina!< was saying. I understood it also as: >!""se nota nerviosa carita de lo ha roto un prato""!<, >!""é que tu te sabes lo que tienes de mosquita muerta, y a lo mejor te sirves cuando sale con Don Carlos pero comigo no""!<. The correct one seems to be: >!!\[Carolina\] Al final te ha servido esa carita de no haber roto un plato.!!<, >!""\[Carolina\] La actitud de mosquita muerta. Te servirá con Sara y con don Carlos, pero conmigo no. Te voy a estar vigilando.!""<. The two lines (the second one up to >!""muerta""!< are spoken in 2 seconds each, so not only was the WPM factor high, but I'd never heard these expressions before. I could hear correctly when I read the subtitles, but without having them on I went back to how I heard it before the subtitles. I had to watch it 3 times reading the subtitles and listen to it 5 times without looking at the screen to get it right without subtitles. I think I would have needed 1400 hours to have been able to hear this segment correctly without having seen the correct answer with subtitles
      * I stopped repeating passages that I didn't understand or hear well because of this video: [https://youtu.be/S9wV1zmXXVc](https://youtu.be/S9wV1zmXXVc) . If I need to repeat something several times, slow down the video or use some mental aid like a translation, it means I'm not ready to acquire it and it's better to continue listening to something I am ready to acquire
      * **At 964.23 hours:**
      * Due to the results of the Cable Girls subtitles thing, I thought it would be a good idea to look for videos about colloquial expressions in Spain Spanish, specifically videos with the same expression as the one with >!""plato""!<
      * **At 986.20 hours:**
      * I finally understood what >!""apenas""!< means in Spanish (or rather, I heard it in this video https://youtu.be/ADqrFoYtYyM). I found it strange and guessed a meaning from the context relating it to the Portuguese >!""à penas""!<, so I ended up looking up the meaning quickly in the >!RAE!<
      * Because of this video [https://youtu.be/S\_j4JELf8DA?t=344](https://youtu.be/S_j4JELf8DA?t=344) , I decided to focus on listening to audio stories (audiobooks and audiofiction from >!RTVE audio!< for example)
      * I've noticed that I'm still acquiring new words and expressions, like this one that seems to make more sense to me now: [https://youtu.be/3eXDlSAAapQ&t=933s](https://youtu.be/3eXDlSAAapQ&t=933s)
      * **At 998.23 hours:**
      * I've noticed that the Navarre accent is the one I've noticed that has >!strong and more frequent Rs (trilled R)!<, so I'm going to focus on speakers from Navarre rather than the Basque Country: >! [https://www.rtve.es/play/audios/navarra-informativos/](https://www.rtve.es/play/audios/navarra-informativos/) !<. I can also hear the ""music"" of the accent on the radio I listen to from >!Jabiertzo!<. I've also noticed a certain similarity with how Basque speakers pronounce >!final vowels, for example in ""ya"" (like Vaya Semanita's pijo accent)!<
      * I was watching this video quietly when I heard Pablo say >!""salamente""!< at 5:41 [https://youtu.be/y7qEOhbixpQ&t=5m41s](https://youtu.be/y7qEOhbixpQ&t=5m41s)
      * **At 1004.73 hours:**
      * I could hear and understand the name of the book in this segment [https://youtu.be/vxQrPy7p8Wk?t=120](https://youtu.be/vxQrPy7p8Wk?t=120) . I had to repeat it twice though
      * Whilst watching a video, I thought of something about this video [https://youtu.be/GW2PE58NIJc?t=574](https://youtu.be/GW2PE58NIJc?t=574) that I watched earlier. It's a piece of advice: to stop worrying and trying to understand everything, it's good to think that the subconscious is picking up absolutely everything, whether you're aware of it or not, it doesn't need your conscious help. This would solve the problem of people like this who feel they need to understand everything with their conscious part: [https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/19feimc/i\_have\_adhd\_and\_i\_gotta\_say\_you\_legitimately\_have/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/19feimc/i_have_adhd_and_i_gotta_say_you_legitimately_have/)
      * **At 1011.60 hours:**
      * Sometimes I wonder how my progress would be if I had only focused on watching entertaining and/or memorable content i.e. optimal input from the beginning. In my case, stories and audio books are practically guaranteed to be optimal input according to what Krashen said was the result of his research ( [https://youtu.be/S\_j4JELf8DA?t=344](https://youtu.be/S_j4JELf8DA?t=344) ). The problem I had was finding abundant understandable content like this in Spanish from Spain (content like >!RNE!< or Podium Podcast). If I was going to learn another language from scratch, I would pretty much only use CI for learners videos, audiobooks and audiostories, anime, and occasionally funny or VERY interesting videos and films/shows
      * **At 1029.52 hours:**
      * I stopped watching videos explaining vocabulary like expressions because they're lessons about the language, which is a inconsistent with the ALG method
      * The initial sports part of this broadcast sounds really cool >! [https://www.rtve.es/play/audios/pais-vasco-informativos/informativo-pais-vasco-745-23-01-24/15928122/](https://www.rtve.es/play/audios/pais-vasco-informativos/informativo-pais-vasco-745-23-01-24/15928122/) !<
      * **At 1038.22 hours:**
      * Without meaning to, I sometimes try to speak something in Castilian by mentally imagining a situation. It's voluntary, not like when it happens by reflex, but from these occurrences I already feel that I'm fluent without ever having practised speaking Spanish, but I don't think my vocabulary would be so broad that I could speak anything well. I have to say that it sounds and feels really automatic and effortless, as if I were mentally speaking in Portuguese or even English
      * I realised that mentally my J in >!abejas!< sounded much more different than the child's in this video: [https://youtu.be/2sf-wXp3C1k?t=271](https://youtu.be/2sf-wXp3C1k?t=271) . So to solve this, I searched for >!""abejas ESPAÑA""!< to hear more of this sound.

      * [https://youtu.be/FyKRw0D8FSs&t=150s](https://youtu.be/FyKRw0D8FSs&t=150s) . Another instace ofs watching a video while paying attention to meaning in a relaxed way and the native pronounces something wrong (>!uses an L instead of an R!<), and it immediately sounds wrong to me because otherwise I wouldn't realise it as I wasn't looking for mistakes
      * **At 1050.0 hours (this one is a set of similar videos I'd continue to test my listening with when I reached 1400 hours, incidentally it's also a good order of resources difficulty, I'm not sure if I'd do this again for another language as I tried to make it as well-arounded as possible, I think I'd just stick to the a random news broadcast as a benchmark and four or five of the same additional items throughout the levels like a street interview type of video, a movie, a show, a hard YouTube channel and a comedy podcast):**

      * **At 1100.48 hours:**
      * I realised that since language and culture are very closely related, in order to learn a language perfectly you have to remain in a state of listening of ALG at all times and accept everything that comes from the culture in order to understand it too (without necessarily adopting it as your own), without judging or comparing cultures, just as you do with the language itself. For example, in my opinion, immature is an English word, so the understanding and meaning behind it are inseparable from English-speaking culture. So to say that something is immature seems to mean ""relative to my English-speaking culture, that seems immature"". This may be correct, since European cultures end up being somewhat similar, but it may not be. Knowing how important acculturation is to the accent in Krashen's work (""accent is about club membership"") and in SLA in general, I'm beginning to think that what the DS method suggests avoiding doing while listening to the input also applies to culture (for example, not comparing Spanish to English while listening, so not comparing Spanish to English culture while living the experience, just accepting it as it is). Perhaps this is why more subtle aspects, such as feeling the emotional impact of words like >!""usted""!< in Spanish, are very difficult for foreigners to grow

1fl074p,69,2024-09-19,"Every month, my college goes into lockdown. ""Starting at 8pm, please lock All Gemini's inside their rooms.""",u/Trash_Tia,Odd_directions,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1fl074p/every_month_my_college_goes_into_lockdown/,"My college takes star signs WAY too seriously.

""Is that understood?""

The college Dean was lecturing me, and I was staring down at my lap, trying to fathom how I got myself into this situation.

Guards stood behind me, acting like I was some escaped psychopath. 

Every time I moved, I noticed them snap to attention out of the corner of my eye.

I was supposed to belong here, to find myself. 

What I *had* found was a student body that was deadly serious about separating students according to the zodiac.

My gaze flicked to an astrology chart on the wall, with the school's least favorite sign scribbled out in permanent marker.

The Dean's office was an astrologer's dream. The Dean herself was my mother's age, a scowling woman who seemed more shadow than person, a projector illuminating constellations across the room, casting her face in eerie white light. I had been lazily following Orion across the walls when she finally snapped, and I jerked to attention, my eyes rolling back to her.

""Miss Oliver!""

I nodded in response, my cheeks burning. Orion skimmed across her face, and I found myself mesmerized by how beautiful the star was.

Her office was fairly cozy, a messy kind of cozy. There were books and papers piled around her, empty coffee mugs, and what looked like star maps spread across her laptop, coffee staining each corner.

""It was a mistake,"" I finally said through the lump in my throat.

It wasn't a mistake.

But it’s not like I could say that.

For some reason, along with this college's draconian rules centered around the zodiac of all things, there was one star sign in particular that had been outcast. 

I turned my attention back to the scribbled-out symbol.

*Subtle.*

Gemini.

If there was ever a zodiac that was hated, or not liked, Gemini was never that star sign. I grew up with kids in my class hating Pisces because they refused to be related to a fish. Or Cancer, because of the crab. Gemini was in the summer months, and the constellation, in my opinion, was beautiful.

But not to these guys.

Starting my freshman year, I began to realize how badly the Gemini students were being treated, with the guys getting the worst of it.

Being a late admission, I was new, along with another kid who seemed to be the joker of the class at first. He was friendly enough, introducing himself with a grin.

We were asked for our star signs as an icebreaker—or what I thought was an icebreaker—and he shrugged with a small smile.

""Uh, I think I'm a Gemini?"" He sounded unsure of himself, leaning back in his chair.

""Yeah. I was born on June 10th. I'm a Gemini.""

I expected that to be the end of it, but I noticed a sudden shift in the air, like the guy just announced he had murdered his whole family.

The girl sitting next to him inched away slowly, dragging her laptop with her, while the rest of the class seemed to collectively let out a breath before twisting to the back of the class.

It was almost a robotic movement, their heads snapping around, eyes narrowing. I hadn’t even noticed the four students in the shadows, heads bowed over their MacBooks. The professor's expression seemed to crumple, his eyes darkening significantly.

""I think…"" He spoke in a sharp breath before seemingly collecting himself.

""I think you should join your friends at the back,"" he said coldly. Until then, the professor had positioned himself as a ""cool"" teacher—a man in his early forties sporting a long trench coat over jeans and a t-shirt. Very chic. Especially with his Scottish accent. Now, it was like looking at a different person. He took slow steps back across the stage, almost stumbling.

I could almost mistake his expression for fear.

""I said,"" the professor's voice broke around the words, and something ice-cold wriggled its way down my spine. ""I think you should join your friends.""

The Gemini kid seemed baffled and a little hurt. The air was thick, every eye burning into him. I felt like they were looking at me too. The professor's eyes were wide, lips curled, like he might say something. 

But he just shook his head, seemingly gathering himself.

""I'm confused,"" the kid laughed nervously, almost jumping out of his chair when a girl behind him kicked his bag across the floor. He sent her a questioning look.

""Is… is this some kind of joke?""

""Now."" The professor wasn’t even looking at him.

""But…"" The boy tried to laugh. ""It's just a star sign, right?""

""I will not ask you again,"" the professor said stiffly. He didn't move, as if doing so would mean being closer to the boy. He folded his arms across his chest. ""If you do not move to your designated seat right now, you're out of my class.""

To my surprise, the boy got up and moved to the back, ignoring students cringing away from him. He didn't speak again, sticking to his assigned group. I noticed everyone else had been separated into their zodiac signs.

Leos were at the front, with Sagittarius and Libra surrounding them. The other star signs were harder to make out. I thought it was just that class that took the zodiac a little too seriously.

But no.

This thing had spread across campus like a virus.

Students didn't care about their grades or what careers they were going to get. 

Because the star signs at the top of the social hierarchy had the faculty wrapped around their little fingers. A Libra girl found out she was no longer compatible with a Scorpio and stopped talking to him completely, ghosting him on social media and going as far as moving halfway across the classroom from him.

The entire campus had gone fucking crazy. Including the faculty.

It was only certain star signs that were allowed extra credit and invited into exclusive clubs, while the rest of us were left in the dust—and Geminis were either treated like dirt or feared, like they were carrying a contagious disease. It was like going back to middle school.

In the sixth grade, I was proud of my star sign. I liked to think I had a secret twin, after learning about the story behind the constellation. Castor and Pollux, twin brothers transformed into Gemini.

I used to draw the twins on the backs of my hands, daydreaming up my very own.

Mina Lucas, a Pisces, called me a two-faced bitch. Because Gemini had two faces. So, I called her an ugly fish.

This was middle school, though.

It's normal for kids to build personalities around star signs.

College students, however, are grown adults.

It was fine to base a crush around a star sign or compatibility. But your whole life? Your social circle and education?

It was bad enough that my classmates were brainwashed by stars, but the professors too? It didn't make sense.

It didn't make sense that my roommate had a mental breakdown the night before because she didn't have anything blue to wear. According to her star sign, she had to wear blue to have a good day.

Geminis were either mercilessly bullied by students and professors alike or treated like they were invisible.

I had noticed over the last few days, disgust had turned to fear.

Instead of bullying Geminis, other students steered clear of them.

I saw it contorted on every face, wary of the Gemini sitting near them, and presently, I saw it on my Dean's face.

She was scared of me.

The woman may have seemed in control, but I noticed her finger anxiously tapping on her coffee mug, her gaze flashing to and from the clock on the wall. She was waiting for something, her demeanor tense, eyebrows furrowed.

Every passing minute seemed to unnerve her even more.

""A mistake,"" she repeated my words, her tone dripping with sarcasm.

""Yes."" I didn’t look her in the eye, swiping my clammy hands on my jeans.

What was I supposed to say?

I didn't want to associate myself with what I thought was a trend, a TikTok thing that would fizzle out like everything else. 

But I was staring down at a handwritten letter crumpled between my fists, from an anonymous tattletale calling out my real star sign.

The crossed O's stood out.

Who wrote like that?

I had been hiding under the facade of being a Sagittarius, since Sagittarius and Leo seemed to be the ""It"" signs. They stood on some fucking pedestal, ruling over campus like some messed-up clique.

The letter was like a slap in the face. I had half a mind to tear it into pieces. I stared down at it, my eyes stinging. This letter told me I didn't belong here. It told me that because the brainwashed hive mind on campus had decided to collectively despise the star I was born under, I was something to be feared, like an animal.

""Who *sent* this?"" I managed to get out. I squeezed the paper in my fist.

Dearest Dean,

The passive-aggressive tone made my blood boil.

I would like you to know of a traitor amongst you, a Sagittarius by the name of Oliver, who is in fact a Gemini :)

I am SO sorry for ruining your day :(

Anon.

I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. When I looked up, the Dean's glare was pinpointed directly in the middle of my forehead.

If looks could *kill.*

""I don't know what to say,"" I squeezed out.

She hummed. ""Well, you can start by explaining yourself.""

She had to be kidding, right?

No.

When I looked her dead in the eye, this woman was being serious.

""Miss Oliver, I am horrified that you would disguise yourself as a Sagittarius,"" she curled her lip. ""As one myself, I should have sensed that our energy was wrong, polluted with your presence. But I let my guard down.""

I slammed the letter down. This woman was certifiably insane.

""Who sent this?"" I asked again, harsher this time.

""That is none of your concern,"" the Dean said. ""You lied, Miss Oliver.""

""About my zodiac sign,"" I sucked in a breath. ""It's really not a big deal.""

Her eyes darkened. ""As you will discover, Miss Oliver, it is extremely important that we know where every Gemini is."" Her gaze flashed to her MacBook screen. ""Especially when certain measures have been put in place.""

""Measures?"" I straightened in my seat. ""What kind of measures?""

Her lip curled. ""You are a late arrival. It is your fault for not arriving on time.""

""You're kidding,"" I found myself speaking through a scoff. I was done. It was one thing for students to behave this way.

But grown adults?

She was enabling this bullying, inciting a fear that shouldn't exist. It was like being on the playground, some stupid kid pronouncing that Geminis smelled, and the rest of the kids following along, forming a hive mind. But this was a forty-something-year-old. The Dean couldn’t justify it. And even if she tried, she would be declared insane.

I leaned forward, testing the boundaries. I wasn’t surprised when the Dean lurched back. ""Was it a bad experience?""

She blinked. ""I don't understand.""

""A bad experience you had,"" I repeated. ""With a Gemini.""

I could sense the words suffocating my mouth, eager to slip out. 

After weeks of feeling like I was back in the sixth grade, finally confronting the root of the problem felt good. 

""Platonic, or maybe sexual,"" I inclined my head. ""Or maybe he… or she ghosted you, so you've brainwashed a campus full of impressionable young students to punish people who cannot help being born between the months of May and June.""

I felt satisfaction when her expression twisted.

""Because that is all it is! What you're all unhealthily obsessed with,"" I spoke through my teeth this time, weeks of repressed anger bubbling over. ""They're just stars,"" I said. ""They don't mean anything to anyone, except *children*.""

""Miss Oliver—""

""See?"" Tracing along the constellation mapped out on her desk, I prodded each static light. To my confusion, it was the Gemini constellation, which was ironic. 

I stabbed at the two twin stars, Castor and Pollux, and then Alhena.

I nodded to Orion, projected across the wall. ""Stars. They're just stars. Dead and dying planets, or if you're religious, your long-dead relatives. Whatever.""

I pointed at the map crinkled under her MacBook, and the Dean once again flinched, her body angling away from me. 

She leaned away like I was contagious. One of the guards started forward, no doubt to grab me, but she shook her head, maintaining that professional, if not slightly strained smile.

""There is no need,"" the Dean spoke in a sharp breath, and the guards stepped back. ""Miss Oliver is understandably upset."" She cleared her throat. ""Please vacate your current dorm and move into the old building across campus where we house Geminis without rooms."" The Dean stood before I could reply. ""I don't expect to see you in my office again.""

I grabbed my bag, getting to my feet. ""You're not throwing me out?""

Her lip twitched. ""We do not suspend Gemini students, Miss Oliver.""

""But what if I want to leave?""

""Because of the measures in place.""

Something warm wriggled its way up my throat, and I tried to speak, but the guards were already politely shoving me out of her office. 

The Dean's words didn’t leave my mind until I was halfway across campus, out of breath, and regretting every word I'd spat. 

She sent me away with a warning and an order to leave my dorm room effective immediately and move into the old building off-campus. I had seen it in passing, a large crumbling structure that used to be the old student dorm.

The door was broken, bars on the windows. There was no way I was staying there. Instead, I figured couch-crashing in a friend's dorm would be better.

Elle was a Leo and insisted she didn’t care about star signs.

Coming from a Leo, that was rich. She had the all-exclusive Leo experience.

I was moving into her room later that evening, playing cloak and dagger with the security guards on shift, when the announcement played on the intercom.

""Starting from 8 pm, please lock ALL Geminis in their rooms. It is upon us.""

Elle froze up, her eyes widening. Until that moment, she had been unusually quiet, the two of us sitting cross-legged on the floor eating Chinese food. But I thought she was just tired from classes.

Elle didn’t react to the message at first. She sent me a sleepy smile and then told me she was going to grab beer from the kitchen.

What I didn’t expect was for her to come back wielding one of her mom’s butcher knives. I stepped back, but her eyes terrified me, her entire body trembling, fingers tightening around the handle. Her expression contorted with that same feral fear I couldn’t understand. ""Elle,"" I bit back a cry. ""Hey. It's me. It's Smith.""

""Get out,"" she spoke through a sob. Her ponytail swung around when she twisted to the door. ""Please. I don’t want to hurt you,"" she waved the knife manically, and I raised my arms, my heart catapulting into my throat.

""You have fifteen minutes,"" the voice drawled, and Elle's expression hardened. ""I repeat. Please lock ALL Geminis inside their rooms immediately and find a safe place. This warning will expire at 5 am. Eight hours from now.""

A sudden bang outside set off my fight or flight, doors slamming and running footsteps. I found my eyes glued to the blade in my best friend’s hand. They were fucking serious about this. The Dean really had turned a whole campus of students against one singular star sign.

Elle’s frightened eyes found me, and I lowered my arms. ""Wait, are you going to stab me?"" I took a slow step back towards the door. ""Because I was born in May?"" 

I couldn’t resist a laugh. ""You told me you didn’t care about the zodiac! You said all of this was BS! So, why now?"" Another step, and she squeaked. ""Do you want to fit in, Elle? Are the other Leo’s making you do this?” 

She didn’t respond, and that pissed me off even more.

Elle didn’t know why she was afraid of me, because her head had been filled with crap.

I raised my arms in mock surrender. ""Why are you looking at me like that? Elle, I'm not going to hurt you! When have I ever...?"" I didn’t expect to cry, but my eyes were stinging. I could hear screaming, Geminis being attacked and locked up. I risked a step back, and her grip on the knife changed, like she was ready to use it.

""You are brainwashed,"" I said slowly. ""The Dean wants you to be scared. She's crazy, Elle. Like, delusional! She has some crazy vendetta against Geminis, and she's punishing us!""

Elle choked out a cry. ""Last month,"" she spoke through a sob. ""One of you got into my room,"" Elle shook her head rapidly, squeezing her eyes shut. ""Just leave,"" she squeaked. ""I’m sorry, Smith. I’ll explain, I promise. But you need to find someplace else, and it can't be here. It can't be tonight.”

She smiled, but her lips were strained, eyes wide. 

When I moved to try and reassure her, she jumped back, like a deer caught in headlights.

She was terrified of me.

""Lock yourself up,"" my friend said softly, and I realized I had lost her. ""But don’t hurt yourself."" Elle sniffled. ""They can climb through the windows and sense light. They follow it. So make sure to turn them off and stay down."" Her expression darkened.

""Can you promise me something?""

I found myself nodding dizzily.

Elle squeezed her eyes shut. ""Don’t look up.""

My gut twisted into tangled knots. ""What?""

Elle's words set something off inside me, but she was already dropping the knife and grabbing me gently, pushing me through the door. I was being shoved out into the hallway, my bags thrown in my face, when the alarms started blaring, red lights swarming the hallways.

I saw shadows darting in and out of rooms, others being shoved inside, while retreating figures made for the elevators.

A boy was violently dragged out by a girl and thrown on his ass. At that moment, I stopped seeing students. Kids. I was seeing wild animals crawling backward on their hands and knees, frightened eyes darting for a safe getaway.

A girl ran into me, dropping onto her knees before catapulting into a sprint.

She was caught by three guys who dragged her away, kicking and screaming.

I had no choice.

It was 7:50 when I found myself standing in front of the old building, halfway across campus, the alarms still ringing in my ears. The dorm was more of a boarding house, with maybe two or three floors. The night felt eerily still, a half moon poking from the clouds. 

There was something glued to the front of the door, a simple white sheet of paper. 

On it, scrawled in permanent marker, was: **""NO.""** in bold letters. 

The O was crossed, I noticed. Which was familiar. 

**""Five minutes,""** the intercom screeched, and in my panic, I knocked three times. 

""Hello?"" I banged again. ""Hey, can someone let me in?"" 

I swallowed thickly. ""I'm a–"" 

My star sign tangled in my throat when there was a crash behind me, and I twisted around. A group of students were dragging two others, bound and gagged, hauling them into a car trunk. 

With my stomach threatening to heave into my throat, I turned to knock again, only to find my fists meeting something warm. A shadow stood in the doorway, golden light bleeding around him. I could barely make out his face—just a mop of light reddish curls.

He tugged the paper off the door and held it out. The handwriting was unmistakable.

""No means no,"" he said, and moved to slam the door. I quickly wedged my heel in the way, blocking it.

He tried to shut the door on my foot, and in my panic, I shoved it back in his face.

The guy made a sputtering noise, but didn't try again. I made sure not to let my guard down. 

“You told the Dean about me?” I hissed. “I’m sorry, did we go back to sixth grade?”

He snorted. “You can *talk*.” 

More screams behind us. I couldn't resist trying to ease through the gap in the door, but he was quick to shove me back. 

“What?”

The shadow paused, then stepped out into the light. I glimpsed narrowed eyes and freckles. I tried to shove past him, but he stood stubbornly in the way. 

His eyes were shaded by a scuffed pair of Ray-Bans. “Ah, yes, the traitor!” he said, like he’d been waiting for this exact moment. “Who’s been hiding in sagittarius  and didn’t think we wouldn't notice.” He cocked his head. “How’s that going for ya?”

I could hear laughter behind him.

Looking closer, I noticed something metal attached to his wrist.

Was he... chained up?

“Traitor?” I managed to say.

He nodded with a grin. I had no doubt he had stood in front of a mirror and rehearsed these lines. It was either that, or he was a psychopath.

“The secret Gemini,” he said, making a huge deal out of blocking my way. “You’re actually famous around here! We turned your room into a relaxation lounge, so *unfortunately*...” he was really dragging out the “ey” sound. I was talking to The Joker. “There’s no room at the inn, dude.”

His lips formed a spiteful smile, and behind me, another crash sounded. 

Something ice-cold ran down my spine. I couldn’t bring myself to turn, to witness more brutality. The guy visibly stiffened, but he didn't show he was scared. 

The asshole had too much pride. He hiked his glasses up his nose, revealing eyes shadowed by an eerie glow spreading across his pupils. For a moment, I could see *hurt* crumpled in his expression, but in a blink of an eye, it was gone, and he was putting on a surprisingly good facade. 

His gaze followed mine. 

Another kid was being mercilessly dragged across the parking lot. When I turned back to him, his expression had darkened. He slid his glasses back into place with emphasis. I swore this guy thought he was in fucking Glee. 

“Have fun locking yourself up,” he said, saluting me with two fingers before stepping back. Another jingle, and he flinched. This time, I saw it clearly—a rusted chain wrapped around his ankle and right wrist. He noticed me staring, and his lips curled into a scowl. The kid stepped behind the door, clearly embarrassed.

“This is your two-minute warning,” the intercom blared, still loud even halfway across the grounds.

Hearing the announcement, the guy gently kicked my foot out of the way, and I almost fell on my ass.

I could hear voices as I shuffled back. I checked my phone.

7:58.

Fuck.

“Wait,” I managed to hiss out.

He stopped for a moment, letting out a sigh.

“It wasn't hard to just accept your star sign,” he grumbled. “The rest of this school are psychos, but we take care of our own.”

“It's a *star sign*!” I gritted out. “Why are you going along with this?”

His jaw clenched. “You should go,” he hesitated. “The top floor is usually safe. Head to the girls' bathroom and lock yourself up.”

“You're fucking insane.” was all I could spit back.

I think part of me was hoping he was just trying to scare me, and then drag me inside at the last moment. But no, this kid really was throwing me to the animals.

The guy shrugged. “Yeah…” He shot me a grin. “Well, goodbye!” he said, slamming the door a little too hard in my face.

“Asshole!” I yelled, kicking the door. 

*“You shouldn't have sided with the Leo’s!”* He rebutalled. 

Across campus, the warning lights were still flashing.

*“Why did you do that?”*

Another guy’s voice hissed from behind the door.

*“Because she’s a traitor.”*

*“Yeah, but she’s stuck out there,” a girl joined in. “Aren’t you being a little too harsh?”*

*“Nope. She can sit out there and rot.”*

I left them to argue and made my way back onto campus.

7:59.

Bathroom.

That was all I could think of. I started toward the main building when movement flashed in the corner of my eye. I saw them pouring out from campus, illuminated in brilliant orange from the torches in their hands.

Leos.

I recognized several faces from my class. They moved as one, a large group heading across campus toward the clearing in the woods.

They wore pajamas, normal clothes, like they were going to hang out.

But something in the air, prickling across my skin, told me different.

There were exclusive clubs on campus, but this was on a whole other level.

I ducked, mapping a way to get on campus without being caught.

If I could get to the door and make a clean break through the cafeteria, I could dive into the girls' bathroom next to the elevator.

I dropped to my knees, attempting to crawl, when I saw her.

The bright red hair was a giveaway, her bobbing ponytail frenzied as she joined the others.

Elle.

Another frantic look at my phone.

8:02.

I didn’t expect her to see me. She was looking around frantically, unlike the others whose eyes were set forward. It looked like she was searching for a way out, staggering over uneven ground.

Then her eyes found mine. Initially, Elle looked relieved, and then her gaze went to the sky, flicking back to me, her eyes widening. She hesitated, before stumbling over to me, pulling something from her jeans pocket. It was a much sharper knife, the blade glinting under the moonlight cast across the grounds.

“Tell me your name,” she said in a squeak. “I need to know it’s you.”

I had half a mind to question her before I remembered the Gemini boy chained up.

""Smith,"" I gasped out. ""I'm… I'm Smith.""

Elle hesitated. She twisted around, scanning the night, and then turned back to me. Her frenzied eyes searched mine. ""What is my most embarrassing story?""

""What?!""

In two strides, she was holding the knife to my throat, her hand trembling. The steel was cold, and I had no doubt that she wouldn't hesitate to press deeper.

""Say it, Smith. Word for word.""

Behind her, the Leos were gone, with only some stragglers left behind. I nodded slowly, trying to ignore the blade digging into my skin. This was my new normal.

""You… you had your period in your boyfriend's parents' new car,"" I whispered. ""You still have nightmares about it.""

Her expression crumpled with relief, and she dropped the knife.

""How about mine?"" I urged her.

Elle surprised me with a quiet laugh. ""You barfed tacos all over your crush on your first date,"" she choked out. ""And he never talked to you again.""

I started to speak, but Elle tugged off her jacket, wrapping it around my eyes.

At first, I fought back, but then her hands, and then her fingernails, dug into the bare flesh of my arms. Her touch was reassuring as she dragged her hands up my arms and then grasped hold of my shoulders.

""I told you not to look up,"" her voice came out in an annoyed hiss.

""I didn't,"" I bit back a cry when she dug her nails in further. ""What's happening?""

""I'll explain later.""

""How can you guys tell who is a Gemini?"" I whispered. ""I don't get it.""

Elle didn’t respond for a moment. ""Your eyes,"" she whimpered. ""It's in your eyes.""

""What do you mean by that?""

""Shush,"" Elle muttered. ""Just stay quiet, okay?""

Elle pulled me to my feet, and I staggered blindly, trying to balance myself. ""I'll take you to a bathroom,"" she breathed, shoving me forward. ""But if you tell anyone I helped you–""

""I won't."" I tripped over something, almost falling on my face. The further we went, the more I could sense something… light.

It started as a pinprick behind my eyes, before spreading, light bleeding through the material of Elle's jacket. There was one bright spot of light, and then another, and another.

Speckled illuminations like glitter illuminating the night.

Closer, they told me.

I followed them almost giddily, watching them burn through Elle's jacket. When the sound of thundering footsteps sliced through me, I turned my head, trying to sense where it was coming from.

""What's that?"" I didn’t realize I was laughing until manic giggles spurted from my lips. It was like being high, my thoughts bleeding into cotton candy.

Suddenly, all I wanted was to see the lights. They felt so far away, and yet also like I could reach them, plucking them straight out of the sky. I laughed again, my body a puppet as I reached out and tried to catch them in my palm.

""I said be quiet!"" Elle whisper-shrieked.

""I am!""

I was curious about the light. It was so bright, and I was missing out on fully taking it in. I stumbled again, this time my footsteps tangled. I didn’t hear the voice until it was in my head, a whisper telling me to pull away the blindfold.

It was choking me, suffocating my thoughts and filling me with a taste of her. I saw it, just a glimpse dancing across my peripheral vision. I had my fingers clawing into Elle's jacket, ready to rip it off, when someone else did it for me.

""Leo. What are you doing out here?""

The voice was familiar, but it was being drowned out.

By its light.

Its song.

""I'm locking her up,"" Elle said shakily.

Darkness made way for light, and I blinked rapidly. I could sense my head tipping back, and then Elle's fingers in my hair, trying to shove my head down.

Blinking rapidly, I saw the Dean of the college, and my best friend's pale face.

And then I saw the stampede suffocated in shadow, silhouettes passing me, ethereal light illuminating otherwise vacant eyes. The lights resembled stars themselves, dancing through the night.

It was the same light that was seeping into me. It felt cozy and warm, already ignited inside them.

I could tell who they were from their attempts to lock themselves up. 

I glimpsed handcuffs around wrists, makeshift ropes still clinging to arms and ankles, duct tape over mouths. When my gaze followed the horde, I caught sight of a cuffed ankle, a stray chain trailing behind him—the guy who locked me out. 

He moved slowly, like a zombie. His glasses were awkwardly placed on the top of his head, eyes drowned by that… that light.

I caught a slight wrinkle in his brow. 

When the others matched forwards, he stumbled back for a moment.

*Was he… pretending to be part of the hoard?*

He was a good actor, perfectly mimicking the others. 

His head was tipped back, arms by his sides, eyes forward, unblinking. 

His gaze flickered to me, lips mouthing four single words. 

*Do not fucking look up.*

But I couldn't *not* look*. 

The light was teasing me, seeping into me like honey.

But it wasn't moonlight. I could glimpse the crescent glowing under the clouds.

Geminis.

They were bathed in it, a swimming glow I wanted to dive into.

All of them.

Where were they going?

Unlike the Leos, their expressions were blank as they staggered along, akin to a crowd of zombies. I remember not being able to concentrate on the Geminis.

Because something had hold of me and wasn't letting go. 

I felt it reach directly into the back of my head, phantom fingers taking me into its grasp. I didn't mean to look up. I tipped my head back, drinking in the sky above me, and the night that suddenly felt alive. 

In the corner of my eye, the Gemini guy was grabbing his friends, pulling them into the trees. The Gemini horde stopped suddenly, heads tipping back, glowing eyes following suit. I blinked twice. 

Elle was already covering my eyes, and I wrenched her hands away so I could see… clearly.

I could feel it, sense it, consuming me, filling my thoughts with a lulling fog.

""Smith!""

Elle's eyes found mine, and she dropped to her knees. Like she was scared of me. 

I remember her lips had formed the words in breathy sobs. **Don't look–**

Before she could reach up, I blinked again, and this time it was a longer one.

I started toward… something…

It was there. I just had to reach as high as I could.

Then I would be able to… touch it.

Starry eyes surrounded me, but I don't remember being scared. 

Elle's cry rattled in my skull as I felt my body lurch on its own, driven by something else, a sentient thing inside me. 

I could feel my mind filling with fog. It told me to go to sleep, and I did.

When I came to, it was no longer night. Artificial white light buzzed above me.

The first thing I felt was something wet oozing down my chin.

Then… cool porcelain pressed against my cheek.

I was in a bathroom stall, my head stuck down a toilet bowl.

But it was different from waking up hungover.

I felt... filthy.

My body was aching, a striking pain rippling across the back of my head. 

When I lifted my neck slightly, a snapping sound made me jump, like my bones were popping back into place. 

My memory was gone, my thoughts a whirlwind lost to the dark. I could still see Elle's face illuminated in that startling light.

The shadowy horde around me, starry eyes burning into me.

Then there was nothing.

The familiar ice-cold graze of porcelain greeted me when I pried my eyes open.

There was something in my mouth, and I spat it out, expecting stale barf. What I wasn’t expecting was a wet piece of flesh to splash down into the bowl.

It took me several seconds to realize the toilet bowl I had my head down was not empty.

In the flickering light from the broken fixture above me, I saw the glistening red first, spattered on the lid, and when I looked down, on the floor too, staining my knees.

And then I saw all of it. The bulging, slimy red mess sticking from the bowl.

I lurched back, and something was stuck at the back of my throat. I reached into my mouth, cringing, and pulled out what looked like a mauled finger, skinned of flesh. There were only spiky pieces of bone fragments clinging to shredded muscle.

Something inhuman croaked from my lips, and I slammed my hands over my mouth, my gut twisting.

I looked up.

Red.

I looked down.

More red.

Vivid, and wet, and recent.

I was covered in dirt and grass stains, my legs bloodied and bruised, half of my hair ripped out.

The walls around me were the same shade, glistening, pooling, disgusting red, dripping and staining every surface.

The lumpy red mass sticking from the toilet bowl suddenly looked less like a mass the more I was looking at it, blinking through the blinding light.

At some point, I screamed, heaving up the rest, wet globules of fat spilling from my mouth. There was a head in the toilet bowl, stuck right under, like I had been trying to hide the evidence.

The head didn’t look like a head, half of its skull crushed. But I could still make out familiar features. Eyes still wide open, lips frozen in what looked like a scream.

The rest of her had presumably been flushed, but I could still see pieces of her clinging to the rim of the toilet.

Elle. 

Oh god, fuck, I killed my best friend. 

I'm still sitting here. I can't bring myself to move. Normal college life still goes on outside, and I can't understand how. 

I found myself back at the Gemini house a few hours ago. It was locked, but there was a small key wrapped in some paper. 

**I was FORCED to give you this, Oliver. Don't touch my stuff. You're sharing with Elena. Don't think this means any of us trust you. Welcome to the madhouse.**

I threw both the key and the note in the trash. 

I ask this as a Gemini. 

Preferably on campus, but this goes for all of you. 

Did any of you kill and eat someone last night with no memory of doing so? 

I'm starting to think the Gemini constellation is something more than a group of stars after all. 

I think it's *alive.*"

[Krater.AI](http://Krater.AI), yet another all-in-one generative AI package claiming that a subscription to their service makes every other specialized service obsolete.

This feels like yet another over-confident jack of all trades, master of none scenario for us to debunk. Could it be that the time saving capabilities Krater likes to boast merely becomes time transferred from content creation into the headache and hard work that comes with picking up all the pieces after your software fails to do its job?

I am going to put one of Krater’s services to the test and if their AI detector doesn’t cut it, you can bypass subscribing to them altogether. Krater holds 10 different apps, but in this case, 10 separate subscriptions might be a better value than this one. Let's find out for ourselves, shall we?

# What is an AI Detector?

Besides the bane of many content creator’s existence, AI Detection tools are software developed to catch the watermarks of AI writing to determine whether it’s AI-generated text or human text.

AI Detection is a tricky business because every software, even major companies like Turnitin or [Originality.ai](http://Originality.ai), acknowledges the process of analyzing a piece of text for AI’s writing style is flawed. Turnitin even reports a 4% false positive rate on the sentence level.

It’s simply the case that in too many instances, AI-generated content and human content overlap in style. It was even reported by Stanford that [AI detectors have a bias against non-English native speaking students](https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/stanford-study-finds-ai-detection-tools-to-be-biased-against-international-students/#:~:text=Turnitin's%20tool%20was%20much%20more,by%20non%2Dnative%20English%20speakers.) because their writing was similar in style. That specific style, dictated by an AI’s algorithm, is to write using simple, precise language for the reader’s utility, not for readability.

Artificial intelligence’s presence in a piece of text is measured in two main categories: [Perplexity and Burstiness](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/how-do-perplexity-and-burstiness-make-ai-text-undetectable). These refer to the simplicity/complexity of word choice, sentence structure, and sentence length. Humans write with natural randomness and complexity that few AI language models have been able to capture.

The one AI able to overcome these detectors with uncanny, human-like quality is Stealth AI. StealthGPT can humanize AI with more naturalness than any competitor to bypass AI detection from any software. Undetectable AI has just as many scammers as AI content detection, StealthGPT is the only tool proven to beat every AI detector tool with an unparalleled human touch.

To fully understand the process of [how humans write and how to make AI writing human](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/07/25/humanizing-ai-four-secrets-to-fleshing-out-your-content/), this Forbes articles goes into deeper detail.

# How to Beat Krater’s AI Detection

You beat Krater’s AI Detection the same way StealthGPT has beaten any AI detection system in the past. You use our AI humanizer to transform any ChatGPT or AI-written content into human-written content in one click or you use our Stealth Writer to generate the human-like text from scratch.

The output you will receive will be 100% original content and plagiarism-free. Just as it is, this output should be able to bypass any AI checker and have it determine the text is human writing. There are however, more strategies you can employ to boost your content’s undetectability, so you can bypass AI content detectors with a perfect score of 0% AI writing.

# What Strategies Can Ensure Content Passes Krater’s AI Plagiarism Detection with 0% Plagiarism?

Beyond simply humanizing your content, StealthGPT is the best AI writing tool for its ability to customize your text with different tones and levels of undetectability. If you set the undetectability at its highest mode by clicking the cog in the top right corner of the bypass tool, not a single plagiarism checker in the game will be able to flag you.

After that, you can continually improve and revise your output to make it more and more human with prompts that both boost readability and personalization.

Enough with the explanation, it’s time to show you how AI Detectors work or fail depending on Krater’s performance. For the initial sample test, we’re going to use Openai’s iconic Chatbot, the OG GPT, ChatGPT.

First, here is the article I had ChatGPT create:

As much as I like this AI generated essay, which chose Tank GIrl to be the most punk rock comic book of all time, something any AI model should be proud of producing, I could spot the watermarks of AI writing just as easily as Krater did below:

ChatGPT’s article scored a 97% on Krater.AI’s detector. So, much for being the OG GPT. People don’t use ChatGPT to bypass AI detectors though. They use StealthGPT.

# StealthGPT vs [Krater.AI](http://Krater.AI)

Lets now humanize ChatGPT’s essay to give you a gist of how StealthGPT gives any text a human touch. I gave Stealth AI a few prompts to boost undetectability as well:

Now, lets run this text through [Krater.AI](http://Krater.AI) and see what results it comes up with:

StealthGPT’s text scored 0.23% AI generated. In other words, for all intensive purposes it scored a perfect 0% against KraterAI.

That was pretty easy now, wasn’t it?

# Conclusion

[Krater.AI](http://Krater.AI) is like any other AI service trying to persuade buyers to subscribe to a weak AI engine. With the use of AI everywhere, companies like Krater aim to consolidate many powerful AI engines into a single package of weaker ones with little to no functionality in real-life situations.

Congrats, Krater detected ChatGPT, but just like every AI detector StealthGPT has run through, we flew under their radar and subverted all their claims and selling points.

The conclusion is clear, whether you want to bypass Krater AI detection, or Turnitin AI detection, or [Originality.AI](http://Originality.AI), or GPTZero, or Quillbot, whoever—You need StealthGPT to optimize your content to be it’s best, most undetectable self. Here’s a link to StealthGPT’s [pricing](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/pricing), with our new [staircase pricing](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/staircase-pricing) system, going Stealth has never been more affordable than now.

# FAQ

# Is Using ChatBots to Write Plagiarism?

As you can see, Krater has two modes for its detector, AI detection and plagiarism. That’s because using generative AI to write your essay for you isn’t exactly plagiarism. Chatbots usually make 100% original content, while plagiarism refers to stealing someone else’s content and not giving them the proper credit. Calling the use of AI to write your work plagiarism is like saying math eqautions solved by a calculator are plagiarized.

Academic institutions that still want to label this practice as academic misconduct have deemed the use of AI to write assignments as “AI Plagiarism”, a phenomenon I did a deep dive on in our blog about [The Ethics of AI in Academia](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/is-using-chatgpt-plagiarism-academic-dishonesty-in-dishonest-academia).

# Do AI Paraphrasing Tools Work?

Not for bypassing AI detection, they don’t. Using paraphrasing tools may rewrite AI writing to sound more better, but they often retain the same watermarks of AI writing that detectors are programmed to look for. So, no AI paraphrasers don’t work, they just make things sound better or different if you need to change up your text. If you want text that bypasses AI detection, you need undetectable AI from the best in the game, StealthGPT.

# What do People Use Stealth AI For?

StealthGPT’s AI is used across the world by English speakers, French speakers, along with every major language. It’s used by students and content creators who want to streamline their workflows all in one place whether for essays, articles, social media, emails, or SEO. Whatever field you’re working in, we can boost the quality of your work and the rate of your creation with StealthGPT.

1flnhuv,1,2024-09-20,Communication and informations ,u/ArtSerious9997,Physics,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1flnhuv/communication_and_informations/,"Hello physicists and scientists of Reddit,  
I’m reaching out to you today to share my research, as well as my conclusions and theory regarding the importance of information and communication, which, in my opinion, make a lot of sense. I hope they will make as much sense to you, and I remain open to any constructive criticism.

I primarily started from studying the second law of thermodynamics and Claude Shannon's mathematical theory of information, both of which develop the concept of entropy in slightly different ways.

**Part 1: Understanding the concept of entropy.**  
Entropy in thermodynamics represents a measure of disorder, the distribution of energy within a system, and the probability associated with each microstate of a system corresponding to a particular macrostate. To quote the Wikipedia formulation: “Given an isolated system in equilibrium, it is found with equal probabilities in each of its accessible microstates.”  
Entropy in Shannon’s theory measures the uncertainty associated with a system, which is to say it corresponds to the amount of information contained or provided by an information source.

**Part 2: Connecting Shannon’s entropy with Boltzmann’s entropy and precise definition of communication.**

Based on these definitions, I tried to understand the implications of the second law of thermodynamics and the increase in entropy in the universe on society and life.  
To do so, I attempted to relate entropy in thermodynamics to entropy in information theory, noting that in both cases, communication—that is, establishing a link and exchanging information—represents a strong common foundation.  
In thermodynamics, the diffusion of energy between two sources (for instance, one hot and the other cold) is only possible if there is communication through a connection between the molecules and atoms composing each distinct system. The diffusion of heat by conduction or convection is faster when there are numerous communication channels based on common grounds between the distinct systems.  
In information theory, the exchange of information reduces the uncertainty of each system regarding the other. The more information we have about a system, the more we are able to predict its behavior over time, and thus the more connected we are to it.  
Another interesting observation is that the decrease in entropy between two systems leads to an increase in global entropy (that is, if we consider the combination of the two systems in communication).  
Indeed, in thermodynamics, the uncertainty associated with each microstate increases with the diffusion of energy in the system.  
In information theory, two systems communicating and connected form a more complex system that is harder for an observer to predict over time.

Finally, I do not distinguish between a possibility (i.e., a possible future for a system, a point in its phase space) and communication between two systems. I think that the phase space of a system is equivalent to the field of communications for a system in thermodynamic equilibrium.

My conclusions are as follows:  
Communication corresponds to the reduction of uncertainty between two systems, meaning the decrease in entropy of one system relative to another, which causes an overall increase in entropy. When one system communicates with another, they are, to some extent, able to predict each other's behavior over time.  
The communication field of a system is equivalent to the field of possibilities—the set of possible futures of a system, that is, its phase space.

**Part 3: Linking entropy to the phenomenon of life.**

For this, I was inspired by the work of Ilya Prigogine on dissipative structures.  
According to his work, living beings reduce local entropy to maintain their organization and integrity, allowing them to survive and evolve within their environment. From the perspective of information theory, a decrease in entropy—an organization between the components of a structure—according to my previous conclusions, signifies communication between them.  
Life as we know it—whether animals, humans, or the companies we create in our society—are therefore dissipative structures that locally reduce entropy, reducing uncertainty between distinct systems. In short, life is a bridge, a channel that enables communication.  
For example, the job of a physics teacher is to transmit reliable information to their students, reducing their uncertainty to help them understand the laws governing our universe, and thus, in a way, communicate with it and the systems that follow these laws, enabling them to predict their behavior. This can be applied to all professions in our society.

**Part 4: Expression of a general theory of communication.**  
My theory is as follows: I believe that the forces of our universe are a direct consequence of the variation in the communication field of systems, that is, the field of possibilities.

* An attractive force arises if a system holds information that reduces uncertainty relative to other systems, leading to an expansion of the communication field.
* A repulsive force arises if a system holds information that increases uncertainty relative to other systems, leading to a reduction in the communication field.

Every system, whether living or non-living, has a communication field composed of the systems it can access. The increase in entropy, in my opinion, corresponds to the expansion of the communication field—the field of possibilities. I believe that life, in all its forms, whether human or corporate, leverages this principle of increasing the communication field. The force induced by the communication between systems creates an exploitable flow of information.

For example, by connecting a source of cold water and a source of hot water, we create an exploitable flow.  
Similarly, if we connect a basin of water at height z to a basin at height z-1, we create an exploitable flow to produce electricity.

My conclusion is that life is a communication system that enables the passage of information between distinct systems, allowing the expansion of the overall communication field, meaning an increase in entropy. This creates an exploitable force, which we use to capture part of the ""communication capacity"" at play, allowing us to maintain our dissipative structure and thus live.

In the case of the food chain, for example, animals and humans degrade the energy from sunlight, which arrives in an organized, focused form, until it transforms into heat that is more difficult to exploit and more dissipated in the environment.  
For companies, they are organized structures that connect supply and demand, enabling each to exchange information and expand the field of possibilities. A product becomes more attractive as it allows a significant variation in the range of possibilities. A company that offers a product that does not extend the range of possibilities will simply die and fade away because it is not properly utilizing the second law of thermodynamics.

In a relationship, whether friendly or romantic, the bond is stronger if the other person gives us important information that helps us extend our communication field, our range of possibilities. On the other hand, we are repelled by someone who might reduce our communication field. Giving life is likely an elegant way to extend the range of one's communication and perpetuate one’s genes.

**Part 5: Implications for our life and society:**  
Beyond companies and society, I believe the emotions we experience in life make sense when thought of in this way.  
The happiness we feel, for example, is deeply connected to the perception we have of expanding the range of our possibilities, and conversely for sadness. I think this mechanism developed during evolution to push us to communicate, exchange messages, transmit information, and forge bonds, because this is what allows us to capture some of the ""communication capacity"" and thus live.

I’ve especially noticed this in myself, when I have sometimes been sad or happy, and now I ask myself: What information have I received that is changing the range of my communication field, my field of possibilities?

To go even further, I believe that art itself is nothing more than a message carrying information that varies our communication field, making us dream and imagine new possibilities that we hadn’t thought of or that weren’t present in our mind at the time. This applies to music, cinema, painting, etc.  
This is particularly evident in modern companies, which exploit these phenomena. The internet and social networks have facilitated the spread of information, allowing us to transmit messages that we previously couldn’t at far greater distances, which has led to the emergence of many exploitable forces that numerous players have rushed to monetize. Just like energy spreading through a gas or entropy increasing through communication between components.  
If we look at history, the great revolutions in our society were mainly caused by the emergence of new means of communication (writing, language, printing, the wheel, the airplane, the telephone, oil, telecommunications, and today AI, which facilitates our communication with the information we seek).

**Part 6: Conclusion**  
My main conclusions are as follows:

* The forces of nature are a consequence of the variation in the communication field of the systems involved.
* Life uses this principle by enabling systems to communicate and exploiting the force that is induced. This allows entropy to increase, meaning the communication field to expand, by connecting systems.

I believe a more scientific formalization of this concept could lead to applications in many fields.

I may be bothering you a bit with these incongruous messages, but I’m not really sure who to turn to for validation of this theory, and I’m looking for people who could guide me in my search for meaning.

In other words, I think you possess the information that can reduce my uncertainty and expand the range of my possibilities.

Kind regards, and good night to all."

I (17M) wanted to ask this one girl out to Homecoming. My friends and I had the idea of publicly proposing to her in the middle of my High School lunch room with a sign and me reading out a poem. We figured that it would be funny and a rememberable experience so I didn't really care if she rejects me. Also Half of the lunch room already knew that my friends and I are the type to fool around so we could easily just say it was a joke even if she rejects me. (Anyways I really wasn't that into her too.) So then it came day that I was actually going to do it. My friends and I got a big sign and I got some cheesy love poem from ChatGPT to read outloud.

 My friend got a idea from Tiktok of putting down, ""Don't want Hawk Tuah, but lemme talk tauh at hoco."" We thought it was a funny remix of the hawk tauh meme, and that it was so stupid it was good so we decided to put it down. We also tried to ask the people at our school store for the microphone which is linked to the cafeteria speakes, but it had no battery so that idea was scraped.  Then the moment finally came I was gonna ask her. My friend group gathered in a circle behind me, the girl's friend group was ready to record since we told them about it, and we told a couple of our other friend's and their friends from the lunch room to gather in front of me. 

 I stood up on the lunch table chair and yelled ""CAN I GET EVERYBODY'S ATTENTION PLEASE."" Everybody then stood up since they knew I was gonna ask a girl out(big sign gave it away.) I then read out my love poem. When I finished I held up my Hawk Tauh sign and asked her to hoco. At this point everyone knew it was a joke because I didn't look that serious when doing it and everyone including me and the girl was dying laughing during it. The girl, while dying laughing shook her head no, but then I lied to crowd and said she said yes. At that moment everyone started going crazy and my other friend picked me up. I then posed for some pictures with the sign until the lunch bell rang. 

The next hour I had government class with the same girl I proposed too and couple other of my friends who helped me plan it out, and we were just laughing about it the entire hour. Even the teacher who also witnessed it thought it was the funniest thing he ever saw teaching. And I thought that was the end of it. But the next hour I got called down to the principals office. I knew it was about the hoco proposal but I didn't think much about it since I knew everyone thought it was funny and not serious including the girl. I arrived at the principals office and the principal said he got a tip from the lunch lady that I was holding a inappropriate sign. 

I then told him nothing about the sign was inappropriate and that I didn't mean it too be. He said your sign said ""Hawk tauh"" what does that mean? I said means to spit. He then said spitting on what exactly? I was confused, and I said, out of your mouth? He then told me to stop playing games and that it is a viral internet video of a girl saying Hawk tauh in an inappropriate context. I said I didn't mean for the sign to even hint at that, and that the word ""Hawk tauh"" is just a onomatopoeia that just means spitting. He then got mad and started accussing me of playing games with him and that ""I knew what I was doing"".

 I said there's no proof that I even meant the sign to interpreted in any way bad and I did nothing wrong. He then put me in another office for 20ish minutes alone and came in and told me to go back to class. He also told me to not come to school tomorrow while he ""investigates"" (he didn't even suspend me, he just told me to not come to school.) I went back to class and finished the school day. When I came home my dad told me that he got a voice message from the principal saying that I was holding a sexual sign that meant spitting on the male genitals to a girl and that i shouldn't come to school tomorrow. My dad was mad, and he told what the sign said. I said, ""Don't want hawk tauh, but lemme talk tauh at hoco.""

 Then he got confused and asked how that would be sexual? I said he misunderstood the sign in some weird way and now the principal is trying to suspend me. The very next day I didn't come to school(I wanted to go to school since I wasn't suspended, but my dad said play it safe.) meanwhile while I was at home I started a petition on change.org in which I explained my situation and I spread it around people from my school. It ended up getting 130 signatures so far because of how people think im being treated unfairly by the principal. 

I heard from my friends who were in the girl's classes that she was getting called down to the office nearly every hour to be questioned by the principal. The principal even went as far to call the girl's parents and to what I assume explain his over sexualized perspective of how things went down despite having no proof that I meant anything bad. (The girl even defended me in the office too.) At the end of the that school day my principal called my dad saying that I was suspended for TWO WEEKS. My dad is very confused on how I got such a strict punishment for doing literally nothing wrong. We are planning on speaking to the school board about it and the principal. We are also planning on showing our petition to them. If you have a minute to spare, I'd appreciate it if you also signed the petition too🙏🏼.  The petition is called, ""Support Utica High School Student expression,"" on change . Org with me holding the same hawk tauh sign with a brown shirt. Thanks for reading!"

1flpirt,1,2024-09-20,My school suspended me over a hawk tauh hoco sign,u/Barackobama4real,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1flpirt/my_school_suspended_me_over_a_hawk_tauh_hoco_sign/,"This story is a bit long but i promise its worth reading. I (17M) wanted to ask this one girl out to Homecoming. My friends and I had the idea of publicity proposing to her in the middle of my High School lunch room with a sign and me reading out a poem. We figured that it would be funny and a rememberable experience so I didn't really care if she rejects me. Also Half of the lunch room already knew that my friends and I are the type to fool around so we could easily just say it was a joke even if she rejects me. Anyways I really wasn't that into her too. So then it came day that I was actually going to do it. My friends and I got a big sign and I got some cheesy love poem from ChatGPT to read outloud.

 My friend got a idea from Tiktok of putting down, ""Don't want Hawk Tuah, but lemme talk tauh at hoco."" We thought it was a funny remix of the hawk tauh meme, and that it was so stupid it was good so we decided to put it down. We also got tried to ask the people at our school store for the microphone, but it had no battery so that idea was scraped.  Then the moment finally came I was gonna ask her. My friend group gathered in a circle behind me, the girl's friend group was ready to record since we told them about it, and we told a couple of our other friend's and their friends from the lunch room to gather in front of me. 

 I stood up on the lunch table chair and yelled ""CAN I GET EVERYBODY'S ATTENTION PLEASE."" Everybody then stood up since they knew I was gonna ask a girl out(big sign gave it away.) I then read out my love poem. When I finished I held up my Hawk Tauh sign and asked her to hoco. At this point everyone knew it was a joke because I didn't look that serious when doing it and everyone including me and the girl was dying laughing during it. The girl, while dying laughing  shook her head no, but then I lied to crowd and said she said yes. At that moment everyone started going crazy and my other friend picked me up. I then posed for some pictures with the sign until the lunch bell rang. 

The next hour I had government class with the same girl I proposed too and couple other of my friends who helped me plan it out, and we were just laughing about it the entire hour. Even the teacher who also witnessed it thought it was the funniest thing he ever saw teaching. And I thought that was the end of it. But the next hour I got called down to the principals office. I knew it was about the hoco proposal but I didn't think much about it since I knew everyone thought it was funny and not serious including the girl. I arrived at the principals office and the principal said he got a tip from the lunch lady that I was holding a inappropriate sign. 

I then told him nothing about the sign was inappropriate and that I didn't mean it too be. He said your sign said ""Hawk tauh"" what does that mean? I said means to spit. He then said spitting on what exactly? I was confused, and I said, out of your mouth? He then told me to stop playing games and that it is a viral internet video of a girl saying Hawk tauh in an inappropriate context. I said I didn't mean for the sign to even hint at that, and that the word ""Hawk tauh"" is just a onomatopoeia that just means spitting. He then got mad and started accussing me of playing games with him and that I knew what i was doing.

 I said there's no proof that I even meant the sign to interpreted in any way bad and I did nothing wrong. He then put me in another office for 20ish minutes alone and came in and told me to go back to class. He also told me to not come to school tomorrow while he investigates (he didn't even suspend me, he just told me to not come to school.) I went back to class and finished the school day. When I came home my dad told me that he got a voice message from the principal saying that I was holding a sexual sign that meant spitting on the male genitals to a girl and that i shouldn't come to school tomorrow. My dad was mad, and he told what the sign said. I said, ""Don't want hawk tauh, but lemme talk tauh at hoco.""

 Then he got confused and asked how that would be sexual? I said he misunderstood the sign in some weird way and now the principal is trying to suspend me. The very next day I didn't come to school(I wanted to go to school since I wasn't suspended, but my dad said play it safe.) meanwhile while I was at home I started a petition on change.org in which I explained my situation and I spread it around people from my school. It ended up getting 130 signatures so far because of how people think im being treated unfairly by the principal. 

I heard from my friends who were in the girl's classes that she was getting called down to the office nearly every hour to be questioned by the principal. The principal even went as far to call the girl's parents and to what I assume explain his over sexualized perspective of how things went down despite having no proof that I meant anything bad. (The girl even defended me in the office too.) At the end of the that school day my principal called my dad saying that I was suspended for TWO WEEKS. My dad is very confused on how I got such a strict punishment for doing literally nothing wrong. We are planning on speaking to the school board about it and the principal. We are also planning on showing our petition to them. If you have a minute to spare, I'd appreciate it if you also signed the petition too🙏🏼.

1fmd7od,1,2024-09-21,iOS Safari Touch Events and Claude coding projects?,u/OP_IS_A_BASSOON,ClaudeAI,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1fmd7od/ios_safari_touch_events_and_claude_coding_projects/,"Hi there,

I am developing interactive tools for my elementary teaching that have been bouncing around my head for a bit, but not personally having a coding background beyond HTML I have otherwise not pursued development. Claude has been a gamechanger for starting to make those come to life.

I seem to run into a similar roadblock across a few of my ideas. With a lot of the webapps I'm creating, I want there to be a drag and drop method of interaction that students are doing. On desktop they are functioning great but when testing for mobile usage it seems to fail despite how the page appears.

Layout-wise I haven't had troubles with creating a layout that responds well to mobile and desktop, but when trying to get the functionality to work on both that's where things seem to consistently fail. It seems to be an issue with how the touch events are handling versus click events, but I also notice when trying to interact on a SMARTBoard in the classroom similar touch and stylus control issues.   
  
Any advice for guiding Claude to develop better mobile/touch functionality for this as it generates code?  
  
Thanks!"
1fmfuld,1,2024-09-21,Failing Com Science Uni? ,u/Ok-Piccolo9567,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1fmfuld/failing_com_science_uni/,"Hey guys, Im studying computer science in university and honestly, I'm clueless about what's going on. I thought I was good at/interested in programming but when I attempted the lab assignment for Operating System, I was dumbfounded at what I was looking at. It was about NachOS and this particular lab was about CPU scheduling. The lecture seemed okay to me, just implementing A Round Robin Scheduling. But lo and behold, I get bombarded by so many files from system.h, thread.cc, timer.cc, timer.h, interrupts and so much more. The whole lab manual was pretty vague about what to do, like Initialise timer in system.cc and activate timer in timer.cc. So like most students, I turned to ChatGPT for help and I was willing to accept my fate if I got caught for plaigerism(for using ChatGPT). Even with its help, It took hours of guesswork to make something work, I think managed to complete 70% and the final part, I was completely stumped. NachOS being in C++ didn't help either because I hated pointers and it makes things so complicated to understand. After the whole ordeal, I realise that I'm probably not going to make it through uni and even if I did, It'll probably be with bad grades. Looking back at my experience, I wished I had made friends with my coursemates so we could study together or even approach lecturers to consult with but I'm just so scared that they might say that I should already know this by now.... I have social anxiety and a general lack of trust in others which probably makes me unpleasant to deal with in the first place. So it's just me and ChatGPT to salvage my degree. I respect the people that can get a IT job by going through free courses like MIT. And if you read to the end, I would like to thank you. 

TLDR; struggling in computer science course, no friends to study with, scared to approach lecturers, slow learner, relies on ChatGPT. Need advice."
1fmkiw2,1,2024-09-21,How has artificial intelligence evolved in 2024?,u/RobotoHub,RobotoHub,https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotoHub/comments/1fmkiw2/how_has_artificial_intelligence_evolved_in_2024/,"Artificial intelligence in 2024 feels like a revolution. It’s no longer just a tool, but something that touches almost every part of our lives. Here’s how AI has evolved this year:

- **Multimodal AI**: AI can now understand and generate not only text, but also images and speech. This makes interacting with machines more seamless and human-like. You can talk to AI assistants, show them an image, and get responses that combine all of these inputs.
  
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: LLMs have become a standard part of everyday technology. They can write articles, draft emails, and even hold human-like conversations. These models don’t just spit out random facts—they understand context, tone, and intent.
  
- **Generative AI**: AI that can create new content is everywhere. From generating art to writing scripts, it’s transforming creative fields. Diffusion models, which can create high-quality images, are now used in marketing, design, and even entertainment.
  
- **AI in Daily Life**: Smart assistants are now smarter than ever. They don’t just respond to commands; they predict what you need. For example, your AI assistant might remind you of meetings or suggest meal recipes based on your preferences and health data.
  
- **Healthcare Advancements**: AI is helping doctors diagnose diseases earlier. It can analyze medical scans, blood tests, and patient history to catch signs of illness that humans might miss. This is speeding up treatment and improving outcomes.
  
- **Education Personalization**: AI is changing how students learn. With AI-powered learning platforms, education is now personalized. Students get tailored lessons, quizzes, and feedback based on their progress and learning style.
  
- **Ethics and Regulations**: As AI becomes more powerful, its ethical use has become a major concern. Governments and organizations are focusing on creating transparent, fair, and accountable AI systems. Regulations are being put in place to ensure AI is used responsibly and doesn’t lead to bias or harm.

The future of AI is bright, but it also comes with challenges. As AI evolves, it will continue to reshape industries, daily life, and even how we think about creativity and intelligence."

1fmtaej,76,2024-09-22,"There's one thing most people against AI and for AI can probably agree on, we really need action taken against these ""AI detectors"", because their practices are scummy and borderline illegal.",u/Lily_Meow_,aiwars,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/1fmtaej/theres_one_thing_most_people_against_ai_and_for/,"# Take for example [https://gptzero.me/](https://gptzero.me/)

The moment you enter their website, it tells you: ""GPTZero Partners with American Federation of Teachers"", to make it seem like it's a worthy and trusted tool and nowhere does it list how reliable it is. Even [chat.openai.com](http://chat.openai.com) , right below your text bar has a disclaimer it might make mistakes...

------------------

And now, if you happen to enter text that gets detected as AI, boom;  
  
""We are **highly confident** this text was AI generated"" - wow, so I can trust this result!  
""**100%** Probability AI generated"" - Whelp, 100%? That must mean it's true then.

And there is only a tiny disclaimer at the bottom saying ""This result should not be used to directly punish students."", but nowhere does it imply the result might be wrong.

I genuinely don't even see how this is legal, in practice, that ""100% AI generated"" means more like 50%, which is a huge margin of error...

# Website 2

And now, to not make it look like I'm only mentioning one website, let's look at [https://www.zerogpt.com/](https://www.zerogpt.com/)

The moment you enter, ""ZeroGPT the most Advanced and Reliable Chat GPT, GPT4 & AI Content Detector"",

See guys?!! It's **RELIABLE**, you can count on the results being true! And also,

""Advanced and premium model, trained on all languages to provide **highly accurate** results""

""We use a multi-stage methodology designed to optimize accuracy while **minimizing false positives and negatives.**""

------------------

And now, let's enter text into the website that gets flagged as AI;

""Your Text **is** AI/GPT Generated"" - wow, so I guess it's irrefutable then? Because it just IS AI generated...

""**100%** AI GPT"" - whelp, can't argue with that, it says it's 100% AI GPT, so it must be true!

And guess what, this one doesn't even tell you that you shouldn't grade students with it, or at least nowhere obvious...

# So uh, conclusion?

How the fuck is this legal??? Both bard, gemini and other AI tools have disclaimers about how they may make mistakes, post misinformation, etc, but for AI detectors it's okay to say it's 400% AI generated and that it for sure is AI??

All of these websites deserve to be sued for defamation and many other things, there are people getting false accused of using AI out there and potentially failing classes and losing jobs because these GPT Detectors are outright lying. 

I'm willing to bet if ChatGPT said it's information was 100% accurate\* and that it is to be trusted, they would get sued to all hell, so what is this, rules for thee, but not for me??"

I don't just mean laws but they've created the society i live in

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Jesus’ mission, as recorded in the Gospels, was deeply intertwined with addressing societal issues. His teachings challenged the social, economic, and religious structures of His time, emphasizing compassion, justice, and a radical rethinking of power. His healing miracles, interactions with the marginalized, and critiques of the wealthy elite directly confronted the inequalities in Jewish and Roman society. He sought to uplift the poor, the oppressed, and those cast aside by the prevailing systems, embodying a vision of a more just and compassionate world.

Jesus' crucifixion is a testament to the cost of challenging the entrenched power structures. His death was not simply a theological moment but also a consequence of speaking truth to power. By overturning the tables of moneychangers in the temple, questioning religious authorities, and advocating for a kingdom of God that transcended worldly power, Jesus became a threat to the established order. His execution was the price of challenging societal norms—but through His death, His message of hope, compassion, and justice spread far beyond His lifetime.

The apostles felt compelled to continue Jesus' mission because they saw His teachings as transformative, not just spiritually but socially. His vision resonated with the deep suffering they witnessed in their communities. As they traveled from city to city, spreading His teachings, they sought to reduce suffering wherever they went, embodying the idea that the message of Jesus was not confined to one people or place but was universal. This mission aligns with the broader goals of most world religions and philosophical systems, which generally seek to reduce human suffering, promote moral behavior, and establish harmonious societies.

When you draw a parallel between government and religion, you argue that government, like religion, provides the framework for how individuals live their lives. Both systems shape moral values, establish rules, and influence the overall structure of society. Jesus sought to address the dysfunction in His society, just as governments should aim to reduce suffering and create a just, functional world. The apostles felt it was their responsibility to expand this mission, just as citizens today might feel called to work toward improving society.

In your view, government is your religion because it creates the rules by which you live—not only laws but the societal structures that influence your daily life. If government, like religion, is meant to create a framework for human flourishing, then the responsibility of individuals within that system is to ensure that the government operates in a way that reduces suffering and creates a just world for all, much like how the apostles took it upon themselves to spread Jesus' teachings for the benefit of all cities. This comparison reflects a deeply philosophical understanding of how institutions—whether religious or governmental—ought to function for the betterment of society.

1fmv7d4,2,2024-09-22,Grad School Review - Rotman MMA,u/stevessuck,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1fmv7d4/grad_school_review_rotman_mma/,"Tl;dr save your money, time, energy and go elsewhere 

If you have ANY work experience, or if you were competent in your undergrad, this program and its group assignments will drive you crazy. You’re paired with other people in your program based on your background, and basically stuck with them for a whole year for every single group project. They pair people based on work experience and undergrad degree. So if you have work experience, you’ll probably have to teach 4-5 people how to actually be professional and work as a team. If you get paired with people who don’t care or don’t try(there are quite a few), good luck keeping your sanity. Supposedly this is to teach students how to work in teams, like “in the real world”. Except there are no repercussions for a team member not doing any work. The courses are designed in a way that you pass as a group. So it’s guaranteed that some people will not do meaningful work, period, because other people in their group actually care and want to graduate, so they end up doing all the work themselves. 

For a program that supposedly requires candidates to demonstrate “effective oral and written communication skills”, there is so much incompetence when it comes to both. Many students cannot do a single presentation in front of the class without looking at the scripts on their phones. They can barely form coherent sentences when asked to answer a question on the spot. Team reports are so often atrociously written, many written in the students’ own languages and then translated into English, with a ton of grammatical errors. Some reports are so clearly written by ChatGPT, covering up the lack of substance using flowery language. It makes me wonder how some of the admitted students passed the interviews. Maybe Rotman simply admitted them so the school can charge the exorbitant international student fees.

There’s a general lack of critical thinking among many students. When it comes to idea initiation, whether it be a group project or just an in class discussions, people seem clueless. The admission process puts so much emphasis on good grades and a strong stats/math background, whilst ignoring key skills required to succeed in the program such as good communications, taking initiatives, and being responsible.

Of course that’s not to say that there are no competent people in the program, but they are rare and scattered among different groups, likely not achieving their full potential because they’re too busy fixing what should’ve been expected as the bare minimum from other students.

Now onto the good parts about the program. Courses are challenging and engaging. Professors and staff are nice and welcoming. You do get access to the wider Rotman network and therefore good industry connections. Lots of MBA focused jobs are also open to MMA students if you’re interested. But in my honest opinion the good is far far away from outweighing the bad."
1fmvkjd,1,2024-09-22,About using AI as an educational assistant tool for students with blindness or low vision,u/Wooden_Suit5580,Blind,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/1fmvkjd/about_using_ai_as_an_educational_assistant_tool/,"Greetings everyone,
I am totally blind since 2015, I work in education with teachers of the visually impaired a.k.a. TV eyes. 
With AI being a prevalent tool used by many in the world today I am on a crusade to adduct roommate teachers about the benefits of using generative AI in the classroom for blind and low vision students.

I have attempted to point out the usefulness of tools such as ChatGPT for students with blindness or low vision.
The capabilities of AI today is beneficial to me and other blind and low vision people to help them get daily tasks done. I can use AI to generate a tutorial specifically tailored to me for my use of screen readers if I’m going to be learning a new application or Piece of hardware.

Iview AI as an extension of assistive technology. A student can take a picture of a problem with their tablet or phone camera and have an app like ChatGPT explain how to go through all of the steps to solve the problem. The issue I feel is that teachers think that students will just automatically cheat and not do the work. I do not think this is the case. I think people need to be educated on how to use these tools properly and ethically in order to achieve the results that they are looking for.  
AI could be used for many things for blind and low vision student students: OCR for documents that they may need help with also getting a description or definition of what is being asked for in the document.
Creative gaming for people with blindness or low vision. AI is very good at creating text based adventure, games or role-playing games.
Creating useful instruction for blind and low vision students on how to understand or perceive difficult concepts.

And one that has helped me a lot in the last few weeks is being able to have AI translate things into different languages not just for me, but for students, teachers, and parents! It has helped bridge the language barrier that exists in many communities.
Please let me know your thoughts on AI and education for blonde and low vision students. Also let me know if you use AI and how you use it ,
Thank you hope everybody’s having a great weekend :-)"

I've found them to be quite engaging and though I feel I've been outpaced by the content at this point - having not done any actual work to internalize C syntax and the use of the command line - I'm fairly confident I could handle it as it's apparently been taught brilliantly. I even found myself answering several of the questions correctly alongside the students in the videos.

I'm a full time factory employee and first time dad, making my way through life knowing I could do more. I don't know which flavor of cs50 and subsequent courses, if any, I should choose to go through. ""Coding"" and ""programming"" seem to be an order of magnitude apart in terms of the requisite skills and experience and I guess I just don't know what these skills and experiences equate to in terms of a career. 



<em>How far does CS50 take me -  how much farther still will I have to go with additional courses to be successful in this field?<em>

Many thanks.

I have engaging, interesting readings - even podcasts, videos, and documentaries. I don't give them more than 3 a week. They have them in advance. I have them submit weekly summaries to enhance their reading comprehension and synthesis skills. They have been using ChatGPT. I am considering going to quizzes. I tested this last semester (I did part summaries, part timed quizzes, part in-class presentations). The in-class presentations took much time. The quizzes they did horrible on and it tanked their grades. Even though it was open-note. So was this a sign they really, really were not reading or just bad at quizzes? Even when students got horrible grades they would not improve on the next quiz. I would craft questions that were nearly impossible to ctrl+f because they were \*applying\* a concept they needed to understand. Questions were a mix of multiple choice, true-false, fill in blank, brief explanations. I am seriously considering going back to them given ChatGPT usage AND to save me time, but I also worry the students will have backlash against them (and that backlash will negatively impact my course evals). Any advice?

Here are all my assignments fyi:

- First Reflection and Final Reflection (First one is a number of questions on social change, changemakers, engaging in community work and in the Final Reflection they rewrite it applying course concepts)

- Clicker questions (3 per class) in-class for participation - 1 is always a point for right/wrong, the other 2 are points regardless of correct answer. They also do a self-eval of their participation grade and I also give them my own rating. 

- Weekly summaries (this is the one causing me the most issues)

- ""Changemaker Challenge"" - 6 different applied exercises like interview, systems map, individual civic action, etc. "

I hope you'll understand my youthful perspective. Thank you.**

In junior high, I developed a crush on a girl who was a year younger than me. It was my first experience of liking someone; until then, I had viewed everyone solely as friends. I tried to connect with her through social media and sought advice from my friends. I even reached out to her friends to learn about her interests. After about two months of getting to know her, I discovered that she was interested in someone else. Accepting that was tough for me, but looking back now, I can laugh at how deeply I felt at the time. I was just a kid experiencing love for the first time, and it didn’t work out.

In response to that disappointment, I pretended to dislike her to mask my feelings. Yet, I couldn't deny that I still harbored feelings for her. I attempted to connect with other girls, but those interactions felt superficial and unfulfilling. I felt trapped in my disappointment, and by the end of junior high, I had essentially given up on pursuing relationships.

Throughout high school, I didn’t think about approaching anyone. Even when I found someone I thought was kind, I convinced myself I wasn’t worthy of her attention and that my efforts would be in vain. In my sophomore year, I tried to communicate with her indirectly, but when she didn’t respond, I took it as a sign that I shouldn’t pursue anyone.

Now, I’m studying abroad, far from my home country. At a gathering at an embassy for university students, I met a girl who reminded me of my junior high crush. I checked her nametag repeatedly to reassure myself that they weren’t the same person. During an icebreaker game, I had a brief conversation with her, and I felt a familiar spark—much like what I experienced back in junior high. Throughout the event, I found myself thinking about her a lot. I made an effort to get to know her, but I hesitated to approach her directly.

I shared this experience with two friends who were aware of my past crush. They assured me that the two girls were not alike. Despite their reassurances, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the girl I had just met was somehow similar to my first crush.

https://preview.redd.it/4kd7pcofchqd1.png?width=1767&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab5bf4dc71a1204725b8c073626427c0d8bfe54c

Building a Smart University Course Finder: My Journey with RAG Technology, All AI, All Local, Verba, Ollama, Llama3

Have you ever wished for a smart assistant that could help you find the perfect university courses? Well, that’s exactly what I set out to create! In this article, I’ll walk you through how I built a ‘Course Finder’ using something called RAG. Don’t worry if you’re not aware — we’ll go over every detail and Build.

https://preview.redd.it/27lfctjhchqd1.png?width=684&format=png&auto=webp&s=b80c146b9970b914f43038e1104e729209e7cf18

# What is RAG?

RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation. It’s a fancy way of saying “smart search and answer.” Imagine you have a huge library of books. RAG is like having a super-smart librarian who not only finds the right books for you but also reads them and gives you a summary in everyday language.

https://preview.redd.it/ut5a2sijchqd1.png?width=1172&format=png&auto=webp&s=21237954ffb1241f0e8072fda0cf7c19372fd29e

# Why Use RAG?

You might be thinking, “Why not just use ChatGPT or another AI chat system?” While these are great for many things, they have some problems:

1. They sometimes make up false information if they don’t know the answer.
2. Their information can be outdated.
3. You don’t know where their answers come from.
4. They don’t know your custom dataset
5. It’s not private

RAG solves these problems by only using the information you give it. It’s like having a personal assistant who only knows about the things you’ve told them about.

# What is this article about?

This article is about how I made a special tool called a University Course Finder. It’s like a smart assistant that helps students find the right university courses. I built it using something called RAG, which stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation. It’s a clever way to search for information and give answers in normal, everyday language.

In this article, I explain how I set up the Course Finder step by step. I talk about the tools I used, like Verba and Weaviate, and why I chose them. I also share why this kind of tool is better than just using a regular AI chat system for finding course information.

# Why Read It?

If you’re interested in how AI can help with everyday tasks, this article is for you. It shows how we can use new technology to solve real problems, like helping students choose the right courses. You don’t need to be a tech expert to understand it — I explain everything in simple terms.

Reading this might inspire you to think about other ways AI could help in education or other areas. It’s also a good introduction to RAG technology, which is becoming more important in how we use AI to find and understand information.

I've been teaching for about two years now, mostly to levels up to B1. This year, a former class of adults, with whom I already covered most of the basics of grammar, has showed up again. We've already covered topics such as modal verbs, the present perfect, conditionals, several phrasal verbs, and more. I can see they are somewhat able to express their opinions on topics, although with some difficulty. At the same time, I feel like rehashing the same topics at this point would be a disservice to them.

Since the new term is starting, I have been thinking of saying to them directly: ""Look, as my goal is to help you become more independent, and given that we live in 2024, you should really know that you can use this tool to generate sentences that you can incorporate into your study routine.""

Most of these students do not aim for certificates and are here simply to ""improve."" However, I wonder how much more I can do for them, given that they are at a level where, with a bit of effort, they could manage their own studies. As I see it now, my role with them would be to: (1) correct their mistakes during activities; and (2) find topics and original material (videos, articles exc.) that can prompt engaging conversations and encourage them to speak. To be honest, I see myself as little more than a conversation partner or master of cerimonies now. Ultimately, I fear that I feel like my role isn't really that relevant at this stage anymore and I don't know what to do about it.

I'm aware that this question possibly stems from these somewhat self-defeating beliefs, and I know that this would make for a completely different discussion. Regardless of what angle you'll want to take, I'd appreciate any feedback from colleagues.

# Entry Level (SDE 1)

# When to Apply

The best way to secure an entry-level position is through an internship at the company, which can lead to a full-time offer based on your project delivery. Internship interviews tend to be the easiest because there are usually lower expectations regarding experience. That said, prior experience from projects or programmes like Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a plus. I recommend applying for off-campus internships instead of on-campus drives, as the competition is often lower. Also, keep an eye out for college competitions organized by companies; (who the fuck uses semicolon when not coding) they can land you an internship. Once you’re an intern, give your project your all, A full time offer will change your career trajectory and life.

The ideal time to apply for a full-time position is right after graduation. If you take a job before securing a full-time offer, the new employer will look for data points about your previous experience, which may not always be favorable. Just like inorganic chemistry, there are always exceptions — Microsoft has multiple tiers between SDE levels, for instance.

However, be cautious: if a recruiter tries to downlevel you, weigh your options carefully. It’s like being offered a better salary but having to work under someone with less experience than you.

# How to Prepare

For SDE 1 roles, not much is expected in terms of industry experience. Your evaluation will primarily focus on your computer science fundamentals and data structures and algorithms (DSA). Here’s how to prepare:

* **Read ""Cracking the Coding Interview"" by Gayle McDowell** and complete all the exercises. This book will make most of the advice here redundant.
* **Solve a variety of LeetCode problems** (aim for 100+). Start with a mixed question bank rather than just easy ones. GeeksforGeeks and and [www.youtube.com/mycodeschool](http://www.youtube.com/mycodeschool) are amazing.
* **Work on a personal project** using standard build systems, learn Git, and get comfortable with Java (it’s used everywhere!). If time permits, consider contributing to notable open-source projects.

# Mid Level (SDE 2)

# When to Apply

Apply for mid-level positions right after receiving a promotion or accumulating 2-3 years of solid work experience with significant design responsibilities. Just remember: they will try to downlevel you, try not to get downlevelled

# How to Prepare

In addition to the skills required for SDE 1, you’ll need to focus on design rounds for SDE 2 interviews. Design skills are often honed on the job, so ensure you have experience designing systems end-to-end. To prepare:

* **Read ""Grokking the System Design Interview""** and check out Alex Xu’s books and newsletter for daily insights.
* **Practice designing everyday systems.** Brain storm on designing day to day systems. Hotstar streamed world cup, lets try to design a system that can serve crores of customers. BMS messed up queueing for coldplay concert? How can you implement a better queuing service
* **Watch YouTube videos** featuring mock design interviews to familiarize yourself with common scenarios.

Your work experience will also be crucial here, so review all aspects of your previous projects in detail. Familiarize yourself with your company's leadership principles and gather relevant data points to discuss during interviews.

# General Advice

* Communication skills are very very important, no one knows what you are thinking (except for the tantric baba at your nearest chaurahya), practice communication in english, Join Toastmasters if you can. You will need to communicate clearly with your interviewer and if you are lucky, with your team mates.
* When implementing solution, make sure there is no ambiguity. Always ask about the edge cases and specifications.
* Remember, your interviewer wants to judge your problem solving skills, not your GK.
* Do not lie to your interviewer or try to copy code off somewhere. You will get caught and humiliated via follow up questions
* Scout the career websites, as soon as there is an opening apply for it. Recruiter and Hiring managers mostly call folks who are the first few to apply
* Get that referall, Do you know that sautele mama ke tauji ke sasur ki affair partner ka ladka who is in FAANG? Reach out them and ask them for a referall. Infact reachout to anyone you know for a referal (Not me, anonymity). They will get a hefty bonus when you are hired and you will get a FAANG job. If they are willing to go an extra step for you then ask them to ping the recruiter and the hiring manager after they have applied for you. Do not apply directly, let them refer you and then apply, else they will not get the referall bonus.
* Do not fall for influencers, I have interviewed a lot of bhaiyas and didis who peddle courses and plans. Trust me, they do not know the most basic shit. All the best resources are available for free.
* Do not do masters just to work in a foreign country. Moving within FAANG is easy. Once you are tenured, you can easily move to a different country at a senior position. Ramu and Shamu (Screw Alice and Bob, keep it swadeshi) were in the same batch. Ramu joined FAANG as SDE 1, Shamu gave GRE and went to USA. Ramu worked is ass for 2 years, became a SDE 2 , reached out to a manager in USA and shifted there. He was able to have decent savings and work experience. Shamu studied his ass off for 2 years, gave interviews and joined Amazon as a SDE 1. He has student loans and will be a SDE 2 after 2 years of work. I have seen this happen a lot. I am not saying that masters is not worth it, but if the only reason you are doing it is to get a job outside India, then there are better ways.
* Know your worth: Research the package which is offered to the level you are interviewing for. Check Blind, G4G, leetcode forums and reddit
* All the companies have DEI programmes, if you are eligible for one then use that opportunity. If you won't then someone else will. Also don't tell anyone that you got in through that programme, they don't need to know.

PS: If you score a good paying job using this post then revisit it and drop a comment, it will make my day. (don't worry mera Alt account hai toh cannot brag on LinkedIn else my whole network will know that I am a r\*\*ditor)"
1fnnpav,1,2024-09-23,Will Chatgpt Replace or Enhance Teachers' Capabilities?,u/hellopriyasharma,u_hellopriyasharma,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_hellopriyasharma/comments/1fnnpav/will_chatgpt_replace_or_enhance_teachers/,"The rapid development and integration of AI tools like ChatGPT into educational settings have sparked a significant debate: Will [ChatGPT replace teachers](https://blogs.helloparent.com/2024/06/03/will-chatgpt-replace-teachers-or-enhance-their-capabilities/), or will it enhance their capabilities? This question is essential as we navigate the evolving landscape of education technology.

https://preview.redd.it/uybod48cykqd1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4fb4d9a0ca87e393f97a04b51cf69cc1c697b01f

**Enhancing Educational Capabilities**

Many educators and experts believe that ChatGPT can significantly enhance the capabilities of teachers rather than replace them. ChatGPT offers personalized instruction, answering students' questions, clarifying concepts, and providing additional explanations in real-time. This can complement classroom discussions and support students outside regular class hours by acting as a virtual tutor​ (MIT Technology Review)​​ (Upskilling teams across APAC)​.

Moreover, ChatGPT can help streamline administrative tasks such as grading and feedback, freeing up teachers to focus more on interactive and engaging teaching methods. By automating these time-consuming tasks, teachers can dedicate more time to personalized student interactions and developing creative lesson plans​ (YourStory.com)​​ (TIE Online)​.

**Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving**

ChatGPT can also be instrumental in fostering critical thinking and problem-solving skills. For example, educators like Donahoe have used ChatGPT to generate arguments for students to analyze, helping them focus on the critical aspects of their assignments rather than getting stuck at the initial stages of writing​ (MIT Technology Review)​. This approach allows students to critique and improve AI-generated content, thereby enhancing their analytical skills and understanding of the subject matter.

**Challenges and Considerations**

However, integrating ChatGPT into education is not without challenges. Concerns about the accuracy and coherence of AI-generated responses highlight the need for teachers to critically assess and adapt the outputs to their specific teaching contexts​ (Frontiers)​. Additionally, there is a risk that students might rely too heavily on ChatGPT for completing assignments, potentially undermining the development of their independent problem-solving skills​ (World Bank Blogs)​.

To mitigate these risks, it is crucial for educators to establish clear guidelines around the use of ChatGPT. By incorporating activities that encourage students to question and evaluate the information provided by AI, teachers can help students develop a healthy skepticism and critical thinking skills​ (TIE Online)​.

**Insights from Industry Leaders**

Alakh Pandey, founder of Physics Wallah, has been vocal about the potential of AI in education. His platform recently launched ""Alakh AI,"" a suite of AI-driven tools designed to personalize learning experiences for students. Pandey emphasizes that while AI can support and enhance educational practices, it is not a replacement for the unique skills and adaptability that teachers bring to the classroom. He sees AI as a powerful tool that can democratize education by making high-quality learning resources accessible to a broader audience​ (TechStory)​​ (YourStory.com)​.

Vineet Govil, Chief Technology and Product Officer at Physics Wallah, highlights the role of AI in providing personalized tutoring and addressing students' queries in real-time. The goal is to use AI to support teachers in their instructional roles, allowing them to focus more on the human aspects of teaching, such as fostering critical thinking and creativity​ (DIGITAL TERMINAL)​​ (Express Computer)​.

**The Future of AI in Education**

Looking forward, the role of teachers will likely evolve to become more of a facilitator of learning rather than a mere provider of information. As AI tools like ChatGPT become more prevalent, educators will need to focus on teaching students how to effectively use these tools, understand their limitations, and critically analyze their outputs. This shift could ultimately lead to a more dynamic and engaging learning environment, where technology and human expertise work hand in hand to enhance educational outcomes​ (Upskilling teams across APAC)​​ (YourStory.com)​.

In conclusion, while ChatGPT offers powerful tools to support and enhance education, it is not poised to replace teachers. Instead, it provides an opportunity for educators to leverage AI to enrich the learning experience, promote critical thinking, and create a more personalized and efficient educational environment.

This powerful language processing tool has the potential to revolutionize productivity by automating tasks, aiding in decision-making, and offering innovative solutions.

One of the most affected sectors is customer service. ChatGPT enables businesses to provide instantaneous, round-the-clock support through chatbots, reducing wait times and freeing human agents for more complex queries. This not only improves customer experience but also streamlines operations and cuts costs.

In content creation and marketing, ChatGPT’s ability to generate written material quickly can significantly increase output without compromising on quality. Marketers can generate ad copies, articles, and social media content more efficiently, allowing them to focus on strategy and creativity.

Furthermore, the tech and developer communities greatly benefit from ChatGPT's ability to understand and produce code. This capability can accelerate the development process, debugging, and even serve as an educational tool for learning new programming languages or frameworks.

Education also stands to gain immensely, as ChatGPT can tailor learning materials to individual needs, answer student inquiries, and provide explanations for complex concepts, essentially offering a personalized tutoring experience.

Financial services are harnessing ChatGPT to interpret market data, write reports, and manage customer inquiries, thereby improving the speed and quality of service.

However, while the impact of ChatGPT is profound, it's essential to discuss how we address potential challenges such as job displacement and maintaining data privacy. Let's delve into the conversation about different sectors, their transformation with ChatGPT, and potential approaches to integrating this technology ethically and effectively. What are your thoughts or experiences with ChatGPT in your industry? How do you see it shaping the future of work and productivity?"
1fnp7be,1,2024-09-23,The reason why ChatGPT o-1 is not significantly better at translation and creative tasks.,u/AImberr,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1fnp7be/the_reason_why_chatgpt_o1_is_not_significantly/,"Pleasee correct me if you think I'm wrong.

I'm a professional translator. The performance of ChatGPT o-1 impressed me on every fronts but transaltion and creative writing. And I discovered the similar sentiment from other professionals. This is my understanding of the reason behind it:

The nature of the task is different.

Reasoning and STEM Problems has clear right or wrong (objective) answers, making it easier to define rewards and penalties in RL. It can benefit from the feedback loop. Also RL can simulate practice by repeatedly exposing the model to varied problems and allowing it to adjust based on outcomes, mimicking how students learn STEM subjects.

While translation and creative writing tasks are much more subjective. Different readers might prefer different styles. Creative writing and translation not only require grammatical correctness but also the conveyance of style, tone, and cultural nuances. And these tasks can have multiple equally valid outputs for the same input, that’s why supervised learning still predominant training(for specifically solving this kind of tasks). It usually relies on large datasets of human-generated content, where models learn to predict the most likely continuation of text based on the examples given, rather than through interactive feedback.

I don't have a ML background, this is about as far as I can touch the mechanics behind them."
1fnpr0p,1,2024-09-23,How to have clean clothes ba galing sa laundry?,u/BeginningSilver3785,adultingph,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultingph/comments/1fnpr0p/how_to_have_clean_clothes_ba_galing_sa_laundry/,"Hi. It's not as ""basic"" and ""googleable"" as I thought. So for context, I am a busy student.. I have no time and place to hand-wash my clothes anymore (malayo na ako sa mga magulang ko) so I simply send them to the laundry shop for convenience. Just drop my load, get the full package, leave and come back later/tmr.



I just feel like my clothes are not cleaned well enough. I mean they smell real nice, fresh and clean, it's just that some of my wardrobe still looks unclean.. especially my whites, don't have that same white... Not even just looking old, they're dirt stains parin. Some of my outfit still have that collar dirt in it and I find it very troublesome na talaga. Even to add extra bleach on the package do not do anything AT ALL.



I paid \[X\] amount, I expected my clothes should be clean, as per the service that I paid for in the first place. I also been to different cities in countless laundry shops for quite some time now and I feel like it's a universal thing to laundry shops-- na hindi talaga nalilinis yung mga damit mo. It wasn't just ""some"" poor performance laundry shops in my experience, in fact, most of them.



But then again I don't believe that it's the laundry shop's fault as there are a lot of students, heck, people around the world who never even have to handwash their clothes to begin with and just relying to these laundry shops all their life, clean and problem-free.

  
Then I contemplated, Baka ako yung problema dito. I never really haven't had a talk with anybody. I just naturally learn how to surrender my laundry bag to the shop! Am I missing something here? I just want clean clothes. I really need advice, for 2 weeks now I still have my white polo uniform neck stains, I really cannot with these. I also go to the gym and visible sweat stains are prominent at some tops. Nakakahiya na suotin yung iba



What I do:

-separate whites from colored (2 loads)

-get the full package for each

-whites get bleach additional

-leave and come back to claim after



Answers are very MUCH appreciated. What am I missing out? What am I doing wrong? What should I be doing instead? Tips? Anything.



(PS: ChatGPT said to pre-heat my load before sending, I have no access to doing that aswell.)

(Changing laundromats certainly don't help too, tried it and the results are basically the same.)"
1fnq8wn,1,2024-09-23,How to automatically generate class notes for your classes with ChatGPT and speech-to-text!,u/OmniTeacher,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1fnq8wn/how_to_automatically_generate_class_notes_for/,"Hello all! 

I know some students have IEPs that say they should always be given class notes, and class notes are generally just a nice thing to have, so I thought I'd share this workflow I came up with!

If you have Microsoft OneNote (through an Office subscription), if you click on the Home bar on the top menu bar, then the three dots on the right to see extra hidden options, all the way at the bottom is a Transcribe feature. And it works really well! Not perfectly, but surprisingly well, and best of all, as far as I can see, you can automatically speech-to-text an unlimited amount of audio per month? All you need to do is remember to hit Transcribe to start at the beginning and end (to stop) of each class period.

  
You can then click ""Add to Page - Text with Speakers"" to copy/paste the full transcription into a OneNote page. (I generally just make a new page for each class labeled like P1 09.23.2024, P2 09.23.2024, etc.)

  
FINALLY, copy and paste all of that into ChatGPT with the following instructions at the front! Just copy/paste this, then copy/paste the transcript text:

""The input you receive will be the outputs of a relatively, but not perfectly, accurate speech to text transcription software from a classroom environment with a teacher or teachers, and multiple student speakers.



You will do your best to account in the text you receive for the types of grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, dropped punctuation marks and quotation marks, and skipped words common in speech to text transcription outputs.  



Having done this, based on the class transcript you are provided, you will please:

1. Provide a brief summary of the main points (2-3 sentences)

2. Break down the content into 3-5 main topics

3. List 5-10 key terms or concepts

4. Generate 3 review questions



Transcript:

{transcript}



Format the output as follows:

Summary:

\[Your summary here\]



Main Topics:

1. \[Topic 1\]

2. \[Topic 2\]

...



Key Terms and Concepts:

- \[Term 1\]

- \[Term 2\]

...



Review Questions:

1. \[Question 1\]

2. \[Question 2\]

3. \[Question 3\]

""""""""

OR, if you want (and especially if you have ChatGPT pro, as the length of a full transcript of a 45 minute class generally seems to be too much for a free chatgpt account), you can try using this link I made up:

[https://chatgpt.com/g/g-YdG002zeX-transcript-summarizer-and-instant-class-notes-gpt](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-YdG002zeX-transcript-summarizer-and-instant-class-notes-gpt)

If that link or your free ChatGPT account both don't work because the transcript is too long, if you sign up for [Claude.ai](http://Claude.ai), and use the exact same prompt + copy/paste of the transcript, that SHOULD work, even with a free version!!!  


Just thought I'd share because I found this to be pretty cool and I hated typing up class notes for IEP compliance otherwise!"
1fnqm2s,1,2024-09-23,AI Tool Combinations Training,u/Difficult-Hand-4654,Business_Ideas,https://www.reddit.com/r/Business_Ideas/comments/1fnqm2s/ai_tool_combinations_training/,"I provide specialized education on AI tools tailored to professions. As I have been following almost all the latest tools for two years, I am familiar with AI tool combinations for various industries. I believe that AI doesn't need to take away anyone's job. I argue that those who can use AI tools aligned with their profession or in an alternative field can increase their performance and/or income. For example, I find the complaint of a graphic designer saying 'AI is doing what I do, so I am no longer needed or won’t be needed' to be illogical. I try to show that this graphic designer friend can multiply their salary by using these tools. 

To give some examples: 

For architects: I take your simple, 2D floor plan and use an AI tool to turn it into a 3D model. Then, I take that output and use another AI tool to work on textures or the exterior. Alternatively, I generate an output from an AI tool that can do isometric drawings, pass it through the stages I just mentioned, and deliver the design. I am not an architect; my university education is in Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation.

 For YouTubers: I generate a script via ChatGPT, source visuals from other AI tools in line with the script, and if needed, I add simple animations using another tool. I convert the script into a voice-over using yet another AI tool. I then combine the visuals, animations, and voice-over in Premiere Pro. I can deliver either short videos or longer ones like documentaries. 

For painters: I teach you how to get the best reference images from which tool. I ensure you master the correct prompt-writing techniques for color harmony, character positioning, and drawing techniques.

 For B2B companies: I use a different AI tool to scrape data from Google Maps, allowing you to reach potential customers and B2B contacts. I provide you with updated email addresses, phone numbers, contact names, and LinkedIn profiles in Excel format. 

For Etsy stores: I start by generating the first design via AI tools. For example, you might be a seller of wooden clocks. I create new wooden clock designs through AI. I then vectorize these designs in a way that you can produce them, making them suitable for laser cutting or printing. I prepare mockups using other AI tools. Or you may only sell t-shirts. The most common use of AI is for creating designs on t-shirts and sweatshirts. I get a new design from an AI tool, vectorize it, and deliver it. I can also prepare emoji sets, illustrate children’s books, or ensure character continuity. What I personally enjoy doing the most is illustrating children’s books and working on projects with character continuity.

 If you want to improve yourself or customize AI tools for your job in any area, I can conduct a quick research to find suitable AI tools and teach you how to use them. Whether you're thinking about if AI could be adapted to your sector or facing challenges in your industry, I can teach you how to combine multiple tools to create a final product or directly deliver the final product if you prefer. 

Currently, I offer face-to-face training in the city where I live. Last year, I gave a conference to an Artificial Intelligence Engineering club at a university, themed 'Earning Money with AI Tools.' Next month, I’ll return to that university to conduct a workshop on creating digital products. 

Since I use a different method for each student and/or sector in my trainings, I prepare a new curriculum each time. I’m not entirely sure if the right term is 'curriculum,' maybe 'lesson plan' could also work. After we get in touch, I prepare the appropriate combination of tools and provide detailed training on how to use each tool in that combination. 

Question one: Should I evolve this into a training center or a website selling training packages? Or should I open an Instagram account and provide trainings there, such as through Zoom meetings? Should I turn it into a start-up and seek crowdfunding to transform this into a training app? I want to make this a full-time job, but I’m unsure how to start and proceed. 

Question two: Do you have any suggestions for a profession where I could adapt AI tool combinations? I am open to any ideas and feedback. 

Maybe this is a silly project, and I can't see it because I’m too involved. I need comments from people with an external perspective. Thank you for reading. "

1fntljw,23,2024-09-23,Spoke to 21 CrewAI developers and here's what we found,u/g_pal,crewai,https://www.reddit.com/r/crewai/comments/1fntljw/spoke_to_21_crewai_developers_and_heres_what_we/,"I recently had our AI interviewer speak with 21 CrewAI developers. I have been curious about agent frameworks and I previously did a research project on LangChain a month ago. Developers shared about what attracted them to use CrewAI, experiences with other frameworks, and suggestions. Here are some key takeaways:

**What Attracts Developers to CrewAI?**

* **Ease of Use and Integration:** CrewAI simplifies the development process with minimal coding and straightforward setup.

""CrewAI is really easy to integrate because most of the things it does are kind of predetermined or already made. So we actually need to focus on flow and on prompts."" — Manager, IT Consulting Company

""I looked at one example project to get started and was blown away that it only took several lines of code to define the agents I wanted to create."" — Founder, GenAI Startup

""It's a relatively easy framework... I would say it's a pretty easy framework to learn with a minimal learning curve. It's user-friendly and easy to set up."" — AI Engineer at an EdTech Startup

* **Agent Collaboration and Backstories:** The framework enables inter-agent communication and allows developers to assign backstories to agents for more focused and context-aware responses.

""What I didn't like about LangChain is that it doesn't allow interactivity between agents, but CrewAI does. So that is why I choose CrewAI."" — AI Engineer, Startup Consulting Company

""The way CrewAI handles agents. How you write their backstories and calls. It makes the agents focus on the task you give them in a specific way."" — Same Contributor

* **Logging and Debugging Capabilities:** CrewAI provides insightful logging, helping developers understand agent interactions and troubleshoot effectively.

""I love the logging and the output to be able to see what was going on behind the scenes... it was really powerful."" — Founder, GenAI Startup

""I loved being able to see the logging and the reasoning behind the scenes of how the agents were interacting with each other."" — Same Contributor  


**CrewAI vs. Alternatives**

The most commonly considered alternative was LangChain. Developers noted several areas where CrewAI stands out:

* **Simplicity:** Compared to alternatives that may require extensive coding, CrewAI offers a more user-friendly experience.

""I believe CrewAI is much more user-friendly compared to the alternatives. Its ease of use is its main benefit..."" — Founder, Software Agency

""For functionality, I would say LangChain is quite better, but in terms of ease of use, CrewAI is far easier than LangChain."" — Computer Science Student

""So far, it's probably the best and easiest one I've used... overall, CrewAI is the one I use the most."" — Founder, Automated Content Creation Startup

* **Inter-Agent Communication**: CrewAI's ability to enable agents to communicate and collaborate is a significant advantage.

""What I didn't like about LangChain is that it doesn't allow interactivity between agents, but CrewAI does."" — AI Engineer, Startup Consulting Company

""If you ask me today which product I would use for a multi-worker-driven project, I would choose CrewAI, not LangGraph or LangChain."" — AI Engineer at Neo4j

* **Less Coding Required:** CrewAI reduces the need for extensive coding, making it accessible to developers with varying levels of expertise.

""But when I saw CrewAI, I found that it was very easy. I didn't have to create a lot of agents or add multiple tools within the agent. Also, there was less Python coding involved."" — AI Engineer at Neo4j

**Use Cases**   
  
CrewAI developers shared some interesting use cases beyond the standard fare of chatbots.  Here are some interesting use cases:

* **Educational Content Creation:** Educators are using CrewAI to generate course materials, create personalized learning roadmaps, and automate research and writing tasks.

* **Business Planning and Development:** Startups utilize CrewAI to simulate collaborative brainstorming among virtual team members to draft business plans and proposals.

* **Personal Productivity Tools:** Implementing agents to manage email summarization and automate social media content generation.

**Areas for Improvement**

While CrewAI has garnered praise, developers also identified areas for improvement:

* **Enhanced Documentation and Complex Examples:** There's a desire for more comprehensive documentation and advanced tutorials.

""The documentation was not as thorough as it could have been, so I had to dig in and experiment more."" — Founder, Automated Content Creation Startup

""I think that the most useful resource was the source code of CrewAI because there weren't many documents about the API."" — Founder, Software Agency

""I would like to see more complex examples... The community isn't very large yet... but a lot can be understood through the documentation and tutorials."" — AI Engineer at an EdTech Startup

* **Improved Error Handling and Debugging:** Developers want clearer error messages and better debugging tools to facilitate troubleshooting.

""I did find it a little bit unsettling seeing different errors... it didn't seem like they had any real rhyme or reason to them."" — Founder, GenAI Startup

""More debugging information would be helpful. Sometimes, the error messages are not very descriptive."" — Researcher, Epidemiology Lab

* **Enhanced Compatibility with Other Frameworks and Tools:** Users suggest improving compatibility with other AI frameworks and tools.

""At the moment, it's compatible with LangChain, but it needs to be compatible with LlamaIndex and maybe some classic ML frameworks."" — AI Engineer, Startup Consulting Company

""It also needs more database interactions... there should be a tool to ask questions about a CSV file or maybe an SQL or MongoDB database."" — Same Contributor

You can check out the interview transcripts here: [kgrid.ai/company/crewai](http://kgrid.ai/company/crewai). I am planning on doing a new research project on agent frameworks after OpenAI's devday. What other topics would you like covered in future interviews?

1fntqsn,2,2024-09-23,Have you tried using Chat for NLP analysis? ,u/kristerskb,learnmachinelearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1fntqsn/have_you_tried_using_chat_for_nlp_analysis/,"Hey!   
  
If you have some experience in testing ChatGPT for any types of NLP analysis I'd be really interested to interview you. 

I'm a BBA student and for my final thesis I chose to write about NLP use in customer feedback analysis. Turns out this topic is a bit out of my current skill range but I am still very eager to learn. The interview will take around 25-30 minutes, and as a thank-you, I’m offering a $10 Amazon or Starbucks gift card. 

If you have experience in this area and would be open to chatting, please comment below or DM me. Your insights would be super valuable for my research.

Thanks."

1fo1sa6,5,2024-09-23,Wish me luck! ,u/BaileyIsaGirlsName,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1fo1sa6/wish_me_luck/,"I’m an adjunct, teaching graduate students in psychology/counseling online. ChatGPT/AI have been the bane of my existence. I’m so tired of reading papers written by a robot. It’s very insulting that students, who are training to be mental health providers, assume a robot can do this job. Ultimately, they are shooting themselves in the foot. AI won’t be there for them when they take their comp exams or licensing exams. 
But to the point. We do a lot of case studies. And you can imagine that it’s pretty easy to upload a case study doc into ChatGPT and get it to spit out a general analysis/diagnosis. So I’m playing with making video recordings of a client (actor) discussing their symptoms for students to watch and write up. The options for this aren’t great, but it’s worth a try. Anything I’m missing with this idea? Can ChatGPT watch videos now? I’m open to other suggestions! "
1fo366c,1,2024-09-23,Can Paraphrasing Tools Generate Undetectable AI Content?,u/gptgabe,stealthgpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stealthgpt/comments/1fo366c/can_paraphrasing_tools_generate_undetectable_ai/,"read on the site: [https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/can-paraphrasing-tools-generate-undetectable-ai-content](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/can-paraphrasing-tools-generate-undetectable-ai-content)

Paraphrasing is a smart writing technique employed by students, writers, and content creators for different purposes. Whether it is maintaining uniqueness, readability, or clarity, rephrasing helps to improve content quality in many ways.

However, manual rephrasing is not everyone’s cup of tea. It requires the ability to present the same thing differently without sacrificing the original meaning. For those who lack the art of paraphrasing, advanced paraphrasers have been developed.

These tools utilize the power of sophisticated AI algorithms to rephrase sentences of existing content. However, since these tools are backed by artificial intelligence, it raises the question in many people’s minds whether the content they rephrase contains AI traces or not.

Since both academic institutions and search engines highly prohibit machine-generated content, writers and learners remain worried about whether their paraphrased content will pass & avoid AI content detection. If you are also confused about this matter, there is nothing to worry about.

In this article, we will thoroughly explain how AI is ai detected in writing & whether paraphrasing tools are capable of creating undetectable AI content. So, without further ado, let’s get started.



# How Paraphrasing Tools Generate Human-Like Content?

Paraphrasers can contribute in different ways to generate content that depicts human writing. Here are some of their most prominent contributions.



# Performing Significant Word Replacements

One of the main techniques paraphrasing tools use to create content that closely resembles human writing is improving word choice. Sometimes, existing text may have some words or phrases that might indicate the involvement of AI. For example, words such as elevate, leverage, delve, and seamless may be flagged as AI-written as they are mostly used by AI writing tools.

Paraphrasers offer the most relevant alternatives to such words commonly used by human writers. By introducing natural vocabulary in the text, a proficient rephrasing tool makes the content more natural and easily readable for everyone. It helps you enrich your text with simple language that reflects the essence of human writing.



# Restructuring Sentences

An advanced paraphraser doesn’t rely on just word replacements to generate human-like content. Rather, it performs significant sentence enhancements to make the text appear written by a professional writer. For this purpose, it first analyzes the context of each sentence and then finds areas for improvement.

While performing sentence changes, it mainly focuses on simplifying the complex parts to make the information easily accessible. It varies the sentence length and incorporates simple structures just as human writers do. By breaking complicated sentences, it presents the same information in two or three easily understandable lines. It may merge short sentences to convey the idea effectively where needed.



# Eliminating Redundancy

Sometimes, you inadvertently write the same words or ideas many times in the content. This creates redundancy in the text, which is mostly seen in AI content. In cases of excessive repetition, your content may be classified as machine-generated in AI detection in your content. However, if you rephrase sentences using an efficient paraphraser, this risk can be mitigated easily.

A paraphrasing tool offers a variety of options for redundant words and ideas. It can provide you with the most relevant phrases that you can use instead of repeating a word. Similarly, it can help you present the same idea uniquely in different sections of content by making notable enhancements in sentence structures.



# Adjusting Tone



Another way paraphrasers contribute to generating human-like content is by helping with the adjuting tone. It allows you to set the writing style in such a way that it aligns with the intended readers. Using it, you can make the tone of the entire content more conversational, which AI content often lacks.

Before eliminating tone inaccuracies, a diverse paraphraser performs an in-depth contextual analysis of content. After that, it aligns the words and sentence style in such a way that fits the required tone. The best thing about paraphrsers is that they don’t deviate from a particular writing style throughout the content.

# Best Paraphrasers To Create Undetectable AI Content

The question remains the same here how to avoid ai detection. Remember, not all paraphrasing tools are created equally. They have significant differences in their capabilities. Here are some of the most powerful paraphrasers that can help you create undetectable AI content.



# [**Paraphraser.io**](http://Paraphraser.io)

When it comes to creating content that sounds human-written, [Paraphraser.io](http://Paraphraser.io) could prove incredibly helpful to pass ai detection. This AI-driven paraphraser goes beyond generic enhancements. It performs a deep examination of the text and reformulates sentences in such a way that every line possesses the essence of human writing. Use this [paraphrase online](https://www.paraphraser.io/) to make significant alterations in word choice, sentence structure, and tone and make the content appear to be crafted by a seasoned writer.



# QuillBot

QuillBot is another advanced paraphrasing tool that can be your companion in content that can pass & avoid AI content detection. It exploits the potential of smart algorithms to scan the input text efficiently. Then, by using a diverse vocabulary and restructuring the sentences wisely, it makes the text appear human-like. As a result, your content doesn’t get flagged as machine-generated by any AI content detector or search engine.



# [**Rephrase.Info**](http://Rephrase.Info)

[Rephrase.Info](http://Rephrase.Info) is also a gem on the internet that lets you reshape existing content in a natural way. It could be best for content creators who need human-written content to upload on their websites so that they can avoid search engine penalties. However, it is not limited to rephrasing just web content. From academic assignments to proposals and emails, you can paraphrase any type of content using this tool.

# To Sum Up

To put it concisely, the content rephrased through a cutting-edge paraphrasing tool is undetectable by chatgpt detector & other AI content detectors. This is because these tools prioritize making the text human-friendly. Above, we have thoroughly explained the role of paraphrasers in generating content that resembles human writing. After going through this article, we hope that now it is clear to you that the content generated through these tools cannot be flagged as AI content."
1fo4fo6,2,2024-09-24,AI EdTech based on communication,u/TheEntrep,Business_Ideas,https://www.reddit.com/r/Business_Ideas/comments/1fo4fo6/ai_edtech_based_on_communication/,"Need help finding gaps in this idea.

**TL;DR** After using ChatGPT as a conversational learning companion, I've improved my understanding and raised my GPA from 3.5 to 3.87, recognizing the value of AI in supporting personalized learning strategies. Observing that most educational AI platforms focus on automating teaching tasks rather than understanding students individually, I've identified a significant gap in the market. To address this, I'm proposing an AI platform that enhances teacher-student relationships by offering personalized insights into each student's thinking, behavior, and learning preferences—integrating seamlessly with teachers' lesson plans and facilitating continuous two-way communication.

**Background**

Ever since ChatGPT came into existence, I've used it constantly for my college classes. I view AI as a supplement rather than just an answer generator, using it to help explain complex topics and address my behavioral needs of my learning strategies. Interestingly, I treat it a bit like a human and enjoy conversing with it about school subjects. This conversation has helped me to understand how I think about learning a subject then cultivating GPT to teach me in that manner. With this role change I have seen my grades go from a cumulative 3.5 to a 3.87.

Given the current landscape of the educational AI market, I've examined several key factors across existing platforms: key features, sub-features, target markets, the teacher's role (whether supplemental or as a replacement), communication channels between teachers and students, dashboard functionalities, and the level of teacher involvement. What I've noticed is that most AI platforms tend to focus on automating teaching functions—like generating lesson plans, guiding students through logical thought processes, and being heavily subject-oriented—rather than serving as tools to deeply understand the student as an individual and how the unique teacher fits into the student's life.

For example, platforms like **Carnegie Learning's AI solutions**, such as MATHia®, offer adaptive learning experiences and provide teachers with data on student performance. These tools are excellent at delivering personalized content and helping students master subject matter. However, they often focus on academic metrics and may not fully address the need for capturing a student's unique thought processes, behavioral patterns, or how they interact with their teachers on a personal level.

This suggests that while current AI platforms are valuable for enhancing educational outcomes, there is a significant opportunity for tools that prioritize understanding the student holistically. There's a pressing need for AI platforms that not only assist with educational content but also enhance the teacher's ability to understand and connect with each student individually, supporting the teacher's role in guiding the student's educational journey.

**Solution**

**Introducing an AI Platform That Enhances Teacher-Student Relationships**

In the evolving landscape of education technology, many AI platforms focus on automating tasks like generating lesson plans or providing direct answers to students. While these tools have their merits, they often overlook the importance of understanding each student's unique thought processes and how teachers can best support them. Recognizing this gap, I am proposing an AI platform that teams up with teachers to offer personalized insights into each student's thinking, behavior, and learning preferences—without replacing traditional classroom methods.

**Engaging Students Through Behavioral Communication**

This platform engages students through behavioral communication, helping them process their thoughts rather than just providing solutions or formatting lesson plans. By interacting with the AI in a conversational manner, students are encouraged to articulate their understanding and work through challenges, fostering critical thinking and self-reflection. This approach positions the AI as a supportive companion in their learning journey, not just a tool for answers.

**Seamless Integration with Teacher's Own Lesson Plans**

Teachers can seamlessly integrate their own lesson plans into the platform. The AI analyzes these plans alongside individual student profiles, offering advice on where each student might struggle and suggesting personalized strategies to help them using the current lesson material. This ensures that instruction is tailored to meet each student's needs while still aligning with the teacher's curriculum and teaching style.

**Facilitating Continuous Two-Way Communication**

By keeping the conversation flowing between students and teachers, the platform helps educators tweak lesson plans based on real-time feedback while still meeting state learning requirements. Teachers receive immediate insights into how students are interacting with the material, allowing for timely interventions and adjustments. This dynamic exchange enhances the learning experience and promotes a more responsive educational environment.

**Dynamic Insights Through an Intuitive Dashboard**

With an easy-to-use dashboard, teachers gain access to dynamic insights and behavior assessments that go beyond traditional performance metrics. The platform provides a holistic view of each student's progress, engagement levels, and areas where they may need additional support. This empowers teachers to make informed decisions and tailor their approach to better support each student's learning journey.

**Reducing Cheating by Promoting Authentic Learning**

The platform cuts down on cheating by reinforcing that the AI is a tool meant for communication and thought processing rather than searching for answers. By positioning the AI as a learning companion, students are less inclined to misuse it for shortcuts and more likely to engage authentically with the material. This cultivates an environment of trust and integrity in the learning process. Let's face it students are going to use AI now.

**Addressing a Critical Gap in Educational AI**

Unlike many existing AI platforms that act as replacements for certain teaching functions, this solution is designed to enhance and support the teacher's role in the student's life. It focuses on understanding the student as an individual and strengthening the unique relationship between teacher and student. This approach fills a significant gap in the current market, where personalization often centers on content delivery rather than fostering meaningful connections.

**Why This Solution Matters**

By addressing the limitations of current AI educational tools, this platform offers a transformative approach that benefits both teachers and students. It empowers educators with deeper insights, supports students in processing their thoughts, and maintains the integrity of traditional teaching methods. This not only improves educational outcomes but also enriches the overall learning experience."

1fo7iep,1,2024-09-24,looking for oc centric rp’s,u/Danislays,harrypotterrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotterrp/comments/1fo7iep/looking_for_oc_centric_rps/,"hi! i’ve been in this community for a while now but this is my first time making a post. i’m looking for some rps! discord is preferred for me!

some info about me. i’m a full time college student studying zoology. i’m genderdoe and use she/they/it pronouns. i’m also omnisexua, demiromantic and poly. my oc’s reflect my identity.

i prefer to play female or female aligned characters, though i will also play non-binary characters and males. i prefer gxg pairings, followed by gxb. i will also do bxb, but i am not super comfortable with bxb on it’s own, due to preferring to play female characters. i don’t like just playing male characters.

i do oc x canon for the most part. i will do double ups(not sure if they're called something different here) as long as it’s fair. however, i do have some rules for that. things have to be fair(no writing five lines for your oc and two for mine), i far prefer girl x girl for my side and i will not play certain characters, like voldemort, for your oc. 

i also do oc x oc on occasion. but this will heavily depend on your oc. however, i don’t often actually reject oc x oc requests, so please do ask! however, if you completely refuse to play any canon characters, i will not rp with you. even doing an oc x oc rp, it’s nice to use canon characters as side characters. i don’t want to be stuck playing all the canon characters. 

i do have a few oc’s who are open for bxb. for these oc’s, it would either be in an rp where i am using multiple oc’s in oc x canon ships or multiple oc’s in oc x oc ships. i will not do an rp that’s just bxb, as i am more comfortable being able to also play a female.

that being said, if you refuse to do same gender pairings for any reason other than not being comfortable playing a boy(so you don’t do bxb) or a girl(so you don’t do gxg), don’t interact with me. 

now onto literacy levels. i’m generally semi-literate, but i can be literate if i’m really interested in the rp. i may do one liners on occasion, but i really try not to do them and won’t rp with someone who does exclusively one liners. i am also not super active, due to being a full time college student. if you can’t wait one or even two days for a response, we will not work as roleplay partners.

i am willing to do 18+, as long as i’m comfortable with you. i don’t want it to be all of the rp. i will also not do rps without romance. they get boring for me. but, if we have side plots of platonic relationships, i love doing that!

also note i am willing to do canon x canon if we do it in a double up, alongside my oc x a canon character or oc x oc. preferably oc x canon. 

i’m willing to do any era. though i’m most familiar with marauders and golden era. below i’ll put some info on my ocs

gemini black: the middle sister of the black brothers. paired with remus. 
safiya lewis: heir of the lewis family, pureblood that has a lot of pressure to marry another pureblood. paired with lily(or bellatrix as an adult)
althea lupin: the older sister of remus, very motherly(basically the mom of the marauders). paired with narcissa black.
haven potter: james potter’s younger sister. paired with marlene mckinnon
cricket mckinnon: marlene’s younger sister. paired with sirius black. 
magdalena macdonald: mary’s older sister, always in mar’s shadow. paired with pandora rosier.
calypso black: the sister of orion black. paired with minerva
althea delacour: draco’s older sister. ran away from home to france. paired with fleur delacour.
venus mckinnon: daughter of marlene and haven mckinnon. raised by james and lily(au where instead of dying, lily and james lived. but, haven went insane from torture because she stayed in the mckinnon mansion long enough to write a letter warning james that peter was the traitor and was caught by the deatheaters) paired with hermione.
heather mcgonagall: basically heather by conan gray. girlfriend of cedric diggory. paired with pansy.
amberely grimm: bitter pureblood who is used to getting whatever she wants. and that’s cedric. her and heather are connected. paired with cedric diggory.
odyssey lovegood: daughter of snape and an oc of mine. always a bit ditzy and whimsical. paired with luna.
giada bloom: daughter of regulus black and giovanni bloom. giovanni was pregnant(he’s trans) with giada when regulus died. paired with ginny.
danica malfoy: leader of a group assembled by voldemort. destined to either overthrow the dark lord or make him even more powerful. paired with neville.
alessandra howe: the gryfindor of voldermort’s group, alessandra showed that a slytherin and gryfindor don’t have to be enemies with her friendship with danica paired with draco.
avalon greenglade: the smarts of the group, though that wasn’t always obvious. the ravenclaw was always good at outsmarting her teachers. paired with harry potter.
marjorie willard: one of the only hufflepuff’s in history, if the only one ever, to use dark magic, marjorie subverts the expectation that hufflepuff’s are docile. but even in her own group, she’s underestimated. paired with daphne greengrass.
i have a few next gen oc’s, but they’re very much wips.

Recently, I've been seeing a lot of content on Twitter/X from developers talking about the discrepancy between what students are taught in classes for CS and what skills are actually used when working as a SWE for big tech or at some startup. One of the more interesting points I saw was an ex-Meta developer talk about how the first 80% or so of his programming knowledge has essentially been replaced by AI tools (Cursor, Claude) now that they are capable enough to at least generate initial passes of projects. He insists that the remaining 20% of his skillset has become critical and is what will differentiate programmers even as AI continues to advance. 

My question is, as someone who  (honestly) feels like I am learning concepts that would have been relevant 5-10 years ago for getting jobs in my college classes and is just getting started, what approach should I take to learning? Are there any particular skills and concepts that I should be particularly focused on? What things in your experience have become important to understand even with AI getting better?  "

# Why I chose to learn to code?

“When I was in high school, I was in an International Baccalaureate program, and one of the electives offered was computer science. Up until then, I’d never heard of programming. They made me go sit in for one of the classes as a sophomore, because the elective started in junior year. The teacher was teaching Java, and I was like, *Ah, this is pretty cool*. I signed up for the elective. Unfortunately for me, that summer I got a call from the principal of the school telling me that they couldn’t register me for the computer science class, because not enough students had signed up for it. I later found out that I was the only one that signed up.

That said, I actually wanted to learn programming. I liked airplanes and the concept of flight. I took a physics course in high school, and I realized I was kind of good at it. My teacher told me, ‘You know, rockets and airplanes have a lot to do with programming, especially the embedded systems. All of these computer chips are programmed with languages.’”

# How I made time to learn?

“Being incredibly curious, when I was 15 years old, I picked up a book on C++ called *Sams Teach Yourself C++ in 24 Hours*. I basically started studying and just tried to the best of my abilities to teach myself C++, of all languages. The very first thing I did when I learned C++ was design calculators for physics that could calculate kinetic energy, just to practice programming. I liked it, so I just kept going and going. When I was a little older, I discovered Arduino and started playing with it, and continued to program.

I am a self-taught programmer, mostly from reading books and watching tutorials. In college, I majored in mechanical engineering with the intent of working for the aerospace industry. My focus was the field of computational fluid dynamics, which is basically the application of math and computer science in mechanical engineering.”

# What got me interested in the job

“I have 17 years of teaching experience — basically any job I’ve had my entire life has been in education. My first job out of school, I ran the outreach program at my university for teachers trying to learn coding. I was teaching the teachers how to code. I used to be a robotics teacher at a school on the Upper West Side, and I coached the robotics teams, both FLL and FTC. And I also gave courses in computer programming, basic mechatronics, and electronic design.

https://preview.redd.it/4qyzgst4frmd1.png?width=1326&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8363c0c6eea53530591f1fe281243874f0a50c6

In 2017, I taught a summer program for middle schoolers on basic programming at the Harlem Educational Activities Fund, and in the very last week, we used Codecademy. Codecademy has the lesson plan already laid out for you, and everything is right there prepared for you in the learning environment to start coding. The students would basically go through the tutorials, and I was just there to help out and guide them if they got stuck. Mind you, these students were 12 years old, so naturally a lot of questions can arise.

Programming is a nice thing to know, not only just for the coding part, but just to teach you how to think. At that age, learning to code and computational thinking is more of a brain exercise than a career move. I like to see someone who didn’t know anything about this subject suddenly develop the interest that I did when I was a child. That’s probably the most rewarding part.”

# Here’s what you need to get started

“I learned how to program in 2004, a year before YouTube came out, so all I had was books. Now there are way more resources, like Codecademy and YouTube — there’s just a wealth of information on the internet. With [AI](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/can-chatgpt-ai-teach-you-to-code/?utm_source=ccblog&utm_medium=ccblog&utm_campaign=sept23_bts&utm_content=ls_hisham), now you don’t even need a book. If you get stuck, you can just ask a robot.

Programming is 20% knowing the syntax and 80% knowing how to think. There are patterns, algorithms, data structures, and all these conceptual ideas that you have to absorb to make programs and apps. Programming languages are how you implement those ideas.”

# My advice for students learning how to code

“Revisit why you want to learn how to code. Say you’re someone who really likes video games and is very curious how they work. Perhaps your school doesn’t have a programming curriculum that focuses on game development? You may want to look at more coding courses that will guide you more towards programming video games, for example, in Python you have Pygame. Look back and remember why you started, and if you’re deviating from that, get yourself back on track.

I also have a shitty sense of humor. But that’s obvious, isn’t it?

I’d tell you my name, but let’s keep the anonymity on that for the time being. I like to have that kind of barrier when I’ve spoken to deranged medical students and a woman who thought she could be physically turned into a car. I wish I was joking.

I’m from Minnesota. I’m Latino and bi. I’m also a Gemini and my MBTI is ENFJ. I study business, I used to study sociology but then I dropped out of uni. Long story. I work as a server at a hotel for events such as weddings, birthday parties, business retreats. I love it and I hate it, the pay is why I’m still there. 

I love listening to music, my favorite genres are rap, r&b, and alternative rock. I love to journal. I love pretty much anything art in general, traveling, learning new things, basketball and going out. Also play video games, but I haven’t had much time lately. I’m pretty much a pothead so I hope you’d be fine with that lmao. I feel like I can get along with anyone as long as you can put effort into the conversation lol. 

I’d appreciate if you tell me a bit about yourself once you message. I’m cool with moving onto a different platform later on."

1fonik0,5,2024-09-24,"DAT Breakdown (22AA, 22 TS, 20 PAT) ",u/exalted_0,predental,https://www.reddit.com/r/predental/comments/1fonik0/dat_breakdown_22aa_22_ts_20_pat/,"Hi everybody! I just finished my test a couple of hours ago! Ever since I stumbled on one of these I've always wanted to do one of my own. I enjoyed reading the different ways people approached studying for this test, and so I wanted to share how I did it!

**Background:** I am currently a rising senior in college, and will be applying during the 2025 application cycle. I figured that the summer before I applied would give me the most time to study, and I'm grateful that I've made the right choice. For reference, I am by no means a smart student, but I do work very hard. My GPA is a 3.64 oGPA and 3.41 sGPA with a very strong upward trend. I ended with a C+ in Gen Chem I (still my weakness to this very day) and throughout my freshman and sophomore years I ended up with B's in many of the prerequisites. I started studying very hard, (I guess you could call it over studying) my junior year and I'd like to say it's paid off. 

Even though I didn't take any rest days, a decent amount of my time ""studying"" was me also on my phone scrolling reddit or procrastinating on the DAT discord group throughout the day (y'all should really join) lol so I guess those served as my breaks and it honestly helped me refresh in between studying sessions. I also didn't start getting burnt out until three days before the exam. I am a very resilient person so I guess that contributes as well.

**Materials**

1. DAT Booster: I will go more in depth on this later, but for the most part Booster really helped me prepare. I followed its 12-week schedule until about Phase II, then I just completely ignored it. For bio, I only I also took every single practice test, some of them more than once. During my last week of study, I made it a priority to make sure I knew the answer to EVERY SINGLE question (especially on bio) in case I got any repeats. Unfortunately this was not the case. I will go more in depth on this later!
2. Booster Crash Course: I attended two bio crash courses about 1.5 weeks before my test. To be brutally honest, it didn't help me much. I think that if you are scoring below 19 and really need a good resource to jumble everything together, they would be a great resource to attend. I did not think clearly at the time and thought they were a good idea to raise my score 2-3 points like most people claim. In all honesty, by the time I attended these I was at peak knowledge for bio so a lot of it was just too broad to do much for me.
3. DAT Bootcamp: During my last 4 days, I was able to take some Bootcamp science section tests just to test my knowledge. I didn't use any of their question banks or videos.
4. Anki: I used this for the first two months. I mostly used the 4000+ anki deck that booster gives. It was good until I started getting 1000 review cards near the end of it, which I completely abandoned it after that. For those two months though, anki was my saving grace for sure.
5. Chads Prep: I didn't use this too much aside from the learning phase. Instead of booster's gen chem and ochem videos, I watched Chad's lectures because they were much better in my opinion. 

**Scores**

1. Biology - 20

I didn't get any repeat questions on this section. Booster's practice exams were not representative at all of my test and I am honestly so grateful I ended with a 20 because it did not feel like I got a 20 while taking it.  Most of my questions consisted of genetics, cell bio, some questions on the circulatory system, bactera/virus questions, and some on photosynthesis. I did not have any questions on the ecology section or taxonomy. I think if I were to get more simpler questions like the ones shown on Booster/Bootcamp, I would've gotten a higher score, but it is what it is and I'm still super grateful for how everything turned out.

As I mentioned before, I studied this section pretty much DAILY with Anki starting from day 1. I worked through half of the 2000 card Anki deck booster provides, and then I worked through the other 4,000 card deck they provide. After about two months, the review cards started getting way too much for me to keep up with. I changed my study methods to copy and pasting the cheat sheets into ChatGPT and asking it to quiz me on EVERY SINGLE FACT. Whatever questions I got wrong would instantly get made into a flashcard.  I reviewed these flashcards for about a month until test day once every 2-3 days. 

2. Gen Chem - 22

I attached my practice scores, and you can clearly see I STRUGGLED with this section for like 6-7 straight practice tests. Seeing all of my work translate to alternating 18s and 16s really messed with me. As I mentioned before, I had little no background with this topic, so I was learning everything from scratch. I mainly watched Chad's Prep for this during the learning phase, and went through the question banks.

Even though I was pouring my heart and soul into this section, nothing seemed to be working. I was rewatching the videos, redoing the question banks, doing Chad's prep questions (those killed me) for hours and hours and my scores were still stagnant at 16 & 18. By around test 6 or 7, I knew something had to change, so like biology, I went back to flashcards. This time, instead of going through the q banks and sort of just falling into the trap of ""skipping"" missed questions, I made sure to create a flashcard for EVERY SINGLE QUESTION that I got wrong or felt unsure about. If there was an answer choice I didn't understand, I made a flashcard for that as well. I also made flashcards for every single practice question I got incorrect. Like biology, I went through these every couple of days.  Gen Chem is a daunting section, but if I was able to pull it off, you will be able to as well!

For the actual test portion, I felt like it was fairly representative of Booster. There were definitely a few questions that Booster didn't even (teach?) but I remember seeing in my gen chem classes very briefly. The questions were worded slightly differently, so I'd make sure to not get too used to the way Booster words their questions because their repetitiveness can kind of make you too comfortable in a way. Chances are you know the answer to the question, its just worded strangely.

Organic Chemistry - 25

This section of the DAT seemed to be the most representative of Booster. Unlike gen chem and bio, you can't really manipulate the wordings of questions for ochem. There weren't really any curve balls here, so just make sure you're always studying the reactions, ppm values for CNMR and HNMR, acidity ranking, lab techniques, etc. I also had a fair amount of reaction questions, and two multi-step synthesis problems.

During the learning phase, I kind of neglected this section because I was scoring 20s right off the bat because of my strong foundation during my sophomore year. I think that this section can be pretty intimidating especially if you're learning it from scratch, but it gets easier once you really get very comfortable the basic fundamentals of how electrons move, electrophiles/nucleophiles, etc. After the learning phase though, I started to double down more on this section using MORE FLASHCARDS...(RIP the trees) I went and made a flash card for every single reaction, and I also went through every question bank and made a card for everything I got wrong just like in gen chem. LIke gen chem and bio, I went through these every 2-3 days. I know that sounds scary, but there are obbiously cards that stick much easier than others, so I would put the ones I knew how to do more easily to the side once to focus more on the difficult ones. I

PAT - 20

During my learning phase, I made it a priority to spend at least 30 minutes a day getting better at PAT. Once I started the review phase, I honestly never practiced this section again aside from the practice tests. Once I found out that the practice test questions (especially for TFE and pattern folding) were not representative of the question bank problems, I instantly stopped doing them.   

When I got my score, I was honestly surprised because I thought I scored a lot higher. Angle ranking, TFE, and cube counting were SIGNIFICANTLY easier than Booster or Bootcamp practice tests. TFE was laughably easy, it was on par to the question banks they provide. There was one shape where it literally had no dotted lines and had four sides maximum. I don't even know how to explain it but it was that simple lol. Angle ranking had a lot of acute angles which made it easier as well. I wasn't hit with any weird cube counting shapes, although I did get one with a floating cube in it.

RC - 21

I don't read at ALL during my free time, and only read when I have to. I am a pretty fast reader, but I tend to forget facts pretty easily. For this section, I completed all of the question banks during my learning phase. After that, the only time I practiced RC was during the full length practice tests. I tried a bunch of different strategies, but the one I found the most success with was the vanilla method. The highlighting function really helped me find answers quickly after reading the entire passage. 

My first passage on my test was more difficult than any one of Booster's RC sections. It was related to telephones, fiber optics, etc. and I just had no interest in reading it at all lol. It had quite a few conceptuals and those true and false statements. I'm not gonna lie, when I was mid-test during this section I thought I was cooked. Luckily, my second passage was SO EASY. The questions were all factual based, and it was weird because they were all asked in the order of the passage. I didn't even need to highlight anything because I was just going down the passage and finding the answer. My third passage was a decent mix of both, and more representative of the Booster practice tests. None of the three RC passages exceeded 14 paragraphs, so I guess I lucked out on that.

QR - 20

QR was a section I dreaded studying for. I am very good at ""doing"" math, but awful at setting up equations in relation to word problems. For this section, I watched all the videos, did all of the question banks, and re-did practice test questions. My only hope for this section was to make flashcards for everything I got wrong and solve them out of muscle memory. During the learning phase, I didn't really put any emphasis on this section, but during the last three weeks I started doubling down on all of the equations/probability questions.

The actual test was pretty representative of Booster. I didn't get many surprise questions, but I unfortunately just didn't know how to solve a decent amount of them. I don't really have any advice on this section, and to be honest I dont think you should follow my way of studying it lol. The calculator on this section allowed me to type in numbers on the keyboard for anyone wondering!

**Overall**

I am blessed and truly grateful for the score that I received. Attached below are my practice test averages for both booster and bootcamp. For those with stagnating scores, I just want to let you know that my scores didn't see an increase until 2 weeks before the exam. I was stuck at a 20 for about 7-8 straight practice tests but thankfully pulled through.

Thank you all for reading and please reach out if you have any questions or want help on how to approach certain sections! I am more than happy to help you!

Some might find it funny, taking essay writing tips from a generative AI company, but who better to learn how to write better essays from than a technology programmed to write human essays for you?

StealthGPT knows essays. We know what academics love to read. If you want to write powerful, persuasive, academic essays then this guide will give you the 7 keys to unlocking your best writing.

So, what are the qualities that make a good essay? It’s not a collection of qualities ranging from the basics, like syntax, diction, grammar, style, and formatting to deeper considerations like persuasiveness, the hook, argument building, and more.

Throughout this guide, I’ll show you what StealthGPT generated using its Stealth Writer tool as a sample.

# Key 1: Five Basic Concepts

I know it’s a little misleading, telling you one tip is understanding five concepts, but I’m going to make this quick. There are five basics you need to take into account when starting your essay and I don’t need to write a whole essay to explain each of these. They are:

* **Form**: The logical order of your essay. Make sure your essay flows from introduction to body paragraphs to conclusion which tightly wraps up your essay with a bow.
* **Writing Style**: Don’t be boring. Good writing expresses a persona that highlights writing skulls including vocabulary, rhythm, artfulness and fluency of English.
* **Conventions**: Punctuation, sentence structure, and grammar. If your essay is lacking in these basic conventions, it doesn’t matter how much style and credibility you’ve injected into your essay, readers won’t take it seriously. Ensuring you stick to conventions is as simple as proofreading.
* **Supporting Documents and References**: Academic writing always considers your resources and citations. You want to demonstrate proof of intensive research with references and quotations with proper citation to whatever format you’re using be it MLA, APA, or Chicago.
* **Topic**: Know your topic or essay question. Know the argument you’re making on behalf of that topic. Know the resources that will help you build that argument. Don’t come into an essay unprepared. All these things need to be known to you well before you start. Brainstorming is a serious step in the essay writing process that you will need to do before diving into your first draft if you want to write an effective essay.

You will find all these conventions present in Stealth Writer’s essay:

Perfect punctuation and grammar. No spelling mistakes and even a personalized writing style and word count requirement if you ask nicely.

# Key 2: A Strong Thesis

The thesis statement is the most important element of any essay. It is the main point or claim of your essay. Usually, a thesis appears at the end of the essay’s introductory paragraph with each body paragraph logically building upon your argument to support that thesis afterward.

A good thesis is arguable, not description of a subjective reality. The point of your thesis and essay at large should be that the read may be able to argue with the point of your thesis until you persuade them with the argument you present and support in each following paragraph.

Before choosing a thesis, you should consider if it’s so obvious that people wouldn’t argue against it or if it’s so simple it wouldn’t require an entire essay to argue.

Unlike each of those previous five conventions, I could write an entire essay about what makes a good thesis. Here's a [Harvard article about writing a thesis](https://writingcenter.fas.harvard.edu/thesis) that I found helpful.

# Key 3: The Hook

An essay’s introduction is more than just the piece of writing where you place your thesis, it’s the essential lure you’re gonna use to seduce readers to start and finish your essay. You need to learn how to hook your readers by baiting them into reader further. This includes not revealing everything right away, build upon a mystery by choosing language that leads the reader one breadcrumb at a time.

Your introduction shouldn’t just include a thesis but sentences that hook your readers by giving them unexplored lines of inquiry toward your thesis that absorb them into your writing.

[Writing a hook](https://www.collegeessayguy.com/blog/write-good-hook-for-essay) can be difficult but thankfully, the College Essay Guy has you covered too.

# Key 4: Building an Argument

Separate your argument into points. Any element of your argument a reader may dispute should be a separate body paragraph for you to persuade them.

Each point of your argument will require a body paragraph following your thesis. Each body paragraph will require a topic sentence. Topic sentences need to present an argument linked to the central idea in our thesis that you build upon in the rest of the paragraph.

Now once you’ve made your argument, you need to provide relevant evidence. This is where you use proper citations without plagiarism to convince your reader. Evidence isn’t all you’ll need though, once presenting them with citations, you will need to analyze what you’ve cited to appeal to your point. In other words, tell us how the evidence supports the topic sentence of your paragraph.

Using Stealth Writer’s new In-text citations feature, you can input as many quotes as you need and it will automatically write them out in whatever format you require. Here’s how we put it to use in our essay:

As you can see, any quote can be linked back to its citation which you can either input manually or automatically using this feature.

# Key 5: Transitions

You essay writing skills alone aren’t enough to lead your reader through an essay. Great essays need to leverage content and information to transition from one paragraph to the next or one sentence to the next.

An important method to utilize when transitioning to a new idea is to jump off introducing that new idea by relating it to an old idea you’ve already mentioned previously. You can compare or contrast the new idea to the previously mentioned one. You can agree or disagree with the old idea using the new idea. You can show cause and effect relating the old to the new idea, or you can explain the old idea using the new idea.

Simply presenting new information to the reader without giving them a base of familiarity is off putting and often too complicated to follow for readers.

# Key 6: Counter Arguments

Because you’ve chosen a thesis that is arguable and you’re trying to persuade readers to your position, there is no better method of getting them onboard with you than first acknowledging then debunking and dismantling the counter arguments to your point.

Always be considering counterarguments to conclusions you’ve drawn from evidence, assumptions you’ve made, evidence you haven’t presented, and an alternative interpretation of your evidence. Because readers will always be thinking of different counterarguments to your points as they read, you shouldn’t just be adding them into your work once you’ve completed writing your essay and building your argument.

Writing a counterargument needs to dispel any standing it has in your readers mind. First, you have to present the counter argument. Then you have to counter that argument and explain why either the counterargument is flawed or too weak to undermine your argument. Be mindful of how you present a counter argument, saying things like “nevertheless my argument still stands” diminishes the credibility of your counter.

# Key 7: Conclusion

Each discipline has different standards for what makes a good conclusion but in any case, what makes a bad conclusion is just a simple summary of what you’ve already stated throughout the essay. What you want to do in a conclusion is address two aspects to an argument the “so what” and the “now what”.

Address the “so what” by setting the stakes that depend on your arguments persuasiveness. Then leaver your readers with the “now what” by addressing how they can now see the issue in a new light after your argument, what questions can be raised following the research and argument constructed that couldn’t have been made at the beginning of the essay, what larger context is your argument a part of, or what actions can be taken in light of your argument.

That’s how you tie your essay up into a perfect bow, instead of just summarizing the previous sections.

# FAQ

# Is Using Generative AI Plagiarism?

Traditional plagiarism is stealing someone else’s words or ideas then not providing proper credit or crediting yourself. Because generative AI generates original content, you are not stealing anyone’s words or ideas when using it. However, academic institutions still consider the use of AI as a ghost writer for academic writing as academic misconduct under the pretense of “AI plagiarism”. You can learn more about the [ethics of AI in academia](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/is-using-chatgpt-plagiarism-academic-dishonesty-in-dishonest-academia) from our blog post.

# Who Uses Generative AI?

A report suggests that half of students are using generative AI for school work now but the software isn’t limited to academia. Professionals use AI writing tools for SEO, blogging, and social media just like students use it for essays and assignments. Funnily enough, faculty use it as well for a variety of tasks from creating curricula to syllabi.

# What Is Undetectable AI?

Because AI detectors have been implemented by most universities, undetectable AI software like StealthGPT was created so you can generate human-like writing using AI. Previous to this, Chatbots generated text that was a dead giveaway as far as its authorship went, now by duplicating the trends of human writing like the complexity and randomness of word choice, sentence structure, and sentence length, undetectable AI tools can generate text that is indecipherable from human text to both AI detectors and professors alike.

1foxlta,49,2024-09-25,Long Time Lurker - All the 'Chance Me/Pick Me Uni/Which Uni is better' is often pointless,u/LonelyMC,Indians_StudyAbroad,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indians_StudyAbroad/comments/1foxlta/long_time_lurker_all_the_chance_mepick_me/,"*A bit of a long post, I apologize for that*  
  
Hello everyone, I am also from India, applying for Fall 2025 intake. I have been a long time lurker in this subreddit since summer 2025 as I wanted to know what others would be applying to. Not to demotivate/degrade anyone, but most of the posts here are basically:  
1. Here is my profile, please chance my acceptance rates.  
2. I want to study X, please give me a list of universities to apply.  
3. I am applying to A,B,C,D universities, which one is better?

I would just like to point out why these questions often amount to nothing:  
  
1 -> Acceptance rates are often dependent upon multitude of factors, not just your profile, which entirely depends on the graduate admissions committee of the particular year of the particular department (how many students they can support). In 2024 they might have taken in a cohort of 25 students, but maybe if 2-3 professors went on sabbatical, they might be willing to only take in a cohort of 20 students. Another important factor is the students you are competing with. Maybe your profile would have got you in easily in the 2024 cycle, but if suddenly 10 Edward Wittens and  5 Claude Shannons are applying for the 2025 cycle, then you are out of luck.

2 -> No, you must do this yourself. This question is the most irritable out of the 3 I have listed. Please, do your own research. It takes time. I have been making university lists since June this year, reading in-depth about every program on the program page, list of professors, courses offered, research done in that department, places where students go after the end of their degree. You need to be **independent.** 

3 -> Many factors play into this, its often super hard to judge. Rankings are often all over the place. QS ranks MIT 1st, THE ranks MIT 3rd, while US rankings put MIT at 2nd. The ranking gets messier for lesser know unis. Ideally, just apply broadly, then leave the choice to the future you when you have multiple acceptances.

  
What you should ideally do:

1. Do individual research on programs. Start by deeply introspecting yourself on why do you want to study further? What do you want to study further? Your short term and long term expectations. Why this specific X and Y university. What do they offer that others dont?
2. People applying to MS programs must understand that they will have a research component. Research fit is really necessary. What is research fit? How well is the match between area you want to study and work and what the department provides. The fit goes both ways. Say you wish to work in deep reinforcement learning, but the department works on computer arch and optimization theory, then there is no fit. They will reject you even if you had a stellar profile.
3. Do NOT depend on ANY consultancy. Probably going to re-iterate and repeat some of my points I have said above, but do not go to any consultancy. Do your own research, apply yourself. Independence is a trait needed to survive, you must know how to collect information. You are your individual self, show it through the apps, in SOP.
4. Understanding different countries have different requirements. US is quite different from Europe. Why select US over Germany? Or vice-versa? Do you have the answer for this question? What will you do after the degree?
5. Individually tailor SOP. Please don't copy paste a template with your name changed. Please don't be generic. It should be good enough that they should be fighting with other universities to take you in. 
6. Be streamlined through the whole process. Don't rush things.
7. A word of warning. Look out for universities which are degree mills. I won't drop any names, but their degrees might not be worth all the effort, money you put in. These are easy to get into, but beware.

I know I this is very long, but thank you if you got till here. These are my individual observations I have made over months of research. If you have any questions, I will be happy to answer. Hope this post helps!

1foxu3m,1,2024-09-25,Which model to use as a student?,u/AssociationTop291,ChatGPTPro,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1foxu3m/which_model_to_use_as_a_student/,"Hello everyone,

I'm a STEM student, and I'm exploring ways to use ChatGPT to boost my productivity, especially in areas like learning faster (STEM subjects, software (Unity for example), programming, etc.) and handling some tedious tasks in my internship (correcting small bugs, etc.).

However, I'm a bit confused about the different models available and how to choose the right one for my needs. I’m using the API with Chatbox and as a student, I don’t always need the most powerful model, so I’m looking for advice on how to select a model that’s both effective and not too expensive for my needs.

Any tips or guidelines on how to make the best choice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!"
1fozwpo,1,2024-09-25,Australian Student Considering Podiatry,u/Sun-God_Kamirumi,Podiatry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Podiatry/comments/1fozwpo/australian_student_considering_podiatry/,"Hi everyone,

I'm from Australia and considering a career in podiatry. I'm planning to pursue a Bachelor of Podiatry/Podiatric Medicine in the next few years and would love to hear from those already working in the field.

I developed an interest in podiatry during a work experience at my local hospital, where I spent an afternoon with a relative who is a podiatrist. Initially, I thought I wouldn't enjoy it, but she inspired me by sharing her experiences, showing me some of her cases and clients, and explaining how she treats their conditions. I was able to observe some of these conditions firsthand, along with a few minor treatments and procedures. Afterward, she had me clean the floor and help sort equipment for restocking. This experience sparked my interest, especially since becoming a medical professional has been a goal of mine since childhood due to my passion for medicine and healthcare.

I have a few questions that I hope you can help with:

* **Key Concepts & Key Knowledge**:
   * What are some fundamental topics or concepts I should expect to learn in podiatry school?
   * Are there any specific things I should focus on early in my studies?
   * What does a typical day look like for a podiatrist?
   * What are the most common conditions you treat?
* **Skills & Priorities**:
   * What skills should I prioritize developing while studying or training to become a podiatrist?
   * Any advice on balancing practical experience with academic learning?
* **Challenges**:
   * What are some common challenges podiatry students or new graduates face in the field?
   * Any tips on how to overcome these challenges and stand out in the profession?
* **Internships & Clinical Experience**:
   * What types of internships or clinical experiences would you recommend for someone just starting out?
* **Specialties in Podiatry**:
   * Are there any specific areas or specialties within podiatry that you suggest exploring or focusing on?

Any advice would be appreciated.

(As you can see, I used ChatGPT, because I didn't have a good idea on how to word this out, but this is generally what I wanted to know since I want to pursue this as a career in the future once I finish High School and a GAP Year Program."

[Chris-PlayZ-](https://www.reddit.com/user/Chris-PlayZ-/) let's ask [Gift Ideas ❤️ GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-41Pnsy6eW-gift-ideas)

>[Less than £100](https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftIdeas/?f=flair_name%3A%22Less%20than%20%C2%A3100%22)

2. Fairy Lights with Photo Clips – A set of twinkling fairy lights paired with clips to hang photos can create a cozy and aesthetic atmosphere in her new flat. You can add photos of your best memories to make it extra special! Here’s a great option you can check out: [Fairy Lights with Photo Clips](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=fairy+lights+photo+clips&tag=gifts-favspro-20).

You can find diffusers within your budget on Amazon, like this one: [Essential Oil Diffuser](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=essential+oil+diffuser&tag=gifts-favspro-20).
7. Handwritten Letters in a Jar – Write her a series of letters to open whenever she feels homesick or stressed. Each letter can have a memory, inside joke, or encouraging message. It's a deeply personal and cost-effective way to show your love.
8. Digital Frame – If she’s tech-savvy, consider a digital photo frame where she can easily upload new pictures, creating a dynamic and ever-changing display of your favorite moments together. Here’s a solid option: [Digital Photo Frame](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=digital+photo+frame&tag=gifts-favspro-20).
9. Cozy Slippers or Loungewear – Since she’s away from home, something cozy like plush slippers or loungewear can make her feel comfortable in her new flat. Look for something cute and warm that she can wear when she’s studying late at night.
10. Custom Doodle Art – Use DALL-E to create a unique drawing of something special to both of you (like your favorite travel destination or activity together). You can then have it printed on a t-shirt, hoodie, or poster using [Printful’s personalized printing service](https://www.printful.com/personalized-gifts/a/index).

1. **Personalized Calendar** – Create a calendar filled with photos of your favorite moments together. You can add special notes or messages for each month, making it a sweet reminder of your relationship throughout the year. You can design it here: [Printful Personalized Calendar](https://www.printful.com/personalized-gifts/a/index).
2. **Compact Jewelry Organizer** – If she’s brought her jewelry collection to uni, a stylish and compact jewelry organizer can help keep everything tidy while looking chic on her dresser. Here's a beautiful option to consider: [Jewelry Organizer](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=jewelry+organizer&tag=gifts-favspro-20).
3. **Cozy Reading Nook Kit** – Create a “reading nook” gift set, including a soft cushion, a cozy throw blanket, and a good book or Kindle gift card. Perfect for unwinding in her new space after a long day at uni.
4. **Personalized Spotify Code Plaque** – If you both have a special song, you can get a plaque made with a scannable Spotify code of the song. She can scan it to play your song any time! Here's an option: [Spotify Code Plaque](https://www.etsy.com/market/spotify_code_plaque).
5. **Cooking Class Subscription** – If she enjoys cooking or wants to learn more, consider gifting her an online cooking class subscription where she can explore new recipes and improve her skills from her flat. Check out: [MasterClass Cooking Subscription](https://www.masterclass.com/).
6. **Personalized Puzzle of a Special Photo** – Turn a meaningful photo of you both into a jigsaw puzzle. Not only is it fun, but it’s also a sweet activity she can do in her downtime, and it becomes a decoration once completed. You can make this here: [Custom Puzzle at Printful](https://www.printful.com/personalized-gifts/a/index).
7. **Aromatherapy Candles** – A set of calming, beautifully scented candles can enhance the ambiance of her flat. They are perfect for relaxation during study breaks. You can find a wide range of options that fit your budget here: [Aromatherapy Candles](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=aromatherapy+candles&tag=gifts-favspro-20).
8. **Personalized Pillow with a Message** – A comfy pillow with a sweet message or a personalized design is a lovely way for her to feel close to you, especially when she misses home. You can create one here: [Personalized Pillows](https://www.printful.com/personalized-gifts/a/index).
9. **Board Game or Card Game for Two** – Gift her a fun board or card game you both can play together when she visits or even over video calls. A game like “Love Letter” or “Exploding Kittens” is easy to pack and brings lots of laughs.
10. **Travel Scratch Map** – Since she’s starting a new chapter at university, a scratch map where she can mark off countries or cities she’s visited is an exciting way for her to track her adventures and travels. It's a great idea for future trips you can plan together.

I hope these additional ideas spark your interest! Which ones do you think would make her feel most special? I'd love to hear your thoughts and refine more suggestions if you'd like. 😊"
1fp1i7w,2,2024-09-25,Study Tips From a Adhd Sufferer,u/Dhistichukka,u_Dhistichukka,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Dhistichukka/comments/1fp1i7w/study_tips_from_a_adhd_sufferer/,"I'm 24M and graduated in 2023. I have terrible attention, focus issues, and severe anxiety. I was a below average, as they say, a dumb, dull student and would always be in the last 10 ranks. I'll share my study techniques, which made my life easy and made me popular 😉😉, better at postings, DDs, and of course mock tests .I developed this as a coping mechanism for my depression and low self esteem when I was in 10th. Please try them if you think they will be helpful. Perfect for MBBS 1st and 2nd years. Remember The first 3 years will give you a basic idea about 4th year subjects.

There are two types of thinking. They are convergent and divergent thinking. I'll give you a brief summary.

Convergent Thinking:
★Focuses on a specific problem or goal.
★Analyzes and evaluates existing information.
★Results in a single answer.
★Ensures precision and accuracy through linear and sequential analysis.

Divergent Thinking:
★Explores multiple possibilities.
★Non-linear, flexible, and emphasizes quantity and variety of ideas.
★Keeps the learning process engaging.

First, simply delete everything from your head and enter ""medicine & surgery is a single vast domain"" in its place. It's just one single subject, broken into 19 smaller subjects to make it easy.

My first step is make sure my fundamentals are very good. This mainly includes medical terminology and buzz words. Don't skip terminology. 

For example: If I want to study, say, an organ, I'll learn the embryology, anatomy, and physiology of that organ, system, or region first. Why? Because this will give you an idea about that specific thing and define what's normal. Then pathology and pharmacology. This will cover everything about that organ system and lay a strong foundation for general medicine and surgery. Just remember

★general medicine = pathology + pharmacology
★Pathology = anatomy + physiology 

Note: (my preference) I treat physiology and biochemistry as one single unit, and I treat pathology and microbiology as one single unit. 

And I make notes in such a way that I don't ever need to read the textbooks again. Just learn how to analyze and condense the information. Before giving mock tests or GTs, just give one simple reading of your notes. If you follow this, this will put you at least in the range of 60-90 percentile (depending on your skills you developed and note-writing abilities).

At first, everything I said doesn't really make sense and sounds very overwhelming, but to say it in simple, obvious terms, it's about integrating different things and putting the acquired knowledge in a single box. You will start to see the patterns once you do this for a week. 

I don't know how to put it in simple words since I suck at English, but see, it's like a computer, right? First, you feed the required information and ask it to think in many different ways. It will try to think and interpolate some ideas and will try some new things like analysis, summarizing, contrasting, and hypothesizing on already existing data. By doing this, it can also extrapolate other things. You are the same. 

Some techniques, like contrasting two different things, will give you an overall picture of two concepts much faster. This will help you quickly revise in proff exams and even USMLE steps.

Clinicals are really very important. The above techniques will make you good at seeing the broader picture; compare DDs. This will make you even more proficient in the subject. Try to do as many mock tests and try to maintain a book if you encounter any new things in the mock tests.

Just maintain notes and revise them as many times as you need. This saves time and energy.

Optional tips : To speed note making process use mobile/tablet chatgpt 4o/3.5(average quality)app or any local LLMs (require pc/laptop)but I recommend phi 3.1 mini/medium(q_8 or F16) Gemma 2(F16) or llama 3.1 13B(q_6) (I have a low end PC
GPU: rtx 2060
CPU: Intel i7 8700
RAM : 32Gb)

1fp2z50,23,2024-09-25,Regrets and Concerns of a should’ve been sophomore ,u/IBelievedPoggers,NJTech,https://www.reddit.com/r/NJTech/comments/1fp2z50/regrets_and_concerns_of_a_shouldve_been_sophomore/,"Im a sophomore by year but a freshman by credits. Im a CS major and in my freshman year I really goofed around in classes always on my phone and relying on ChatGPT for my CS100 class. The end of Fall Semester comes I failed CS100 with a C and Math 108 with a D. I convince myself it happens to everyone I’ll just retake it spring. Spring semester comes and I’m making the same mistakes passed my other classes, passed 108 with the skin of my teeth getting the exact score I needed on the final to pass the class, and failing CS100 with a C+. At the time the severity of my situation hasn’t hit, I’m given the opportunity to come to this school all expenses paid and get paid $3000 a semester just for attending as long as I maintain a 3.0 gpa. My gpa fell to the pits of hell, I was in bad academic standing and had to give the dean of students a good enough reason not to make me pay for tuition. Currently at a 2.3 I have been given till spring to get myself together and have a 3.0 by then. I was considering switching schools and majors but I knew that wouldn’t make me happy. The money in the tech field is nice and all but I’ve always had an interest in computers and technology so I know this is what I want to do in life. Thankfully my mom hasn’t found out, when she does let me know who has some spare room in their dorm. But here are my concerns so far in all my classes I’ve done good on the homework and on the quizzes and I’ve studied the material further once the lecture if finished. How do I prepare for the common, there always something with the commons it’s never like the quizzes or the homework’s there’s always a curve ball thrown in every question. Today is my math 110 exam I know all the concepts but I’m not confident that I’ll do good. Lastly, looking through internships I see they require you to know all these languages, frameworks, and libraries and my question is can I rely on NJIT to teach me these things through classes or do I need to learn them throughout my winters and summers. Overall, I have the drive to succeed; I study extensively, do good on assignments, and am feeling to take summer classes to catch up but even with all this behind my expectations I feel as if I still won’t be able to make it by the deadline provided."
1fp3tj7,52,2024-09-25,LLM's pace of improvement compared to a human's education.,u/Ormusn2o,singularity,https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1fp3tj7/llms_pace_of_improvement_compared_to_a_humans/,"Maybe not so much on this subreddit, but a lot of people are talking about value of education, and how LLM's and chatGPT basically destroys students ability to critically think and how cheating using chatGPT might only work for high school but they will get in trouble when getting into college. 

It might be hard to keep timelines, but I think there are interesting dates to keep in mind.

Initial release of chatGPT was in November 2022. It was at around elementary or middle school level.

Release of gpt-4 was in march 2023. It was at level of freshmen high school.

Release of o1 was in September 2024. It is at a level of college grad or college junior. 

Now, if you were a junior highschool in 2023, now as a sophomore you have access to college level intelligence. If you were a college junior, when gpt-4 released, now you have access to one or two grades above you. 

If you were in elementary school, by the time you will take exams to highschool, there is likely going to be PHD level intelligence access in your phone.

If you just entered college, it will take you 6 or 9 years to get your education, and it makes me think how much intelligence we will have in our phones by then.

Can people genuinely tell me what exactly kids are supposed to learn? Why is using chatGPT to solve your homework wrong? By the time you have some education, for most people their education will be completely worthless. Even if there are huge, multi year slowdowns in improvements, the chance your education will be better than that of a smartphone is very unlikely."

AI can automate administrative tasks such as grading and scheduling, freeing up teachers' time to focus on instructional activities. This efficiency allows educators to spend more time on student interaction and less on paperwork​. Tools like Gradescope use AI to help teachers grade assignments more quickly and accurately, reducing the workload and providing faster feedback to students​​.

# 3. 24/7 Support and Tutoring

AI-powered tools provide round-the-clock support and tutoring for students. For instance, AI Guru from Physics Wallah offers 24/7 personalized tutoring, addressing students' queries in real-time and providing immediate assistance​​. Similarly, Coursera’s AI-based learning assistant offers 24/7 support, helping students with course-related queries anytime​.

# 4. Enhanced Engagement and Motivation

AI can boost student engagement through interactive and gamified learning experiences. Features such as leaderboards, streaks, and badges in AI-powered platforms like Alakh AI encourage students to stay motivated and engaged in their studies​. Duolingo uses AI to personalize language learning, incorporating gamification elements to keep learners motivated and engaged​.

# 5. Improved Accessibility

AI makes education more accessible by providing resources that can be easily translated into multiple languages. This capability is crucial for breaking down language barriers and ensuring that students from diverse backgrounds can access high-quality educational content​. Google's AI-driven Read Along app helps children learn to read by providing real-time feedback and support, making education accessible to non-English speakers​​.

# 6. Data-Driven Insights

AI can analyze vast amounts of data to provide insights into student performance and learning patterns.

AI caters to various learning styles by offering multiple modes of content delivery, such as text, audio, and video. This flexibility ensures that all students, regardless of their preferred learning style, can benefit from the educational material​. Microsoft's Immersive Reader uses AI to provide text-to-speech, translation, and other learning tools, supporting diverse learning needs​.

# 8. Early Intervention and Support

AI can identify at-risk students early by monitoring their progress and engagement levels. Early intervention strategies can then be implemented to provide the necessary support and prevent students from falling behind​​. Squirrel AI uses AI algorithms to detect learning gaps and provide targeted interventions, helping students stay on track​​.

# 9. Scalability

AI enables scalable educational solutions that can accommodate large numbers of students. Platforms like Physics Wallah have used AI to organize mega live classrooms for thousands of students, demonstrating AI's capacity to handle large-scale educational needs​. Similarly, BYJU uses AI to deliver personalized learning at scale, reaching millions of students across India and beyond.

# 10. Enhanced Teacher Support

AI supports teachers by providing them with resources such as lesson plans, educational videos, and interactive activities. These resources help teachers deliver more effective and engaging lessons​​. Edmodo’s AI features offer teachers content recommendations and engagement tools to enhance their teaching practices​​.

# Expert Opinions on AI in Education

Sal Khan, founder of Khan Academy, emphasizes the potential of AI to provide personalized learning experiences that cater to the unique needs of each student, helping them achieve their full potential. He believes that AI can democratize education by making high-quality resources accessible to everyone, regardless of their background.

1fp8r7u,1,2024-09-25,"""ChatGPT's Impact on Virtual Education: Efficacy in Corporate and Academic Training Explored""",u/cporter202,ChatGPTautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTautomation/comments/1fp8r7u/chatgpts_impact_on_virtual_education_efficacy_in/,"As we tread deeper into the digital age, the integration of AI-driven technologies in education systems has become a topic of significant interest and development. The emergence of OpenAI's ChatGPT has, in particular, brought a new dimension to virtual education, impacting both corporate training and academic learning environments.

ChatGPT's incorporation into educational platforms offers unique benefits, such as providing instant feedback, personalized learning experiences, and a vast repository of knowledge accessible through a conversational interface. For corporate training, this means employees can engage with the material at their own pace, solidifying knowledge retention and improving the overall effectiveness of training modules. It also promises to streamline complex training processes by breaking down intricate subjects into digestible conversations.

In academic settings, ChatGPT can serve as a virtual tutor, assisting students with homework, helping with research, and even practicing language learning. It has the potential to democratize education, offering support to students who may not have easy access to human tutors or additional resources. Moreover, ChatGPT can help educators create a more interactive curriculum by integrating AI into lesson plans and discussions.

However, while the promise of ChatGPT is great, there are considerations to be made regarding its efficacy. It's important to weigh the AI's current capabilities with the complexities of educational needs, and ensure that it aligns with learning objectives. Can it cater to different learning styles? How does it interact with subject matters that require nuanced understanding and critical thinking?

I'm curious to hear the community's thoughts on this. Have you had any direct experience with ChatGPT or similar AI technologies in a learning environment? What do you consider its strengths and limitations? Let's delve into the subject of ChatGPT's role in virtual education and its impacts on how we learn and teach in our fast-evolving world."

1fpbtho,1,2024-09-25,Breaking Bad: The Sitcom,u/seantenk,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1fpbtho/breaking_bad_the_sitcom/,"So, I asked ChatGPT to generate “a sitcom about Breaking Bad in an alternative universe where Walter White never have cancer, and so he never becomes a drug lord.”

This is the outcome, and it just killed me: 

**Breaking Bad: The Sitcom**  
**Title**: *Breaking Good*  
**Genre**: Sitcom  
**Premise**: In this alternate universe, Walter White never gets cancer. Instead of turning to a life of crime, he focuses on his regular life as a high school chemistry teacher, trying to balance the everyday chaos of family life, a quirky school staff, and hilarious misunderstandings. Jesse Pinkman is still a former student who can’t quite figure out his own path, but rather than cooking meth, he's more interested in starting his own weird businesses. Hank Schrader is the loud but lovable brother-in-law who’s more of a nosy neighbor than a DEA agent with serious pursuits.

---

### **Main Cast**

- **Walter White**: A well-meaning, nerdy high school chemistry teacher with a knack for solving problems in over-the-top ways.
- **Skyler White**: A sharp-witted wife trying to manage the family finances and stay sane while dealing with Walter’s schemes and their son’s teen years.
- **Jesse Pinkman**: Walter's goofy, former student and neighbor, always full of terrible ideas for get-rich-quick schemes that never work.
- **Hank Schrader**: The boisterous, nosy brother-in-law who lives next door. Hank is constantly barging in, offering terrible advice, and generally making a mess of things.
- **Marie Schrader**: Skyler's sister, a well-meaning kleptomaniac who's always involved in everyone's business.
- **Saul Goodman**: A local attorney who has somehow become Walter's best friend. He's always coming up with ridiculous legal loopholes for even the most mundane issues.
- **Gus Fring**: Owner of the neighborhood Los Pollos Hermanos franchise, a respected businessman who’s a little too perfect. Walter can't help but suspect there's something ""off"" about him, though it’s just his extreme neatness.

---

### **Episode 1: ""Science Fair Fiasco""**

**Plot**:  
Walter is tasked with helping organize the high school science fair, and he's determined to make it the best in the state. He ropes Jesse into helping, convincing him to set up a harmless, over-the-top chemistry demonstration that *totally* won't explode. Meanwhile, Hank is determined to be the judge of the fair and uses his ""detective skills"" to figure out which kid might be ""cheating.""

**A Plot**:  
Walter and Jesse create a simple baking soda volcano, but Jesse, ever eager to impress, decides to add “a little something extra.” Hilarity ensues when the volcano erupts all over the gymnasium, causing the fire alarm to go off. The school's principal, Carmen Molina, is not amused and demands that Walter ""stop bringing his weird inventions"" to school events.

**B Plot**:  
Skyler is trying to plan a family vacation, but Marie keeps hijacking the plans with suggestions for destinations that are either way out of budget or entirely inappropriate (like a luxury cruise to Alaska). Hank, meanwhile, is sure that one of the kids at the science fair is running ""some kind of scam"" because their project is just too advanced for a high schooler. His “investigation” involves knocking over multiple projects and getting into a debate with a 14-year-old about magnets.

**Key Moments**:  
- Walter’s frustration builds as Jesse continually adds unnecessary elements to the project, including food coloring, Mentos, and even Pop Rocks.
- Hank dramatically sneaking around the science fair with a fake mustache, pretending to be undercover.
- The fire alarm scene, where Walter and Jesse frantically try to stop the ever-growing foam volcano, while Hank accidentally sets off another project—a homemade rocket that flies straight into Principal Molina’s office.
- Skyler finally snapping and announcing that the family vacation will be a camping trip, much to everyone’s horror.

**End Scene**:  
After the chaos dies down, Walter is banned from organizing future science fairs, but Jesse, ever the optimist, tells him, ""Yo, Mr. White, next year, I’ve got this idea for a *laser show*."" Walter just sighs and says, ""Let’s never do this again."" Hank, standing by with his clipboard, proudly declares that he’s figured out which kid was cheating, but it turns out he’s been ""investigating"" a teacher’s demonstration the entire time.

---

### **Episode 2: ""Neighbor Wars""**

**Plot**:  
Walter and Hank get into a neighborly feud when Hank builds a giant BBQ smoker in his backyard, which blows smoke into Walter’s house. Meanwhile, Jesse tries to start a dog-walking business, but his lack of basic canine skills creates chaos in the neighborhood.

**A Plot**:  
Hank's new BBQ obsession leads to all-day smoking sessions in his backyard. Walter, tired of his house smelling like brisket, tries to politely ask Hank to move the smoker, but Hank refuses. What starts as a simple disagreement escalates into an all-out prank war, with Walter using chemistry to get back at Hank. Walter fills Hank’s smoker with a harmless but highly pungent sulfur compound, causing Hank to believe he's ruined the entire BBQ.

**B Plot**:  
Jesse, trying to make quick cash, starts a dog-walking service but underestimates how hard it is to control a pack of dogs. At one point, he loses control of seven dogs, and they run rampant through the neighborhood, eventually ending up in Walter’s yard, trampling Skyler’s flower beds.

**Key Moments**:  
- Walter secretly tweaking Hank’s BBQ recipes, resulting in a chili that’s so spicy it sends Hank and his buddies running for the hose.
- Jesse walking the dogs and being dragged down the street like a cartoon character, yelling, ""Yo! Slow down!""
- Skyler, fed up with the petty feud, ends up taking the dogs away from Jesse, who sighs in relief and says, ""Thanks, Mrs. White, they were way more savage than I thought.""
- The BBQ climax where Hank and Walter attempt to one-up each other in a “BBQ-off,” but both are distracted by Jesse’s runaway dogs, who devour all the food.

**End Scene**:  
The episode ends with the Whites and the Schraders sitting together in the backyard, eating takeout from Los Pollos Hermanos while the dogs sit calmly nearby. Walter sighs and admits, ""Maybe we should leave the BBQing to professionals."" Hank, wiping sweat from his forehead, agrees, “But I still say my ribs would've won.""

---

### **Recurring Themes and Gags**  
- **Walter’s Over-the-Top Solutions**: Every time Walter tries to solve a minor problem (like unclogging a drain or organizing a school event), he overdoes it with some complex chemistry that ends up backfiring hilariously.
- **Jesse’s Failed Side Hustles**: Jesse is always coming up with new, terrible ideas for businesses, from dog-walking to organic smoothies to selling t-shirts with slogans like “Yeah, Science!” which no one ever buys.
- **Hank’s Over-the-Top Investigations**: Hank is always convinced there’s a criminal conspiracy afoot, even when the situation is completely mundane.
- **Marie’s Kleptomania**: Marie’s habit of stealing random, useless items leads to awkward but funny situations, like accidentally taking the neighbor’s garden gnome or sneaking silverware into her purse at family dinners.
- **Saul’s Wild Legal Advice**: Saul is always ready with some ridiculous legal loophole that’s both completely unnecessary and totally convoluted.

---

In *Breaking Good*, the stakes are low, the laughs are high, and no one’s life is ever in danger—except when Jesse gets involved with his next ridiculous idea."

**Honest feedback**

As a provider, it is great although be advised the pro will only provide 200 uses of advanced models over a month, so use the offer wisely or you'll run out in days. If you want unlimited access its about £12.50 (charged in dollars - $16.60 a month or (£149.39) £199.99 a year) - it's head office is in san Francisco.

1fpjf8i,11,2024-09-25,How is the liver larger than the small intestine?,u/optimisticseal,Anatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anatomy/comments/1fpjf8i/how_is_the_liver_larger_than_the_small_intestine/,"Anatomy teacher here. When looking up organ sizes online, the liver is frequently touted as the largest internal organ, 2nd to the skin overall. I've said this off-handedly to my students before as well. But when I looked into it, compared to the small intestine, it seems to actually be smaller. Google searches and even chatGPT will explain that while the small intestine is longer, the liver is ""larger."" But by mass, the liver is either the same size or smaller, at least according to the first few sources on Google. I figure this is because the small intestine is usually filled with non-human stuff i.e. food, and therefore that doesn't really count toward overall size? I mean, removing the non-human stuff, the liver is definitely much denser and more compact. I was wondering if there was anything I was missing in this comparison between the two?

  
PS - it's my understanding that muscles are also organs, so wouldn't the gluteus maximus also be larger than the liver? Less confident on that one though as I'd imagine the size varies much more plus it's kind of nitpicky lol"

1fpygu0,1,2024-09-26,Want Advice: School's enforcing A Strict Restroom policy,u/Ellie_T200x,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1fpygu0/want_advice_schools_enforcing_a_strict_restroom/,"The Head of Teaching and Learning started enforcing the rule of not allowing students to go to the restroom unless its urgent. Our school lasts from 7am-12:30pm (till 2:30 during extra classes). We have a 15min lunch break and a 5min lunch break. (also an extra \~30-40mins during extra classes as many students also pray during this additional break). Extra classes are prominently held for 10th-12th grades (depends on if the class is behind on the syllabus or not).  
I understand that the intention behind this rule is so that disruption during class is minimized, the students dont miss out on class, and to discourage bunking of classes. But isn't it counter intuitive as teachers now have to judge whether the student is having an emergency or not, students also may end up asking multiple times along with reasoning with the teacher to let them go, students may also be in too much discomfort to focus in class etc. There are also other ways to discourage bunking, such as teachers counting the number of students at the start of the class (The no. of present students is always written of the board).  
Because of the above reasons, i am planning to print a letter to the Head of teaching (Ill comment the draft of the letter, i ChatGPTed it). Is that the correct action to take or am i being too dramatic? I know tht this rule is being enforced on 9th-12th graders, im not sure about younger grades. What pushed me to raise this concern is tht today a student wanted to go to the loo but the tchr refused (even though the student said tht its urgent), this is probably because the management is currently hard on the tchrs, esp this particular tchr for reasons which i wont say in this post (unless asked in the comments) as it will become too long. I told the girl to go w/o permission since its urgent, she refused n still tried to reason with the tchr, after that the tchr let her go. There are many such students who wont go unless given permission as they respect the authority too much and I think this can lead to unfortunate circumstances. So am i doing the right thing or is there a better course of action i can take? Should i just suck it up n deal w/ it? Im not so sure tbh. Some tchrs let us go tho, but its the minoroty. For others, if we say tht its urgent they might let us go."
1fpz8rf,1,2024-09-26,Canadian entered US for my education user Visa Exemption; Want to get married to US citizen. Have some questions!,u/askingquestions-usca,immigration,https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/comments/1fpz8rf/canadian_entered_us_for_my_education_user_visa/,"Hello all! I am a Canadian citizen and I entered the US for my education without the need for a visa. I believe this is called the visa exemption program between US/CA.  Currently in the middle of my studies with 2 years left.   
  
I-20, SVEIS paid, everything good; I got my stamp in my passport and I have left the US to visit family for holidays and always came back. Last I traveled out of the US was in January of this year.

I proposed to my girlfriend who is a US Citizen (we met over a year ago), and we'd like to get married; been looking at adjustment of status so I could stay here in the US and finish up my education. We have the documents needed for it including: pictures, lease for our apartment, joint account, etc. She is going to fill out the petition once we clarify if this process is allowed.

--

I am having trouble finding if I can adjustment my status with the Canada/US visa exemption program. I see stuff about the Visa Waiver Program NOT being allowed to, but that is for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less which is ***not what I am under.*** Though, it does say this: These bars do not apply, however, to those seeking to adjust status as an immediate relative of a U.S. citizen or VAWA-based applicants.

--

When I asked ChatGPT (Sorry my searches weren't getting anywhere) this is what it said:  
Yes, as a Canadian student entering the U.S. under the visa exemption (using your I-20 and SEVIS), you can apply to adjust your status if you become eligible.

Where did it find this information? What documents do I need to show when we apply: the I-20 and SEVIS like I did when I entered the US? My stamp in my passport? Thank you so much!"

I told the girl to go w/o permission since its urgent, she refused n still tried to reason with the tchr, after that the tchr let her go. There are many such students who wont go unless given permission as they respect the authority too much and I think this can lead to unfortunate circumstances. So am i doing the right thing or is there a better course of action i can take? Should i just suck it up n deal w/ it? Im not so sure tbh. Some tchrs let us go tho, but its the minoroty. For others, if we say tht its urgent they might let us go. "

I think it got him to a tee, someone should make a comic out of this:  


**\*\*Title: Gojo Satoru Takes the MBTI Test\*\***

\*Setting: Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical College, in the teacher's lounge. Gojo Satoru lounges on a sofa, fiddling with his smartphone. Principal Yaga enters, carrying a stack of papers.\*



\*\*Principal Yaga:\*\* ""Gojo, I need you to complete this MBTI personality test. It's for a staff development program.""



\*\*Gojo:\*\* \*Glances up, lifting his blindfold slightly to peek over it.\* ""MBTI test? You think a questionnaire can capture all of \*this\*?"" \*Gestures flamboyantly to himself.\*



\*\*Principal Yaga:\*\* \*Sighs.\* ""Just fill it out. It's mandatory.""



\*\*Gojo:\*\* \*Grins.\* ""Alright, but only because you asked so nicely.""



\*He takes the test and starts reading the first question.\*



---



\*\*Question 1:\*\* \*""You enjoy vibrant social events with lots of people.""\*



\*\*Gojo:\*\* ""Well, I do love making an entrance."" \*Marks 'Strongly Agree.'\*



\*\*Question 2:\*\* \*""You often spend time exploring unrealistic yet intriguing ideas.""\*



\*\*Gojo:\*\* ""Unrealistic? For me, nothing's unrealistic."" \*Marks 'Agree.'\*



\*\*Question 3:\*\* \*""Your travel plans are usually well thought out.""\*



\*\*Gojo:\*\* ""Planning is for people who can't improvise."" \*Marks 'Disagree.'\*



\*He continues through the questions, occasionally chuckling to himself.\*



\*\*Question 10:\*\* \*""You are more inclined to follow your head than your heart.""\*



\*\*Gojo:\*\* ""Gotta admit, I'm a genius."" \*Marks 'Agree.'\*



\*\*Question 15:\*\* \*""You often consider how your actions might affect other people.""\*



\*\*Gojo:\*\* ""Well, I am responsible for my students... sometimes."" \*Marks 'Neutral.'\*



---



\*As he's halfway through, Nanami Kento walks in.\*



\*\*Nanami:\*\* ""What's that you're doing?""



\*\*Gojo:\*\* ""Oh, just some personality test. Apparently, they think they can figure me out.""



\*\*Nanami:\*\* ""Those tests can be quite insightful.""



\*\*Gojo:\*\* ""You sound like you've taken one.""



\*\*Nanami:\*\* ""I have. I'm an ISTJ.""



\*\*Gojo:\*\* ""Ha! Sounds about right."" \*Continues with the test.\*



---



\*\*Question 20:\*\* \*""You rarely feel insecure.""\*



\*\*Gojo:\*\* \*Smirks.\* ""Who, me? The strongest?"" \*Marks 'Strongly Agree.'\*



\*\*Question 25:\*\* \*""You enjoy participating in group activities.""\*



\*\*Gojo:\*\* ""If by participating, they mean showing off."" \*Marks 'Agree.'\*



\*\*Question 30:\*\* \*""You think the world would be a better place if people relied more on rationality and less on their feelings.""\*



\*\*Gojo:\*\* ""Well, a balance wouldn't hurt."" \*Marks 'Neutral.'\*



---



\*After completing the test, he hands it back to Principal Yaga.\*



\*\*Gojo:\*\* ""Done! So, when do I find out that I'm one-of-a-kind?""



\*\*Principal Yaga:\*\* ""We'll have the results by tomorrow.""



---



\*The next day, Gojo receives his results.\*



\*\*Gojo:\*\* \*Reading the paper.\* ""ENTP, the Debater. Fascinating. Says here I'm charismatic, energetic, and love intellectual challenges. Well, they're not wrong.""



\*He walks over to Nanami.\*



\*\*Gojo:\*\* ""Guess what? I'm an ENTP.""



\*\*Nanami:\*\* ""Not surprised. Suits you.""



\*\*Gojo:\*\* ""Maybe we should start a club. 'Personality Types and the Jujutsu Sorcerers.'""



\*\*Nanami:\*\* \*Adjusts his tie.\* ""I'd rather not.""



\*\*Gojo:\*\* \*Laughs.\* ""Ah, always so serious, Nanami!""



\*He tosses the paper onto the table and stretches.\*



\*\*Gojo:\*\* ""Well, that was fun. Now, time to see what trouble my students are getting into.""



\*He exits the lounge, humming to himself, leaving the test results fluttering in the breeze.\*"
1fq31is,1,2024-09-26,The fear of ChatGPT making students dumber is overblown.,u/seaneihm,TrueUnpopularOpinion,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1fq31is/the_fear_of_chatgpt_making_students_dumber_is/,"The use of technology to sidestep learning isn't anything new. For years now programs such as Wolfram Alpha and Symbolab, as well as online homework/test answerers such as Chegg, have always been readily available.

We know that these types of tools are here to stay, and there will always be students that choose the path of least resistance.

In the end, you're not bringing in a laptop to an Organic Chemistry exam, or for an in-class, handwritten essay. You won't be able to use ChatGPT on the SAT, LSAT, USMLE Step 1, or the bar exam. 

The smart, dedicated students will invest the work necessary to understand the material. The ones who don't will continue to fail, as has always been the case. 

At least now this homework-answering tool is equitable. Before, wealthy students would have used Chegg premium, gotten their college-educated parents to do homework for them, or hired graduate students to write essays."
1fq39ds,1,2024-09-26,Professor Catches Students Plagiarizing With AI,u/gptgabe,stealthgpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stealthgpt/comments/1fq39ds/professor_catches_students_plagiarizing_with_ai/,"Read: [https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/professor-catches-students-plagiarizing-with-ai](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/professor-catches-students-plagiarizing-with-ai)

In a situation so ironic and meta, it’s almost hard to believe, Megan Fritts, an assistant philosophy professor at the University of Arkansas, Little Rock, caught numerous students plagiarizing with AI on their first assignment for her Ethics and Technology class.

# AI Plagiarism in an Ethics and Technology Class

The assignment was simple: “Briefly introduce yourself and say what you're hoping to get out of this class”. The purpose of the assignment was two-fold: to learn about her students and to get them acquainted with Blackboard’s discussion board feature.

Having used ChatGPT to generate their essays, many of the students submitted similar outputs that instead of stating their desired expectations of the class, regurgitated descriptions of what an ethics and technology class is. Such personalized requests are often too complex for ChatGPT’s algorithm, so it comes as no surprise that Fritts was able to spot the watermarks of AI writing right away.

""When you're a professor, and you've read dozens and dozens of AI essays, you can just tell,"" Fritts responded when asked how she was able to detect the presence of AI.

The students, perpetuating their interest in understanding ethics and technology, did the right thing and immediately confessed to using AI to write their introductory essays.

""They all owned up to it, to their credit, but it was just really surprising to me that — what was supposed to be a kind of freebie in terms of assignments — even that they felt compelled to generate with an large language model.""

The casualness of students using AI to write an introductory essay speaks to two phenomenons: First, that students are using AI writing tools for school work at astounding rates.

Where it was reported that 86% of college students are using AI in their studies.

Second, that students don’t see the need to put effort into meaningless work. In the replies to Fritt’s now viral X post detailing her story, many of the replies argued that of course students would be using AI for assignments they deemed “busywork”, comparing the use of AI to write essays to using a calculator to solve math equations.

Fritts disputes this comparison, especially in the case of humanities assignments, which she feels are meant to shape people not dispense content.

""The goal is to create liberated minds — liberated people — and offloading the thinking onto a machine, by definition, doesn't achieve that,"" she said.

Although using the word “liberated” implies a political context or perhaps agenda, Fritts does touch upon the academic consensus that doing school work is essential to developing thinking ability. Whether by using generative AI or simply by harboring a technology addiction, our thinking ability from our decision making, critical thinking faculties, or even our attention spans, are compromised.

# Tech Solutions for Tech Problems

There are numerous instances of students facing severe consequences for using AI, but it's teachers who are suffering with the burden of finding new ways to make meaningful learning experiences that counteract AI usage.

Many are feeling helpless, with so many students using AI writing tools, whether undetectable or not, and with the outright [failure of AI detection tools](https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/teach/ai-detectors-dont-work/) to properly do their jobs, the future of academia seems dim to some.

Even Fritts herself acknowledges that the burden of curbing the AI plagiarism problem can’t be on the students. Instead, institutions are realizing there is no way out other than embracing AI in academia.

Higher Education institutions have been utilizing AI for a variety of tasks from AI detection software, to generative AI for curricula, syllabi, and homework.

Whatever faculties students don’t develop from doing old-fashioned school work, might be developed from learning AI literacy and applying the technology to complicated problems.

# The Future of AI in Academia

As detailed in this Forbes article [predicting AI trends in academia](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/08/29/three-predictions-for-how-ai-will-reshape-academia/), one should expect the institution to buckle against technological change by restructuring the way students take on their writing assignments. Many of these assignments will be done in class to curb AI cheating, from brainstorming to submission, students will write their essays in class.

Once the systems start implementing more customization and personalization, they will be able to shape learning experiences to each individual student in a classroom, so no student gets left behind.

# Should The Use of AI Tools be Considered Plagiarism?

Using AI-generated content isn’t traditional plagiarism. Plagiarism is the theft of someone else’s words or ideas without proper credit. Meanwhile, AI-generated text is always original. Catch students using artificial intelligence, they will be accused of academic dishonesty under the category of “AI plagiarism”.

So no, [using AI writing is not plagiarism](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/is-using-chatgpt-plagiarism-academic-dishonesty-in-dishonest-academia). You can go as far as calling these students cheaters, but that might not age well with the way things are going.

# AI Tools for Submission and Detection

Had Fritts’ students used undetectable AI writing tools, perhaps this story wouldn’t have ever been written. Unlike OpenAI’s ChatGPT or other AI chatbots, undetectable AI writing tools like StealthGPT don’t feature the watermarks of AI-generated text and instead replace them with a human writing style.

For instance, [StealthGPT bypasses AI detectors](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/bypassing-ai-detectors-stealthgpt) like Turnitin, GPTZero, [Originality.ai](http://Originality.ai), and more. These AI checkers usually have high false positive rates, like Turnitin which acknowledge a 4% false positive rate at the sentence level.

To understand why this happens so often, you need to understand what is an AI detector. An AI detector analyzes text for AI writing and that just means it tries to find word choice, sentence structure, and sentence length that are so simple and precise, they were probably written by an algorithm that optimizes for utility. It’s rather easy to find student writing that uses simple and precise language, which was the case when Stanford discovered [bias in AI detectors](https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/stanford-study-finds-ai-detection-tools-to-be-biased-against-international-students/#:~:text=Turnitin's%20tool%20was%20much%20more,by%20non%2Dnative%20English%20speakers.) against students that didn’t speak English as their first language."

I’ve been working with students on their academic research proposals, and crafting well-structured reports, tools, and frameworks can be a challenge. But ChatGPT has been my go-to for brainstorming, outlining, and even refining some of the most complex research designs. From expanding introductory chapters in Hindi to developing questionnaires for research objectives—ChatGPT has saved me so much time and mental bandwidth.

One example: I was working on a proposal titled ‘Language Across the Curriculum’ and needed tools that could differentiate between language and non-language subject teachers. I simply outlined the objectives to ChatGPT, and it gave me creative, well-thought-out suggestions for developing the right tools.

Have any of you used ChatGPT for academic or professional tasks? How has it helped you? Would love to hear your stories!"

I am a complete BEGINNER and have no applicable knowledge of stats, but am a medical student taking a research year. I've realized that having stats knowledge is SO immensely helpful. I got SPSS for free and am using it as I have no coding experience and feel that it would be hard to learn R.

It seems the norm in most medical literature/ abstracts is to do a univariate/variable analysis, then mutli analysis. ie if something is sig in the uni, then input it into the multi analysis.

Making my project vague, i want to see how drainage output after a surgery is related/ predicted by a bunch of variable (specimen excised weight, age, bmi, diabetes, etc)

After a bunch of youtubeing/ chatgpting I have done the following:

1.) Linear regression on all my variables with my total fluid output as my dependent (Method: enter)

2.) Linear regression on all my variables with my total fluid output as my dependent (Method: stepwise) (please don't hate, I feel like I see this all the time?? but on further googling, no one likes it)

3.) UNI analysis using linear regression with ONLY continuous variables, and t tests for categorical variables. Then taking the only sig items and putting it into another linear regression (Method: enter).

Obviously I'm getting different sig variables each time I do this. I've spent the WHOLE day on this, and I can't figure out what is right. Perhaps none of them is right?! I get that with my poor understanding of stats, I can't expect to get everything right in one day. But I want to have an inkling of doing the right things to get accurate numbers, and not just reporting on numbers I don't understand. Please help!!!!

I know this looks like a mess, so I thank you in advance!"

The following is a summary of my experience and some tips I wish I had when I started! 

  
(sorry in advanced for all the typos and grammatical errors, this is meant to be informal, had enough formal writing with this degree lol)

https://preview.redd.it/x47cnfqkh8rd1.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&s=58713b67175068176d32bfde46fc646f732a7471

I started on April 1st 2024 and finished on September 26th (tomorrow is my birthday! perfect timing)

I am 19 (about to be 20 tomorrow) and I took a gap year from high school to figure out what I wanted to do. I felt kind of behind so I knew if I was going to get a degree I wanted to get it as fast as possible. I do not work full time, I had a food service job where I worked weekends totaling 16 hours a week. I put in on average 40 hours or more per week. I definitely procrastinated a LOT. The first month I only got 4 classes done, I didn't think 6 months was a realistic goal because I always read about people doing it in 6 months with transfer credits or with work experience. But after that first month something clicked in me and I became dedicated to finishing in 6 months. 

I was somewhat good at school, I graduated #8 in my class, I didn't do the college courses and honor classes towards the end of the school year because I thought college was a scam (only a scam if they take all your money and it takes 4 years or more lol). I just say this because I feel like some of the things I learned in school helped me get through most of the general education classes really quick, especially the science class we had in this course. 

The mindset I had while I did these courses was that the general education isn't really that important. I would try to get those done as fast as possible. I wouldn't even read the material if possible. But on the actual accounting classes like Intermediate Accounting 1, 2, and 3 I actually read the through the whole book and watched all the videos. The only classes where I didn't read the material was Auditing D215 and Accounting Information Systems D217. I used the notes that were available in the resources and also watched the Edpsira videos for those. Those two classes were finished in 1 day. I remember auditing took me exactly 10 hours to complete. I am just saying this because there is a HUGE amount of people saying these courses are extremely difficult and I think its a bit over exaggerated. I wouldn't say they were easy but definitely not extremely hard. Just wanted to say this, because I was really unmotivated to get through them after reading everyone's experience. 

Also read about some people saying the Business Law class (D216) was hard, but for that one you just have to watch the cohorts and thats it. The lady explains everything so well. 

OOOOOOOOO another life hack. ChatGPT. No this is not cheating, only dumb people use ChatGPT to cheat. This was the thing that helped me SOOOOOOOO MUCH. Basically if I didn't get a question right on the unit tests or PA I would screenshot it and ask ChatGPT why I got it wrong. If I still didn't understand I would keep going back and forth with it until I comprehended the topic. Its like talking to a professional that knows everything, beware though... sometimes it did not give me the right information. I'd say around 90% of the time the information it told me was correct. It helps to somewhat know what your are learning and being able to reference it from the text book to catch on to these mistakes. But the errors weren't major. I would just tell it that the test said the correct answer was this other answer choice and then it would correct itself. 

Um also I've seen people posting about perplexity being better than ChatGPT and I'm not sure about that. But I think the issue is I don't know how to use it. I pay for ChatGPT ($20 a month) so thats what I used. But today ChatGPT was down and I needed to study for my final OA D105 so I decided to give it a try since all WGU students get one year of the pro version of perplexity for free. I did not like it at all, but like I said i probably do not know how to use it. I couldn't find where I could have a conversation with the AI, it kept on referencing the first thing I brought up all the time idk. But if it works for you, use it!

The Performance Assessments were VERY EASY all the time! Its not that deep honestly, I was always so confused when mine got evaluated and I passed. Sometimes I felt like I didn't do to good of a job and it was going to be returned back to me but I always passed somehow. I think that they literally only care about the things listed on the rubric, which duh very obvious but idk. Just know its not that hard dont stress out. Do everything on the Rubric and you'll be fine. This is how I used chatGPT, I could copy and paste my essay and rubric and tell it to evaluate my essay based on the rubric provided. So yeah another little life hack for y'all. Oh and I HATE Grammarly idk why I just have a beef with them. I use QuillBot Grammar check, way better in my opinion. They catch more things than Grammarly. 

I energy drinks and coffee were definitely my friends these last 6 months. I drank Celsius energy drinks, the little packets you can mix with water. Very low calories so thats good. It's cause sometimes I would feel like I was reading but it wasn't going in my brain for some reason, so I would just drink one of those and It helped. Also towards the last 2 months I bought this gum called Neuro Gum, claims to give you energy and it has L-Theanine which helps you focus if you mix it with caffeine? I dont know, sounds silly but even if it was just a placebo effect they definitely helped. I pretended to use them like a ""magic pill"" that would make me smart. 

But yeah thats all I could think about, just wanted to give some people advice I wish I would of had when I was first starting. I am not trying to brag, trust me.... I already did by posting about this on my Instagram story that 13 people saw so yeah lol. I'll try to answer a few questions if y'all have any. I plan on getting a job next month, already looking at a few things. Also starting my Masters Degree with WGU in November so yeah gonna be so much fun! Can't wait for the end of year pizza parties yum.

I just say this because I feel like some of the things I learned in school helped me get through most of the general education classes really quick, especially the science class we had in this course.

The mindset I had while I did these courses was that the general education isn't really that important. I would try to get those done as fast as possible. I wouldn't even read the material if possible. But on the actual accounting classes like Intermediate Accounting 1, 2, and 3 I actually read the through the whole book and watched all the videos. The only classes where I didn't read the material was Auditing D215 and Accounting Information Systems D217. I used the notes that were available in the resources and also watched the Edpsira videos for those. Those two classes were finished in 1 day. I remember auditing took me exactly 10 hours to complete. I am just saying this because there is a HUGE amount of people saying these courses are extremely difficult and I think its a bit over exaggerated. I wouldn't say they were easy but definitely not extremely hard. Just wanted to say this, because I was really unmotivated to get through them after reading everyone's experience.

Also read about some people saying the Business Law class (D216) was hard, but for that one you just have to watch the cohorts and thats it. The lady explains everything so well.

OOOOOOOOO another life hack. ChatGPT. No this is not cheating, only dumb people use ChatGPT to cheat. This was the thing that helped me SOOOOOOOO MUCH. Basically if I didn't get a question right on the unit tests or PA I would screenshot it and ask ChatGPT why I got it wrong. If I still didn't understand I would keep going back and forth with it until I comprehended the topic. Its like talking to a professional that knows everything, beware though... sometimes it did not give me the right information. I'd say around 90% of the time the information it told me was correct. It helps to somewhat know what your are learning and being able to reference it from the text book to catch on to these mistakes. But the errors weren't major. I would just tell it that the test said the correct answer was this other answer choice and then it would correct itself.

Um also I've seen people posting about perplexity being better than ChatGPT and I'm not sure about that. But I think the issue is I don't know how to use it. I pay for ChatGPT ($20 a month) so thats what I used. But today ChatGPT was down and I needed to study for my final OA D105 so I decided to give it a try since all WGU students get one year of the pro version of perplexity for free. I did not like it at all, but like I said i probably do not know how to use it. I couldn't find where I could have a conversation with the AI, it kept on referencing the first thing I brought up all the time idk. But if it works for you, use it!

The Performance Assessments were VERY EASY all the time! Its not that deep honestly, I was always so confused when mine got evaluated and I passed. Sometimes I felt like I didn't do to good of a job and it was going to be returned back to me but I always passed somehow. I think that they literally only care about the things listed on the rubric, which duh very obvious but idk. Just know its not that hard dont stress out. Do everything on the Rubric and you'll be fine. This is how I used chatGPT, I could copy and paste my essay and rubric and tell it to evaluate my essay based on the rubric provided. So yeah another little life hack for y'all. Oh and I HATE Grammarly idk why I just have a beef with them. I use QuillBot Grammar check, way better in my opinion. They catch more things than Grammarly.

I energy drinks and coffee were definitely my friends these last 6 months. I drank Celsius energy drinks, the little packets you can mix with water. Very low calories so thats good. It's cause sometimes I would feel like I was reading but it wasn't going in my brain for some reason, so I would just drink one of those and It helped. Also towards the last 2 months I bought this gum called Neuro Gum, claims to give you energy and it has L-Theanine which helps you focus if you mix it with caffeine? I dont know, sounds silly but even if it was just a placebo effect they definitely helped. I pretended to use them like a ""magic pill"" that would make me smart.

But yeah thats all I could think about, just wanted to give some people advice I wish I would of had when I was first starting. I am not trying to brag, trust me.... I already did by posting about this on my Instagram story that 13 people saw so yeah lol. I'll try to answer a few questions if y'all have any. I plan on getting a job next month, already looking at a few things. Also starting my Masters Degree with WGU in November so yeah gonna be so much fun! Can't wait for the end of year pizza parties yum."

Reddit's r/wallstreetbets is where financial advice goes to die, only to be resurrected as a meme. It’s a place where million-dollar losses are worn as badges of honor and where the phrase “due diligence” might as well be replaced with “YOLO.” The community runs on hopium and blind optimism, convinced that the next big gain is just one poorly researched option call away. It's a chaotic blend of day traders, meme lords, and that one guy who somehow thinks G***S*** (i have to censor it) is still going to the moon.

People in r/wallstreetbets treat the stock market like a casino, but with even worse odds. Their idea of investment strategy is picking a stock ticker because it sounds cool, and they'll dive headfirst into the riskiest trades imaginable because, apparently, losing 95% of your portfolio is just a ""learning experience."" Every post feels like watching someone drive their portfolio off a cliff, and the comments are like the crowd cheering them on. And yet, despite the constant financial wreckage, these degenerate traders will still confidently tell you to “buy the dip.”

The best part? Half of them are probably doing all this with their student loan money, thinking they’ll either pay it off or live in infamy on a screenshot of their account balance in the negative.

In summary: r/wallstreetbets is proof that the stock market might not need regulation—just a reality check."

If this is an obvious(ly dumb) question, I apologize, I was a lawyer before I became a teacher and I didn't go the traditional route.

I teach 8th grade history, and we're wrapping up our unit on pre-Revolutionary War America, specifically the tensions that rose between the colonists and the British over the various social, political and economic issues. A quick aside, I also call this unit ""Llama Llama Colonial Drama."" Anyway, their assessment will be a persuasive work where they have to convince the audience/reader to either join the Patriot or Loyalist cause.

1fqj6z1,1,2024-09-27,"Serious and unironic considerations of anime as an impactful and period defining art style, rather than a niche sexualized commercial product, primarily meant for entertainment...",u/deiki,ArtistLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/1fqj6z1/serious_and_unironic_considerations_of_anime_as/,"I know anime can be considered a controversial subject and can see that Rule #5 was clearly made to implicitly address this, but I hope this doesn't get removed since this goes a little deeper than just ""is anime art?"". Also I am not an artist; just someone who has hobbyist interest in history (also weeb software engineer xD).

Anyhow, would it be far-fetched to say that hypothetically, hundreds of years from now, future history textbooks could have anime an artistic movement that has had a great impact on the ""Information Age"" (i.e. our modern digital world), like how students today may learn about how Renaissance Art has greatly shaped the 15th-16th centuries? Curiously I just fed this question into ChatGPT o1 and here was the response it gave:

>It is not far-fetched to imagine that, hundreds of years from now, future history textbooks might recognize anime as a significant artistic movement that had a profound impact on the Information Age. Just as Renaissance art is studied today for its influence on the cultural and intellectual developments of the 15th and 16th centuries, anime could be viewed as a defining artistic and cultural force of our modern era. Here's why:

1fqk7nu,1,2024-09-27,"1st WEEK Of SALE! WOOHOO    (NO Ads, NO Organic & NO Scam )
",u/RaviPrakashKumawat,dropshipping,https://www.reddit.com/r/dropshipping/comments/1fqk7nu/1st_week_of_sale_woohoo_no_ads_no_organic_no_scam/,"https://preview.redd.it/tne1u2b5sbrd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e59fcbd622dc3986a11464eecc1bcf0ec7ad0c4

Hey everyone,



I’m a broke college student, and like many of you, I’ve been hustling to make something of myself. I’ve always had a passion for Data Analysis, Data Scraping, SEO, and White Hat Hacking, and I’ve also been inspired by the success stories of big e-commerce dropshippers. I wanted to jump into the world of e-commerce myself, but as a student, scraping together funds was HARD.



After months of working odd jobs and saving every penny, I finally managed to gather around $1,300. I poured all of it into Google Ads and Facebook Ads, hoping to get some sales for my dropshipping store. But here’s the kicker: after burning through every last dollar, I got ZERO sales. Not a single one.



Needless to say, I was crushed. But instead of giving up, I decided to tap into my skills in Data Scraping and White Hat Hacking to find a new approach.



### The Game-Changing Idea



I had an “aha” moment. What if I could collect successful dropshipping stores' customer information, like their emails? With that kind of data, I could target the very customers who are already buying similar products. So, I started scraping customer emails from top Shopify stores – all perfectly legal, by the way. There’s a gray area here, but nothing outright illegal.



### The Results: 63000 Emails!



Using my skills, I was able to collect a whopping 63000 customer emails from various competitors in the Shopify dropshipping space. This data is gold. Pure gold.



Once I had the emails, I didn’t stop there. I designed an extremely engaging email marketing campaign. I took advantage of top-performing email templates that I found for free on Twitter (pro tip: follow email marketers on Twitter, they drop gems!). With the help of ChatGPT, I personalized these templates to perfection.



### The Email Campaign That Changed Everything



Last week, I launched my first email marketing campaign using the customer emails I scraped. And guess what? The response was mind-blowing. I’m seeing a \*\*13% conversion rate\*\*, which is insanely high! 



For reference, many dropshipping businesses struggle to hit 1-2% with ads. But with email marketing, I’m converting 13% of the people I reach. My sales started pouring in, and in just a week, I’ve managed to generate \*\*$380 in sales in a single day\*\*, and now I’m averaging around \*\*$300 per day\*\* with \*\*40 orders\*\* daily.



### Why Data is the New Oil



Here’s the real lesson: \*\*Data is the new oil\*\*. Every new dropshipper is influenced by the big e-com gurus, and they all tell you to run ads. But ads are expensive, and if you’re just starting, burning dollars on ads with no return is devastating.



With the email data I’ve collected, I don’t need to rely on ads anymore. I can target these customers over and over again for new products, new stores, and even seasonal promotions. It’s a \*\*one-time investment\*\* that I can leverage multiple times.



### The Cost? Way Less Than Ads



I spent around \*\*$800\*\* to scrape this data and launch my email campaign. Some of you might think that’s high, but let me tell you – it’s \*\*NOT\*\*. This is a \*\*one-time cost\*\*, and I can continue to market to these customers for months, maybe even years, for \*\*free\*\*. Compare that to ad campaigns, where you’re paying every single time someone clicks (and sometimes doesn’t even convert).



### My Secret Sauce: Email Marketing is the Future



Email marketing is \*\*the most cost-effective\*\* method right now. It’s cheaper than your monthly coffee or fast food habit. For those of you spending hundreds on ads with little to no sales, this is your wake-up call. Data is everything, and email marketing is the tool to unlock that potential.



I’ve only just begun, and I’m already seeing incredible results. In the coming weeks, I’ll be scaling my campaigns and continuing to learn and optimize. I’m excited to see where this journey takes me.



### A Special Offer for You



I wanted to share my experience because I know how tough it is to make ends meet as a beginner. If you’re in the same boat I was, here’s your chance to learn from my mistakes and skip the struggle.



I’m also happy to share \*\*some of these emails\*\* with you. I have around \*\*63,000 customer emails\*\* from successful dropshipping stores, and I’m offering them at a ridiculously low price – probably less than your monthly fast food bill. 



If you’re interested, \*\*DM me\*\*, and we can talk about it. This data is \*\*real gold\*\*, and it’ll change the way you approach dropshipping forever.



\*\*TL;DR:\*\*

- I was a broke college student who lost $1,300 on ads with no sales.

- Using my skills in Data Scraping and White Hat Hacking, I collected 1 million customer emails from top Shopify competitors.

- I designed an engaging email marketing campaign and now have a 13% conversion rate, making $300/day.

- Data is the new oil – email marketing is the cheapest, most effective method for drop shippers.

- I’m offering 63,000 emails for a super-low price. DM me if interested.



Stay smart, save your money, and \*\*invest in data\*\*. It’s a game-changer.



Cheers to your success,

1fqqgpu,1,2024-09-27,"For those learning, here’s some tips. TL;DR at bottom",u/SafeRealistic9720,italianlearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/italianlearning/comments/1fqqgpu/for_those_learning_heres_some_tips_tldr_at_bottom/,"I started learning Italian just 19 days ago, knowing absolutely nothing. In that time, I’ve learned over 300 words, and while they may be beginner-level, they’re still progress! The journey so far has already taught me some invaluable lessons and tips that I believe can help others too.

Whether it’s speaking fluently, listening without struggle, or reading and writing effortlessly, I’ve learned that mastering Italian—or any language—requires more than just one resource. So, if you’re starting out, let this post be both a motivational boost and a reminder: You will NOT learn Italian from just one source.

I’m a natural-born student, so when I become passionate about something, I dive deep. Right now, I’m studying Italian for 1-3 hours a day, while most people average around 15-30 minutes. But me? I’m playing a different game.

Nineteen days ago, my girlfriend and I decided to learn Italian together. She speaks both Spanish and English, and I only speak English. We gave ourselves a goal of learning Italian within 2-3 years.

So, what’s the takeaway here? You need a clear, meaningful reason to learn Italian (or any language). Having a goal in mind makes the process smoother and far less discouraging when challenges arise.

My goal? I want to be conversational by June of next year. Right now, I’m at an A1 level, but based on my study habits, I’m aiming for B1-B2 by then. I may not be perfect, and maybe I won’t even get many opportunities to speak Italian when we visit Italy. But that’s okay—because even the possibility of falling short only motivates me to keep going.

Acceptance is key. You have to accept that things may not go as planned. I might reach B2 fluency before we go, only to find myself in situations where I can’t put my skills to the test. And guess what? That’s fine! Instead of letting it discourage me, it pushes me to learn more. I’ve already accepted that setbacks are part of the process, and I’m ready for them.

Once you’ve figured out why you’re learning Italian, and you’ve accepted that things might not always go smoothly, it’s time to focus on how to learn it—fast.

In my experience, and from talking to native Italians, here are some key tips for learning the language:

Apps: Duolingo and Babbel

	•	Duolingo: While Duolingo only covers up to A1 level, it’s a great tool for beginners. I know some people may not be able to afford subscriptions, but for learning the basics, it’s worth checking out. What’s worked best for me is using Duolingo to learn vocabulary, then practicing by creating my own sentences. I also use ChatGPT to have conversations and test my reading comprehension. For listening practice, I use ChatGPT’s voice feature, which mimics human conversation.
	•	Babbel: If you can afford it, I highly recommend Babbel. It takes you from A1 all the way to B2, and it even offers sessions with real tutors for advanced fluency. While Duolingo and other methods might work for some, Babbel offers a structured, all-encompassing learning experience. It’s one of the most efficient ways to improve both grammar and speaking skills.

Of course, I’m using a combination of all these methods—Duolingo, ChatGPT, Babbel, Discord, etc.—to cover all the bases.

Additional Tips:

	•	Watch Videos: Check out channels like “Easy Italian” or general Italian content.
	•	Netflix: Watch your favorite shows dubbed in Italian with English subtitles.

A word of caution: don’t try to translate every word. Focus on the meaning behind the words rather than their English equivalents. For me, associating words with images or actions helped me stop translating in my head and start understanding the language for what it is. For example, with the word “Stanco/Stanca” (tired), I think of a tired person—not the English translation.

In summary, learning Italian—or any language—takes commitment, a solid goal, and a willingness to accept that things may not always go as planned. But if you stay the course, I promise you’ll do amazing.

TL;DR:
Learning Italian requires dedication, multiple resources (like Duolingo and Babbel), and a clear goal. Accept that setbacks will happen, but use them as motivation. Practice listening, speaking, and associating words with actions, not just translations. With enough commitment, you’ll succeed!"

**Sir Christopher German, The Legend of AFAR**: If you are after a **much** deeper understanding of the concepts and theories behind the standards and a not-so-strong foundation in AFAR (as well as board top-notcher shortcuts) He is **best** known for his makeup classes usually before preboards.  
Sir German has a book for AFAR catered to both undergrad and reviewees sold in the bookstore in CPAR

**AUDIT (Gerardo Roque, Medina (only online))**

Take note: iba ang experience ang online and onsite here  
Online: If you want to have a clear illustration of solutions and concepts  
Onsite: If you are after a quick and efficient refresh in Audit (also very fast), as well as a better delivery of his jokes  
He has a reviewer book for both Audtheo and Audprobs sold in the bookstore in CPAR

**MS (Rodel Roque)**

Take note: iba rin ang experience ang online and onsite here  
Online: If you want to have a clear illustration of solutions and concepts  
Onsite: If you are after a quick and efficient refresh in MS, as well as some concepts in Algebra and Calculus for Math lovers out there na nascam sa BSA.  
He also has a review book but Idk where to find this since it is not sold in the bookstore

**TAX (De Vera, Llamado)**

First Priority: Onsite  
Second Priority: Online (Atty Jack for Concepts and Atty Llamado for Questionnaire; Similar to onsite but not quite)  
**Atty. Jack De Vera:** If you are after a quick and efficient refresh in Tax (also very fast), as well as a better delivery of his jokes and experience as a tax lawyer (which will **never** be in his online video lectures). He is also able to condense difficult-to-memorize concepts and passages in the tax code into illustrations made reviewee-friendly. He also has a tax book catered to reviewers sold in the bookstore.  
**Atty. Christopher Llamado:** If you are after a deeper understanding of the concepts and codal provisions behind the Tax Code and a not-so-strong foundation in Taxation. He also has lecture handouts discussed exclusively in his class. Pang-undergrad ang approach niya but he makes sure he discusses every nook and cranny that could pop up in the board exam, which is why he also holds makeup classes from time to time (with free food). He also has a tax book series catered to undergraduate students sold in the bookstore.

**RFBT (Atty. Dante Dela Cruz and Atty. Kenneth Dela Cruz)**

This is a special case since its delivery is unique compared to the other subjects

**Onsite (First Priority)**

Atty Dante: Emphasis in Traditional Laws, Summary Discussion in Special Laws  
Atty Kid: Emphasis in Special Laws, Suffient but condensed discussion in Traditional Laws  
This will also be applied in the preweek.

**Online (Alternate)**

Traditional laws by Atty Dante regularly released during the whole review session  
Special Laws video lectures by Atty. Kid released in the last five weeks of the review sessions

For more information, please refer to my reply to this post: 

    https://shorturl.at/55gvv

**Notes:**

Online Videos and Handouts: Given every week to avoid overwhelming the students  
Preboards: checked manually results are released after 3-5 days  
Preweek: Sabay sabay lahat ng classroom via connected speakers and no board discussions para patas. Solutions and answers are given in advance.  
Other notable facilities: Registrar, Bookstore, Library, Canteen, Study Hub, and Study tables available on ALL floors in the CPAR Building owned by the establishment.

**Recommendation:**

Attend both in their onsite to have the complete experience in CPAR and to receive the benefits of both reviewers (and both modes of deliveries in the case of Audit and MS since halos isa lang ang reviewer dun)  
If you are pressed with time, attend onsite for your weaknesses (and favorites) and go online for strengths  
If you only chose the online option, sapat na ang online video lectures ng CPAR.

**Final Note:**

Hindi totoo na comprehensive sa CPAR. The professors are either very efficient in their delivery (KDC, De Vera, Roque Brothers onsite, and Valix Brothers) or willing to go back to square one (Llamado, DDC, German, Santos, Roque Brothers online) to make the students have a better understanding and preparation in the board exam.  
Inevitable talaga ang self-study in ANY review center so don't just rely on them solely for your board exam performance. But what matters most is that you pass the board exam through YOUR efforts and their guidance and motivation.

Hope this helps"
1fqrvvp,46,2024-09-27,Professor here. Need front-end UI advice/recommendations when running a local model (in production) for use in the classroom. More on the use case inside.,u/gigDriversResearch,LocalLLaMA,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1fqrvvp/professor_here_need_frontend_ui/,"I teach analytics in a b-school. I have a LLM with RAG access to a textbook I've written for my course. I use the LLM as a virtual tutor so it can help answer questions at 2am when students are doing assignments that are due the next morning :). I also give assignments requiring them to leverage the LLM for data viz in R and Python. LLMs have enabled so much more in my classroom - as business students, they don't get programming training but this gives them an appreciation for what data science entails and prepares them to work with data scientists.

I've never required students to purchase a textbook (which is why I wrote my own) or any other course materials because it's rarely necessary. But for the first time, I went against that and made a genAI pro subscription part of the required course materials. The goal was to let students experience a frontier LLM and help them learn to think about how to leverage gen AI in their workflow.

Now, requiring extra purchases made me feel dirty, even though I felt it was justified. So, I'm going back to not requiring purchases which means I need to create my own front-end for students to access. Ideally it will have a similar UI as chatgpt or artifacts. The plan is to set up a domain and website so I can use it internally through university log-in info. I already have options for the back-end (e.g., HF inference endpoints or bedrock through my university's AWS relationship, but RAG is kinda pricey for me on AWS; a fine-tune is the next step and I have student assistants helping me generate a large dataset from my textbook to that end). I give assignments where they generate code so the solution needs to produce code in markdown. The other issue is it will need to go through my university's accessibility review for compliance.

What are the options for hosting a front-end with this? I prefer to adapt something rather than create it from scratch (although I'm not opposed to this). E.g., on my personal machine, I use [chatbot-ui](https://github.com/mckaywrigley/chatbot-ui) with ollama and API calls when I need a frontier model. I've considered adapting this since its open-source. Any other suggestions?

Tl;dr - recommendations for an open-source front-end UI that can be used in production and adapted for use in a university classroom?"
1fqsrlz,1,2024-09-27,AI Is a Language Microwave,u/fintech07,AIToolsTech,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIToolsTech/comments/1fqsrlz/ai_is_a_language_microwave/,"Nearly two years ago, I wrote that AI would kill the undergraduate essay. That reaction came in the immediate aftermath of ChatGPT, when the sudden appearance of its shocking capabilities seemed to present endless vistas of possibility—some liberating, some catastrophic.

Since then, the potential of generative AI has felt clear, although its practical applications in everyday life have remained somewhat nebulous. Academia remains at the forefront of this question: Everybody knows students are using AI. But how? Why? And to what effect? The answer to those questions will, at least to some extent, reveal the place that AI will find for itself in society at large.

There have been several rough approaches to investigate student use of ChatGPT, but they have been partial: polls, online surveys, and so on. There are inherent methodological limits to any study of students using ChatGPT: The technology is so flexible and subject to different cultural contexts that drawing any broadly applicable conclusions about it is challenging. But this past June, a group of Bangladeshi researchers published a paper exploring why students use ChatGPT, and it’s at least explicit about its limitations—and broader in its implications about the nature of AI usage in the world.

Of the many factors that the paper says drive students to use ChatGPT, three are especially compelling to me. Students use AI because it saves time; because ChatGPT produces content that is, for all intents and purposes, indistinguishable from the content they might produce themselves; and because of what the researchers call the “Cognitive Miserliness of the User.” (This is my new favorite phrase: It refers to people who just don’t want to take the time to think. I know many.)

The future, for professors, is starting to clarify: Do not give your students assignments that can be duplicated by AI. They will use a machine to perform the tasks that machines can perform. Why wouldn’t they? And it will be incredibly difficult, if not outright impossible, to determine whether the resulting work has been done by ChatGPT, certainly to the standard of a disciplinary committee. There is no reliable technology for establishing definitively whether a text is AI-generated.

But I don’t think that new reality means, at all, that the tasks of writing and teaching people how to write have come to an end. To explain my hope, which is less a hope for writing than an emerging sense of the limits of artificial intelligence, I’d like to borrow an analogy that the Canadian poet Jason Guriel recently shared with me over whiskey: AI is the microwave of language.

It’s a spot-on description. Just like AI, the microwave began as a weird curiosity—an engineer in the 1940s noticed that a chocolate bar had melted while he stood next to a cavity magnetron tube. Then, after an extended period of development, it was turned into a reliable cooking tool and promoted as the solution to all domestic drudgery. “Make the greatest cooking discovery since fire,” ads for the Radarange boasted in the 1970s. “A potato that might take an hour to bake in a conventional range takes four minutes under microwaves,” The New York Times reported in 1976. As microwaves entered American households, a series of unfounded microwave scares followed: claims that it removed the nutrition from food, that it caused cancer in users. Then the microwave entered ordinary life, just part of the background. If a home doesn’t have one now, it’s a choice.

There is also an organic process under way that will change the nature of writing and therefore the activity of teaching writing. The existence of AI will change what the world values in language. “The education system’s emphasis on [cumulative grade point average] over actual knowledge and understanding, combined with the lack of live monitoring, increases the likelihood of using ChatGPT,” the study on student use says. Rote linguistic tasks, even at the highest skill level, just won’t be as impressive as they once were. Once upon a time, it might have seemed notable if a student spelled onomatopoeia correctly in a paper; by the 2000s, it just meant they had access to spell-check. The same diminution is currently happening to the composition of an opening paragraph with a clear thesis statement."

I’m a developer who cares a lot about English education. I recently made a website that helps teachers create online tests using AI. My goal is to offer something new—detailed reports on how the class is doing and personalized reports for each student.

I know platforms like Quizlet and Kahoot are popular, but I feel they don’t do enough for language learning. AI tools like ChatGPT seem better at teaching English because they are ""language"" models, but most platforms don’t focus on ESL needs.

On my website, teachers can pick vocabulary or grammar topics, and the AI will make questions based on those choices. I’d really like to know your thoughts: What do you think Kahoot and Quizlet are missing for teaching ESL? What would be useful in your classroom?

Thanks for your feedback!"

Unfortunately, my own list quickly grew out of control. Here it is:

12th century

Hildegard of Bingen
Nun, later abbess, from Germany, who wrote choral music, mostly for religious purposes. She was also a mystic and writer. 
Essential album: https://open.spotify.com/album/5o5TClGeBw8wKsyvQqVqTr?si=Y1MJnZI4SEq0kfeHXkXqCw

15th century

Josquin des Prez
Josquin was a Franco-Flemish composer who combined medieval polyphonic music (multiple melodies playing at once) with a new expressivity, as opposed to the highly elaborate and complex style of the late medieval period. He was the greatest composer of the Renaissance. 
Essential album: https://open.spotify.com/album/27YnmK3ZL2lgmN5pUEDUUq?si=kXAVMLz_TDiUF8_vo4EBTg

16th century

Giovanni da Palestrina
Considered one of the greatest composers ever, Palestrina was an Italian composer of the late Renaissance. His music combines the expressivity of the Renaissance with a 'smoother' sound where the different voices meld together more and are less dissonant. 
Essential album: https://open.spotify.com/album/4psVkmIonrR72FJyEmpfqb?si=gjD-xPmKQemLmLd-oTF_qA

early 17th century

Claudio Monteverdi

late 19th century

Saariaho was a Finnish composer. She began composing with atonality, but later began composing music with rich textures and polyphony, informed by spectral analysis of the sound waves produced. Her music is not tonal but is constantly expressive.

Magnus Lindberg
Lindberg is a Finnish composer. His early works are harmonically advanced and use electronic music (music involving sound recordings or synthesisers), but as he developed he moved away from electronic music in favour of an eclectic style with inspiration from serialism and minimalism. His music is advanced, but in recent decades has become simpler and more accessible as he focused more on the harmony and colour of his music.

To investigate further, I would recommend the Guardian (https://www.theguardian.com/music), BBC Music Magazine (https://www.classical-music.com) and, if you want to investigate the albums of a composer you already know the name of, Classics Today (https://www.classicstoday.com/). Not to mention Wikipedia, which can be an info dump, as you discovered, but which can also be very helpful in highlighting particular works of interest. "

I’m a developer who cares a lot about English education. I recently made a website that helps teachers create online tests using AI. My goal is to offer something new—detailed reports on how the class is doing and personalized reports for each student.

I know platforms like Quizlet and Kahoot are popular, but I feel they don’t do enough for language learning. AI tools like ChatGPT seem better at teaching English because they are ""language"" models, but most platforms don’t focus on ESL needs.

On my website, teachers can pick vocabulary or grammar topics, and the AI will make questions based on those choices. I’d really like to know your thoughts: What do you think Kahoot and Quizlet are missing for teaching ESL? What would be useful in your classroom?

Thanks for your feedback!"
1fqvwos,1,2024-09-27,What’s Missing in Kahoot and Quizlet for EFL Teaching?,u/arbel03,TEFL,https://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/1fqvwos/whats_missing_in_kahoot_and_quizlet_for_efl/,"Hi EFL teachers,

I’m a developer who cares a lot about English education. I recently made a website that helps teachers create online tests using AI. My goal is to offer something new - AI-assisted detailed reports on how the class is doing and also personalized reports for each student.

I know platforms like Quizlet and Kahoot are popular, but I feel they don’t do enough for language learning. AI tools like ChatGPT seem better at teaching English because they are ""language"" models, but most platforms don’t focus on EFL needs.

Few more notable findings:

1. A teacher should always be in the loop - since ChatGPT is not 100% accurate

2. The AI should be adjusted to the level of your students - to avoid frustration, all instructions should use language that is suitable to the student, and in some cases instructions should even appear in the mother tongue of the student

3. The instructions of the AI should be provided by the teacher and should be hidden from the students - to avoid frustration

4. The online tests should be engaging and have a consistent theme. In order to engage younger students

On my website, teachers can pick vocabulary or grammar topics, and the AI will make questions based on those choices. I’d really like to know your thoughts: What do you think Kahoot and Quizlet are missing for teaching EFL? What would be useful in your classroom?

I would also love to hear especially about your assessments. How do you assess your students?

Thank you for your feedback!"

**Freelance, Contractor & Starting a Business FAQ**

*What's the difference between a freelancer, contractor, subcontractor and business owner?*

All are considered self-employed.

Freelancer aka Independent Contractor aka 1099: You do everything yourself

Subcontractor: A freelancer/independent contractor/1099 hires you

Contractor: W-2 Employee employed by a 3rd party agency that assigns work to them

Business owner aka Sole Proprietor: You do everything yourself + you have a registered LLC

*Can I just be a freelancer without starting a business?*

Yes. Registering an LLC will allow you to list your business on Google, hire employees, and be eligible for some grants/loans. This is good for when you expand and grow bigger, but initially, there's not much of a difference. You can lease commercial property without an LLC, it's just riskier and will be tied to your personal information (in the event of large debt and bankruptcy, for example) instead of the LLC's information. Accidents and injury may happen to clients and employees and you may be held liable. It's kinda like driving a car without insurance.

*How do I get clients?*

Ask around, provide business cards and make use of apps like Nextdoor, facebook, craigslist. There are also paid software and freelancers who do something called 'lead generation' which can help. Go to local events and join local discord servers. Ads are expensive, but having your business listed on Google isn't. For more information, scroll down and use

*Do I need a physical location for my business?*

It depends on the state. You can usually just use wherever you're living or a friend's/family's address. Some states may allow PO boxes.

*Do I need a lot of money to start a business?*

Not necessarily. It may be difficult if you're barely making ends meet, but you can start a business at a low cost.

*Can you give me an estimate of how much it would cost for me to start a business?*

It varies heavily on jurisdiction and what your business is. There are some states that will charge you $35 to file the LLC and some states have a minimum of $300 with additional $50 per employee which can quickly get up to thousands of dollars. I've seen registered agent services cost $50 and some cost hundreds.

Here's a quick overview of what costs you should consider:

* Initial startup cost (eg equipment, ingredients)
* Operating costs, fixed and variable (eg equipment/venue rental, gas for vehicle)
* LLC Filing Cost (look this up for your state)
* Annual report cost (again, by state)
* Business permits/licenses
* Annual franchise tax (tip: try to find free accounting societies that will help you go over your taxes)
* Business cards: \~$15-20 (tip: look for UPS or Staples)
* Car decals: \~$10-20 (tip: look for small, local businesses to avoid high delivery fees)

*How do I start a business?*

1. Make a list of everything you can do that people will want to pay you for
2. Narrow it down based on required initial costs (how much will equipment cost?), market needs (do a lot of people need this service or product?) and any ideas you may have about practicality
   1. Tip: Take advantage of free templates from HubSpot, SCORE and other websites
3. Pick a Registered Agent (some states require the Registered Agent to be a resident. You can name a friend or hire someone to do this)
4. Consult with free local resources like SCORE to get help with narrowing down your idea(s), forming a business plan, and generally getting started with the business
   1. Tip: SCORE provides 100% free business consulting/mentoring (virtual and in-person) and has many experts to help, including cybersecurity, lawyers, accountants. If you're hesitant or afraid, please put in a personal request for Jasmine Lester of SE Michigan and let her know that you came from Reddit. You can find her by going to [https://www.score.org/](https://www.score.org/) -> find a mentor -> search for a mentor -> search her name -> request mentor. She will be in charge of your case as long as you need her, and if there's anything she doesn't know, she can ask experts to join meetings while still being in charge of your case. You can let her know your situation freely; I vouch for her discretion. Otherwise, you can use the filters to find a mentor or type in your zip code in the home page to have them match you
5. Become familiar with sales, accounting and general business management.

You may have to pay more and register as a 'foreign LLC' if you choose to operate your business in a separate jurisdiction from where it's registered. However, this may be necessary to streamline the process if you run into documentation issues.
   2. Tip: LLC registration isn't as difficult as you think. The forms are generally very short and easy to fill out. If you have any questions, you can always consult SCORE or other local small business resources
7. Set up a free [Google Business Profile](https://www.google.com/intl/en_us/business/) to have your company listed on Google and Google Maps

**Remote Jobs FAQ**

*Do all remote jobs require technical experience?*  
No. While it's much easier to get a well-paying remote job as a technology expert, there are jobs open to sales, marketing, consultancy, accounting and entry-level tech - even in the tech sector.

*Is the tech sector the only one that hires remotely?*  
No. NEOM is hiring in the public sector and many social impact jobs/NGOs (think UN, World Bank) hire remotely as well. Accounting, taxes, consulting, social media marketing, art, graphic design are all popular sectors for remote jobs. Major, large companies that have global presence, startups that are just starting out and nonprofits often hire remotely as well.

*Do only small companies and startups offer remote jobs?*  
No. It seems that way because the remote-first business model is a very recent thing, so most companies who are fully remote are web-based startups. Please note though, if you are trying to apply to larger companies, it's very competitive.

*Is it legal?*

Short answer: It's legal if the company says they hire worldwide/from your country/region of origin.

Long answer: There is something called a 'Digital Nomad' law that many countries have or are developing. This allows you to work for companies based in the country you're legal to work in while residing in another country. The US has not developed a robust Digital Nomad law. Some companies have special contracts for international contractors (usually by having a partner company in another country) and international employees (usually eCommerce or SaaS). Many remote-first companies offer remote contracts with the intention of allowing you to travel and reside in other countries while working for them.

*How do I apply?*

1. Get a phone number from your country of origin, one that's either enabled for international calling or a VoIP
2. Use above resources to find companies that hire remotely
3. Apply with your country of origin

*Do you have any other tips?*

* Be wary of scams
* Be mindful of local laws in your country of origin
* Many startups offer 'President', 'Vice President' or other high-level positions. If the company is legit, the position is legit. As a startup grows, they need someone in charge of certain areas and most startup founders prefer to work with a partner (co-founder) than alone, even if you're not planning to invest. Ask about payment in advance and consider the terms carefully to see if it's a good option for you.

**AI FAQ**

*What is AI?*

AI, or artificial intelligence, is a type of technology that you can access through certain websites or apps to use as a tool. The type of AI that will probably help you most is called Generative AI or GenAI. This type of AI 'generates' information in response to a prompt. It can generate a resume for you, or a logo, or a response to an email, for example.

*What can I do with AI?*

You can use it to:

* Fine-tune your resume
* Create custom cover letters for each job
* Generate responses to long-form job application questions
* Helping you with your work like generating code, designing a logo, creating a business plan, suggesting ideas

Tip: do NOT rely only on AI to do your work for you. It will MOST LIKELY make obvious errors and may also make up facts/news reports/research findings that aren't real.

*How do I use AI?*

1. Go to [https://huggingface.co/chat/](https://huggingface.co/chat/)
2. Sign up for a free account (you can use it once or a few times without signing up, but you have to sign up in order to use it forever)
3. Enable all tools
4. Follow [this](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/fm-prompt-tips.html?context=wx) guide by IBM
5. Hit enter

*How does AI work?*

They are 'models' that are trained on historical data to try and create their own responses. Like how students read information from textbooks and learn from their teacher and create their own responses to questions in an exam.

*What's HuggingChat? How is it different from ChatGPT, Copilot and all the other AI things?*

Huggingface is 100% free and open source (meaning that the developers made it so that anyone can access the code it was made with and use it, modify it, etc). There is significant dev support and community support (meaning you can go on the website or on their discord server and ask questions or make suggestions).

Each AI model is also trained differently and using different data. That means that some are better at solving math problems, and some are better at generating images, for example.

Tip: If huggingchat doesn't give you the response you were expecting, here're a few things you can do:

1. Adjust your prompt
2. Give more information to your prompt
3. Use different AI models. Try Copilot for example, or search online for an AI software that's more specialized in the task you're asking the AI to do
4. Ask HuggingFace and/or use community models (advanced)

Tip: If you asked it a math problem and it spouted out code stuff instead of equations, it's probably using LaTeX. You can try to reload it or search online for a LaTeX converter.

**LinkedIn FAQ**

*What is LinkedIn?*

LinkedIn is a free online job board and professional networking site.

*Why should I use LinkedIn?*

LinkedIn can serve as a portfolio of sorts, for people who hire you to have a more comprehensive look at your skills and background. You can also message recruiters directly on LinkedIn, or set up services for people to hire you as an independent contractor through LinkedIn. Many people who hire freelancers use LinkedIn like a review site, and many remote-first companies use LinkedIn to verify your skills.

*How do I set up LinkedIn?*

The process to set up LinkedIn may take a while. Be prepared to commit more time and energy to it than other social media.

**Create an account**

Follow the prompts to fill in basic information. Those you aren't sure of, you can leave blank for now

**Profile Link**

* Use your name
* Shorten it appropriately if your name is very long. Think about what would be the easiest to remember and type.
* Ideally, keep this link the same throughout your entire career

**Banner image**

Go to Canva and select LinkedIn Banner, or search for LinkedIn Banner online. You can probably find plenty of generic photos that you can use. You can put an inspirational quote or your contact info on top of the image if you prefer. If you have vacation photos, you can use those too. Remember that the Banner photo will be blocked by Profile photo though.

**Profile photo**

If you have a professional headshot, use it. Otherwise, put on work clothes, stand against a white wall and either take a selfie or have someone take it for you. You can use portrait mode and filters to make it look better

**Headline**

Follow this format: Job Role/Title | Sector/Industry | Key Skills | Number of years' experience (or significant achievement including numbers/KPI/metics)

**About**

Use this section to write in anything that you think will be important or eye-catching but that doesn't fit anywhere else in your LinkedIn profile. For example: key achievements, skills, coding languages, your journey and how you got there, your passions/ambition/goal/dream

**Experience & Education**

First, fill out how you would with your resume. Make sure to include key metrics and deliverables. Select the company where possible so that an image will pop up. Then, add relevant skills to each experience. These skills will automatically go into the Skills section of your profile. You can add the same skill to multiple experiences/education. If you have work samples, add those too

When you're done with the basics, you can go to 'Add Profile Section' to add languages, personal projects, volunteer work, a featured section, awards, grades and more. If you don't have any Licenses & Certifications yet, scroll up in this post to find free certifications.

*How can I use LinkedIn to get jobs?*

* Follow companies and recruiters that you're interested in
* Message recruiters directly
* Comment directly on hiring posts by company recruiters
* Grow your network by making as many connections as you can, because on LinkedIn you can send connection requests to 'friends of friends' (meaning that if you're connected to the same person, you can send them a connection request; you can also do this if You -> A, A -> B -> C, You -> C)
* Follow job posters, recruiters and 'linkedinfluencers'.

# General life tips

* [Bank of America](https://about.bankofamerica.com/en/international-professional-bank-account) only requires foreign passport and proof of residency (eg rent bill) to open a bank account
* If you have no money, don't spend ANY money on food or clothes. Instead, look up food pantries and clothes closets online. You can usually find the closest ones on Google Maps or call 211 for help
* If the state or city you're in is too expensive, too racist, doesn't have enough homeless/undocumented resources, save up, bite the bullet and MOVE. It's better to spend a few days on the streets or a shelter than to set yourself up for long-term failure
* If you have NO credit score, can't get into rental apartments because of requirements, can't buy a house because can't get a loan, find a nice inn or extended stay hotel with a good landlord. Many extended stay hotels are very nice, some even have a separate bedroom and living room.
* If you have nowhere stable to live and also no car, but have a decent amount of upfront cash (or can get some) and a driver's license, consider buying a used van/box truck/RV. You can convert it quite nicely, and if it doesn't look like an RV, you can probably get away with parking it, moving it, parking it so you won't have to pay for RV parking.
* If you have a relatively stable income but finding it hard to get permanent housing due to your immigration status, consider rent-to-owns, foreclosure homes that you can reasonably save up for, or building. Land is more often much cheaper and/or owner-financed, which means you won't have to go to a bank. There are shed builders who will do rent-to-own, you just have to find one that ships to your location and will build the minimum size requirement for a house at your location. These rent-to-own sheds often take only 5-6 years to pay off, and don't require a credit check.

# Freelance, Contractor & Starting a Business FAQ

*What's the difference between a freelancer, contractor, subcontractor and business owner?*

All are considered self-employed.

Freelancer aka Independent Contractor aka 1099: You do everything yourself

Subcontractor: A freelancer/independent contractor/1099 hires you

Contractor: W-2 Employee employed by a 3rd party agency that assigns work to them

Business owner aka Sole Proprietor: You do everything yourself + you have a registered LLC

*Can I just be a freelancer without starting a business?*

Yes. Registering an LLC will allow you to list your business on Google, hire employees, and be eligible for some grants/loans. This is good for when you expand and grow bigger, but initially, there's not much of a difference. You can lease commercial property without an LLC, it's just riskier and will be tied to your personal information (in the event of large debt and bankruptcy, for example) instead of the LLC's information. Accidents and injury may happen to clients and employees and you may be held liable. It's kinda like driving a car without insurance. 

*How do I get clients?*

Ask around, provide business cards and make use of apps like Nextdoor, facebook, craigslist. There are also paid software and freelancers who do something called 'lead generation' which can help. Go to local events and join local discord servers. Ads are expensive, but having your business listed on Google isn't. For more information, scroll down and use 

*Do I need a physical location for my business?*

It depends on the state. You can usually just use wherever you're living or a friend's/family's address. Some states may allow PO boxes.

*Do I need a lot of money to start a business?*

Not necessarily. It may be difficult if you're barely making ends meet, but you can start a business at a low cost.

*Can you give me an estimate of how much it would cost for me to start a business?*

It varies heavily on jurisdiction and what your business is. There are some states that will charge you $35 to file the LLC and some states have a minimum of $300 with additional $50 per employee which can quickly get up to thousands of dollars. I've seen registered agent services cost $50 and some cost hundreds. 

Here's a quick overview of what costs you should consider:

* Initial startup cost (eg equipment, ingredients)
* Operating costs, fixed and variable (eg equipment/venue rental, gas for vehicle)
* LLC Filing Cost (look this up for your state)
* Annual report cost (again, by state)
* Business permits/licenses
* Annual franchise tax (tip: try to find free accounting societies that will help you go over your taxes)
* Business cards: \~$15-20 (tip: look for UPS or Staples)
* Car decals: \~$10-20 (tip: look for small, local businesses to avoid high delivery fees)

*How do I start a business?*

1. Make a list of everything you can do that people will want to pay you for
2. Narrow it down based on required initial costs (how much will equipment cost?), market needs (do a lot of people need this service or product?) and any ideas you may have about practicality
   1. Tip: Take advantage of free templates from HubSpot, SCORE and other websites
3. Pick a Registered Agent (some states require the Registered Agent to be a resident. You can name a friend or hire someone to do this)
4. Consult with free local resources like SCORE to get help with narrowing down your idea(s), forming a business plan, and generally getting started with the business
   1. Tip: SCORE provides 100% free business consulting/mentoring (virtual and in-person) and has many experts to help, including cybersecurity, lawyers, accountants. If you're hesitant or afraid, please put in a personal request for Jasmine Lester of SE Michigan and let her know that you came from Reddit. You can find her by going to [https://www.score.org/](https://www.score.org/) -> find a mentor -> search for a mentor -> search her name -> request mentor. She will be in charge of your case as long as you need her, and if there's anything she doesn't know, she can ask experts to join meetings while still being in charge of your case. You can let her know your situation freely; I vouch for her discretion. Otherwise, you can use the filters to find a mentor or type in your zip code in the home page to have them match you

* If you have NO credit score, can't get into rental apartments because of requirements, can't buy a house because can't get a loan, find a nice inn or extended stay hotel with a good landlord. Many extended stay hotels are very nice, some even have a separate bedroom and living room. 
* If you have nowhere stable to live and also no car, but have a decent amount of upfront cash (or can get some) and a driver's license, consider buying a used van/box truck/RV. You can convert it quite nicely, and if it doesn't look like an RV, you can probably get away with parking it, moving it, parking it so you won't have to pay for RV parking.
* If you have a relatively stable income but finding it hard to get permanent housing due to your immigration status, consider rent-to-owns, foreclosure homes that you can reasonably save up for, or building. Land is more often much cheaper and/or owner-financed, which means you won't have to go to a bank. There are shed builders who will do rent-to-own, you just have to find one that ships to your location and will build the minimum size requirement for a house at your location. These rent-to-own sheds often take only 5-6 years to pay off, and don't require a credit check. 
* Pro-bono can mean it's free, or it can mean it's low-cost. There are plenty of lawyers who will not ask for upfront payment, but you have to pay them if they win. This can be low-cost or standard cost.

1fr20tf,2,2024-09-27,Frozen Workspace with Notion AI? ,u/MartinRamsey04,Notion,https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1fr20tf/frozen_workspace_with_notion_ai/,"I've been using Notion for about 4 years now, and I use it mainly to take notes but there's lots of other reasons I've used it for over the years.
These are: 
-storage of school documents (I'm a medical student)
-managing projects
-second brain
-I have a 1 large database that I've used to track all my lectures, assignments, due dates and important family dates over the years (this is my largest database, content on it largely consists of pages from the past 2 years) 

I signed up for Notion AI on the back of the recent rebrand and 'update' as it seems to be a game changer specifically for my use cases. Given that I use Notion daily, I decided to give ChatGPT a break and try out Notion AI especially since I've used the special settings/considerations on ChatGPT to tailor it to act like a writing assistant for my notes on Notion, which I edit quickly as I import them onto the specific page. 

I've noticed since signing up that I can't ask Notion AI to give me complex answers on questions regarding my workspace because of the message displayed every time I've used it thus far 'I'm still learning your workspace'. However, the most basic of these is asking it what I have on my schedule (database mentioned above) on Monday next week; I tried the same with Wednesday next week. The answer I got basically told me that according to my calendar, September 2022 (lol) has nothing scheduled for that day. This informed me that at the time of the request being sent, the AI had only learnt as far as 2022 within 40 minutes of me subscribing.

Otherwise it handles other prompts fairly but also seemingly restricted to basic prompts because it struggles to be as responsive as it was exactly a year ago when Notion AI was first released and I tried it out after getting off the waitlist. I say this as my desktop app freezes and does a summersault everytime I try ask it to rewrite and edit a content light page. 

I don't know whether it's because it's still trying to finish learning the workspace or if this is generally how the AI works, which would be disappointing. I am quite happy using the free chatgpt version, but I'd love it if notion could be as versatile.
(I'm only trying Notion AI out for a month before I decide to be a regular subscriber) 

Has anyone else experienced any issues with Notion AI on 'almost' heavy workspaces.

TL;DR: I've been using Notion for 4 years as a medical student to track lectures, projects, and important dates. I recently subscribed to Notion AI after the rebrand, but it's been struggling with my large database, giving outdated or inaccurate responses, like showing events from 2022 instead of next week. It also freezes when I ask it to edit content-heavy pages. I’m unsure if it's still learning my workspace or if this is a limitation of Notion AI. Has anyone else had issues with Notion AI on large workspaces?
(generated by free ChatGPT haha)
PS: would have loved to generate a TL;DR using Notion AI. "
1fr2amh,1,2024-09-27,Does Caktus AI Work?,u/gptgabe,stealthgpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stealthgpt/comments/1fr2amh/does_caktus_ai_work/,"check here: [https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/does-caktus-ai-work](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/does-caktus-ai-work)

The world of undetectable AI is treacherous, with few software able to cut it against AI detection software that is always subject to updates and implemented by every relevant institution. You already know StealthGPT’s AI-generated content can beat these detectors, but once in a while, a new AI opponent enters the arena to see if they can take the throne.

Caktus AI offers an AI humanizer and AI writing tool it claims can bypass AI detectors. We’re going to be the enemy’s using AI detectors to see if Caktus’ AI tools really have the functionality they claim to have. Is Caktus AI the best AI? Does it generate AI text that can bypass AI content detectors and plagiarism checkers? All will be answered in this undetectable AI review.

# My Grading System

Both students and amateur food critics on Yelp will recognize my system. I offer a letter grade and star rating out of 4 stars which is the culmination of four categories which are writing ability, functionality, user-experience, and pricing.

# What is Caktus AI?

As a citizen of the American Southwest, I’m partial to cacti. So, if an artificial intelligence company is going to have one as its mascot, I’m gonna take their service for a spin. At first glance, Caktus is a tool to help you with school work. Whether it’s academic writing, math, or chemistry, Caktus AI has generative AI tools to help a student. Their AI essay writer, which they claim is the best in the world, is the tool in question today though.

They also have a bypass AI tool that only comes with a paid subscription, so I’m gonna bypass using it. If generated text with their basic tool doesn’t feel like high-quality human writing and can’t beat AI detection, it’s not worth diddly squat. An essay writing tool with the same AI watermarks as ChatGPT is useless if you can’t submit your essay.

# Comparing the Results of Our Essay Writers

Before we see if Caktus AI is functional enough to bypass AI detection, we need to inspect the actual writing it generates to see if it has any kind of readability or style. Here is the result of Caktus AI getting a prompt from me:

I waited and waited. Caktus took forever to analyze my prompt and generate an essay. So long I thought the software was bugged. So long that I had to restart it twice. So long that it was clear that they did not want me to use their free service at all.

They were gonna do everything in their power for me to buy a subscription to their software. I decided to let my computer sit, hoping if I came back much later, I’d have an essay. Make a note of the time:

I gave Caktus a prompt at 11:45 and by 12:19 Caktus AI was still ""analyzing"", giving me no option but to give Caktus a 0.

# The Final Grade: F, 0/4 stars

For the first time, one of the AI tools we tested simply didn’t work at all to generate text. Thus, Caktus gets an F in every category. I’m sure the poor functionality of their free-version exists simply to compel people to subscribe to their pro version, but if anything should discourage you from doing that, then a non-functioning tool should be it.

We couldn’t test Caktus’ essay against Turnitin, [Originality.ai](http://Originality.ai), GPTZero or any AI Detector. There was no research paper or citations to review, nothing. Caktus isn’t so much AI technology as it is a total croc.

If you want an AI algorithm you can trust, visit StealthGPT’s [pricing](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/pricing) page where you can subscribe for less, only $0.99 for the first month with a student email, or you can use our free version which will generate your essay in seconds, unlike Caktus AI.

# FAQ

# How to Bypass TurnitinAI Detection?

You will need undetectable AI to bypass TurnitinAI Detection. Turintin is currently integrated into most student submission portals like Canvas and Blackboard. However, StealthGPT has always been able to fly under Turnitin’s radar no matter how many times Turnitin updates.

We have numerous articles showing exactly [how to make your text undetectable](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/make-chatgpt-undetectable) enough to bypass Turnitin, give them a read then give StealthGPT a try yourself.

# Are AI Detectors 100% Accurate?

No detector is 100% accurate. In fact, Turnitin acknowledges that their software has a 4% false positive rate at the sentence level. With 86% of students having used AI, that amounts to a massive amount of false positives that make the prospect of using AI ineffective. That’s why MIT simply proclaimed that [AI detectors don’t work](https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/teach/ai-detectors-dont-work/).

# Why Do Teachers Trust AI Detectors?

Some do, most don’t. Trust isn’t exactly the word I would use in this context. Teachers don’t have any better tools to detect the presence of AI-generated content. They’re aware of the high rate of false positives and the nightmare that comes with a student fighting an accusation.

Still, academic institutions have no other way to ensure academic integrity stays intact. So, they use AI detection tools in spite of their problematic nature and even their [bias against international students](https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/stanford-study-finds-ai-detection-tools-to-be-biased-against-international-students/#:~:text=Turnitin's%20tool%20was%20much%20more,by%20non%2Dnative%20English%20speakers.)."

",u/RaviPrakashKumawat,dropshipping,https://www.reddit.com/r/dropshipping/comments/1fr2qx6/1st_week_of_sale_woohoo_no_ads_no_organic_no_scam/,"https://preview.redd.it/zf15r2b57grd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=93f7866e752bb60ea972d917112308841697541a

Hey everyone,

I’m a broke college student, and like many of you, I’ve been grinding to make things happen. I’ve always been interested in Data Analysis, Data Scraping, SEO, and White Hat Hacking. But like so many, I was also drawn to the success stories of big e-commerce dropshippers.

After working random jobs and saving everything I could, I managed to put together around $1,300 to kickstart my e-commerce dropshipping store. I invested all of it into Google Ads and Facebook Ads, hoping to see results. \*\*But here’s the harsh reality – I didn’t get a single sale\*\*.

I was devastated, but I didn’t give up. I decided to leverage my technical skills in a different way.

# The Technical Shift: Data Scraping and White Hat Hacking

Instead of focusing on paid ads, I realized that \*\*data\*\* is where the real value lies. Using my knowledge of data scraping and white hat hacking, I had a breakthrough idea: Why not collect the emails of successful competitors' customers? These people have already bought similar products, which makes them prime targets.

So, I started scraping emails from top-performing Shopify stores. This may sound tricky, but as long as you’re using data ethically and within legal boundaries, it’s a smart and strategic move.

# The Power of Data: 63000 Emails Collected

Over time, I managed to collect around \*\*63000 emails\*\* from competitors’ customers in the Shopify space. This data is incredibly valuable because these are people who are already interested in and purchasing products in my niche.

With this in hand, I pivoted to \*\*email marketing\*\*, which I quickly learned is a \*\*far more cost-effective strategy\*\* than burning through dollars on ads.

# Building the Perfect Email Campaign

To make sure I didn’t waste this opportunity, I designed a well-thought-out email campaign. I used high-performing email templates that I found for free from top marketers on Twitter, and with a little help from ChatGPT, I customized these templates to fit my brand perfectly.

The results were beyond my expectations.

# The Outcome: 13% Conversion Rate

I launched my email campaign last week, and the response has been incredible. I’m seeing a \*\*13% conversion rate\*\*, which is significantly higher than what most e-commerce businesses see with ads.

For context, many dropshipping businesses struggle with 1-2% conversion rates using paid ads. Email marketing, on the other hand, has been a game-changer for me.

In just a week, I’ve managed to pull in around \*\*$380 per day\*\*, and now I’m averaging \*\*40 orders daily\*\*, making roughly \*\*$300 a day\*\*. I’m just getting started and am already working on scaling this up further.

# Technical Takeaways: Why You Should Focus on Data

Here’s what I’ve learned:

* \*\*Data is the new oil.\*\* If you have access to valuable customer data, you can avoid the pitfalls of ad spending and target people directly with offers they’re more likely to buy.
* \*\*Email marketing\*\* is far more affordable than running ads. Once you invest in building your email list, you can re-target those same people over and over again with new products, offers, and updates.
* \*\*Conversion rates are higher\*\* because you’re speaking directly to people who have already shown buying intent. This is what makes email marketing a better bet for beginners than wasting cash on ads with little return.

# The Bigger Picture

This approach has opened my eyes to how underutilized email marketing is in the dropshipping space, especially for newcomers. It’s not just about burning money on ads but about \*\*being smart with data\*\*.

I’ve spent about \*\*$800\*\* to collect this data and run my email campaigns. While that might seem high to some, it’s nothing compared to what I would’ve spent on ads with little to no return. Plus, this data is reusable. I’ll be targeting these customers for future products, stores, and even seasonal promotions.

If you’re struggling to make sales or are burning through cash with ads, \*\*I highly recommend shifting your focus to data collection and email marketing\*\*. It’s a long-term investment with huge upside potential.

I’m happy to dive into more details if anyone’s interested in how I structured my email campaigns or where to find resources. Feel free to \*\*D\*M me\*\* if you’re curious about how I collected the data, designed the emails, or anything else related to data-driven marketing strategies.

Let’s be smart and save our hard-earned money by focusing on what really works: \*\*Data and email marketing\*\*.

\*\*TL;DR:\*\*

* As a broke college student, I burned $1,300 on ads with no sales.
* Using my data scraping and white hat hacking skills, I collected 1 million competitor emails.
* Designed an email marketing campaign and now see a 13% conversion rate, making $300/day.
* \*\*Data is the new oil\*\* – email marketing is cheaper, more effective, and scalable compared to ads.
* If you want to learn more, \*D\*M me. I’m happy to share tips and strategies.

1fr57g5,1,2024-09-27,PM Experience as an English teacher in Japan ,u/Disastrous_Tutor_387,pmp,https://www.reddit.com/r/pmp/comments/1fr57g5/pm_experience_as_an_english_teacher_in_japan/,"Hello I am working on my PMP exam experience and was hoping to get some advice from the community. I would like to use my experience on a project as an English teacher because it was a long project but I don’t know if it will be acceptable or not.

I used a ChatGPT for the format and made some changes but please let me know if you think it will be acceptable or if I should make some changes.

**Project Objective:**  
The project aimed to enhance the English proficiency and TOEIC scores of 20 employees within a Japanese company. The primary target was for each participant to achieve a TOEIC score of 500 or higher, thereby improving their overall business communication skills and contributing to the company’s global competitiveness.

**Outcome:**  
The program saw a significant improvement in the English proficiency of the participants. Half of the students met the TOEIC score target within the initial two-year period, while the remaining students required extended training. To ensure continuous progress, the project was extended to allow these individuals to reach their goal.

**My Role:**  
As the project lead, I was responsible for the successful planning, execution, and monitoring of the program.

**Responsibilities:**  
I initiated the project by securing the project charter approval from the sponsor and identifying key stakeholders within both the teaching organization and the company’s HR department. I worked with stakeholders to define the project scope, aligning it with the company’s objectives.

In collaboration with the project team, I developed and executed a comprehensive teaching plan. As the project progressed, I managed multiple change requests to extend both the project timeline and budget when some of the deliverables were not achieved within the initial timeframe. This involved presenting evidence to stakeholders and negotiating the additional resources needed to ensure success.

I played a key role in managing personnel, especially during periods of staff turnover. I trained new instructors, ensuring continuity and maintaining the quality of the program. I also facilitated regular communication with stakeholders to monitor progress, address concerns, and adjust teaching methods as needed.

**Deliverables:**  
The primary deliverable was improved TOEIC scores for all 20 employees, with half of the participants achieving scores above 500 within the original project timeline and the remainder continuing to work towards this benchmark after an extended project period.

Here are a few contemporaries or similar thinkers to Neville Goddard, all sharing spiritual or metaphysical teachings rooted in consciousness, thought, and the power of belief. Many of them emphasized concepts such as manifestation, the Law of Attraction, and metaphysical interpretations of scripture, much like Goddard:

1. Joseph Murphy (1898–1981)

Best known for his book The Power of Your Subconscious Mind (1963), Murphy focused on how one's thoughts can influence reality. Like Goddard, he believed that the subconscious mind holds immense power to shape life experiences.


2. Florence Scovel Shinn (1871–1940)

An influential New Thought teacher, Shinn's works, such as The Game of Life and How to Play It (1925), emphasize the power of spoken words and affirmations in manifesting desires.


3. Charles F. Haanel (1866–1949)

Author of The Master Key System (1912), Haanel’s book is a detailed exploration of mental focus, thought power, and manifestation. He was a major influence in the New Thought movement and an early proponent of the Law of Attraction.


4. Emmet Fox (1886–1951)

Known for The Sermon on the Mount (1934), Fox was a New Thought spiritual leader who emphasized the metaphysical interpretation of the Bible, much like Neville Goddard. He believed that one’s mind is the key to shaping reality.


5. William Walker Atkinson (1862–1932)

Atkinson wrote under several pseudonyms and authored Thought Vibration or the Law of Attraction in the Thought World (1906). He explored the power of thought and vibration, contributing to early Law of Attraction ideas.


6. Ernest Holmes (1887–1960)

Founder of the Religious Science movement and author of The Science of Mind (1926), Holmes taught that consciousness and belief systems shape reality, very much in line with Goddard’s teachings.


7. Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–1882)

Though not a contemporary, Emerson’s transcendentalist ideas greatly influenced New Thought and metaphysical thinking. His emphasis on self-reliance, intuition, and the inner spirit resonates with Goddard’s ideas of imagination and personal divinity.


These thinkers were part of the broader New Thought or metaphysical movements, sharing ideas about the power of the mind, spiritual interpretation of the Bible, and personal empowerment through belief and imagination.

Sure, here are 10 more thinkers who shared or influenced similar teachings to Neville Goddard:

8. Wallace D. Wattles (1860–1911)

Best known for his work The Science of Getting Rich (1910), Wattles emphasized creative visualization, thinking in a ""certain way,"" and aligning one's thoughts with abundance.


9. James Allen (1864–1912)

His famous book As a Man Thinketh (1903) laid out the core idea that ""you are what you think."" He taught that personal responsibility and positive thinking are the keys to shaping one’s life.


10. Prentice Mulford (1834–1891)

An early New Thought pioneer, Mulford wrote Thoughts Are Things (1889), exploring how one’s thoughts directly impact reality and focusing on the law of thought as the creative force in life.


11. Genevieve Behrend (1881–1960)

A student of Thomas Troward, Behrend wrote Your Invisible Power (1921). She taught the principles of visualization, affirmations, and mental discipline to manifest desires.


12. Thomas Troward (1847–1916)

An influential figure in the New Thought movement, Troward’s Edinburgh Lectures on Mental Science (1904) delved into the connection between the mind and reality, emphasizing that thought is the ultimate creative power.


13. Phineas Parkhurst Quimby (1802–1866)

Often considered the father of the New Thought movement, Quimby believed in the power of the mind to heal and transform, laying the foundation for later metaphysical thinkers like Goddard.


14. Annie Besant (1847–1933)

A prominent Theosophist, Besant explored spiritual awakening and self-transformation through consciousness. Her writings and lectures focused on the metaphysical aspects of reality and the power of the individual to shape their experience.


15. Myrtle Fillmore (1845–1931)

Co-founder of the Unity Church, Fillmore taught spiritual healing and the power of affirmative prayer. Her ideas were rooted in the belief that thoughts and prayers can manifest healing and abundance.


16. Henry Thomas Hamblin (1873–1958)

Hamblin was a British New Thought author who wrote The Power of Thought (1924). His teachings focused on spiritual growth and the creative power of thought to shape one’s circumstances.


17. Claude M. Bristol (1891–1951)

Author of The Magic of Believing (1948), Bristol emphasized the power of belief, visualization, and affirmations to manifest success. His works inspired many in the personal development and self-help movements.


18. Christian D. Larson (1874–1954)

A New Thought leader, Larson’s The Pathway of Roses (1910) and Your Forces and How to Use Them (1912) discussed the importance of positive thinking, affirmations, and the power of the mind in creating a fulfilling life.

Pick somewhere else in order to avoid wasting any time or money.
Here's why:


As was posted recently, aA has had yet another round of layoffs, completely decimating the career placement team. This is the beginning of their replacing their staff with AI.


Now on paper an AI instructed bootcamp model could theoretically work to fulfill it's purpose of teaching you to code. However, what reason are you even going to a bootcamp then? They'll be cutting down on instructors next and they already have the TA's spread too thin to where they're operating via tickets and messages now so you're getting minimal (if any) direct attention or assistance.


Next, there's the fact that if you're operating on an AI bootcamp model, do you really think you're going to outperform Claude or GPT when you can't possibly have a similar amount of GPUs or training data? Their new CEO had founded an AI tutoring company prior to starting at App Academy, but even if she's bringing proprietary technology from there, it won't be able operate to the degree of the free technology that's currently in rotation. (Excluding a lack of rate limits)


Finally, will students who are new to learning to code be able to use AI resources responsibly in order to chase comprehension rather than memorization? There's a completely real chance that they're just weakening their graduate pool in an already highly competitive market.


They have made countless questionable decisions and no longer have any goodwill left to burn through with recent graduates. I haven't even touched on the social implications of people learning that they're replacing staff with AI. I would be shocked if they make it through this market."

STEM/quant instructors, what are your policies on GenAI for coding classes?

I ask because at present I’m teaching on a writing-only social sciences class, but if my contract gets renewed next year I may be moved to teaching on the department’s econometrics classes and have more input to the syllabus. I figure it’s worth thinking about and being more informed when I talk to my senior colleagues. 

I’m strongly against GenAI for writing assignments as a plagiarism and mediocrity machine, but see fewer problems in code where one doesn’t need to cite in the same way. In practice, a number of my PhD colleagues used ChatGPT for one-off Python and bash coding jobs and it seems reasonable - that’s its real language after all. But on the other hand, I think part of the point of intro coding/quant classes is to get students to understand every step in their work and they won’t get that by typing in a prompt.

1frbcp9,1,2024-09-28,One Of The Best AI Detectors for Teachers 🔍 Our In-Depth GPTZero Review,u/m4ry-c0n7rary,WeReviewedIt,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeReviewedIt/comments/1frbcp9/one_of_the_best_ai_detectors_for_teachers_our/,"Thanks for reading our **GPTZero review**. These days, teachers and professionals often find themselves wondering: “Did a real human write this, or was it the work of ChatGPT’s digital brain?” The constant back-and-forth can drive anyone bonkers!

So tools like [GPTZero](https://ecowebdesign.co.uk/gptzero-official) position themselves as the AI content sheriff that promises to help you separate **AI-generated text** from good old-fashioned human effort. But is it really the **best AI detector for teachers** and how accurate can these tools really be? We took it for a test-run ...

# Product Overview

**Product Name:** GPTZero  
**Category:** AI Detection Tools  
**Overall Verdict:** 4.8/5

# Detailed Product Analysis

# How GPTZero Works

GPTZero doesn’t just stare blankly at your text—it actually gets to work using advanced **AI detection algorithms**.

It measures **perplexity** (fancy talk for how predictable the words are) and **burstiness** (whether it has that unique human touch of rambling sentences and random word choices). This combination makes it a pretty solid tool for **AI-generated text analysis**.

The **Deep Scan** feature is where GPTZero really comes into its own, giving you a colorful breakdown of which sentences are likely AI-generated.

It’s like a text highlighter with a brain! And for those of us swimming in essays, the **bulk document scanning** feature can handle multiple files at once, saving you from drowning in a sea of suspicious paragraphs.

# AI Writing Analysis

Let’s face it: writing styles differ wildly between humans and machines, and GPTZero does a solid job with **AI writing analysis**.

By detecting those [predictable word patterns](https://ecowebdesign.co.uk/gptzero-official) typical of AI, the tool can often identify which essays were quickly spun out by an algorithm and which ones had someone burning the midnight oil. Handy for **teachers**, right?

# Content Verification Tool

What’s cool is that GPTZero functions as an AI detector and as a **content verification tool**. It doesn’t just flag text—it verifies the originality of each section, providing that peace of mind whether you’re grading papers or reviewing content for your website.

It’s like having a digital lie detector, available at the click of your mouse.

# Personal Experience with GPTZero

In our test run, [GPTZero](https://ecowebdesign.co.uk/gptzero-official) worked like a charm on most documents. The **AI detection algorithms** were sharp, catching AI-generated text with ease.

However, it did mistakenly flag one particularly eloquent student’s work as AI-written (sorry, Jessica!). Aside from that, it was pretty spot-on, and we enjoyed the transparency of the sentence-by-sentence breakdown. 

The **Chrome extension** also made quick checks on web pages a breeze, though we did wish for more detailed probability scores right in the browser.

# Pricing Options

GPTZero has a **free version** that lets you test up to 5,000 characters, which is perfect for small assignments. If you need more, the **School Board Endorsed GPTZero Educator** (Essential) plan is available at $10/month, and for the big leagues, the **GPTZero Pro** plan at $23/month offers higher character limits and priority features. There’s also a middling Premium plan at $16/month and a **custom plan** for those with heavier workloads or enterprise needs.

",u/CartographerNo1972,civilengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/civilengineering/comments/1frgf56/help_please_tired_of_traditional_civil/,"Hi everyone, I need some help choosing a topic for my final year project in civil engineering. I’ve been exploring options in construction (buildings, bridges, concrete, etc.), but honestly, those topics don’t excite me as much. I’m looking for something outside the usual construction-focused projects, something innovative and more aligned with what interests me: a blend of IT and civil engineering.

I’m not an expert in IT, but I’m eager to learn. I’ve heard about tools like ArcGIS, but I’m a beginner and I’m willing to spend time mastering it since I have a year to work on this project. Ideally, I’d like to find a project that’s feasible for me as a civil engineering student, yet still innovative enough to stand out.

I want something applicable in Canada, where I’m studying, and something that could reignite my passion for civil engineering—since I’m honestly feeling a bit unsure if I’m in the right field. I don’t want to focus on traditional projects like building structures or transportation networks that many students might do. I want something unique, forward-thinking, that combines civil engineering with IT, but is still within my reach as someone without a strong IT background. I've asked ChatGPT a lot of questions, I’ve talked with it day and night, and while I did find some interesting ideas, I still feel like I haven’t found the perfect project yet. That’s why I’d love to hear your ideas and suggestions!

Do you have any suggestions or ideas that could help guide me toward the right direction? Maybe there’s a cool project out there that could combine the use of AI, smart infrastructure, or sustainable tech? Any guidance would be appreciated!

Thanks so much!"

That reaction came in the immediate aftermath of ChatGPT, when the sudden appearance of its shocking capabilities seemed to present endless vistas of possibility—some liberating, some catastrophic. [https://theatln.tc/vnCmf6FZ](https://theatln.tc/vnCmf6FZ) 

“Since then, the potential of generative AI has felt clear, although its practical applications in everyday life have remained somewhat nebulous. Academia remains at the forefront of this question: Everybody knows students are using AI. But how? Why? And to what effect? 

“… This past June, a group of Bangladeshi researchers published a paper exploring why students use ChatGPT, and …of the many factors that the paper says drive students to use ChatGPT, three are especially compelling to me. Students use AI because it saves time; because ChatGPT produces content that is, for all intents and purposes, indistinguishable from the content they might produce themselves; and because of what the researchers call the ‘Cognitive Miserliness of the User.’ (This is my new favorite phrase: It refers to people who just don’t want to take the time to think. I know many.)

“…The future, for professors, is starting to clarify: Do not give your students assignments that can be duplicated by AI. They will use a machine to perform the tasks that machines can perform. Why wouldn’t they? And it will be incredibly difficult, if not outright impossible, to determine whether the resulting work has been done by ChatGPT, certainly to the standard of a disciplinary committee. There is no reliable technology for establishing definitively whether a text is AI-generated.

“But I don’t think that new reality means, at all, that the tasks of writing and teaching people how to write have come to an end. To explain my hope, which is less a hope for writing than an emerging sense of the limits of artificial intelligence, I’d like to borrow an analogy that the Canadian poet Jason Guriel recently shared with me over whiskey: AI is the microwave of language.”

1frhqbs,2,2024-09-28,Some info from a (soon-to-be) DO in response to the Friday discussion,u/the--scribe,h3h3productions,https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/1frhqbs/some_info_from_a_soontobe_do_in_response_to_the/,"I’m a fourth-year DO student and I’ve been a fupa troopa, Hila Kleiner, and foot soldier since the Israel days. The podcast has really helped me through some stressful times over the last 4 years, but it was clear during the Friday episode that there are still people out there who aren't familiar with what a DO is and I can probably shine a better light on the field than ChatGPT or Wikipedia. So, long post incoming (TLDR at the bottom). No hate to anyone on the crew, just wanted to pass on some info. 

**What is a DO?** In the US, a DO is a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine. To sum it up, it is an MD with some added spice. It was started in the late 1800s and has since helped increase the number of physicians in the US, especially primary care doctors. We get extra training in neuroanatomy and the musculoskeletal system. Aside from that, our core curriculum is identical to any MD program and we are held to the same standards. We are supposed to be more holistic, but that’s just good medicine and I have been trained by plenty of MDs who practice holistic medicine. DOs can practice any medical or surgical specialty they receive residency training in and the MD/DO residencies are now merged. We also get training in osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM). 

**What is OMM?** To put it simply, it’s just an extra tool in our toolkit when treating patients. OMM incorporates aspects of other fields, such as massage therapy and physical therapy. A lot of it is stretching and moving/working muscles in ways to improve pain, function, and range of motion. We get extra practice in examining and diagnosing joint and muscle issues. We learn about recommendations for exercises, stretches, medications, and other therapies for MSK complaints. I’d recommend at least trying OMM if you’re experiencing back pain, sore joints, muscle aches, or headaches that haven't responded well to other treatments. Just like everything else, it’s about finding the right doc.

**Is there pseudoscience in OMM?** There is some dumb stuff we learn that doesn’t have good research backing it. But it is a very small part of our education and rarely put into practice. We mostly learn it now to answer questions on board exams, but the more ridiculous parts are falling out of favor even on the exams. Very few DOs, especially younger ones, are using it in their practice. However, there is research backing the benefits of OMM, especially with back pain.

**Do most DOs use OMM in their practice?** No, most do not. Most will still utilize the exam skills learned during OMM training unless they go into something like radiology or pathology.

**Are you the same as chiropractors?** NO! The only people I have heard go after chiropractors more than Ethan are DOs. “Cracking” is a part of OMM, but it is done in safer positions and mostly because patients think it feels good. The story I have been told is that chiropractors stole the cracking from early DOs but none of the actual medicine. Some people like getting their back/neck cracked, but we’re not going to tell people it’ll cure their diabetes. It might provide temporary relief so we can get patients doing other exercises and stretches that’ll help in the long term. Also, we won’t be cracking necks when someone is having a heart attack on an airplane… 

**Are DO schools easier to get into?** In general, probably, but they are still really hard to get into. Med school applications have been increasing and with interviews going virtual after COVID it has been harder to stand out. It’s a game and people from affluent backgrounds with more connections still have an advantage. There are other factors at play as well, like in-state advantages and legacy applications. People will get rejected from DO schools but get into an MD school and others will get rejected from ""lower-ranked"" MD schools and get accepted to “prestigious” MD schools. Where you end up often comes down to luck and being a good fit.

**Why might some people be a better fit for a DO school?** A lot of DO students are “nontraditional,” meaning they’re a bit older and come from a different field rather than straight from undergrad. For example, I was working on a farm a year before med school. Many great applicants will be rejected each year and might try for multiple cycles before getting an acceptance. Again, getting into med school is hard and getting into any school is an accomplishment because it never works out for many applicants. No one should feel bad about getting into a DO school.

**Are MDs more prestigious?** Historically, there has been a bias against DOs. There shouldn’t be and this has been improving. Any MD that would refer to themselves as being more prestigious is probably pretentious. Throughout my nonclinical and clinical years, I’ve been trained by both MDs and DOs and have learned just as much from each. A lot of us also take the same board exams as MD students in addition to our DO board exams and score well on them. I have seen a lot of great DOs and MDs, as well as a few bad DOs and MDs. The treatment you will receive is equivalent, regardless of the degree, and it will just come down to the individual physician you have. Many people have likely been treated by a DO without even realizing they weren’t seeing an MD. In the end, the letters after the name don’t matter. They’re both physicians. 

I hope this helped clear things up. Family. 

TLDR: DOs are physicians who receive nearly identical training to MDs. Today, the differences are minimal, and you are just as likely to receive excellent medical care from a DO as from an MD.

P.S. AB, you would’ve been a great DO or MD. FLOCKA!"

I hope to get a person's view on this. I am assuming it is allowed to ask as I read few posts in the sub asking the same.

**Writing task 2**

You should spend about **40 minutes** on this task.

In some countries university students live at home with their family while they study, whereas in other countries students attend university in another city.

Do you think the benefits of living away from home during university outweigh the disadvantages?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from own knowledge or experience.

You should write **at least 250 words.**

**Answer:**

*In many countries students live at home with their family while attending university, whereas students attend university in another city in other countries. The main advantage of being away from home is that it makes the students more responsible for their well-being and finances, but it also makes them vulnerable to the loneliness that comes along with living in a different city. In my opinion it is advantageous to live away from home while attending university.*

*The students become responsible for their food, laundry and ability to manage funds while living in a different city. It also helps them to manage time in a more efficient way because they have to do all the chores along with the university work which helps them to understand time management as an essential skill. A student living at home will never worry about the chores of the house, the preparation of food or doing their laundry.* 

*Living in a different city also helps students to realize the importance of living frugally and be aware of an emergency fund which will motivate them to have some savings from an early age. This is one of the most important skill to learn to live below their means and plan for an unforseen circumstance that will help them prepare for future. Although living alone in a different city sometimes tend to be lonely, it's also a great opportunity to learn to meet new people and establish relationships.* 

*Living in a different city for university certainly has it's disadvantages but advantages outweigh them easily. Since living in a different city can be rewarding and help students gain real life skills which may not be the case if students are living at home. The ability to form relationships with new people, ability to understand the nuances of simple finances in day-to-day life and managing chores along with the university course work certainly help students to become a better version of themselves.* 

**Writing task 1**

You should spend about **20 minutes** on this task.

The graph below shows the production levels of the main kinds of fuel in the UK between 1981 and 2000.

Summarize the formation by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.

You should write **at least 150 words.**

Answer:

*The graph depicts the production levels of major kinds of fuel for the period 1981 and 2000. It is evident that petroleum is the majorly produced fuel since 1981 and sees a constant increase in production until 1984. On the other hand the natural gas shows a stagnant production for most of the period.*

*It is important to note the decline in the production of coal after 1983 to 40 energy units which slightly grows to 60 energy unit in 1986 but rapidly declines after that till 2000. In contrast to the coal's prodution there is an increase in the prodution of natural gas after 1991 which grows at a significant rate every 5 years making it the 2nd most produced fuel in the UK in 2000.*

*Although the production of petroleum has it ups and downs, It is still the most produced fuel in UK over the whole period of 1981 to 2000. The production of petroleum is highest in 1999 and lowest in 1981. On the other hand the highest production of coal in 1981 and lowest in 2000. The natural gas production in lowest in 1981 and highest in 2000.*"

1frxrjt,1,2024-09-29,test,u/Nurzap,u_Nurzap,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Nurzap/comments/1frxrjt/test/,">**1.** What do DS majors learn?

In [lower division](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/dsus/academics/requirements-lower-division) courses, Data Science majors learn the basics of statistical analysis (Data 8), basics of Python and Java (CS 61A and 61B/61BL respectively), and linear algebra (Math 54). There is no lower-division statistics course necessary to transfer, but I would highly recommend one as it would make your life a lot easier in both lower and upper division. 

Upper division courses are a lot more flexible with you being able to pretty much create your own set of courses from a [large list](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/dsus/academics/requirements-upper-division). You have to take Data 100 which teaches you an industry standard Data Science library called Pandas and goes into more depth with statistical analysis with topics like linear regression, SQL, large language models (LLM), and clustering. Most students end up taking CS 170 which teaches you how to optimize and implement famous algorithms, dynamic and linear programming, and NP problems. Many Data Science students also take CS 189 which is an introductory course to machine learning. A common regret I've heard from graduates is that they didn't take enough statistics courses, so I would also look into some of those such as Stat 135 and 151a.

>**2.** Any course you take outside your major to specialize in an concentration/minor?

Finally, there are clusters (or [domain emphasis](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/dsus/academics/domain-emphasis)) which are courses outside of the immediate Data Science neighborhood that you can take. You are required to take 1 lower division and 2 upper division cluster courses. What you decide to specialize in depends on what you want your future to be like. The most common clusters I know about are math, business, and economics. 

>What tends to be the most challenging subject or course?

It depends on how good you are at programming. For some, CS 61A or 61B can be the most challenging because they are all about programming languages without any statistics. If you have no coding experience, 61A will probably be harder. If you have some, 61B might be harder. As for upper division, most students will find CS 189 to be the hardest if they take it. 

> **3.** Any good opportunities for current DS or related majors? How competitive are internships and can you even find a good internship?

Internships are always hard to find. Period. However, they are essential if you want to maximize your chances of employment as a fresh graduate. You can join clubs, go to career fairs, and just generally ask around. The worst someone can say is no.

>**4.** Let's say I enrolled in UCB and didn't get DS as my first choice, is it easy to transfer into DS

Depends if you are transferring or not. If you are a transfer student, it's either you get DS or you don't get into UC Berkeley at all. The [chances of being admitted as a DS major](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/about-us/information-center/transfers-major) is about 15%. If you are not transferring, you're looking at about half that. If you want to apply as a different major and then switch majors once you come here, it is not so easy anymore. Students admitted Fall 2024 and beyond have to go under a [comprehensive review](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/dsus/academics/declaring-major) in order to be considered for a major switch. Prior to Fall 2024, it was basically guaranteed as long as you met requirements, but now it is dependent on the demand of the major and will [no longer be guaranteed](https://ls.berkeley.edu/topics/hd-majors-comprehensive-review) or even a high chance in all likelihood. 

> What are the major transfer requirements?

Go on [assist.org](http://assist.org) and input your current college and UC Berkeley to see the transfer agreement they set up. It will tell you what classes you need to take before transferring. If you can't satisfy all requirements through one community college, you may need to attend multiple part-time.

>**5.** Any updates on Gateway construction? I'm looking forward to it's completion.

I am being plagued by a childhood memory of a horror/thriller movie, it's driving me nuts. I asked chatgpt and bing AI, to no avail. Maybe someone can help me.

I remember the following scenes: 

A female high school teacher or senior student in a biology class seeing frogs getting dissected and being disturbed by it. 

A flashback of said teacher remembering how as a kid she threw a bucket of mud (?) onto an  incoming motorbike with two occupants. It crashed, and the driver and the person behind him were impaled by wooden sticks on the roadside. It was on a lakeside, with frogs croaking in the background, which I think was part of a trauma incurred by the girl/teacher. 

A group of students breaking into the house of the teacher and abusing her.

I can't remember the rest, but I guess that, as is usual in such movies, the victim has a psychotic breakdown and murders her assailaints. 

It might be an italian B-movie, as I watched it on italian TV.

I'd be grateful for any help in finding out what movie this was, so I can finally stop puzzling!"

Me & my friend have been trying to build this app with 0 prior coding knowledge using thunkable. It's proving to become difficult and I think we probably waste a lot of time on thunkable with things that can be done much more easily with another language. We had 0 prior coding knowledge and in about 20 hours have learnt everything we know and achieved: 

- Set up firebase structure

- Set up google sign in

- User can choose username with checking database for uniqueness.

A lot of the way we learn is with chatgpt and it seems to not understand sometimes that thunkable has limited features, so we spend lots of time trying to find workarounds for the code GPT gives us. For example, something like querying firebase to fetch the users & organise them in descending order of XP seems pretty easy outside of thunkable? 

Given that we had absolutely 0 prior knowledge & have achieved this in thunkable, how quickly could we learn a coding language? & which should we use to create an app for ios & android?

is it worth it? or should we reach out to a developer (which we definitely can't afford right now)"

1fsjvpa,31,2024-09-29,Sensitivity Experiments,u/skdadleskodle,BallbustingStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/BallbustingStories/comments/1fsjvpa/sensitivity_experiments/,"Hey everyone!

In today’s story, an unlucky guy is asked to help his professor with a little experiment. It ends up being a bit more intense than he anticipated. It’s just a little one-off I threw together, so it’s fairly short.

There's a second, alternate version of this story is focused on pleasure instead of pain, and is the one with the happy ending.

**Note: This story was originally a furry one, but I edited it to humans, so some sentences don't flow quite as well.**



-----------------------------------

Gabriel flexed, testing the metal clamps that held him down to the table. They were far too strong, he’d sooner break his arms than free himself. The ones that held his legs down were the same. He was completely and utterly immobilized, a fact that was not helping his nervousness. He looked up at the woman that had put him in this predicament. “Hey uh, are you sure these are necessary?”

“I don’t know how strong your reaction will be. I don’t want to risk getting injured,” his professor waved his concern away. Wrapped in her lab coat, she paced back and forth, preparing to start her experiment. She pushed her messy hair aside as she walked to her keyboard. He watched her, having nothing else to do. Though her outfit was not exactly form fitting, the way she kept bending over to type was a nice sight. Anything that could calm his nerves even a little bit was welcome.

Gabriel had had a crush on her for months, ever since he’d first started taking her chemistry class. People had told him that she was a boring professor, but he didn’t have a choice. He needed these credits, and she was the only one that taught this particular course. The older woman was an odd character, to say the least. She was casual with her students, telling them to just call her by her name: Claudette. And, yet, she also always spoke like she viewed herself as above everyone, that their trivial lives didn’t matter to her. She was clearly extremely passionate with her work, yet from the way she talked, you’d have thought that she didn’t care about anything. Her science classes were boring, yes, but they were informative and easy. 

Still, as simple as the course was, Gabriel was on the verge of flunking. No matter how hard he studied, he was just barely passing. If he was going to get a good grade, he’d need extra credit.

To his relief, Professor Claudette was willing to give this to him. All he had to do in exchange was assist her with her work. For the most part, this just involved helping her in her lab, after class. She’s just make him carry test tubes around, or read off some gauges, or measure stuff. He didn’t understand half of what they were doing, so he tried to pass the time by attempting to make conversation. This usually went nowhere. She wasn’t really a people person, a fact she openly admitted. If he asked a question, she’d give a short, blunt answer, then return to her work. If he tried to talk about movies, or the news, or anything in between, she’d just shrug and say that she didn’t watch television. The only thing that could really get her to talk was asking about her work, which would inevitably send her into a multi-hour speech.

All that to say, she didn’t start the conversation very often. Which is why Gabriel had been so surprised when she randomly walked up to him this morning and asked to see his genitals.

It had taken a moment for him to respond to her completely normal request, unsure if he had heard her correctly. His professor repeated herself, motioning to his groin, “I need to examine your testicles.”

“W-what? Why?” Gabriel asked, taking a step back in disbelief.

Sighing, she stated that she needed his balls for an experiment. He began to ask what kind of experiment, but she refused to elaborate. Knowing about it beforehand could change the results, she explained. The data she was looking for all hinged on his “unbiased reactions.” He wasn’t really sure what this meant, but she eventually convinced him to pull down his pants. Promising that she’d give him an A for the whole course if he helped her today, she watched as he undid his belt and exposed himself.

Truth be told, Gabriel was not opposed to showing his cock and balls to her. He wanted to do much more with them, in fact. It was just that his fantasy had always been just that: a fantasy. Never would he have expected to actually have a shot with his professor. Would he have fucked her right there, right then, if she had asked? Yes, without hesitation. But she wasn’t asking for that, she was just requesting to see him naked. A logical first step, he realized, but he never thought he even make it this far. Curious, and a little hopeful, he pulled out his dick and nuts, hoping she wouldn’t be offended by his erection.

It seemed that she wasn’t, given the way that she immediately reached out to grab his sack, somewhat roughly. Rolling the orbs around, so that she could get a good look at them, she compared their sizes against each other. Though her expression was completely neutral, she seemed to approve, adjusting her glasses as she spoke, “Ah, these are good specimens. They’ll work just fine.”

It took every ounce of willpower for him to not cum in her hand. He couldn’t believe this was actually happening. Claudette might have been a good bit older than him, but half the reason he did so badly in class was because he just couldn’t keep his eyes off of her. Her cute little glasses, the way she smiled she got excited over her experiments, she was just so damn pretty. And now she was actually offering to give him an A if she got to touch his cock! He must have been dreaming, there was no way this was real.

Overwhelmed by the amazing view of her face right next to his dick, he didn’t realize she was talking until she repeated herself. “I said follow me. I’ve been preparing for this for weeks, so I don’t wish to wait any longer.”

And thus, Gabriel now found himself naked and strapped to a metal table. She was kinkier than he would’ve thought. He’d been tied down before, but not like this. The thought of what she was going to do to him was both exciting, and a little intimidating. Every time he tried to ask for an explanation, she just ignored him.

Finally, after a few good minutes of typing, she moved to stand beside him. Holding up a small voice recorder, she spoke into it, “G.S.R. testing log, September twenty-first. Subject: Male, twenty-two years old. Subject appears nervous, as evidenced by the way he’s looking around and avoiding eye contact.”

“You know I can hear you, right?”

“Subject has successfully maintained an erection for twelve minutes, with no physical contact. All recording systems are ready, beginning control test.” With this, Claudette began to reach for his crotch, only to stop and pause. She looked down as she considered something, before turning to look him in the eye. “Do you want to look at my breasts?”

“H-huh?” he stuttered, unable to help himself from looking at her chest.

“My breasts. Er, I believe people online call them ‘tits.’ According to my research, the sight of them makes males become aroused. Is this true for you?” She raised her hand to the top button of her coat as she said this.

Gabriel, trying not to sound too excited, said that he didn’t mind either way. Shrugging, the woman lowered her hand, keeping herself dressed.

“Damn it,” Gabriel cursed himself in his head. He’d only said that because he didn’t want to be rude and sound like a horny pervert. In truth, he wanted to see them so, so much. But surely asking her to undress now would make him seem like even more of a perv. Those breasts were the focus of most of his fantasies. When he jerked off, he’d always imagine his professor wrapping her tits around his cock, pumping until he painted them white. He wanted so desperately to know what they felt like, and now it looked like it would be a while longer until he got that privilege. “Fuck, way to blow your shot, idiot.”

Seemingly not realizing how disappointed her student was, Claudette slowly wrapped her fingers around his sack. She rubbed her thumbs along each ball, watching his face as she did so. Gabriel gave a small sigh, trying to thrust up into her touch. Satisfied at his reaction, she released her right hand, curling her index finger. With it, she gave his left nut a solid flick, right in the middle. He flinched, unsuccessfully attempting to close his legs as his eyes were torn from her boobs.

“Ow! What was that for?” Gabriel asked, trying to maintain his composure. She responded with another flick to his other ball. He cringed again, pushing against the clamps. “Hey! Cut it out! What are you doing?”

“Just relax, and please don’t hold back your reactions. If you can, please describe what you feel in as much detail as possible.”

“Well, it hurts when you do that, first off.” Gabriel said with a huff. She nodded, giving him another flick. With another deep sigh, he rested his head back. Her hand brushed against the bottom of his shaft, prompting a tiny thrust to guide her attention upward. How many times had he stroked himself, imagining that it was her hand instead of his? He hadn’t counted, but it must have been a few dozen times. Most likely, he’d cum the second she touched it, but at this point he didn’t really care.

Gabriel would never know how long he’d last, though, as all her attention was focused on his bollocks. Bouncing and rolling the two spheres in her hands, Claudette leaned in, until he could feel her breath his sack. The view was amazing. Was she going to suck on them? Fuck, her tongue would probably feel so good licking all over them.

As visions of her pleasuring him orally distracted him, Claudette got his nuts into position. Placing a thumb on one side of each nut, and fingers on the other, she looked up at him. Carefully, she put a tiny amount of pressure into them, massaging them in her hands.

“That feels better,” Gabriel said, relaxing from those earlier flicks. Ball play wasn’t usually something that interested him, but he didn’t mind. So long as she kept touching his junk, he’d go along with anything. 

Or so he thought.

“More detail, please,” his professor instructed.

“Um, I … I don’t know? It … it just feels good.” He shrugged, sneaking a glance at her chest.

“I really need you to be more specific than that.”

“It, uh, your hands feel nice when you caress my balls … or I guess I should say ‘testicles’ cause science. It’s just relaxing, I guess.”

“Mmm, I see. And if I squeezed harder?” asked Claudette, casually. Not waiting for an answer, she increased the pressure a tad.

Her student frowned, shivering slightly. “Ow, please don’t! They’re really sensitive, you know. You can’t just squeeze them like- GAAH!”

With a choked gasp, he violently jerked. The table shook as he tried to bend in the middle, but the clamps held him down. Between his legs, the woman had suddenly bore down on her test subjects, pinching them as hard as she could. Her sharp nails sank into the rubbery orbs, nearly meeting in the middle. This, by itself, would have been horrible enough, had she not also begun wiggling her thumbs.

“My apologies if my technique is not up to par,” Claudette spoke as she squeezed his tighter, “I’ve watched several tutorials online, but haven’t had a chance to practice before.”

Though wracked with pain, Gabriel tried his best to not make any noise. Maybe he wanted to impress her by acting tough, or maybe it just hurt too much for him to have time to react. He couldn’t tell. Either way, he closed his eyes and tried to ignore the waves of sharp pain radiating from his groin. This got harder with each passing second, he wasn’t sure how much longer he (or his balls) could take this. She suddenly let go for a moment, giving them a chance to re-inflate a bit. But this relief was short lived, as Claudette began to jab her thumb into his nuts from different angles. Top, sides, bottom, she looked for the spot that gave the most. His dick rapidly softened, pointing upwards.

As the boy opened his eyes, shocked that the pain could get worse, she cocked her head. “How does this feel?”

He could only manage a shaky, incoherent whimper. “GHHHH, h-h-huurts!”

His professor seemed disappointed at this simple answer. Abruptly releasing his balls, she readjusted her grip. Grabbing his sack by the base, she held them firmly in place, preventing them from squirming away. His legs tried to kick her away, but they were too weak to do anything.

Several seconds passed, finally giving him time to breathe. Thinking that she was finally done, Gabriel slumped back onto the table. He’d been hit in the nuts before, but this pain was far worse than any he’d endured before. No doubt he'd be walking funny for a week after this. That A seemed slightly less worth it now. Through clenched teeth, he began to ask his professor exactly what the hell she was testing. To his horror, just as he began to speak, she raised her fist in the air.

Thump!

Claudette’s knuckles smacked into his right nut. Trapped between her fist and other hand, it had no room to slide out of the way, taking the full force of the hit. A blast of pain ripped through him. Having already been softened up by her squeezing, his ball was fairly squishy, as evidenced by the indents her knuckles made in it. As his legs shook, she launched a second punch into the other ball. 

Thump!

Hips bucking, he didn’t care if his ragged groans were embarrassing or not. His limbs strained against the metal clamps, his back arching as much as it could.

“HHHURGGG!”

Thump!

Thump!

The agony doubled as she crushed his balls twice more. The older woman was stronger than he’d thought, there was some real power behind those blows. Her aim was also very accurate, hitting each nut dead center, to maximize the force. Each blow sent what felt like a shockwave through his nuts, as if they were about to crumble completely. On the fourth hit, his flaccid cock throbbed, oozing a tiny bit of cum out of the tip. Fascinated by this, Claudette’s flinched in surprise.

Between pained gasps, he yelled for her to stop. She obeyed, mercifully letting go and allowing his orange nuts to smack onto the metal table. Casually, she stood up and grabbed her recorder. “Hmm, you didn’t react as strongly as I expected. In the videos I watched, males tended to scream and flail around more.”

Gabriel wanted to point out that those men probably weren’t strapped down, but he was too busy trying to fight the pain to speak. He kept trying to reach down and cup himself, forgetting the clamps. All he could manage was to slightly bring his knees together, which did little to ease the ache.

“Which testicle hurts more, the left or right? Or are they the same?”

It took a while for him to respond. He hoped that answering would save his bollocks from further torment. “Ooh fuuuck … ghhh, t-the r-r-right one.”

“And which hurt more, squeezing or punching?”

Trying to calm down, Gabriel shook his head. “Hhrrgg, p-punch.”

Nodding, Claudette noted these answers into her recorder as she stepped away. “Control test results: Subject’s reaction was consistent with that of the typical male, but less intense. Subject claims that the pain is stronger in his right testicle, and that blunt force impacts felt worse than squeezing. Notably, subject also seemed to orgasm during the test.”

Gabriel said nothing. Waiting out the silence with several deep breaths, he watched as she grabbed a small flask, stirring it to make sure there were no bubbles. Placing it on a scale and checking the weight, she quickly typed something on her keyboard. Seemingly satisfied, she walked back to the table with it.

“Now then, let’s begin the experiment.”

His face dropped. He could at least talk now, albeit with lots of groaning, “That wasn’t it?”

There was going to be more? Oh boy, this just kept getting worse by the second.

“No, that was just a control test. I needed to see your reactions to regular pain first.” She placed her hand on his stretched out arm, leaning in until her tits were inches from his face. There was no way she wasn’t doing this on purpose, he thought.

“What does that mean?”

“Patience,” Clauduette repeated as she held up the flask to his mouth. She told him to drink it, which he did after some hesitation. The clear liquid had a strong, salty flavor. It tasted almost like, well, cum. With a grimace, he swallowed it down, and asked if it was some sort of pain reliever. Her face had no emotion as she spoke, “Of a sort.”

Before Gabriel could reply, a strange feeling seemed to wash over the boy’s body. His head began to swim as something stirred deep in his pelvis. A warm pressure, traveling through his insides. He shuddered as it slowly shifted downward, until it reached the base of his balls. With eyes wide in surprise, he watched as the feeling engulfed his genitals. Within seconds, his jewels felt like they were ballooning, until they felt nearly double in size. It was like the inside of his nuts were boiling, churning with pressure. He’d gotten some pretty bad blue-balls before, but this was way worse. Straining his neck to see, Gabriel half-expected his balls to explode from the pressure. Shockingly, the two spheres seemed perfectly fine, if a tad bigger than usual. The pressure kept building for a few more seconds, until, mercifully, it stopped. It took nearly a full minute for it to go away fully, but the pain hadn’t died down.

“What the hell was that? It still hurts.”

Claudette gently pushed his head back down, as she spoke into her recorder. “G.S.R. administered successfully. Testicles appeared to shift, and have moved to the bottom of the scrotum. Subject claims that the pain has neither worsened nor dissipated. Said subject seems disoriented, but otherwise alright. Beginning experiment proper.”

Gabriel was too focused on what just happened to hear anything she said. “It doesn’t feel any different … what was that stu- AAAAAH!”

Cutting him off, she lightly flicked his nut. He instantly flinched, his limbs straining against the clamps as he tried to bend at the waist. An explosion of pain erupted from his groin, more intense than anything he’d ever felt in his life. Claudette took a step back at his reaction, watching as his cock throbbed violently. Panting, his brain struggled to comprehend what just happened. Had she just punched him again? No, she couldn’t have, he saw that she didn’t. She hadn’t even really moved her hand. So why did it feel like she just slammed a sledgehammer into his crotch?

Before he could verbalize these questions, his professor flicked his other nut. Immediately, he gasped again, body shuddering. That tiny smack utterly assaulted him with white hot pain. His balls (already sensitive from their recent scrambling), were barely even being hit, and yet those earlier punches paled in comparison to how horrible this felt.

“Hmm, G.S.R. does not seem to be performing as anticipated,” Claudette said into the recorder. Unlike before, her tone was a lot more emotional and dejected. She was even fully frowning, a rare sight. “Subject is reacting much stronger to stimulation. Given the intensity of his spasming, it appears that the serum may actually be intensifying all pain. His pupils have dilated significantly, and he is breathing heavily. This prototype might be a failure, but I must run a few more tests to find out.”

Both his teeth and fists clenched as he took a deep breath. “What the fuck did you give me!?”

“I call it the ‘Genital Sensitivity Reducer,’” she answered, “It’s a prototype serum I created that changes the way your brain receives and interprets signals sent from your testicles. It is supposed to decrease the intensity of all sensations by roughly three orders of magnitude! Additionally, it increased the body’s maximum pain tolerance, preventing forced unconsciousness, among other effects. Unfortunately, it seems to be doing the opposite now.”

“W-w-what?” he asked, not catching a single word she said.

In a rare showing of emotion, Claudette rolled her eyes with a huff. “How do I put this in even more simple terms? It … it makes it hurt more when I touch your ‘balls,’ and makes them more resistant to … um, ‘popping.’ It is not supposed to do this, mind you, but science isn’t always successful on the first attempt.”

As she spoke, she stabbed her fingers back into his balls. Her technique was exactly the same as before, but his reaction were much, much more intense. Instead of soft groans, Gabriel full-on yelled. He pushed against the clamps, but they held him tight, leaving him unable to move. The metal table began to shake against the floor as he desperately bucked. Pressing and grinding each ball against the other, she cocked her head.

His eyes began to roll back as he yelled out. “AAAH! Stop! I c-can’t! Oh fuuuuck! Wait!”

“This is the first prototype formula I’ve gotten working,” she said, casually. She began with her thumb wiggles again. “I don’t believe in testing on myself, so you’re my first subject. The effects will wear off in a few hours, so I’m hoping to learn as much as I can before then. Maybe with enough data, I can fix whatever went wrong with the formula.”

Her student replied with a series of incoherent cries. He could barely even breathe at this point. His mind just couldn’t handle the horrific, mind-destroying levels of agony that was bathing his lower half. The worst pain of his life didn’t even come close to matching this. Every pinch was a shockwave of testicular ache. Every twist of her hands was an incomprehensible, hellish explosion. It was too much. He couldn’t take any more. He just couldn’t.

Despite his pleas, his professor didn’t slow down for a second. She continued to squeeze down, feeling his jewels quiver with every little movement of her hand. It had taken her nearly three years to get this serum working, she was going to make the most of it. That meant sinking her nails in deeper.

Gabriel was far past screaming now. The pain was overwhelming him so much that he could do nothing but mewl. He couldn’t hear what she was saying, his brain couldn’t handle any other signals right now. He couldn’t even look down anymore, he was so exhausted. As her fingers pressed his nuts into her palms, the pain would burn even hotter. The sensation was multiplied with every squeeze, building upon itself over and over and over again. His arms and legs were starting to give out, and he was soon reduced to just lying there as she worked over his nuts. He didn’t even know it was possible for something to feel this bad. It shouldn’t have been possible. How had he blacked out yet? The ache continued to grow as she crushed his balls into an ever shrinking space. The sudden realization that she might actually pop them hit him like a truck. Would she actually do that? Would she be that cruel?

As these thoughts raced through his mind, she suddenly let go. Though this should have been a relief, his eyes grew wide in terror. If she was doing the same thing she did last time, then that meant-

Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump!

As his vision went white, his body stiffened, fists clenching so hard his nails nearly stabbed through his palms. The agony reached its crescendo, a point far beyond what his body could handle. Each punch was worse than the one before, far worse. He didn’t know what it felt like to get popped, but somehow he knew that he’d have preferred that to those last four hits. This couldn’t even be described as pain, it was far beyond that. His body jerked so hard that Claudette actually let go and jumped back, afraid that he might tear the clamps off.

Instead, in a move that caught both of them off guard, his cock suddenly exploded. The biggest cumshot of his entire life erupted from the tip, his balls contracting hard. As his cock was aimed up at his face, it splattered across his chest. A last attempt by his balls to spread their seed before they were turned to mush, perhaps. Or maybe she had pounded them so out of shape his cum had nowhere else to go. In any case, the front half of his body was completely painted white by a fountain of jizz. 

Waiting until Gabriel’s dick finished oozing cum (as she didn’t want to get any on her), Claudette leaned in, watching his bollocks move around in the sack. They seemed to quiver away from her, as if they were scared of her touch. Looking for her recorder to note this, she found that his spasming had knocked it to the floor. Had he the strength to turn his head, he would’ve had a perfect view of her ass as she bent over to grab it.

The poor boy was barely even conscious now. His limbs were completely limp, eyes unfocused, tongue lolling out, and mouth slightly drooling. Mildly concerned, she quickly threw on a glove and placed her hand on his cum-soaked chest, feeling his heartbeat. No doubt he’d be unresponsive for a little while, the woman thought. She snapped her fingers in his face, watching for a response. With this same hand, she poked his right nut, prompting a shallow breath to escape his mouth.

Happy that he was still awake, she recorded her findings. “Test results: serum is, so far, a complete failure. Subject reacted so strongly that he nearly fainted, and his penis ejaculated as before … though it released far more than last time. I am unsure as to whether this serum also increases the rate at which semen is produced, or if this subject is displaying some form of unusual reflex to trauma. However, on a positive note: subject's testicles also seemed to be more 'elastic,’ for lack of a better term. I was able to push my fingers in significantly deeper than in the control test. This proves that the serum could work, given some minor changes to the formula. Additionally, given that the serum’s effects are focused on the testicles, let this be a reminder to perform tests on subject’s semen beforehand next time. Consistency, potency, etc.”

Gabriel couldn’t hear a word she said, he was too busy trying to recover from the mind-melting ache that had just wracked his body. He wouldn’t be able to form a coherent thought for a few more hours, at least. But, since his balls were still intact, his mental absence was admissible.

And so, Claudette climbed up onto the table, throwing her leg over him. Wasting no time, she casually placed her foot atop his left ball. The assault the two orbs had just endured had made them swell a bit, allowing her to place her foot comfortably on the other ball. His eyes twitched, struggling to look up at her as his nuts began to flatten out under her weight. Within seconds, little bubbles began to squish between her toes, amplifying the pain a thousand-fold.

Shifting her weight back and forth as she began to bounce, she spoke into the recorder, “Initial trial complete, beginning test two of fourteen.”"

In today’s story, a lucky guy is asked to help his professor with a little experiment. It ends up being a bit more intense than he anticipated. It’s just a little one-off I threw together, so it’s fairly short.

**This is an alternate version of my previous story. It is focused on pleasure, and does not contain any ballbusting. I know it doesn't fit the sub, but thought I'd still post it because it's directly tied to a bb story.**

---------------------------------------------

Gabriel flexed, testing the metal clamps that held him down to the table. They were far too strong, he’d sooner break his arms than free himself. The ones that held his legs down were the same. He was completely and utterly immobilized, a fact that was not helping his nervousness. He looked up at the woman that had put him in this predicament. “Hey uh, are you sure these are necessary?”

“I don’t know how strong your reaction will be. I don’t want to risk getting injured,” his professor waved his concern away. Wrapped in her lab coat, she paced back and forth, preparing to start her experiment. She pushed her messy hair aside as she walked to her keyboard. He watched her, having nothing else to do. Though her outfit was not exactly form fitting, the way she kept bending over to type was a nice sight. Anything that could calm his nerves even a little bit was welcome.

Gabriel had had a crush on her for months, ever since he’d first started taking her chemistry class. People had told him that she was a boring professor, but he didn’t have a choice. He needed these credits, and she was the only one that taught this particular course. The older woman was an odd character, to say the least. She was casual with her students, telling them to just call her by her name: Claudette. And, yet, she also always spoke like she viewed herself as above everyone, that their trivial lives didn’t matter to her. She was clearly extremely passionate with her work, yet from the way she talked, you’d have thought that she didn’t care about anything. Her science classes were boring, yes, but they were informative and easy. 

Still, as simple as the course was, Gabriel was on the verge of flunking. No matter how hard he studied, he was just barely passing. If he was going to get a good grade, he’d need extra credit.

To his relief, Professor Claudette was willing to give this to him. All he had to do in exchange was assist her with her work. For the most part, this just involved helping her in her lab, after class. She’s just make him carry test tubes around, or read off some gauges, or measure stuff. He didn’t understand half of what they were doing, so he tried to pass the time by attempting to make conversation. This usually went nowhere. She wasn’t really a people person, a fact she openly admitted. If he asked a question, she’d give a short, blunt answer, then return to her work. If he tried to talk about movies, or the news, or anything in between, she’d just shrug and say that she didn’t watch television. The only thing that could really get her to talk was asking about her work, which would inevitably send her into a multi-hour speech.

All that to say, she didn’t start the conversation very often. Which is why Gabriel had been so surprised when she randomly walked up to him this morning and asked to see his genitals.

It had taken a moment for him to respond to her completely normal request, unsure if he had heard her correctly. His professor repeated herself, motioning to his groin, “I need to examine your testicles.”

“W-what? Why?” Gabriel asked, taking a step back in disbelief.

Sighing, she stated that she needed his dick for an experiment. He began to ask what kind of experiment, but she refused to elaborate. Knowing about it beforehand could change the results, she explained. The data she was looking for all hinged on his “unbiased reactions.” The tiger wasn’t really sure what this meant, but she eventually convinced him to pull down his pants. Promising that she’d give him an A for the whole course if he helped her today, she watched as he undid his belt and exposed himself.

Truth be told, Gabriel was not opposed to showing his cock to her. He wanted to do much more with it, in fact. It was just that his fantasy had always been just that: a fantasy. Never would he have expected to actually have a shot with his professor. Would he have fucked her right there, right then, if she had asked? Yes, without hesitation. But she wasn’t asking for that, she was just requesting to see him naked. A logical first step, he realized, but he never thought he even make it this far. Curious, and a little hopeful, he pulled out his dick and balls, hoping she wouldn’t be offended by his erection.

It seemed that she wasn’t, given the way that she immediately reached out to grab it. Moving it from side to side, so that she could get a good look at it, she gave it a single stroke from base to tip. Though her expression was completely neutral, she seemed to approve, adjusting her glasses as she spoke, “Ah, a good specimen. This’ll work just fine.”

It took every ounce of willpower for him to not cum in her hand. He couldn’t believe this was actually happening. Claudette might have been a good bit older than him, but half the reason he did so badly in class was because he just couldn’t keep his eyes off of her. Her cute little glasses, the way she smiled she got excited over her experiments, she was just so damn pretty. And now she was actually offering to give him an A if she got to touch his cock! He must have been dreaming, there was no way this was real.



Overwhelmed by the amazing view of her face right next to his dick, he didn’t realize she was talking until she repeated herself. “I said follow me. I’ve been preparing for this for weeks, so I don’t wish to wait any longer.”

And thus, Gabriel now found himself naked and strapped to a metal table. She was kinkier than he would’ve thought. He’d been tied down before, but not like this. The thought of what she was going to do to him was both exciting, and a little intimidating. Every time he tried to ask for an explanation, she just ignored him.

Finally, after a few good minutes of typing, she moved to stand beside him. Holding up a small voice recorder, she spoke into it, “G.S.R. testing log, September twenty-first. Subject: Male, twenty-two years old. Subject appears nervous, as evidenced by the way he’s looking around and avoiding eye contact.”

“You know I can hear you, right?”

“Subject has successfully maintained an erection for twelve minutes, with no physical contact. All recording systems are ready, beginning control test.” With this, Claudette began to reach for his cock, only to stop and pause. Her tail curled as she considered something, turning to look him in the eye. “Do you want to look at my breasts?”

“H-huh?” he stuttered, unable to help himself from looking at her chest.

“My breasts. Er, I believe people online call them ‘tits.’ According to my research, the sight of them makes males become aroused. Is this true for you?”

Gabriel replied in the affirmative, trying not to sound too excited. Nodding, his professor unbuttoned her lab coat and placed it on the table. She was wearing pants, but nothing on her top half. His eyes widened as her boobs bounced slightly. They were even more perfect than he’d imagined. Oh, what he wouldn’t give to feel those tits wrapped around his cock right now. Those breasts were the focus of most of his fantasies. When he jerked off, he’d always imagine his professor wrapping her tits around his cock, pumping until he blew his load all over them. He wanted so desperately to know what they felt like. If he hadn’t been restrained, there was no way on Earth he would’ve been able to stop himself from grabbing them. His dick throbbed, leaking a bit of pre-cum, which she noted to her recorder.

Slightly grinning at the effect her chest was having on the horny male, she slowly wrapped her fingers around his length. She rubbed her thumb along the back of the head, watching his face as she did so. The boy gave a small sigh of pleasure, trying to thrust up into her touch. Satisfied at his reaction, her hand began pumping up and down in a somewhat mechanical fashion, as if she was unsure of what she was doing. 

Gabriel also didn’t seem to know what he was supposed to do. Would reacting be unprofessional? Did she want him to stay quiet? What about cumming, was that allowed? He asked her this, and she assured him it was fine.

“Just relax, and please don’t hold back your climax. I require your raw reactions. My apologies if my technique is not up to par,” Claudette spoke as she squeezed his shaft tighter, “I’ve watched several tutorials online, but haven’t had a chance to practice before. If there is anything you’d prefer I do, please let me know.”

“C-could you … twist your hand a little?” Gabriel said between breaths. She nodded, doing as he asked. With another deep sigh, he rested his head back, eyes locked to her tits. How many times had he stroked himself, imagining that it was her hand instead of his? He hadn’t counted, but it must have been a few dozen times. It was only a dry handjob, but that was more than enough for him.“Oh fuck, that feels amazing!”

“Could you describe the sensation in more detail, please? As thoroughly as you can?”

“Um, I … I don’t know? It … it just feels good.”

“I need you to be more specific than that.”

“Uh, the pleasure grows when you stroke up, and feels the best when you touch the tip, I guess.”

His professor seemed disappointed at his answer, but continued with her stroking. A huge smile formed on his face as he watched her hand pump up and down. Damn, he really needed this. After staying up multiple nights studying, it felt so good to just sit back and relax. Though she had only started a few minutes ago, it wasn’t long before his cock began throbbing harder, a change she noted. “Subject’s penis has begun to pulsate more frequently. Subject may be approaching orgasm.”

Indeed he was. Gabriel wanted to draw this out longer, but the older woman was just too hot. He tried to discreetly angle his hips toward her, hoping to paint her amazing tits white. She did say it was fine if it got on her, after all. Placing her other hand on his orange thigh, she leaned in, wanting to watch his cumshot. Hips bucking, he didn’t care if his ragged moans were embarrassing or not. His dream was actually about to come true! His limbs strained against the metal clamps, his back arching as much as it could. “I’m c-cumming! Claudette!”

She said nothing, continuing to pump as he blasted two ropes of seed across her left tit, and one across her right. Another, weaker shot hit her in the stomach, while a few more sprayed all over her hand, running down his shaft and balls. Each spurt was smaller than the last, but he still had a few more to go. She gasped out in surprise, watching as her student’s cock continued to drool cum for several more seconds. After one more small shot, his massive, content sigh signaled that he was done. The sight of her chest covered in his cum only added to his satisfaction. It was a view he’d never forget.

“That was … more than I expected,” said Claudette. Though she stopped pumping, she kept a firm grip on the base. Examining his softening length, she wiped a bit of cum off her tits, playing with it between her fingers. He briefly hoped that she would taste it, but alas, she just wiped it on his leg. “Is this a normal amount for you?”

Trying to calm down, Gabriel shook his head. “Uh, no … or kinda. I mean, not quite that much. I don’t know, I’ve never measured it.”

“Why not?”

“I’ve … never thought too?”

“Hmm, if I had a penis, I know I’d certainly be curious.” Claudette turned and stepped away, grabbing a towel to wipe her cum covered hands. Her boobs, meanwhile, she didn’t clean off. The way they jiggled ever so slightly as she scrubbed her hands, made him even more desperate to touch them. He felt tempted to say that she could measure his cumshots as much as she wanted, but decided not to push his luck. Picking up the recorder, she spoke into it again. “Control test results: three minutes and twenty-eight seconds. Subject’s reaction was consistent with the typical male orgasm, and his penis has become flaccid as expected. Subject has also notably not moved his gaze from my breasts since the control test began.”

With a blush, he looked away, “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to stare! Your boobs are just really beautiful … I mean you are beautiful. Not that I’m like, attracted to you or anything, I mean I am, you’re pretty … I just meant … uh … I’ll shut up now.”

Great, now she thought he was some weird, horny pervert. Way to fuck it up.

His professor stared at him for several seconds, as he shifted uncomfortably. With the tiniest hint of a slime, she brought the recorder to her mouth again. “Subject appears to be displaying symptoms of the condition commonly referred to as ‘post-nut clarity.’”

Gabriel said nothing. Waiting out the awkward silence, he watched as she grabbed a small flask, stirring it to make sure there were no bubbles. Placing it on a scale and checking the weight, she quickly typed something on her keyboard. Seemingly satisfied, she walked back to the table with it.

“Now then, let’s begin the experiment.”

Her student raised an eyebrow, “That wasn’t it?”

There was going to be more? Oh boy, this just kept getting better by the second.

“No, that was just a control test. I needed to see your reaction to a regular orgasm first.” She placed her hand on his stretched out arm, leaning in until her tits were inches from his face. There was no way she wasn’t doing this on purpose, he thought.


“‘Regular’ orgasm? What does that mean?”

“Patience. We need you to get erect again first.”

“Uh, I can’t get hard that fast.”

“Patience,” Clauduette repeated as she held up the flask to his mouth. She told him to drink it, which he did after some hesitation. The clear liquid had a strong, salty flavor. It tasted almost like, well, cum. With a grimace, he swallowed it down, and asked if it was some kind of aphrodisiac. She grinned, “Of a sort.”

Before Gabriel could reply, a strange feeling seemed to wash over his body. His head began to swim as something stirred deep in his pelvis. A warm pressure, traveling through his insides. He shuddered as it slowly shifted downward, until it reached the base of his cock. With eyes wide in surprise, he watched as the feeling engulfed his genitals. Within seconds, his flaccid length rapidly hardened, growing back to its usual erect size. Still, the pressure continued to grow, his dick hardening more and more, to the point that it was nearly starting to hurt. As this happened, his balls simultaneously felt like they were ballooning, until they felt nearly double in size. It was like his cum was boiling, churning for release. He’d gotten some pretty bad blue-balls before, but this was way worse. Straining his neck to see, Gabriel half expected his balls to explode from the pressure. Shockingly, the two spheres seemed perfectly fine, if a tad bigger than usual. The pressure kept building for a few more seconds, until, mercifully, it stopped. It took nearly a full minute for it to dissipate fully, his cock remaining hard all the while. 

 “Woah, what the hell? What was that?”

Claudette gently pushed his head back down, as she spoke into her recorder. “G.S.E. administered successfully. Penis achieved full erection in four seconds, and testicles appeared to shift in the scrotum. Subject seems disoriented, but otherwise alright. Beginning experiment proper.”

Gabriel was too focused on what just happened to hear anything she said. “How did you … what was that stu- AAAH!”

The woman lightly ran her finger across the tip. He instantly flinched, his limbs straining against the clamps as he tried to bend at the waist. A blast of pleasure enveloped his dick, more intense than anything he’d ever felt in his life. Claudette took a step back at his reaction, watching as his cock throbbed violently, oozing pre-cum. Panting, the boy’s brain struggled to comprehend what just happened. Had he just climaxed again? There was semen all over his cock. Could he have came again that fast? Wait, no, that was from his previous orgasm. Why did it feel like he just came, then?

Before he could verbalize these questions, she rubbed her finger down the front of his dick. Immediately, he gasped again, body shuddering. That tiny bit of pressure utterly assaulted him with pleasure. His cock (already sensitive from his recent climax), was barely even being touched, and yet that earlier orgasm paled in comparison to how good this felt.

“G.S.E. seems to be performing as anticipated,” Claudette said into the recorder. Unlike before, her tone was a lot more enthusiastic. She was even fully smiling, a rare sight. “Subject is reacting much stronger to stimulation. His pupils have dilated, and he is breathing heavily. Given the way his hips are thrusting, it seems that he desires more stimulation. I may finally have a working prototype!”

Both his teeth and fists clenched as he took a deep breath. “What the fuck did you give me!?”

“I call it the ‘Genital Sensitivity Enhancer,’” she answered, “It’s a prototype serum I created that changes the way your brain receives and interprets signals. It increases the intensity of sexual stimulation by roughly three orders of magnitude! Additionally, it forces more blood flow to the genitals, forcing an erection, and accelerating the rate at which your body produces semen!”

“W-w-what?” he asked, not catching a single word she said.

In a rare showing of emotion, Claudette rolled her eyes with a huff. “How do I put this in even more simple terms? It … it makes it feel better when I touch your ‘cock,’ and makes you ‘cum’ more.”

As the woman spoke, she began pumping his dick again. Her technique was exactly the same as before, but his reaction were much, much more intense. Instead of soft moans, the tiger full-on yelled. He pushed against the clamps, but they held him tight, leaving him unable to move. The metal table shook against the floor as he desperately bucked. Whether this was an attempt to gain more pleasure, or to escape from it, she couldn’t tell. Using his semen as lube to grease up his dick, she cocked her head, continuing.

His eyes began to roll back as he yelled out. “AAAH! Stop! I c-can’t! Oh fuuuuck! Wait!”

“This is the first prototype formula I’ve gotten working,” she said, casually. “I don’t believe in testing on myself, so you’re my first subject. The effects will wear off in a few hours, so I’m hoping to learn as much as I can before then.”

Her student replied with a series of incoherent cries. He could barely even breathe at this point. His mind just couldn’t handle the horrific, mind-destroying levels of pleasure that was bathing his lower half. The best sex of his life didn’t even come close to matching this handjob. Every stroke was a shockwave of pleasure. Every twist of her hand was an incomprehensible, heavenly explosion of sexual delight. It was too much. He couldn’t take any more. He just couldn’t.

Despite his pleas, his professor didn’t slow down for a second. She continued to stroke him, watching his cock throb and pulse with every little movement of her hand. It had taken her nearly three years to get this serum working, she was going to make the most of it. That meant more stroking, and a tighter grip.

Gabriel was far past screaming now. The pleasure was overwhelming him so much that he could do nothing but mewl. He couldn’t hear what she was saying, his brain couldn’t handle any other signals right now. He couldn’t even look down at her tits anymore, he was so exhausted. As her fingers brushed the tip, squeezing it into her palm, the pleasure would burn even hotter. The sensation was multiplied with every pump, building upon itself over and over and over again. His arms and legs were starting to give out, and he was soon reduced to just lying there as she tortured him with pleasure. He didn’t even know it was possible for something to feel this good. It shouldn’t have been possible. Was he going to die from sheer pleasure? Was she actually going to kill him with just a handjob?

And yet, even then, the stimulation continued to grow as he approached a second orgasm. As his vision went white, his body stiffened, fists clenching so hard his nails nearly stabbed through his palms. The pleasure reached its crescendo, a point far beyond what his body could handle. With one last whimper, his cock exploded. The biggest cumshot of his entire life erupted from the tip, his balls contracting hard. Still stroking, Claudette tried to protect herself with her other hand. She might not have even bothered, as the massive blast of seed hit her straight between her eyes. If it hadn’t been for her glasses, she’d likely have been blinded. Three-fourths of it splattered against her face, while the rest flew into her open mouth. It hit the back of her throat, painting a trail across her tongue. Gagging, she turned away, but didn’t let up on her student’s dick. Sixteen more cumshots, each four times as big as the entirety of his previous orgasm, slammed into her chest and neck. His cock was pumping out so much that she could actually feel it traveling up his shaft. The front half of her body was completely coated white, and yet, still, his cock wasn’t done. Another seven blasts of semen flew over her shoulders, splattering wetly against the opposite wall. A final four shot straight up, falling back down onto his stripped chest and the table.

Waiting until she felt Gabriel’s dick finish oozing cum, Claudette wiped her face as best as she could. There was cum EVERYWHERE, it would take days to clean up her lab. Even the front of her pants were soaked. Fortunately, she had hidden the recorder behind her back before he blew. Finally letting him go, she undressed fully, throwing her pants to the floor. She bent over as she did this. He would’ve had a perfect view of her cunt, had he the strength to turn his head.

The poor boy was barely even conscious now. His limbs were completely limp, eyes unfocused, tongue lolling out, and mouth slightly drooling. Mildly concerned, she placed her hand on his cum-soaked chest, feeling his heartbeat. No doubt that orgasm had utterly spent him, she thought. She snapped her fingers in his face, watching for a reaction. With this same hand, she poked his cock in the middle of the shaft, prompting a shallow breath to escape his mouth.

Happy that he was still awake, she recorded her findings. “Test results: Eighteen seconds. Subject reacted so strongly that he nearly fainted, and requested that I stop. Penis is still fully erect, and produced … a lot of semen, far more than I anticipated. Given how much he ejaculated before, I am unsure as to whether this serum will always produce such an amount, or if this is unique to this subject. Additionally, let this be a reminder to perform tests on subject’s semen beforehand next time. Consistency, potency, taste, etc.”

Gabriel couldn’t hear a word she said, he was too busy trying to recover from the mind-melting pleasure that had just wracked his body. He wouldn’t be able to form a coherent thought for a few more hours, at least. But, since he was still diamond-hard, his mental absence was admissible.

And so, Claudette climbed up onto the table, throwing her leg over him. Wasting no time, she casually lined his cock up with her pussy and slid him inside. The huge amount of cum coating his member made for excellent lube, allowing her to take him all the way. His eyes twitched, struggling to look up at her as he was engulfed by the greatest pleasure a man could feel, amplified a thousand-fold.

Planting her hand down and getting herself ready to bounce on his dick, she spoke into the recorder, “Initial trial complete, beginning test two of fourteen.”"
1fsnr33,1,2024-09-30,29 [F4M] #Online - Looking for a subby man who will cosplay for me!,u/SeleneEndymion,femdompersonals,https://www.reddit.com/r/femdompersonals/comments/1fsnr33/29_f4m_online_looking_for_a_subby_man_who_will/,"# PLEASE READ MY WHOLE POST BEFORE YOU MESSAGE ME

Hopefully this post will go through...

I’m looking for a short-term or long-term dynamic, all depending on our chemistry/compatibility, preferably with FLR elements BUT at the same time… I want a man who is CONFIDENT in himself and able to speak his mind by communicating openly without shutting down. To be blunt: I do not want a clingy, whiny partner who needs me to be their Mommy. 

This will be a strictly online-only connection as I’m currently exploring my options and I’m not willing to change my mind just because someone wants to force things to happen. Be yourself! We’re either a match or we’re not, it’s as simple as that, and I’m here to have fun so please don’t waste our time if you’re not able to accept this. Trust, honorifics, and partnership has to be earned while building upon a strong foundation. IF you and I click, it’s possible that the dynamic could become a relationship one day, but I will not discuss that any time soon so do NOT push me or lovebomb me.

You should be able to communicate with me, express yourself honestly, and put in real effort rather than waiting for me to give you breadcrumbs every step of the way. Know that I want someone who has actual dating experience and isn’t some teenager fresh out of highschool or a college student who’s never been with a woman before. I’m not here to hold someone’s hand and teach them how to romance a woman, so PLEASE don’t waste my time! I also need you to understand that I am a human being, that I want Femdom/FLR where the focus is on ME and MY NEEDS rather than dealing with men who selfishly center themselves because they want to get their dick wet. I don’t want to have to tell you to treat me like your princess or that I have to train you on how to be attentive, romantic, and thoughtful. You have to enjoy giving pleasure and keeping my needs and desires above everything else in your head, so don’t even bring up your boner. You are the submissive one here, not me, so prove yourself worthy of me and serve me properly.

**SUB (YOU):**

* Age Range: MUST be within 25-40!!!
* Location: USA
* Height: Tall. Tall. I like tall men. NO SHORT KINGS. If you have to ask how tall you need to be, you are probably not tall enough for me. You need to stay tall af even when I wear my heels.
* Body Type: Slim + Tone or Fit + Muscular
* Political Spectrum: Left
* Experience: Not a newbie to Femdom, relationships, FLR
* Relationship Status: Monogamous, Single, not sexually active or dating IRL.
* Green Flags: Communicator, Giving, Honest, Independent, Kind, Listener, and Loyal. Gemini is a plus.
* Personality: You are polite/courteous enough to say please, yes ma’am, and thank you. You enjoy showing off for me, pampering me, giving words of affirmations, wooing and romancing me. My mom would believe you’re the perfect gentleman who pulls out my chair and opens doors for me, while also showing up with gifts on Valentine’s Day to remind me how much you adore me. You can have an ego and be a bit sassy, but you treat me like your princess and give me what I want eventually. Sense of humor is also a must!
* Morals and Values: You are an ally for the queer community. You have to care about women’s rights. You also understand that the world is full of different people with different values, so you know not to be an asshole as long as they’re respectful toward you and others. You also respect other cultures. I have my own culture. We have food and customs, so I don’t want to see you throwing a fit because you think it’s gross or weird. You treat waiters and retail workers with kindness, patience, and respect. Your road rage (or any rage, for that matter) does not exceed mild irritation. You’re not a control freak, and you are not possessive of me, so you accept that I have friends, including guy friends. Bonus if you can be friends with them eventually.
* Looks and Hygiene: You shower regularly and keep up with proper grooming. You’re not bald, and you don’t have a beard. You don’t shave all your body hair off but also don’t be a gorilla. Ido not want a man that has no body hair or too much body hair. I like guys that have hairless thighs but hairy calves and some wispy chest hairs/back hair, if that gives you any ideas. Dress classy and tastefully when I expect you to (use common sense. I’m not your mommy and shouldn’t have to tell you when to dress nicely.) Casually, I like a man in black. Show me what you can do with your wardrobe. I’ll decide whether I like it or not. You either have long hair or you have it cut and styled; either way, it must be maintained properly. You have to make me look good wherever you go - especially if you do get to stand next to me in public. You must smell good and brush your teeth. Tattoos and classy fashion sense are a big bonus.
* Things I don’t want: If you play LoL, I instantly have a distrust of you. No Virgos. No virgins. No small weiners. No little dick energy. NO SHORT KINGS. No control freaks. No insecure little boys who have mommy issues or need to be reassured that I find you attractive or that we’re “okay.” stfu. No money issues/financial problems. No baby mama drama/kids/child support/bankruptcy/court bullshit. Have your shit straight and sorted out. No criminal activity-having-ass motherfuckers. I don’t have time or energy for your drama and bullshit. No racists, bigots, or general assholes.
* BONUS: You love Harvest Moon/SoS, JRPGs, and/or Final Fantasy XIV and can crush a whole ass watermelon between your thighs.
* I’m gonna go balls to the wall and say that if you know who Emet-Selch is, then we’re in business. If you can cosplay him and do a good job, I’m keeping you.

**ABOUT ME:**

* Late 20’s; 5’3”. Long black hair and brown eyes. Tattoos and piercings. Stiletto nails. Small bust/waist. Wide hips. If you like big, brown eyes, you’re in luck.
* I like to be silly and goofy, I also want to engage in sophisticated conversations, too.
* I frequently travel and like seeing new things, but I also like staying in and playing video games or drawing/making art.
* If I were to describe myself, I would say that I can be very sweet and nice when I want to be. I am a college-educated woman that has worked hard to get to where I am today and am continuing to build on that. I’m funny and enjoy laughing, but a good story will also make me cry. I enjoy exploring new/different things in all aspects of life. I’m adaptable, caring, creative, fun-loving, outgoing, romantic, and sentimental. I want to feel safe enough to be soft, but I’ll be a bitch if necessary. I can be a little unhinged.
* I take care of myself, and I’m very busy. My time is spread extremely thin as it is. I can’t have someone clingy or whiny pestering me to give attention when I can’t/don’t want to. I need you to be a confident and independent adult with your shit together and things going for you in your life.
* I draw digitally, and it exclusively involves gaming art/shitposts based on chats with friends
* I have been told that I have really bad resting bitch face
* I like wholesome games that tell a good story, play DnD with my friends, and enjoy meeting new people with similar hobbies and interests
* I love trying new foods/activities, but I frequently visit a lot of Japanese and Mediterranean restaurants in particular. I like a glass of white wine wherever I go, and if I can dress for the occasion, even better.
* I want words of affirmation. That is extremely important to me because I want to feel special. I know I am beautiful and smart and clever, but I want YOU to tell me. Not the guy at the fucking gas station. This is YOUR job. Not his. Not only that, but I want to hear genuine compliments about me as a person beyond just my physical appearance. I want to be pampered. I like to know I’m thought of based on your actions.
* I want you to do more than the bare minimum with showing up. I want you to listen and care and step in when I need/want you to without treating it like a chore or burden. This is your job. Figure out the things I enjoy and make an effort to anticipate my needs/desires. I want you to show that I’m important to you; especially on Valentine’s Day or other special occasions. I am your princess. Treat me as such. I want peonies and perfume. My favorite chocolates are from Europe. Use context clues to figure out what I want and need.

**NSFW DETAILS:**

* I will let you know if I’m interested in discussing kinks/NSFW topics.
* Do not send a close-up photo of your nudity.
* Always ask for my permission before sending photos.
* I will NOT change my mind so NO means NO.
* Do not treat me like a kink dispenser or act horny at inappropriate times.
* If you want to beg then it better be in a sexy way and not a pathetic little bitch way. I want to be romanced and I want to be turned on, the opposite will give me the ICK so fast.
* I love being verbally praised and hearing that you’ll worship me for all kinds of reasons. Be my biggest simp and let me know that you adore every part of me.
* I like being the receiver of breast/nipple play, cunnilingus, fingering, and penetration.
* I love being pampered in every sense of the word so my love languages will include words of affirmations, acts of service, quality time and gifts. I want to come home and have my shoes taken off, being massaged after a hard day of work would be a blessing, and I want to receive special care. Make my life easier, not harder.
* There are many things I’d like to explore… I want to try slapping my man, shoving my fingers down his throat and having him suck them, flogging him and being rough with him. His response should be “thank you!” and he should be grateful that he’s the one at the end of my heel. I would love to hear you thank me for anything and everything, especially if I’m allowing you to have the pleasure of serving me or touching yourself. You can beg but remember to act sexy when doing so. Tell me what you want and show me that you’re worthy.
* Use your words and talk dirty to me in a way that would make me wet, don’t talk to me like you’re a fuckboy. I want to hear about the things you’d like to do to service me and help me cum, without you mentioning your dick. You want to live for my pleasure and that is incredibly hot to me.
* Roleplay and cosplay would be HOT!
* I will not allow you to watch porn, entertain romantic/sexual discussions with other women (PERIOD), or do anything that a single BACHELOR would be doing. I love a man who works out and takes care of himself too, so act like you want me to consider you for the long haul. I want you to show off to me and I want you to be eye candy for me. If I say to take a selfie while doing a certain pose, then give me what I want without having to ask twice. At the end of the day you should ask yourself: Who do you belong to?
* You should be eager to do service tasks for me and figure out what would be helpful. I want a man who is able to take some control outside of the bedroom so being a provider, showing your romantic side and planning dates, opening doors for me, carrying my shopping bags, acting like you enjoy spending time with me when I do whatever I want to do, and coming along with me when I feel like exploring or trying new things.
* My Hard Limits: Blood, Diapers, Permanent Scars, Scat, Watersports

So if you made it this far and think that you can match with me, just send me a REDDIT CHAT REQUEST with answers to the following questions:

* What’s your name, age, gender, pronouns, and location?
* How would you describe yourself as a person AND a submissive man? (Please try to express yourself as best as possible here, thank you.)
* What kind of job do you have?
* Can you tell me about your hobbies and interests?
* Have you ever traveled anywhere or done something really fun somewhere?
* Do you have any previous experiences with dating, Femdom, FLR, or online dynamics?
* Would you be willing to send a selfie with you holding up a piece of paper that has MY username written on it? If so, please don’t hide your face and keep it SFW. :) Remember you want to impress me.

Here we are at my closing statement, congratulations! I’m happy you took the time to read all of this so I will share one more thing with you before telling you my expectations. I mentioned earlier that I am unhinged and I hope that you could see my personality throughout this post. lol I’m mostly joking and I wanted to get that across along the way, so either you can handle that like a champ or I’m not the one for you. It’s fine if we’re not a match! You don’t need to tell me that I sound like a bitch with high standards OR that you can’t fit XYZ criteria but still wanted to shoot your shot anyway. Just have a good day and be on your way, thank you!

LAST STOP… I will appreciate it very much if you are able to fully commit to following through with everything I want to see within your chat request! If not, then it’s for the best that you do not waste our time because I will not give second chances or explain why I've ignored your message and likely reported you to the mods as well. THIS IS NOT A CHARITY so I do NOT owe you anything if you think that I’m some kink dispenser waiting to play out your sexual fantasies. Otherwise, I will let you know if we’re not compatible if you did take the time to put effort into your message. Please respect my boundaries and do not send NSFW photos of any kind, do not call me by honorifics, and do not assume familiarity with me. We are strangers so you should not act like you’re a fuckboy trying to get in my pants in your first message to me."
1fsnzgd,5,2024-09-30,AI 'podcast' summary of my piano student's first 18 lessons,u/kinggimped,piano,https://www.reddit.com/r/piano/comments/1fsnzgd/ai_podcast_summary_of_my_piano_students_first_18/,"Hey y'all. Quick background, I work as an IT engineer but have played piano my whole life. I have played and taught piano throughout my life, and I still teach piano lessons on Sundays. It began while I was unemployed and studying for IT certifications, but continued after I found a job. I have 3 students - 2 retirees, one teenager, all beginners.

My philosophy has always been to teach the way I wish I'd been taught piano and music - rather than how I learned, which was a very rigid and punitive academic style that focused on playing pieces rather than playing the piano. Lessons are an hour and after every lesson I write comprehensive notes after each lesson - lesson summary, detailed practice guides, some diagrams, music theory snippets, expanding on questions students asked in class, and links to more info or examples of things we're working on. It also works as a journal of their learning and  It works really well and though my students are still pretty early on in their piano journey, they're all thriving and making fantastic progress.

Anyway. A coworker was talking to me about NotebookLM today, which is a new AI research tool from Google. Basically you feed it source material, and you can ask questions or create study guides etc. based on the content. Basically like ChatGPT but you can feed it specific source material. It also has a feature where you can create an ""audio overview"", which takes the form of two people having a podcast-like conversation about the content.

My (developer) coworker was bemoaning the fact that he wanted to try it because he'd heard it was pretty impressive, but didn't have much interesting content to throw at it. He knows I use notetaking apps a lot at work. I had the idea to basically copy and paste in my lesson notes from one of my student's first 18 classes.

We were kinda blown away by what it spat back after about 5 minutes. We're both pretty familiar with AI but this felt like a step further from ChatGPT.

Anyway. I thought I'd upload the audio and share it here because, while it's a bit iffy in some areas like all AI and LLM outputs, it actually ends up summarising a beginner pianist's experience and early fundamental concepts incredibly well. The fact it can take a bunch of notes and create a narrative, make analogies (some better than others) and callbacks and references based on that material is kinda wild. Not to mention how they kinda nailed the vocal intonation and interplay of a podcast format.

I thought some folks here might find it interesting! Or not. Feel free to downvote/delete if this breaks rules or is off-topic. I don't post much here nowadays.

I’ve been exploring options in construction (buildings, bridges, concrete, etc.), but honestly, those topics don’t excite me as much. I’m looking for something outside the usual construction-focused projects, something innovative and more aligned with what interests me: a blend of IT and civil engineering.

I’m not an expert in IT, but I’m eager to learn. I’ve heard about tools like ArcGIS, but I’m a beginner and I’m willing to spend time mastering it since I have a year to work on this project. Ideally, I’d like to find a project that’s feasible for me as a civil engineering student, yet still innovative enough to stand out.

I want something applicable in Canada, where I’m studying, and something that could reignite my passion for civil engineering—since I’m honestly feeling a bit unsure if I’m in the right field. I don’t want to focus on traditional projects like building structures or transportation networks that many students might do. I want something unique, forward-thinking, that combines civil engineering with IT, but is still within my reach as someone without a strong IT background. I've asked ChatGPT a lot of questions, I’ve talked with it day and night, and while I did find some interesting ideas, I still feel like I haven’t found the perfect project yet. That’s why I’d love to hear your ideas and suggestions!

Do you have any suggestions or ideas that could help guide me toward the right direction? Maybe there’s a cool project out there that could combine the use of AI, smart infrastructure, or sustainable tech? Any guidance would be appreciated!

Thanks so much!"

To qualify, you must provide documentation from the VA, Social Security Administration (SSA), or a medical professional. Some may receive an automatic discharge based on records from the VA or SSA. If not, you can apply through Nelnet, the TPD discharge servicer.

After approval, loans will be discharged, but some may require a three-year monitoring period (for SSA or medical certification). If the discharge is based on VA documentation, this period isn’t required. Taxes may apply at the state level, and federal tax treatment depends on when the discharge occurred.

If denied, borrowers can reapply or dispute the decision within 12 months.

1fszvkf,1,2024-09-30,ChatGPT's Impact on Business Productivity: Top Transforming Sectors,u/cporter202,ChatGPTautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTautomation/comments/1fszvkf/chatgpts_impact_on_business_productivity_top/,"The advent of artificial intelligence has paved the way for innovative technologies to disrupt the traditional business landscape. Among these, OpenAI's language model, ChatGPT, has stood out, significantly impacting business productivity across various sectors. I would like to delve into how this powerful tool is transforming industries and revolutionizing the way we work.

In the realm of customer service, ChatGPT is being harnessed to provide immediate, around-the-clock support. By leveraging its natural language processing capabilities, companies can deliver faster responses and minimize wait times. This not only enhances customer experience but also allows human agents to focus on more complex queries, thereby increasing efficiency.

The legal sector is another domain witnessing ChatGPT's influence. Law firms are employing the AI to draft and review documents, a task that conventionally consumes copious amounts of time. This automation accelerates the preparation process while reducing the margin for error. As such, lawyers can devote more attention to case strategy and client consultancy, thereby adding value to their services.

Education also benefits from ChatGPT's proficiency. Teachers and educational institutions are utilizing this technology to create personalized learning experiences. Chatbots can tutor students, adapt to their learning paces, and provide immediate feedback, making education more accessible and inclusive.

In marketing, ChatGPT has become an asset for content creation and consumer insight analysis. Marketers can swiftly generate promotional material and analyze customer feedback with nuanced sentiment analysis to shape more effective marketing strategies.

Further, the healthcare industry is integrating ChatGPT for patient interactions and administrative tasks. This AI's capabilities in understanding and processing medical terminology mean it can efficiently manage appointments, reminders, and preliminary patient inquiries, leaving healthcare professionals with more time for patient care.

It's imperative to consider that while ChatGPT and similar AI tools greatly contribute to productivity, they also come with challenges — particularly in terms of job displacement and the need for new skill sets amongst the workforce. As with any technological shift, it is essential to find a balance, ensuring that these tools are leveraged to complement human capabilities rather than replace them.

What sectors do you think will be most profoundly impacted by ChatGPT in the next few years, and how do you envision this AI will further shape our working lives? Share your thoughts and let’s engage in a discussion about the future of work in an AI-powered world."

1ft7z9z,266,2024-09-30,Y'all (freshers) need to chill. Here's how.,u/unsuspiciousprofile,UniUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/1ft7z9z/yall_freshers_need_to_chill_heres_how/,"I am in my 3rd year and see daily posts here of people stressing over some minute details that will have zero impact on your life ever.

Someone missed a class, someone esle slept with a flatmate, some other person hates their course after 5 classes, bunch of people homesick.

Here's my take on all of this:

I understand, we literally all went through this. Now yes some are having a blast at uni, but if that is not you, it doesn't mean it is gonna be like this forever.

When I was in my 1st year, I did stupid shit that led me to getting severely depressed in the middle of UK's gloomy winter. Somehow, I decided to stay on my course and guess what? Can't be happier now. 

There is so many things that might go wrong it's impossible to address them all, but unanymously working on yourself is what it comes to it. If you are struggling with budgeting, this is what you need to learn. If you are struggling with socialising, this is also what you need to learn. Or maybe you are a massive procrastinator and leave everything till last minute? Well, you have a whole 1st year to figure out how to overcome it, and even if you fail it's only like 10% of your final grade. Many many problems of students at uni are really just problems of being in a situation where your self -regulation is still high school level, but your freedom is much more like that of an adult. So you need to grow this ability. In fact, you could argue that all that undergrad really is for is showing your future employer that you are somewhat able to keep a regular schedule and hand in things in due time. The skills you develop only really become meaningful after master's, unless in your profession you can work right after bachelor. And this sounds incredibly anticlimatic but it's not bad news at all, you will learn plenty of very useful skills, academic and non-academic. But just know that things take time, and sometimes they make get very bad before becoming great. 

It's corny but as humans we struggle with managing our freedom, and when granted some more we don't quite know how to navigate it. However, mistake after mistake and hurdle after hurdle you become more and more convinced that certain ways to do things work better for you than others. It's just very important to stay strong and not let it all break you, so find yourself the support you need, be it your parents, friends, colleagues or whoever you can think of who's ever been supportive. If there's nobody like that, use reddit and ChatGPT. Good luck!"
1ft8g06,23,2024-09-30,Adjuncting at four very different schools,u/Excellent_Carob173,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1ft8g06/adjuncting_at_four_very_different_schools/,"I'm adjuncting at four very different schools:  (1) a very selective private university, (2) a private regional college, (3) a private minority-serving college, and (4) a public community college.  I teach/have taught lit and comp at all of these schools.  

Here's what I'm dealing with this semester:

***Reading (and Participation)***  
At all four schools, reading comprehension is a major problem.  

At 1 and 2, I have students - domestic, English-as-a-first-language students - who lack elementary reading skills.  At 2 and 3, I cannot expect that any of my students will do any reading whatsoever before class.  I can even provide the audiobook, and they won't listen.  At 1 and 4, I can tell that 25-50% of the class will at least glance at the reading beforehand.  

But, again, the real issue is that even when we read out loud in class, it's clear that the majority of students struggle with literary texts written at a 7th grade reading level in lit classes, and they struggle with news stories and op-eds written at any level from middle to high school.  

It's not hopeless, though.  Many catch on.  However, many just...don't; they have already thrown in the towel.  

At 1, I see the greatest divide.  My class there always immediately splits between students who will ""get it"" and insist on excelling, and then those who just don't.  That divide is growing, though.  There are clearly students who have recovered from Covid and then those who fell through the cracks.  There are students with a lot of civic knowledge and students with hardly any. They hesitate to speak up because they're scared they might be ""wrong"" - until a handful of them are comfortable. They are my most anxious students overall. 

At 2, they are mostly annoyed that they are being expected to read anything.  Asking students to (volunteer to) read out loud at this institution has been eye-opening and shocking, though.  Many struggle with 'basic' vocabulary words that I learned in my low-ranked public middle school preparing for the PSAT. I can read things out loud to them carefully, stressing the important words and phrases, and the content still won't ""click.""  These students have the least amount of civic knowledge.  They don't want to speak up, and they are not bothered by uncomfortably long silent pauses.  They'll wait it out with me.  These are my most self-conscious, too-cool-for-school students.

At 3, they participate without abandon, and they're not afraid to be wrong.  (These were mostly below-average high school students.) They struggle to read on their own just as much as 2, but when I read with them out loud, they grasp the concepts.  What they lack in reading and writing preparedness, they make up for in conversation.  These classes have the most students with any civic knowledge, even if there are fewer with as much civic knowledge as 1.  These are my most reliable students.

At 4, my students are a mix of my best from 1 and my average from 3.  Half my students are really hopeful and want to transfer to a four-year school; the other half just want to get through as efficiently as possible.  This class has the most students who can comprehend texts on their own. They participate.   These are my most mature students (though not, on the whole, older.)

***Writing (and Assignment Submission)***  
All struggle to write; all struggle to use any word processor.  

At 1, many want to rely on ChatGPT, but they are learning to ""try"" to disguise their usage.  All of them have a superficial sense of what an essay ""should"" look like.  They have the least faith in their own ideas.  The vast majority still fail to follow submission guidelines, even when you demonstrate.  They are the most likely to get upset for having points deducted for not following submission guidelines.  They genuinely think ""I didn't know"" should be a get-out-of-jail-free card for anything and everything.  They are the most likely to grade grub.  But, then, when I've taught upper level courses here, I've been blown away by some of them.

At 2, many want to rely on ChatGPT, but they don't know how to use it.  These students also have a (very) superficial sense of what an essay ""should"" look like, but they don't have a grasp of the mechanics of writing, so except for when/where they paste from ChatGPT, their essays often don't actually say...well...anything.  They don't care about submission guidelines or deadlines, regardless of demonstrations and reminders.  They'll take the point deductions.  They just want the class to be over.  

At 3, most are weary of ChatGPT because they ""know they'll get caught,"" they say.  Many of these students have no real sense of what an essay ""should"" look like, but they, on the whole, make more substantive contributions.  They will try to follow submission guidelines if you demonstrate. These students are the most likely to hand in assignments on time.

At 4, ChatGPT usage varies widely.  Some use it fairly well.  Some use it not-so-well.  Some are scared of it.  They all have a sense of what an essay should look like, and they are, by far, the most likely to follow submission guidelines.  The fail to meet deadlines just as much as 1 and 2, but they'll take the point deductions.  

***Conclusion***  
This is a wild ride... I'm still learning... "
