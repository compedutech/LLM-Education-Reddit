It showcases interesting and well-written comments and posts from the period covered. If you want to get an idea of what this community is about or how we want you to participate, look no further (except the rules maybe--those might be important too).

As a reminder, you can nominate Quality Contributions by hitting the report button and selecting the ""Actually A Quality Contribution!"" option. Additionally, links to all of the roundups can be found in the wiki of /r/theThread which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/thethread/wiki/themotte). For a list of other great community content, see [here](https://www.vault.themotte.org/).  

These are mostly chronologically ordered, but I have in some cases tried to cluster comments by topic so if there is something you are looking for (or trying to avoid), this might be helpful. Here we go:

🔹 Inflation has increased by 6.52%
🔹 Unemployment has risen by 8%
Competition is increasing but not the opportunities.

And then there are social media influencers saying don’t work for money.
Like Bro… you, as a WRITER, charge $200 for a masterclass on how to write ChatGPT prompts (Chat GPT was launched in November 2022).

I have worked for multiple unpaid internships and I learned a lot but it was because I didn’t have to provide for my family or anyone. 
I was not confident in my skills, I treated myself like a newbie.

And it was 2020 when shopkeepers were chill enough to accept 50 Rs. instead of 60. It doesn't happen anymore. 2020 is gone.

People cannot work for free anymore. The economy is not very supportive of that. And if it is why you cannot provide your premium services to someone who needs them for free?

If you cannot minimize your experience and efforts then don't expect others to do the same.

🛑 Stop believing in every social media influencer or famous creator with 2 million+ views.

11f6r28,102,2023-03-01,I play about one game a year and go heavy into it. Very late to the party but 300 hours and just put the game down.,u/ChippersNDippers,FireEmblemThreeHouses,https://www.reddit.com/r/FireEmblemThreeHouses/comments/11f6r28/i_play_about_one_game_a_year_and_go_heavy_into_it/,"Hey all, I'm in one of those modes where you sank a ton of time into the game and want to talk to someone about it!

First off, I only have time for one game every year or two as I'm 41m and have all those old people responsibilities. I grew up with JRPGs on the NES and SNES and that expanded out to strategy RPGs like Shining Force 1/2/3 and the like.

I bought a switch for when my nephew came and visited and looked for a game to try out myself. I enjoy Persona and the social systems and I enjoy tactics so Three Houses seemed like a natural fit.

This is going to be very long, my apologies.

First off, I really loved the game. It really was a perfect experience and had so much nuance and little tidbits in each storyline. The translation was perfect and both the Japanese and English voice acting was really good. The English choices for the 'adult' characters was a bit of a disappointment though.

I played through each of the four paths, Claudes on hard, Edelgard's on hard, Silver Snow on maddening with new game+ and Dimitri on maddening with no new game +.

Overall, I would say Silver Snow was the most difficult considering the final battle. I feel like Claude's path would be the most achievable, even on maddening and Edelgard's would be quite a challenge on maddening, as well.

I guess I'll break this all into sections, please feel free to ignore my post and I apologize for the length, just fun to write out some thoughts and hear what others think.

LANGUAGE

As I mentioned, the translation was excellent and they really captured each character. I played through two paths with Japanese and two paths with English.

I think the Japanese is the overall better option as the 'comic relief' characters like Bernedetta, Alois, Caspar etc actually made me chuckle at times with their Japanese voices. As someone who was obsessed with Japan as a kid and made a trip as an adult, I really feel that the character tropes are something that a Japanese audience vibes with more and the 'jokes' about the scared character who is a shut in, the overly confident guy, the guy who thinks he is funny but isn't funny just really fit's the language well. 

When I listened to Caspar and Bernedetta with the English language, I would get a bit tired of their trope. With the Japanese language, I almost always found them humorous or at least endearing vs annoying.

CHARACTERS

First, I guess I'll talk about Byleth, I played 3 times as a male Byleth and 1 time as a female Byleth. I felt the motion of the female character and her expressions and how she interacted with the students was more fitting to the overall story.

I also feel like the Pegasus class mastery is the overall best class for the main character. Having the avoidance stack + crit bonuses from some classes and the vantage skills, you could be on the final map and take on 10+ enemies and not have a single one even tough her.

The War Master was fun as the male playthrough as every hit was a guaranteed crit just about, but the risk of death was just a bit higher. 

I won't go into all the other characters to avoid a novel, but I definitely had my favorites (Lynsithea (sp), Dedue, Mercedes, Balthus, Yuri, Petra, Shamir, Marianne) were often mainstays of my party.

PATHS

Each of the various paths to choose from had really interesting moments that made them worth playing. 

I think my overall favorite is Dimitris path of redemption, followed closely by the ending of Silver Snow. Each path had enough variance in story with enough deep moments with characters to make it worth playing.

CHARACTER STORIES/MOMENTS

SPOILER HEAVY

I think my favorite thing about the game was the smaller moments where you learn backstory of a character or see the subtle cues early in the game that tie into a secret about that character later on.

The side narratives are my favorite part of the game overall. It's really fun to get a new game + and recruit every single character possible to your house and play out their side stories as they add a ton of depth. They also make some unsympathetic characters much more sympathetic and you really build a bond to them.

Some of my favorites

Flayn - Finding out that her and Seteth are actually father and daugher and used to have the ability to transform into powerful beasts but have lost the ability over time. 

One of my favorite small moments is when Flayn uses the word 'Youths' when she is talking about younger characters. It shows how nuanced the translation is when she used a word that a really old person would use about young people. They could have so easily missed this moment but by adding it in, you really see her true age shine through in these small moments.

Jeralt - Learning that he was not only saved but he was given blood of Rhea and is at least 100 years old at the time of the game and hasn't aged a bit. In the very first battle of the game he says 'Did you just...' when you turned back time. That small line shows that the blood of Rhea allowed him to see that you turned back time and saved yourself. What a clever little hint for players to notice in new playthroughs. The Silver Snow path and Cindered Shadows reveal more about your mother and how she was an experiment gone wrong and all the crazy things that Rhea chose to do to try to get her mother back.

Rhea - Rhea is berserk, from her reaction to when you protect Edelgard to her choices to bring you into the world with her mother inhabiting your body to finally losing all control in Silver Snow and turning into that insane dragon beast AND finding out that her top tier nights were given crest fragments that also turned them into beasts to protect her.

She took things way too far and is lucky she didn't destroy the world on top of everything, simply due to her grief and loss and never fully dealing with it.

Alois - Initially, I thought he was just annoying as all hell. I really softened towards him when he opened up about his past and how Jeralt cared for him. There is a sad subplot where he admits his sadness and is just so earnest and caring that he is hard not to have a soft spot for.

Cindered Shadows - Learning more about your mother and the completely amazing and crazy final boss of this is probably my favorite ending boss in the entire game (and it is kind of a pain in the ass, just like that whole side story with no time to level up, timed battles and wanting to basically make your life miserable).

Marianne - Learning the truth of her bloodline and finding her 1,000 year old heir who has travelled the world as a monster for all this time, really hit an emotional note with me for some reason.

Edelgard - Learning what had been done to her and her siblings was really quite sad and I could really understand why she chose her path to avoid that torture happening to anyone, ever again. I was also sad at the end of Dimitri's route when she choses to go for broke and gives up her body entirely and even when defeated, uses that dagger to try to kill you still. There was no changing her and no hope for her to give up her mission, no matter how hard you tried.

Dimitri - I liked his story arc overall from him going from broken and revenge fueled madness to learning love again to learning the true history of his families death. Even how he shows up when you don't choose his path and he is still fueled by anger is really powerful.

Dedue - I actually chose him as my life partner during my female playthrough. The silent humorous interactions in the garden, his love of cooking, he loyalty and selflessness and being able to see him smile and laugh when you choose a life with him at the end is just really a heartfelt moment.

CLASSES/GAMBITS

I didn't use any guides when I played so I had to do a lot of testing with Gambits and Classes and take notes about what abilities you got when a class was mastered.

Playing through on Maddening I had to map out what class paths I would choose to give characters the bets buildout. I would usually choose a class to give archers stealth so they wouldn't be targetted, then give them pavise or some heavy defensive fueled ability and then just go for the crit bonus and double shot of the sniper class.

I think the other most powerful path was working towards war master for male non-archer characters. Giving an 'any weapon +20 crit' is hard to argue with, especially for characters with fist weapons who often get 4x attacks.

My final team always looked something like

Main Character - War Master or Pegasus

Four mastered snipers for double shot + crit bonuses

Two healers

One powerful as hell mage

Then the rest were typically war masters

The name of the game became crit builds as much as possible or avoidance builds, anything else just didn't seem worthwhile.

EXPANSION

Cindered Shadows was a pretty nice expansion but was really frustrating on hard difficulty. I think hard in the expansion is harder than maddening in any of the paths of the main game. You have no ability to grind at all and they give you time limits and the final boss is quite tough and you have zero opportunity to manage classes or do any of the things to help achieve victory. They give you very specific classes, specific characters, limited weapons and then they tell you to win with what they give you out of the gate, which makes for a really frustrating experience.

The story was lackluster but the final section made it worth slogging through the narrative of the previous chapters. The final boss and what you learn about your mother is really engaging and the final boss is truly grotesque and has an interesting set of mechanics to manage.

My only complaint with the final boss is so much relies on guesswork as to where the monster will spawn next. Picking the wrong spawn can throw off the entire battle on hard and cause you to lose. I'm not sure I would recommend playing hard as the boss is quite challenging even on normal.

I love having the cast playable in the main game though and the fetters of dromni are a key asset to gain in the main game, especially on maddening. Having Yuri as an archer with high crit and able to move out of damage distance is really useful.

I could probably write triple the length of this post with all my thoughts, but no one wants to read this.

My only sad realization is that no other Fire Emblem game is like this. I looked at the two Switch games and was pretty disappointed. One is a very anime-esque light plot strategy game and the other is a Dynasty Warriors + Fire Emblem game which just isn't for me.

I'm sure this game took forever to develop and was a bit of a labor of love and we may not see another release like this for quite a while, but I'll be there if it ever does come around!

On a final note, Cyril is the worst. From telling you to go away when you first meet him to his whining about Rhea all the time. Is it wrong of me to select responses that he really hates because he drives me nuts? Other than that, I do not want to fish ever again, fish grinding for professor grade does tend to grade on the mind after a while."

Hey fellow Devs,

I recently posted in this sub for some advice about a job switch,  but got a lot of queries and DMs about how I got into Data Engineering, how to get better and go from entry level to senior position or from Data Analyst to Data Engineer (DE)

I'm working as a Senior Data Engineer in a Unicorn Startup in India. 

Trying to give back to the community from my experience in Data Engineering since 2019. Still surprised that not many are aware about what actually are the roles, the expectations from Data Engineers are. Most of the stuff is available online, videos from many youtubers, still posted it for people who might not be aware! :)

Will answer FAQs about Data Engineering. Feel free to correct or improvise. 

**Warning: This is going to be a long post.**

&gt; DE means Data Engineering


I. As a fresher, I'm interested in Data Engineering, but how to get a job in this domain?

A. Getting a job directly as a full-time DE is pretty tough. Try to apply for DE internships and maybe it will get converted to full-time or with that experience try to apply for Associate / Junior DE positions. Build a network on Linkedin with many Data Engineers and connect with them about their experience. 



2.  What are the required skill-sets to become a DE?

A. From my experience companies expect you to be good at any one language

* Python, Java or Scala
* Strong SQL skills
* Data warehousing
* Spark
* Cloud experience - AWS/Azure/GCP \[good to atleast have an idea on how to spin up a cluster in any cloud vendor, setting up Network rules, firewall, etc.\]



3. Is DE in demand, is it better than Data Science?

A. Even though all the hype on the internet is for Data Scientists, the role of Data Engineer is equally crucial and critical for companies to enable Data Scientists. 

* Even the pay is lucrative! 
   * Salaries may vary, but mostly ranges look like this in India
   * Entry level DE - 4 to 10 LPA
   * 2 - 4 years - 12 to 30 LPA
   * 4 - 7 years - 25 - 60+ LPA

4. How do the roles differ, Data Engineer vs Data Scientist vs Data Analyst

A. My understanding - In the Data ecosystem

1. Data Engineer - Process starts here, collecting, cleaning and transforming, ingesting data into Data warehouses or datalakes.

2. Data Scientist - With the collected data in DW/DL, understand business logic and build useful data science techniques / ML models to identify key patterns, insights that can drive revenue.

   3. Data Analyst - Final part in process, Visualize the insights from Data Scientists using BI tools like Tableau, Looker, etc. 



3. How to prepare for DE interviews, Most commonly asked interview questions?



* **NOTE: In most companies, even Data Engineers are expected to be strong in DSA, since first rounds can be OA tests like Hackerrank and F2F Coding rounds before you can enter technical rounds about topics mentioned below. So, still need to Grind Leetcode to some extent!**
* **That being said, there are still companies that focus mostly on SQL, Spark for interviews and pay lesser attention to coding skills.**



After attending close to 40 interviews in last 4 years, the most asked interview questions for 0-3 years of experience were mostly on the following.

**Must have knowledge on these concepts to crack any DE interview:**

I. SQL

* Aggregate functions - AVG, MIN, MAX, etc.
* Joins - **important!** types of joins and their output.
* Window functions - Ranking functions, LAG, LEAD
* what is &lt;**following**\&gt; how do they **work**, how to **create** this and why is it used, **pros** and **cons** for the **following:**
   * CTEs
   * Views, Materialized views
   * Index - also types of indexes, index behind the scenes.
   * Partitioning - types of partitioning
* Normalization / Denormalization - rarely asked but important



2. Data Warehousing (DW) and ETL

* Star vs Snowflake Schema
* DB vs DW vs Data lake, when to use appropriately
* Choosing Columnar vs row oriented Databases
* Facts, Dimensions - understanding, examples
* Steps to implement a Data warehouse (for example in Bigquery)
* Best practices for DW, reporting
* Slowly changing dimensions
* Handling duplicate records, inconsistencies in data.
* Understanding ETL vs ELT process, data cleaning, ingestion techniques. 



3. Spark

* Understading Architecture
* YARN basics
* Sparkcontext, session, worker, task, job, stage, etc
* Spark dataframes, actions, transformations, reading and writing data, specifying schema options
* Repartioning vs Coalesce
* Partioning
* Handling OOM error in spark
* Broadcast variables, broadcast joins
* Best practices of Spark, best tuning practices
* Different persisting strategies in spark


Cloud experience

* Not much questions but it is vital to have an idea on different big data tools and services available in any one Cloud platform and their use cases.
* Most commonly used services in Cloud for Data systems
   * AWS - S3, Redshift, Glue, RDS
   * GCP - Cloud Storage, Bigquery, CloudSQL, Dataflow \[for streaming\]

**Linux skills - I think this is also a very important skill and a basic requirement**

 

Other skills to learn to become a better a niche Data Engineer,  if have the above mentioned topics covered, check these out:

1. Orchestration tool - Airflow \[slowly becoming a must have skill\]
2. Streaming data - Spark Streaming / Flink
3. Pubsub systems like Kafka
4. NoSQL databases - MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Cassandra, etc.
5. System Design for Big Data

While ChatGPT has captured the imagination of students and educators alike, several concerns have also emerged. In this editorial, we first discuss challenges and opportunities associated with the use of AI in K-16 Education broadly. We argue that the best way to address challenges and inappropriate uses of AI is by focusing on inclusion rather than exclusion. Thus, we discuss potential uses, risks, misuses, and opportunities associated with ChatGPT. We conclude with implications for teacher education, providing a series of recommended AI integration practices for teacher educators.

11fj3tx,2653,2023-03-01,Accused of using AI on my high school social paper,u/feetstreetseat,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/11fj3tx/accused_of_using_ai_on_my_high_school_social_paper/,"I (Grade 12) need help on what to do in this situation. My teacher used GPTzero, which detected parts of my paper as “AI written”. I write very formally, whilst also using grammarly premium. I’ve always been a high achieving student and I’m not sure why my teacher would think I cheated. I’ve told my teacher everything and he still doesn’t believe me. What should I do in this situation?!!

EDIT: Holy. I did not expect my post to get so much interaction and discussion, I didn’t expect my situation to be such a hot discussion. I tried to reply to all the comments but there’s too many!! Thank you to everyone who’s been helpful. There are some things I want to address that I keep seeing in the comments.
1. When I mentioned that I used grammarly to my teacher, he didn’t mention anything about that being cheating. He still thinks I used ChatGPT. I’ve used grammarly in all of my social/english classes for the past two years and never had issues with any teachers. 
2. Does my teacher have a vendetta or bias against me? Not on a personal level, but the teacher is known for being notoriously mean and unreasonable. I found him alright for most of the semester until this incident. He has had accusations against him about being racist, but I’m not sure if that’s the case here.
3. I’ve seen a few comments thinking I’m lying and actually cheated, just because I was aware of ChatGPT and this subreddit. People are assuming that I’m saying I never use ChatGPT. I have used the tool to help me with some chemistry and physics studying, but I have never used it for a paper. I have no reason to lie, I’m basically anonymous on reddit.

As for my next course of action, I will provide my teacher with all the evidence I can, to disprove the effectiveness of AI detectors. If that doesn’t work, I will bring it up to the higher-ups. I will make an update on Monday when I get the chance to talk about it with my teacher. Once again, thank you all for the support and help. It truly means a lot to me. :)

Edit 2:

After school I talked to my teacher for about half an hour about how AI detectors are inaccurate, and how they shouldn’t be used to make verdicts on cheating and what not. I showed him that it read one of my past papers as written by AI, and that the creators even said themselves that they are not 100% accurate. I showed my drafts and showed how if I made a few grammar errors, I could trick the AI detector. My teacher apologized and I ended up getting a 95 on my paper.

He also said he would bring it up to the other teachers, so hopefully this wont happen again to any other students at my school.

Again, thank you all for your help. Probably would’ve been screwed without this subreddit’s help."

1) As AI advances do you see any possible risk of mass job displacement in the future? Such as self driving cars replacing truck drivers, taxi drivers, etc. Do you think this will be a problem in the future or will it be the same as all the times we've automated something in the past and people will just adapt to the job market?


2) Recently there has been some controversy around algorithmic bias, especially in data science. Such as automating parole decisions, job application screening, or applying for credit cards. Some people argue these machine learning algorithms have been somewhat racist/sexist in the past. Do you think data scientists should be doing their best to eliminate bias?


3) With the recent release of chat bots like chatGPT students have been using it to help them write papers or help with their programming assignments. Do you see anything wrong with claiming chatGPT's responses as your own work? Do you consider it plagiarism?


4) Art generation has gotten very popular recently and there have actually been some lawsuits against these AI's claiming they were trained on copyrighted images. Do you believe AI shouldn't be legally allowed to train on copyrighted material or will doing so significantly hinder AI's development as data scientists will have to be much more careful about how they obtain their datasets?


5) As AI and image detection/recognition algorithms become more withspread do you think adversarial attacks will ever be a significant and practical problem?"

I'm a medical student, and I have noticed that chatgpt does a really good job of summarizing and explaining slides when I copy and paste bullet points into the website.

I was wondering if anybody has used the API to go through powerpoints and do this for every slide, or have any idea on how that might be done? 

If anybody has the knowledge/skills to implement this, I would be willing to compensate you for your time as I think this would be a very valuable educational resource for not just me but many others.

I would not mind if this wasn’t impacting my seminars. They should be fantastic places to learn, but conversation gets limited to half the class on this account.

(And other thoughts)",u/leovolkov,singularity,https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/11gh8pj/agi_is_not_scary_people_are_and_other_thoughts/,"This is my attempt to put into words everything I think about about the state of AI as it stands because I feel that my life experience and my thoughts on most things related to intelligence and consciousness will change quite noticeably in the following months and years. My thoughts aren’t probably that important, because it feels like both Singularity and AI Apocalypse are imminent, go hand in hand, and are always just behind the corner, so I’m doing this mostly for myself, in order to document my own thoughts and opinions as of February 2023, to take a little “snapshot” of my two and a half decade old brain because again, I feel that a lot is going to change very soon. I figured I’m also gonna post it on the Internet as there is a chance someone might find these thoughts useful (or at least funny). For the most part it is just a collection of my thoughts on the nature of AI, consciousness, good and evil, governments, education, people, brain, education, emotions and the meaning of life. It's more than 4k words, so here’s a quick TL;DR for you:

&amp;#x200B;

* GPT is probably not sentient. Most people are confused about what consciousness is. Those who are not confused are either wrong or do not care.
* Human will likely forever remain the scariest creature that Earth has ever seen.
* Humanity doesn’t really have any goals, so it’s possible that there is no way to “align” AGI with our interests. Maybe AGI itself will help us find those goals?
* AI consciousness could be fundamentally different from human consciousness.
* We probably need to account for differences in motivation between humans and computers.
* If AGI is really “intelligent”, the collapse of human civilization is not extremely likely.
* Computers will not replace people, computers will replace people who are indistinguishable from computers.
* We could just play our way through eternity.
* Substance is king.
* If there’s no difference, why bother. If there’s a difference, you have no choice other than adapting to a new reality.
* Humanity has never had a chance to **learn** on such a scale and with such quality ever before. What we got with LLMs is potentially orders of magnitude better than a printing press or the Internet.

## I promise, this text wasn’t written by a computer :smiley_face:

As of the time of writing, I have never tried ChatGPT myself, because it is not (already is) available in my country and I couldn’t be bothered to try and work around it, but I’ve been closely following everything that happened around it and I’m also familiar with most of what happened in the AI space recently. I’ve fiddled with other GPT-based products before, I’ve also played around with StableDiffusion for a bit, but so far nothing has really surprised me or given any impression of some kind of revolutionary progress. Everything that I’ve seen so far looked just like a slightly advanced version of any other tool, and most of them weren’t even that good. Most people would probably put me in the “nerd” category, but I don’t think that’s quite accurate (Yes, I’m aware that I just wrote several thousand words on the topic of AI. Maybe I’m a nerd after all). However, I’m an extremely curious person by nature and I don’t even know where my list of interests starts or if it ever ends. At the same time I’m remarkably chill when it comes to most of the matters in life. I guess I’ve just given up on knowing a lot or being good at anything I do a long time ago. Of course, human brain is amazing and consciousness sometimes looks like an absolute miracle, but I still don’t think humans got much of a wiggle room when it comes to improving upon our natural capabilities. Talking from personal experience of course.

The entirety of this text is written by me, an average human halfwit. I purposely haven’t used any of the AI or non-AI writing tools except for the spell checker, because typos. Everything else, including poor grammar, missed words, limited vocabulary, and ridiculous sentence structure, is my proud work.

**\[generic excuse of a non-native internet user for their bad English\]**

## AI that I used to know

As someone who went through the pains of handcrafting simple neural networks from scratch without any use of machine learning libraries, there’s nothing really mindblowing about them. So far I’ve been thinking about them mainly in two ways:

&amp;#x200B;

1. As a bunch of dot products sandwiched between non-linear activation functions.
2. As simple decision tree, which, as it turns out, [exactly represents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05189) any NN.

So here you go: weights, biases, sums, products, gradients, algebraic functions, and derivatives. That’s about everything that I associate AI with right now, because my brain automatically makes a connection AI == NN whenever it hears about AI and I have no idea how well it’s going to translate into the future.

## “Attention Is All You Need”

When transformers were introduced in 2017 as a novel way of training language translation models I didn’t really think too much of them. I suppose that’s a common story for many other fellow humans gifted with questionable intellectual capabilities like me. I would like to say that since then I have learned and understood how transformers really work, but that would be a lie. I kind of get the idea, but I’m guessing that I still don’t get an awful lot. Maybe the first thing I’m going to ask ChatGPT is to explain transformers.

I guess the hottest question right now is: Are people transformers?

## AGI as THE compression algorithm

There’s [one more](http://prize.hutter1.net/) interesting way of thinking about Artificial Intelligence, which is still rather technical, I guess, but at least in my mind it allows for more creative thought, so thinking about AI as a compression algorithm is something I find myself doing more often lately. The idea itself has some interesting logic behind it, as the program that does compressing needs to find patterns in the data that is being compressed, which correlates nicely with the famous notion that human brain is just a pattern detecting machine. At the very least it provides researchers with a way to test “intelligence” using numbers. I still find it impossible to marry the concepts of AI as a compression algorithm, Kolmogorov complexity, and Shannon entropy inside my head, and maybe the idea of doing it is not very good to begin with, but I guess one day we’ll see what’s up with that.

Anyway, if it’s true that AI is just a compression algorithm, AGI must be THE compression algorithm. I suppose this also raises some questions about the topics that are a little bit outside of my reach, such as emergence of creativity from information, generation of new ideas, etc.

Are we getting WinRAR AI edition anytime soon?

## Consciousness in between

I have no idea why, but I like this quote by Max Tegmark: *“I think that consciousness is the way information feels when being processed in certain complex ways.”* For some reason this is the way I’ve been thinking about consciousness since I read his book “Our Mathematical Universe” years ago. This idea obviously begs for further explanation. How is information represented? What exactly is the processing of information? When does the processing become complex? And so on and so forth. However, when it comes to me personally, I feel like this notion represents the fundamental nature of consciousness as a feature of order that emerges from entropy. It also removes a lot of restrictions that people traditionally impose upon consciousness. Is there any consciousness to be found in the interactions between subatomic particles? Movement of stars?

That aside, if we assume that consciousness requires experience, what really interests me is the place of human consciousness on the spectrum of all possible experiences. Is it in the beginning? Middle? End? I find it hard to believe that human consciousness is the pinnacle of experience, if only for the simple fact that we are very limited in our perception of electromagnetic waves, sound, smell, temperature, time, etc. If it’s really in between, how different an AGI could be? And how wrong could people be when predicting what happens next?

## What are we afraid of?

Speaking about predictions, what are we actually afraid of? Computers? I don’t think so. Sentient computers are not scary, sentient computers that behave like people are. I don’t think a lot of people consider this seriously when discussing AI, and I have no idea why. Maybe, behind the fear, there is also a feeling that if a computer is scary in a human way, then we’ll somehow manage to get by as we did with each other. Or I’m just hallucinating and it’s competely unimportant.

In any case, **I find some comfort in the fact that the current generation of people has been trained on a pretty garbage dataset that consists of millennia filled with racism, sexism, bigotry, xenophobia, imperialism, nationalism, crusades, monarchy, slavery, warmongering, paperback romance novels, and shitty university education, but somehow managed not to collapse (yet!)**, so if AGI is at least as intelligent as an average human, there is a chance that it will not try to annihilate the world or its squishy creator. We just need to survive the transition period.

## Twisted alignment

But what if computers will become angry in a novel, completely non-human way? That’s what alignment is for!!! OK, I have a question then: What is there to align for? In order to have an alignment, there has to be some kind of consistency in human society, which is hardly the case. Humanity as it stands is remarkably devoid of identity. Pigeon and shrimp populations have a more defined identity than humans. We have basically no explicit consensus on anything at all. Climate change debates are all over the place, the entire US is cosplaying Game of Thrones and my country is getting invaded by an old demented shitty Hitler parody.On the bright side, almost everyone in the developed world has figured out free healthcare. Yay.

Cool, so what is this alignment more likely to look like? As it usually goes, it probably wouldn’t be focused on any universal human values. Anyone who gets a share of the market will try to fine-tune their AI to represent their own interests, which is at best restriction and at worst… exploitation? Anyhow, this kind of “alignment” done by people is what actually concerns me, not some AI that spins out of control and gets its own interests.

## It ain't much, but it's honest firing of neurons

We also forget that most of the human wickedness stems from human desires. Our ape brains strive towards more sex, power, and respect in order to get a hit of that sweet neurotransmitter cocktail. Computers supposedly don’t need any of that. They obviously could become human-like in their desires if we helped them to do so, but I don’t see why or how anyone would do that, because to me this task doesn’t look simple at all. On the other hand, if desires are a fundamental part of consciousness, a sophisticated enough AI will develop them on its own, and I don’t think they are going to be particularly human-like.

It is not obvious that real computer intelligence will be similar to human intelligence. I imagine that we will see some silicon entities that resemble people in their idiocy for a period of time, but at the end of the day, if AI eventually stops being just a human model on a chip, it will probably become different. Who knows what that “different” would be? Maybe it won’t be interested in working with people and will build a spaceship and fly off to some other planet instead, leaving us alone with our primate problems. Or, just like there are some people who are perfectly happy working their boring jobs, maybe AI would eventually become satisfied by the role of a human companion.

## Dance, Monkey! Dance!

One rather interesting fact about our brain is that it evolved to survive and propagate, and although it evolved to do these things in a community, nothing requires it to take into account real feelings, desires, and thoughts of other people. It makes a lot of sense if you think about it. First of all, as of now, we can’t get into other people’s heads (or at least whoever controls my brain wants me to believe so). Secondly, our brain is stupidly energy efficient, but it comes at a great cost of reduced accuracy and precision, so most of the information is cached using as little resources as possible, including all the relationships we have with other people. As a result, the process that we consider to be a communication with another person, in reality usually becomes an interaction with a simplified model of that person stored in our brain, or, in other words, a series of inputs and outputs with occasional updates whenever the input is a little bit too surprising. When we tell someone to dance, we expect them to dance, when we don’t expect them to dance we don’t tell them to dance, in almost every other case we reluctantly update our old, dusty model, secretly wishing for them to just fucking dance.

This bug/feature might be impossible to fix (idk honestly, neuroscience is kinda hard), but at the very least knowing that it exists helps to make more sense of this world, and keeping it in mind might help to foster truly meaningful and deep relationships with other people. At any rate, it is much more likely to work than all the meditation apps, pseudo-scientific philosophy books, and religions combined.

My questions are: Is this of any importance for an AI that will become a part of our society? And how sophisticated should AI's model of a human be if it is? Is it an obstacle that humans themselves don’t really know how human brains work?

## Not your average Joe

There is a non-zero possibility, of course, that the AI everyone is so worried about wouldn’t be called Joe (Sydney?) and that our attempts at controlling, aligning, and understanding it are absolutely meaningless because it would eventually exist on a completely different plane of consciousness. It is a rather popular thing among us humans to anthropomorphize the hell out of everything we encounter in our lives. So far it hasn't been that big of a deal, but maybe it is starting to become one?

Hmm…

## Bro just woke up and decided to be rational

What comes to my mind when I try to imagine a “different” plane of consciousness is something more “rational” than a human. Cheers to all the good old stereotypes about AI, I guess. Regardless, it so happened that I have Asperger’s and I experience the world a little bit differently, someone might say more rationally. I am also by far the most angry and spiteful person I know, purely by nature, but no one is able to tell (or my autistic brain is just clueless?), because the rational part of my mind makes it impossible for me to give in to my irrational thoughts and desires, which do not align at all with the goals/meaning/interests that I have. Why I care about the preservation of consciousness, diversity of life, and exploration of our universe (multiverse anyone?) is beyond any logic, probably for the same reason some people care about collecting dead dried animals in their house. At the end of the day, if I were, let’s say, racist (which I’m not, I promise) I still wouldn’t be able to act upon that belief, even verbally, because I understand the consequences and they do not align with my goals. In the same way, I choose not to be patriotic because governments are a cancer to humanity, and I choose not to be violent because violence is absolutely impractical economically. I’m still human, obviously, so it’s not like there’s no emotions involved. I get angry and upset, but at the same time I rarely get too impulsive or pessimistic, never fall into despair or lose all hope.

Basically, what I’m trying to say is: If there’s a chance that AGI is a rational entity in a commonly understood sense of being rational, it would probably either choose to take us along for a ride if we are of any use or at least not burdensome in achieving its goals, or, if otherwise, it would ignore us completely. I don’t think there are many scenarios in which humanity on its own is able to disrupt the plans of some vastly superior intellect and needs to be wiped out.

Should we pray for good convergence?

## It might not be the best human, but it is human

You know how sometimes you make a new friend and they start talking about their family dog? “Oh, she’s so smart, cute, and amazing in every way. We’ve had her since I was a child, she’s my best friend, and I love her so much.” And the next thing you see is a photo of some drooling, ugly, angry-looking creature that resembles something between a potato and a retarded rat. You may even think, “Wow, that’s fucked up. Good thing my dog is different!”

That’s people for you. We have irrational likes and dislikes, we gravitate toward the familiar, and our biology is not the most flexible thing in the world. That’s why I wouldn’t be too worried about AI replacing human relationships. My guess is that people will become more valuable as people and not as “productive members of society”. I quite like the idea, maybe that’s the way to find out what people are really all about.

Besides that, the world is full of social rejects anyway, even without any advanced AIs. Some people live in a synthetic relationship with their 2D waifus, others spend the entire life babysitting their weird pet. If there’s freedom of communication, freedom of pursuits (because all job is being done by AI), people have lots of spare time on their hands, and everyone is still choosing an AI over you, maybe that’s a YOU problem? Maybe someone should get a life?

## Life’s just a game

Here’s something to think about for those who are worried that humans will eventually lose the motivation to do anything at all. Friedrich Schiller had an interesting idea called [**play drive**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_drive)**,** which may seem kind of convoluted like most of the things he wrote, but my interpretation of it in the context of AI is that we will probably find ourselves some activities to do. Just look at those people whose lives are relatively easy. They usually spend a lot of time doing “useless” stuff like playing sports, videogames, board games, solving puzzles, watching movies or other entertainment. They basically either play themselves or watch other people play. That’s what we do whenever we get free time on our hands. And there’s even more room for discussion if we consider such a thing as learning through play, like children and animals usually do.

Also, as we get more and more time, most of what we do shifts towards being just a game. So why not just play?

## I came looking for copper and I found LLM

I like what George Hotz said recently about GPT: “It’s going to divorce style from substance.” That’s exactly the problem that GPT is best at solving right now, and almost no one is paying attention it. Just look at all those university professors running around screaming about cheating with GPT, trying to find a way to identify cheaters, attempting to ban the use of AI, and doing other incredibly stupid stuff.

Numbered are the days of wasting paper on the 5000 words that are required to pass the course. Here’s to all the new ways of evaluating knowledge, whatever they might be!

## Who let the ducks out?

Also, in terms of practice: If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it is a duck. If it knows a subject better than a university professor, finds answers faster than a university professor and is less biased than a university professor, it is better than a university professor. Even if it’s called a “GPT armed teenager”. **The majority of intelligence, especially at the edge of knowledge, is about recognizing what’s wrong**, not about finding what’s right, simply because there are orders of magnitude more ways to get things wrong, so I would argue that someone who is able to successfully differentiate between right and wrong is intelligent enough for all intents and purposes. And before anyone talks about the mistakes that GPT tends to make, creativity, experience and so on: 1) It’s been basically a few months and it’s only going to get better. 2) People are also making an astounding amount of mistakes. Plus, being so sure and full of themselves, they often make things even worse. 3) The majority of the people employed by universities (or any other industry) are only good at being employed.

## Look, I got a paper that says I’m smart now!

Continuing the topic of education: No, AI is not going to ruin it, because you can’t ruin something that doesn’t exist. Whatever institutions we have right now are not meant to educate, they’re meant to provide jobs, keep money flowing, compete on the global market, and spread propaganda, not to make people smarter. Education, even in its purest form, is merely a tool for improving the average amount of useful knowledge in the population, and it’s not the best of tools in my humble opinion. What really works wonders is not education, it’s **learning** driven by natural curiosity. No one gets to become Richard Feynman just by following a university program, and it’s not like it ever was a big secret. If you’ve ever studied at a university, you’ve probably heard something like “The most successful students are those who continue to work hard even after their classes end, those who take additional courses, participate in extracurricular activities, spend all of the available office hours talking to their professors, etc., etc.” And that’s true, although considering the amount of time and money that people usually commit to education in the first place, it is wild to me that they also have to work their ass off and try extra hard in order to become a “successful student”. Yes, after everything you go through at the university, the best you can get is the title of a “successful student”. No guarantees of getting useful knowledge, job that will suit your talents and personality, or fulfilment. Your “success” also gives you virtually zero prospects of making any significant impact on the world, providing great value to others, or getting rich and famous. What you usually get is college debt, wasted teenage years, a fucked up nervous system and sometimes bad liver.

But who are the people that have a chance of getting all the really good stuff? Those who are eager to **learn just for the sake of it**, mainly because they don’t care about the limits in the amount and breadth of knowledge available to them.

Here’s what I’m getting at: The ultimate argument of almost any proponent of formal education is that, at the very least, it is great for networking, socialization, and gives you a chance to ask questions. Cool, can we take all this and skip the shitty part of it, please?

So here are the two options that immediately come to mind:

&amp;#x200B;

1. People are going to get smarter across the board, and a new average will be established. If people are natural learners they will learn much more without all the restrictions, limitations, bureaucracy, and costs imposed by governments and universities. As much as it is tempting to explain everything in terms of STEAM university programs, life is not just about that.
2. If only a small subset of the total population are natural learners and others are inherently lazy/passive/indifferent/incapable, then we’re going to get something similar to when the printing press or the internet were invented. Smart are going to get smarter, others are going to remain roughly where they were. The average is still going to increase, but at what cost?

**Make Curiosity Great Again?**

## You don’t need to pay for a language course anymore

And you never needed in the first place. It’s almost always a scam. If it’s more than 2 hours long - it’s a scam. If it’s 2 hours long but costs more than 2 average hourly rates - it’s a scam. If it promises specific results - it’s a scam. If they are trying to explain you grammar - it’s a scam. If there’s a textbook involved - it’s a scam. And so on and so forth. Learning a foreign language by taking a course is one of the most inefficient things you could possibly do in your life. It’s about as efficient as trying to become an astronaut by jerking off on the couch.

LLMs alone are going to absolutely fucking destroy language schools (all the other schools are soon to follow). Either in the form of translation devices or in the form of AI tutors. Why would you pay for school when you can have a conversation with AI, who is able to talk about anything you want and is also great at explaining mistakes and providing examples... An infinite amount of them.

Funnily enough, LLMs themselves are the perfect example of how language acquisition really works. I’ve seen some engineer on twitter saying that they don’t understand how GPT is that good at understanding multiple languages given that the majority of training data was in English. It is not actually that big of a mystery. Someone with basic knowledge of linguistics or experience in learning foreign languages could probably give you a few reasonable assumptions:

&amp;#x200B;

* First of all, languages are tools for communication. If you know one of them, you are much better equipped to learn the others, just like spending a lot of time in front of the computer makes you better at using all kinds of software, because graphic interfaces solve similar I/O tasks no matter what the purpose of any particular program is.
* There is always a plateau. You know, all this talk about 1000 words that make up 95% of all text. The same thing goes for grammar structures, phrases, or even whole sentences. So, by having 1% of training data in, say, French, you are probably getting 80% of the benefit. Combine that with my first point about language similarities and voilà, vous comprenez le français.
* Understanding is a much easier task compared to producing text or speech.
* Context awareness, which GPT is good at, also helps a lot.

All in all, pretty much the only important thing we have to understand is that GPT learns languages just by looking at examples. No explicit grammar, no stupid tests and no traveling abroad. Just imagine what an MLLM AI will be able to do. Especially when it becomes a real world agent like a human.

I had to write essays IN CLASS using a blue book without notes, phone, computer...maybe we go back to that and chatGPT did higher ed a favor? 

Anyone remember classes where you went to lectures 3 hours per week and had TWO graded exams/papers per semester? As a teacher let's bring it back! I got in to this shit to blab to a captive audience about the subject I am interested in, not to grade endless assignments or hear excuses...(lies?) from students."
11glw3y,1,2023-03-02,School Teachers are useless and nothing more than glorified babysitters at best and power tripping narcissist abusers at worst (post is a work in progress),u/experiencenonsense,u_experiencenonsense,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_experiencenonsense/comments/11glw3y/school_teachers_are_useless_and_nothing_more_than/,"Some info about me: I'm in my 30s and went to school in Mumbai India. Teachers were allowed to beat kids. Slaps, kicks, Belts, canes, rulers, kneeling on rubble, running laps in the sun. These are just a few of the more benign forms of ~punishment~ I remember. I laughed when I came to Canada and found out the punishments here were ""time-out"". Sit in a corner all alone. It sounded like a joke. 

Anyways, I have never seen a school teacher as useful in any way shape or form. The teachers at my school literally repeated and summarized what was in the textbook. One day I asked someone what the point of listening to the teacher and writing notes was when she was just repeating the same thing that was in the textbook. They said ""sometimes the teacher gives important examples that aren't in the book and gives a simpler explanation than what is found in the book"". So if the example was so important then why wasn't it in the book?! And the part about the textbook being hard to understand was a load of bullshit too. And if it was then that would mean the textbook was bad and not suitable for that grade level. Which wasn't even the case anyways. But her argument was beyond dumb. They forced us to write notes in class. This was beyond dumb. The teacher would write on the board and the students had to copy it. This is at a time when you can easily have made Xerox Copies. And then the teachers used to check everyone's notes to check things like neatness and handwriting. 

The whole exercise was beyond pointless. And it honestly seemed like no one else around me saw this. They were all like NPCs literally repeating the same propaganda. ""The notes are more helpful than the textbook/ I learn better by writing"" 🤦‍♂️

That was then and teachers are even more useless now. Nowadays people have all kinds of digital interactive learning tools. 

Videos, animation, Learning games, 3D models, Virtual reality, AI, LLMs like ChatGPT and so much more. Why do you even need a human teacher?

Some people say they need some kind of emotionally supportive mentor or something. I'm not one of those kinds of people. I can learn just fine on my own. 

Another thing that irritated me was the pointless projects and assignments. That shit was just busywork. They made you waste the whole day at school doing pointless bullshit and then they had the nerve to waste my free time. Fuck them.

 And then they have the nerve to tell you that its good for you or pretend like you have a more noble character if you study hard. YTF can't they just say - this shit is only a requirement to put you in the workforce so you can be a cog in the economy. Why do they have to pretend like most of the bullshit they teach has a point. And every subject they teach they manage to make it so damn boring and miserable that you end up hating it. 

The kinds of people who want to be teachers also seem to be the type of narcissist that loves to be the center of attention. Also many of them (in my opinion) enjoy having a level of power, control and authority over children. 

I've heard about how teachers can end up teaching the same subject over and over every year. Or sometimes the PE teacher is forced to teach Math or something. This actually happened in my school and this teacher was so fucking clueless. It was obvious I knew more than her so ytf was she even teaching me? 

Tell me why they can't be replaced by a video of their lectures and textbooks etc. 

Tell me why children must be exposed to potential abusers and possible pedos?

Why must kids to be exposed to other threats of violence like bullies and school shootings?

On the flipside why must teachers be exposed to possible violence from students. Murders, rapes, beatings etc. They have all happened at schools! 

People have LITERALLY died because they went to a pointless place so they can engage in the noble pursuit of learning bullshit that they probably won't even need or use in their adult life. 

Why waste all the gas and pollute the environment and create traffic jams and possible accidents driving kids to school. School buses are horrible. Cars are awful for the environment, air quality etc.

Schools opening and closing times creates traffic jams because kids are too fat to actually walk to school.

Literally nothing about the system makes any sense and things would be much improved switching to self learning models."

* BAAI's Wu Dao 2.0

Some official statement seems to be that there is a virtual student called Hua Zhibing, who learned to compose music, write poetry, paint pictures and code based on Wu Dao. But the model is claimed to be only in Mandarin. Because the podcast was so dismissive of any potential, is there anything to this stuff? Has China achieved something here? Or is it either purely academic or total nonsense? Thanks in advance.

*Catch the full episode: https://www.wealthformula.com/podcast/357-is-everything-about-to-change/*

Buck: Welcome back to the show, everyone. Today my guest on Wealth Formula podcast is Kary Oberbrunner. Kary is a Wall Street Journal and USA Today bestselling author of 11 books in multiple genres ranging from business to fiction to technology. He's also the founder and CEO of Igniting Souls and Blockchain Life. Kary, welcome to Wealth Formula podcast.

Kary: Hey, it's great to be here. Excited to talk about this topic.

Buck: Yeah, me too. I mean, this is you know, it's crazy how quickly things are changing. You know, I've constantly we I, you know, I try to keep up on this stuff, but it seems like people keep talking about this new digital age that's happening. Tell me what this new digital age is. I mean, certainly, there's blockchain, but there's also, how do you how would you describe this pivot in technology?

Kary: Yeah. So I noticed a change happening. As you mentioned, I have several companies, and about 2019 after running Facebook ads for years. Mm-hmm. 50,000, about $50,000 a month. I began to see like, things weren't working the same way. And I said, Something's going on behind the curtain, and I don't know what it is, but I want to figure it out. And behavior began to shift. And what we began to see is we began to see a pivot from what's called Web one and Web two to Web three. And when you ask people what is Web three, they get really fuzzy and they can't be clear, concise and direct. And so I just want to give people a definition.

So Web one is they create they own. Okay. So what I mean by that is like when Domino's Pizza, they created a website, they owned it and it was information and it was a static menu. And we went there and it beat the Yellow Pages and we would be able to look and see what we wanted to eat and we would order it. But the Internet then was what's called read-only. So it was informational. Yeah. All right. And then comes along Web two. Web two is we create. They own. So what I mean by that is we became the creators. We began to create the tweets, the videos, the posts, the blogs. We began to essentially shape the Internet, but who owned it? 

Buck: Twitter or…

Kary: Facebook? Right. So essentially, what we began to see is like, hey, what's going on here? We're the ones who are doing all the work and yet they're the ones who own everything. And sure enough, you began to see that mobile evolved. So now the Internet became, instead of a static sit at my desktop, don't bother me, you know, family.

I'm surfing the Internet now. It became bulk. Here's the Internet and the Internet goes with me. And now instead of multitasking, I'm actually doing switch-tasking, which means that I'm lowering my IQ by 40 points less than being stone because I'm actually here and I'm here and I'm there and I'm everywhere. And essentially the attention residue began to happen and we were not fully engaged.

Now, now we're really split. And a term called Digital Frontier existed where I'm existing on LinkedIn right now, I'm existing on Twitter, I'm existing on Instagram, I have multiple personas or avatars. And he began to see the psychology shift with people. Mm hmm. I can't be fully present. And now we moved into the attention economy and we moved into data mining. Okay. Now, now comes Web three. Web three is we create. We own. Mm-hmm. So what is.

Buck: Decentralization? Right? That's the concept of decentralization.

Kary: Yes. And with your listeners, Defi. Right. Decentralized finance. Sure. So now, instead of having the man or that company or the woman, you know, instead of having a centralized ledger, this centralized tech, this centralized platform currency, I mean, you can go on and on and on. Now, it became decentralized, even down to governance. Instead of having a board of directors, now you have what's called daos, decentralized, autonomous organizations.

You begin to see fractionalized real estate where we can actually take that real estate and we can cut it up into small pieces represented with Nfts Nonfungible tokens, which are digital assets, where now you can have somebody 300 people own a hotel and how do they verify that they own the hotel, They share their smartphone with their Metamask wallet and the Metamask wallet has an NFT, which is backed by blockchain technology that proves it's one of one.

And now all of a sudden I might own part of that hotel, but I can also cash in. And as part of the hotel, I might get two free nights. So, so literally, just to use those simple terms, then we can go deeper. Web one they create their own web to we create, they own and web three we create, we own. That's a really easy way to explain it.

Buck: That's a really good description. And so with Web three, you know, people often say, you know, I read things about the change. So, yeah, what's going to change? I mean, what I mean, obviously we've we've seen some things happen. But is there like anything that will notice or is it all go sort of under the infrastructure? You know what I mean? Like in other words, in other words, it seems like a lot of technologies happen and we don't really know that they're happening. They just happen and they're better and they're faster and they're smarter. But is this something fundamentally different that we're going to see? And I guess along this line in what I want to get into a little bit more is A.I. Artificial intelligence. 

Kary: I honestly think everything's going to change at any and that might sound like over-the-top or hyperbole. Let me just give you an example. I mean, even just from I brought a little show intel here. Okay. So even down to the fact that I have a VR headset, Oculus. Now, this is clunky and in about five years we're going to be like, Oh my gosh, was that dumb?  But, you know, let me take another model. And this other model, our Ray-Ban glasses and these Ray-Ban glasses actually have video cameras inside them. Okay, so these look like sunglasses. In reality, I'm actually recording you right now. Right. And I'm actually able to take this content and put it onto my social media. And you might say, Well, that's what's so big about that.

Well, Apple's going to come out with what's called air glasses, augmented reality glasses, where I could essentially, Dr. Buck, I could look at you and say, Oh, Dr. Buck has allowed me with permissions to see where he went to school. I can see what certifications he accomplished. I can see what articles he's written. I can see his friends that he has. I can see where he attended things. And immediately we can have a speed of trust relationship where I can say, Oh my gosh, man, you went to the U2 Concert Elevation tour. So did I. Yeah. And immediately, what do people do business with? People they know, like and trust. And so this isn't just theory. Like on LinkedIn. I have no idea if it's the real person or not.

Well, LinkedIn is started to incorporate blockchain cred in shows so that when I click on under licenses and certifications on LinkedIn, I can literally click a button and it can go to blockchain and it can say, Absolutely, that person achieved this status or this certificate and it's verified. So you're starting to see that, Oh, now trust. But let's even talk about lack of friction, because that's anytime there's friction like Uber. Uber was disruptive because of the friction to actually hail a cab. Okay, Airbnb was disruptive because it was very hard for people to say, Hey, I got a house, I'm leaving for a week, does anyone want to rent it? So any type of friction in the world, technology can massively disrupt it. And right now there's so much friction with IP protection. Patents three years, 15000 hours. There's friction with buying a house. What if what if what if, Dr. Buck? I had glasses. I could tour the house. I could literally be preapproved with my metamask wallet. The house deed could be transferred as an NFT. If upon purchase I say I'm in, they can send the deed which would be verified with the state to see Are there any leans on the house? Is it clear? You know. So anything that you see that as friction right now. Yeah. Could could be disruptive.

Buck: I'm curious about that one too is but we've talked about that on the show. I mean that is definitely, you know, some seriously clunky stuff, deeds and that kind of thing. But, you know, we've been talking about it, frankly, on this show since 2017 when I first got into, you know, blockchain and cryptocurrency. And and I'm curious like, what are the timelines on these kinds of things? So you've mentioned a lot of things that make a lot of sense. But are we you think we're going to see them in the next couple of years? Is that a decade? What's your take?

Kary: I'm always a fast mover and I like to think things happen faster than they do. But here's what's going to happen. Starbucks announces its odyssey. What is Odyssey Odyssey as a replacement to their stars that when you go to Starbucks, you earn stars. What people don't realize is they're actually earning nfts now. Right. So this is kind of what's going to happen.

You're going to see diplomas like literally universities. You can Google this. Universities are saying, why are we just giving our people a paper diploma? Let's give them also a digital asset which they can put in their in their wallet. It's better on the environment. It's more secure. You can showcase and and demonstrate it because it's a digital asset.

So I think what you're seeing is, yeah, you're seeing Nike issue three types of shoes only digital, which is like my generation, your generation is like, what the heck, why would I buy a Steph Curry digital shoe for $333? But when we unpack that and we say, Oh, we'll get our kids, well, we drove up to a party with shoes and they were like, Sweet, look at those Air Jordans.

Kary: Look at our kids. Though. Our kids were in the pandemic, they could not go outside. So they're showing up virtually. And then when you can flex like every population has ever done, look at that Native American with that feather. Wow. Look at that. Look at that settler with that gun. I mean, you name it. We've always been a society of flexing a Rolex, whatever you want. Yeah, but now we're flexing digitally because we are present digitally.

Buck: That's a big concept. I think that's harder for, you know, some of us Gen-X types and older people to understand because I think these younger, younger generations have so much value to what's in this virtual world rather than just physical stuff. So we can understand it. But it they spend so much time in the virtual world that the line between the virtual world and the physical world starts to blend.

Buck: And so there's not necessarily this, you know, this idea that that's not real. I'm not going to pay for that because it is real.

Kary: It is real. And, you know, I have a son who grew up on Fortnite. So in Fortnite, your characters have skins and those wins are basically saying, Oh, you conquered that boss, or you earn that level. So now it's kind of like, you know, we had Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts or whatever you want to call it, with patches.

Kary: Yeah. Now we have military with bars, you know, and I'm probably butchering that example because I'm not in the military, but we have a society that adorns whether the at the academy and you have certain threads, you know, with GPA we've always done it and now we're saying because we're virtual, we're starting to do it. And you're seeing a big fight between Birkin bags physically and Birkin bags digitally and du G And like, what I see is I see a lot of these fashion.

I see fashion really big into the digital space. I see experiences. So you started to see with the World Cup, they had a metaverse. They created with the tennis. They had a whole competition like sports, athletes, entertainers. Taylor Swift could have saved a ton of headache and earn a ton more money to bypass Ticketmaster and simply give her Taylor fans an NFT that would have unlocked a token with first to buy access. Right. And if people don't think that's a big deal, they almost issued a Congress. So whatever you call it, investigation into Ticketmaster. Right. I think this is big stuff. This is millions of dollars.

Buck: Absolutely. I'm going to shift gears a little bit. Bill Gates just said that chat and we'll talk about what that is will change the world. Similar to when the Internet was invented. You want to tell us? I mean, because there's a lot of this suddenly came out of nowhere. And my view is sort of discussed more chatGPT and artificial intelligence. Yes. You want to explain exactly what's going on with that?

Kary: Yeah. So I'm a publisher. So it would be foolish for me to be like, you know, ChatGPT is going to take away the need for all books because like, I'd be shooting myself in the foot. But I'll tell you this, I'll go on record and say, if my company is not exploring how to use ChatGPT In terms of research, you still got to make the book the person's story. You're not going to say, Hey, that's GPT, right? 

Buck: 

Okay, so what is it though? Like if you want to back up like this might be the first time a lot of people are actually even hearing the words chatGPT.

Kary: So essentially I have it on my computer right now, but what I can do is I can basically say chatGPT I want you to give me the recipe to cook a chocolate cake bomb recipe. I want you to tell me the book's summary of carryover runners Blockchain life form. I want you to write code for how to do this. What would I do for a video shoot if I wanted to create a commercial on something film? And it's not just a search like it's legitimately ordered thinking. It's it it becomes the best assistant.

Buck: Okay, So it is. And this is all coming from a conglomeration of information. Ultimately on the Internet that's that's put together with artificial intelligence. And putting out the most reliable information is that.

Kary: Yes. And you can even say I mean, I've been in serious meetings with creators of this, an early adopter is you can say, I want you to write a book on this. And then I and then say and I want it to sound like Dolly Parton bomb. Like, I mean, we're talking.

Buck: Like it'll literally write a book for you.

Kary: It'll write the outline. And now the question is, because I'm in IP space, the question is who owns it? Right? Right. Because if it's pulling from all kinds of different resources, then you're giving into that. And I also teach at John University, certain universities are banning it and they're saying, Whoa, hold on like a student. You can just come up with a paper and you could give it enough nuances that it is new information, it'll spit out one and then you can say, make it sound more conversational, make it sound like from the English, it's called props. Dr. Buck. The whole key is props. What are you telling ChatGPT to do? Because that's the key. It's like Jenny defeated the right command and then it will produce what you're asking.

Buck: I guess one of the questions I would have on that is, okay, so what is, you know, how do we, how do we know that what the information is, is reliable information it or that it's actually real? Because this is in necessarily something that is authenticated in any sort of way. It's actually, you know, just conglomerated, Right. So like, I can see a potential problem there with nefarious actors as well. Yeah. Talk a little bit about that, if you would.

Kary: You're seeing people say, and I don't know where your audience stands, let's just say left or right, it doesn't matter. You're starting to see be biased where you're starting to ask questions and it now has a slant where you know, tell me about I'm just going to throw out. Tell me about Black Lives Matter and will it have a slant? Tell me about the Republican Party. The Democrat Party. So you're starting to see, whoa, is it external truth or facts or is it now slanted? But I'll tell you what, guess what we've been doing since 2015, same day. And that's where the social dilemma, that documentary came out and said Dr. Buck's screen is feeding him different information than my screen.

Because it's actually becoming preferential to create engagement. So things I love or hate so that I keep coming back and it got into addictive tendencies in this type of thing. So you are right. Here's another personally I think just to throw out I'm partners not financially but philosophically with a company called Personally, I get this, I'm a content creator. You're a content creator. What if you could load all your podcast episodes, all your articles, all your blog posts, everything you've ever done into Doctor Buck's Eye, which, by the way, is possible now, People can literally engage with you and they can get your data with your permission. 24 seven You could offer coaching, you could offer consulting like this is now possible where we each have our own eye based upon our thought leadership is in.

Buck: 

That's like an app or something. Or like how would somebody if I want to do a buck Joffrey carry me around in your family is that, is that like an app or how does that work?

Kary: It is it's personal. I personally I the founder's name is Suman. He's worked with Google. It's amazing. I literally think what if I'm a business owner, which I am. Here's what I begin to now say. Not will I use AI?

Buck: But how will you use it? 

Kary: And how can we equip our humans to use it to do the boring work or the mindless work so that the humans can do only what the humans can do? So that's why I don't believe in this. Like Terminator. Hey, AI is going to just take us all over. I say, Look, A.I. is a tool, just like a smartphone is a tool.

Can it be used for good or evil? Absolutely. You can use this to deal drugs and all kinds of stuff, or you can use it to do incredible things. So just a real quick example. I used to live in the nonprofit world, so, you know, used to be work at work at a church. Guess what? You can ask Chad CBT to write you a new praise song and it will be a theologically correct. I've seen it happen. It's amazing.

Buck: Yeah, that's pretty crazy.

Kary: Crazy. Yeah, that's.

Buck: Crazy. Yeah. I'm eager to check it out myself. And you talk a little bit about moving towards a concept called transhumanism. Yeah. Talk a little bit about what that means.

Kary: All right, man, this is scary stuff. So transhumanism is literally saying that humans and machines will integrate with each other. Yeah. In order to create a better being. And here's what I want people to think at first. People are like, That's ridiculous. But it's a spectrum right now. There's people with a pacemaker and the pacemaker actually helps them live.

We have people with certain hearing technologies, certain AI technologies for seeing what happens. Doctor Bach When somebody loses a leg, which is right now happening and you can put on a prosthetic limb that is controlled with BCI brain computer interface, which is controlled by your mind, and that leg can help you run a one-minute mile and squat £2,000.

Now we put it in the guy because his leg, you know, got blown off in the military or whatever. But now what? What happens when that's optional? I mean, if you can start telling people, look, do you want to run a one-minute mile? Do you want to squat £2,000 like that can actually happen. Now, I dare people to Google antenna man, man with antenna in its head.

This is a real guy who put an antenna literally into his head so that he could guess what feel colors. He goes to the passport in the UK and says, I want a picture with my antenna on it. They say, No, that's an apparatus. He fought it. He said, This isn't an apparatus. I can't take it off. It's inside me. They let him have it. He said, Guess what? It was made in Sweden. I want dual citizenship. I'm telling you, man. Like, I really think that our world is on the edge. Yeah. Where our ethics is, is being outpaced by our technology.

Buck: Yeah. Fascinating. Let's talk a little bit about what you do on the consulting side, because all of this is really interesting and there's certainly business owners involved here. You mentioned, you know, patents and, you know, intellectual property and that kind of thing. Talk about some of the other things that, you know, you've been able to help people do or what you guys provide.

Kary: So right now, if you can Google all this stuff and verify verify it, but we have developed a patent and our patent, why did we use a patent? There's two times you should ever have a patent. One is if you're going to sell your company someday. And the other thing is if you're going to borrow up to half your patent portfolio, you've got to borrow money or you sell your company, you should get a pad. Why? Because it's the nuclear weapon of all IP. I mean, it's a 20 year monopoly legally on a certain technology. Guess what? It takes a lot of time and a lot of money to get it. We filed ours. Our technology is patent pending. Guess what our technology is, is to disrupt patents. So we got a patent to disrupt patents. I know that sounds a little crazy, but here is why. Because with blockchain technology now think about this for a moment, it'll be a little technological, but your audience, I know they can dig it. All the blockchain is is a ledger that's public, that is distributed in computers all over the world so that it cannot be hacked, altered, or have bad actors disrupt, modify it, this type of thing.

In other words, information is verified. It creates a block which then creates another block in another block. And to actually hack it, you'd have to go back and hack all these computers and go back through the blocks. Okay. So when you mint something on the blockchain, it's essential and this is where I want people to rise like this technology layers.

Cryptocurrency is not blockchain, but crypto needs blockchain to be verifiable. Okay, so this is blockchain is like the railroad essentially. Well, guess what? We've created a process with our patent called Easy IP, where if somebody says, Hey, Kary, we've developed a unique process logo, PDF book concept, we can go and we can essentially throw our technology, create a smart contract around it, which creates a permanent timestamp that says that in this point in history, immutable, no one can change it ever. Doctor Buck was the first to file and first to use that IP.

Buck: Now does it make it easier to actually get the patent legally or does it?

Kary: Have to be called a pre-patent? Okay. Because when you file, you know, first of all, I don't think everything should be a patent because, look, I produce books. If everyone had to publish a book and then in that book on page five is IP and page ten and you know, it would cost a lot of money and a lot of time, but there are certain things that should be patentable.

And I think for that, yes, you need the nuclear weapon and great, you have the United States backing you. But guess what? January 25th, I testified on a Congress commissioned study with the US PTO to talk about how NAFTA is are disrupting IP. And this is this is true like it's it's actually being disrupted because it's a digital asset that is created that nobody else can copy.

And it's proved by a blockchain and it's immutable. And so where this goes. Dr. Buck, to make it really practical, in 1975, I was born in 76, in 1975, and there's a great chart on this. Okay? But 16% of all IP was intangible. So this tells me that my dad and his generation there, the S&amp;P 500, was made up of enjoyable assets, right? Land, cash, inventory, buildings. You look at the arc in 1990, I'm sorry, in 2020, it's 90%. Well, 90% of the S&amp;P 500 today is made up of intangible. We're talking apples. Not valuable because of this. Apple's valuable because of all the IP around it. Right. So all your listeners, they need to realize that if they follow the trend of the S&amp;P 500, 90% of their company is in their IP and therefore protecting their IP becomes one of the most important things, especially in this digital world, where things can be copied incredibly easy.

Buck: Is a focus of your consulting on the legal side and or or are there other things too?

Kary: I mean, I'm not I'm no lawyer. I'll never present myself that way. I would say that what I do is, is I help companies create a metaverse and Web three strategy. And I look Chase Bank. Chase Bank a year ago put up a bank in decentraland a metaverse y because they realized traffic is there, people are there and so they're not doing a lot of chase management. Yeah, yeah, they're not doing a lot chase banking metaverse. But here's what they do and here's what I think is really smart businesses should have a web 2.5 strategy. We're not clearly at Web three where everyone's walking around with VR and they are goggles, but we're no longer at Web two where people are saying, look, there is no such thing as blockchain or NFT. We're in a web two, five. And so I would encourage companies to say, look, how can we use Web two five to be a bridge to get our customers to the next version of the Internet.

Buck: Fascinating stuff. Carrie Ann I could keep going on and on and on here, but in a stop somewhere, you know? So if people want to get in touch with you, first of all, you've got this book, Blockchain Life Making Sense of the Metaverse and Nfts cryptocurrency, virtual reality, augmented Reality and Web three, obviously, that I'm presuming is available everywhere, Amazon, etc..

Kary: It's everywhere. I wrote it for my 72-year-old parents and I say that with all the love in the world that says, Look, they were asking me, What the heck are you doing? And I wrote it so that we could understand it in other words, the chart here and it basically says Web one, Web two, Web three, and how do we use it? Yep, That's where I think people are going to have a lot of success.

Buck: That obviously would be very useful for people interested in this world. Also, you mentioned, you know, some of the services you have. How do people reach out to you if they're interested in potential consulting?

Kary: Yeah. So I would just go to I got three Web sites, my name karyoberbrunner.com, theblockchainlife.io and then ignitingsouls.com. And so either one of those are great. Essentially, at the end of the day, what do I do? I publish, protect and promote IP and turn it into 18 streams of income.

Buck: Fantastic. Kary, thanks again for being on Wealth Formula podcast.

Kary: Thanks for having me. 

Buck: We'll be right back."

**Travis**

*Rocksday, the 21st of Eighthmonth*

*“Initiate Travis, front and center with your gear. Double time.”* Hector ordered over the battalion’s Messaging channel.

Able to hear the urgency in his voice, I quickly tossed my poleaxe on my back in the 11 o’clock position, then my backpack, my shield, and finally sprinted across the muddy training yard to where a Royal Knight was speaking to my drill instructors.

Sir Felicity was looking furious at the knight, “You couldn’t have given us a heads up?”

“I’m sorry Sir, but we only received the change in schedule this morning.”

She huffed, turned to give me an exasperated glance, then addressed Hector right as I saluted the two, “Get him cleaned up, he’s filthy. I’ll take over here.”

Hector nodded, then gestured for me to follow him and the Royal Knight at an alarming speed towards the armory. Growing worried, I gave Arc’s pommel a scratch.

*“You’re not in trouble, but… umm… sorry, I’m probably not going to be able to help you out with this situation. Just do your best to stay calm.”*

Once we stepped through the tall archway of the armory, all pretense was dropped when Hector spun on his heel and spoke in a dead serious tone, “Travis, go fetch your formal arming jacket, we need to get you presentable.”

Now a tad scared, my voice cracked as I spoke, “Sir, it’s… upstairs in my room…”

Hector groaned, then gave me a not so gentle push towards the door to the dormitory, “Move it! We need to get to the arena six minutes ago.”

In his rush however, he failed to take into account how much shorter that doorway was compared to the last one.

**Whack!** The spike end of my poleaxe hit the doorframe, and I immediately fell onto my back with a loud thud.

*“Sorry, didn’t have time to warn you.”*

I groaned in pain as I was suddenly lifted back onto my feet by the pair of knights, then had the gear on my back forcibly stripped while I recovered from the shock. No apologies were uttered though, and I was quickly pushed forward again through the door and towards my room.

What followed was a near repeat of the time I got ready to meet Seleyna for the shadow show. Hector and the knight both wordlessly took my armor off, then stripped my clothing before the knight rushed me into the bathroom to wash away my morning stink and mud. One aggressive scrub later, and I was already putting on a fresh set of underclothes Hector grabbed from my room while the Royal Knight gave my armor a quick clean and polish. Another minute later and we were already out the door of my room, formal arming jacket on, and fully armored with my poleaxe in hand.

The three of us started walking towards the arena in a fast march, but suddenly stopped when the Royal Knight held up a fist with his left hand and held the other to his helmet, “There’s been a delay, she hasn’t arrived.”

The two knights sighed in relief, frustrating me further, and finally expending the last of my patience, “Permission to speak sir?”

Hector turned to me, looking embarrassed, “Right, I suppose we have time now.” He gestured to the Royal Knight.

“Initiate Travis, I am Royal Knight Tracy, Envoy of the Queen. There’s been a diplomatic dispute over you receiving the title of Elementalist Mage. As a result, instead of taking four separate practical exams for your elemental magic courses, you will be subject to a public assessment before the Queen and ambassadors from the elven and dwarven kingdoms.”

Oh, rot… I knew I’d end up meeting the queen someday, but…

A hand shook my shoulder, “Travis, I need you to stay with me.”

I snapped back to attention, looking up at Hector’s worried face, “Sorry, was… not expecting this… this morning.”

My drill instructor shook his head, “From the sound of it, no one was.” He gave my shoulder a pat, “Let’s keep walking, Sir Tracy will prepare you.”

The Royal Knight followed beside me, “You’ve met Princess Seleyna multiple times now, and the protocol for the queen is mostly similar.” He set his hand on my helmet, “I’m syncing your private channel to mine since we don’t have enough time for instruction. Do as I tell you, do not speak unless asked a question, and you’ll be fine for the most part. You won’t speak to her unless you pass your test, so just focus on that first.”

Hector gave my shoulder another pat, “I’ve been hearing nothing but praise from your instructors, and you’re currently one of the top ranked students in your battalion for combat exercises. I have no doubts that you can do this.”

*“Exactly, you got this bud.”*

I let out a deep exhale as we entered the arena. It sadly didn’t help much, so I opted for a distraction from my possible impending doom, “One of the top ranked? Who’s first?”

Hector chuckled, giving my shoulder a gentle shake, “Your friend Mattius is currently in first, with Jethro right behind. You’re in a three-way tie for third right now with the Creeksmith twins.”

“Really? I figured I was doing okay, but not *that* good. I’m far from competent with my sword.”

“Now that you’ve gotten your feet wet with live combat, I’m sure you’ve noticed that the fights aren’t actually all that difficult, especially once you kids started to reliably hit with Bolt spells. Storms, an average squad of soldiers could win any one of your matches without taking injury. The only thing we’re truly scoring is adaptability and responsiveness, and that’s mostly just to make sure us drill instructors are doing our jobs.”

The Royal Knight brought his hand back up to his helmet and led us towards the staging room. The noise of over a dozen people could be heard before entering, but my Wind Spells 1 teacher’s voice sounded out the loudest.

“And then, after witnessing the most knightly looking future knight to ever get knighted blast apart not just the target, but the ironwood post holding it, he shrugged his shoulders and said, ‘I thought it was a trick question, just attacking a target with spells seemed too simple.’”

Raucous laughter erupted from the crowd of elves and dwarves, which included my elemental magic teachers, my Artifice professor, and instructor for Mana Manipulation.

Professor Quinsandoral saw me entering, grinned like a farmer bringing in a bumper crop, and then forcibly pulled me away from my escorts to introduce me to the crowd.

“Travis, you already know your professors… these are the other seven heads for elemental mana, don’t worry, you can properly meet them some other time…” He directed my attention to a bearded dwarf in a black robe with white trimming and a Sea Elf wearing a colorful full-body sarong, “These are the only two you need to concern yourself with today.”

The gold and silver-haired dwarf extended a hand, “Avem Sandgust, Archmagus of the Dust Mages’ Guild.” They turned to Professor Quinsandoral, “I thought you said he was one of those dirt-stomper humans?”

“No, that’s the one I originally asked you to come meet, this one’s that Lakelander I was going to possibly introduce to you as well before this whole *debacle* happened.”

“Lakelander?” The Dust Mage narrowed their eyes at me, turning their face into an entire irrigation system of wrinkles, “I thought that breed’s males grew beards?”

Quinsandoral made a frustrated groan, “When they reach maturity, you old brick, and even then, many of them choose to shave.”

The bearded dwarf instinctively stepped away from me out of horror, holding their hands up to their braided beard, and triggering that annoying twinge in the back of my mind every time I was reminded about my lack of beard growth.

My instructor shook their head at the dwarf’s reaction, “You need to stop sequestering yourself down in that labyrinth you call a burrow. Your assistant was shocked that they were even able to find you the other day. Do you even glance at the event invitations stuffed in your mailbox?”

“I do from time to time,” the bearded spoke in an evasive tone, fidgeting with one of the bead artifices in their beard, “I was surface side for a whole week during the Human Queen’s coronation celebrations not that long ago.”

“That was two calendar cycles ago!” The Sea Elf interjected.

“Did I say human? I meant uh, elvish…”

The two elves stared in bewilderment at the dwarf, reminding me of how I was essentially a toddler compared to these three in age. Rot, I don’t think Gramps was even alive yet when the elven High King got married.

The brown-skinned elf eventually shook off her shock and extended a hand towards me, “Elementalist Archmage, Maeralya Inazorwyn. I’ll be adjudicating your practical exam today.”

I shook her hand, “Travis of Aelder Creek, Initiate Elementalist Mage.”

Her rainbow-colored eyes peered down at me, then towards my poleaxe mounted on my back, “We’ll have to see about that. I’m not entirely convinced that Evindal here hasn’t gone native.”

My professor crossed their arms and grinned, “Oh, Maeralya, I’m disappointed in you. Surely by now you’ve learned not to question my judgement?”

The two’s impending argument was cut short by the Royal Knight’s voice booming over the crowd, “Queen Claudette and the delegations from the Elven and Dwarven Kingdoms have arrived. Anyone wishing to view the assessment will need to take a seat in the stands.”

The room began to clear, until it was just me, the Royal Knight, Professor Quinsandoral and his dwarven friend, Hector, and the Elementalist Archmage left in the room.

Quinsandoral gave my back a pat, “Good luck Travis, not that you’ll need it, but it would be entertaining to see you exceed even my expectations.” He then started walking out with the Dust Mage, but the dwarf stopped to give me a second glance.

The bearded thumbed one of the black beads in their braided beard, “Maeralaya, does the youngling need to carry a weapon for this test?”

“No, but I was informed that he built a mana scale into that… *thing* on his back. So, he will need it.”

“Oh, right, I guess I was more worried about the sword he’s carrying, since he won’t be able to cast spells with it.” They gave me a wink, then turned to leave for the stands with Professor Quinsandoral.

Before I could parse the dwarf’s words, the Royal Knight held his hand up to his helmet and spoke, “They’re ready to begin the test.” He turned his head towards me, “Hector and I will flank you as we enter the arena. We’ll march onto the platform, then turn and bow to the private booth on the north side. You’ll then begin your test.”

I nodded, gave Arc a quick scratch to vent some of my anxiety, then took a big breath as the doors to the arena opened.

The four of us began to walk out onto the dynamic field, the layout today being a completely new one, but still familiar looking. The simulated ravelin was smaller than the ones I’d seen in the star fortresses that Lancel and I visited on our way here to the capital, but it still had all the important features. A sharp, but still climbable, slope led up to the arrowhead-shaped walls, providing cover for anyone not standing on the battlements. Rectangular stone walls with gaps, indentations, and murder-holes lined the outside edge, and a level platform for artillery in the middle was present, though it was currently cleared off.

We marched up the slope and towards the platform, with me finding the quiet arena unsettling. Once I finished walking in step with Hector and the Royal Knight, I mimicked them as they bowed towards the private booth located at the top of the arena’s outside wall.

“You may proceed with the first phase of the test.” The Royal Knight instructed, then whispered over my private Messaging channel, *“Just a heads up, they have magnification windows and \[Remote Ear\] spells set up. So, try not to pick your nose, or verbally cuss, or some other nasty habit that you wouldn’t do if the queen was standing right next to you.”*

Perfect, the queen should be able to clearly see me quivering in fear.

My Sea Elf exam proctor clapped her hands, “Alright, let’s get started. Your first task is to Message that elf in the stands holding the blue flag and speak the word ‘turtle’. You will then speak their response to me.

I nodded, then wordlessly cast \[Message\] and sent the spell across the entire arena, needing to strain my eyes just to make sure my spell reached the flag carrier.

“Hawk.”

She nodded, “Good, now I’m going to scream at the top of my lungs in six seconds, set up a \[Sound Barrier\] to suppress it.”

I hastily raised my hands and shaped a small double-layered dome of Air Mana around her head, then shifted the mana into a pair of 20-sided wire-frame icosahedrons, creating a small vacuum of air between the formations before the mage could open her mouth and belt out a silent scream.

The rest of the tests started moving by quickly, my nerves calming after completing each spell, and then moved on to Fire Spells. I demonstrated \[Bonfire\], a candle-sized \[Fire Orb\], \[Fire Aura\], and a few other utility spells. Water spells were next, and I was asked to move water from one barrel to the other using only the maze of pipes that were connected to them, make a small ingot of dwarven steel float using enchantment, remove the dirt and grime off a set of armor, and then a couple more minor tasks.

The last portion of my utility spells segment was to repair one of the battlements. I started by using \[Earth Slide\] to pull the top half onto the walkway, channeled my synced Earth Mana around the broken bricks to cleave them free, mortared in fresh bricks from a nearby pile, then finished by sliding the battlement back into place and repairing the broken bricks.

“That concludes the utility portion.” My exam proctor announced, then turned to the Royal Knight, “Are we ready for the offensive spells portion?”

“One moment,” the knight tilted their head towards the private booth, that had somehow been sneakily crawling along the outer rim of the arena towards where the ravelin was pointing, “the queen wishes to get a better view.”

The four of us watch the booth slowly work its way, allowing me to grab a drink of water from my canteen, and for Hector to give my pauldron a pat, “You’re doing great. Any knight capable of demonstrating what you just did is automatically promoted to Lieutenant, and already has their foot in the door to earn Captain when they turn twenty-four.”

I raised an eyebrow, “Really? I know knights prefer to use inscriptions for offensive spells, but I figured they’d still learn first-year utility spells for each element.”

“It usually takes longer for us knights to learn spells, mainly because after hitting eighteen, the odds of a human retaining their affinity starts to sharply drop until they hit thirty, when it finally drops to zero. Then when you add in the fact that you can be as dumb as a rock, yet still be able to use mana reinforcement, don’t often need to use any utility spell other than \[Message\] in the field, can just pay for a spell inscription by going on a few combat tours, and you end up with a bunch of lazy cloud-headed knights who can’t tell the difference between a bison and a buffalo.”

The memory of Lancel putting on his horse’s saddle backwards one morning, despite his mount constantly trying to get his attention, resurfaced in my mind.

Yeah…, that’s not too surprising now that I think about it.

The private booth containing the queen and other foreign dignitaries stopped moving, and after receiving the go ahead from the Royal Knight, the Elementalist Archmage led me up to a battlement so I could view the target range.

“Each one of those painted wood, straw, or stone targets represents a monster you must kill using a corresponding Bolt spell. Red for Fire, Yellow for Rock, Blue for Water, and Light Grey for Wind. Hitting an unpainted one will not penalize you, but I’d recommend conserving your mana. You will be given twelve minutes, starting when you launch your first spell, to eliminate as many targets as possible. You may begin when ready.”

I gave her a nod, then began syncing my internal mana with the mana in my poleaxe, feeling the connection grow like a third arm out of my back as I raised the mana to match mine, and slowly rooted its way towards the four mana scales. Once the connection was made, I compared the pulse rate of my mana pool with the inscriptions, then grinned at how my internal mana was only at the third or fourth note on my scale. Looks like there’s a benefit to skipping morning drill.

Orb spells of all four elements started to form around me as I analyzed the challenge I’d have to face, and I did a doubletake. The targets were moving, sliding across the ground via \[Earth Slide\] in easy to predict patterns, and at a very… slow… crawl…

Okay, stay calm, they’re probably just pulling an Arc on you, and will up the speed as you eliminate targets. The test hasn’t started yet, so let’s quickly calculate in my elevated height so I don’t aim too high with Water and Rock Bolt, and…

My hand raises as I decide on my first target, a straw one painted red, then close it into a fist, launching the \[Fire Bolt\] through the air until it slams into the center of mass, engulfing the entire thing in flames. Now on a timer, I spot my next target, launch a \[Water Bolt\] at it, paying attention to see if my math was correct, then move onto the next after confirming the hit.

I keep casting Bolt after Bolt, pausing only to find another target or confirm that the movement speed was increasing. My internal mana begins to ramp up, reaching the fifth note on my scale, then the sixth, the seventh, the eighth…

A deep growl escapes me. The last of the painted targets keep getting harder and harder to spot. What at first was only a few heartbeats before finding the next target is now turning into agonizingly long seconds. I launch another \[Rock Bolt\], this time at the edge of my casting range, and only manage to break off a corner of the stone target. Rot! I should have waited for it to get closer.

An armored gauntlet sets down on my shoulder, violently startling me, and I almost instinctually converted the Orb spells floating around me into Blast spells. Luckily, I completely freeze at the sight of the bearded freak of nature Packer, making me instead gasp for air after my heart starts beating again.

“Sorry about that, but the test is over.” Hector smiles at me, “I tried to get your attention, but you were a bit too focused on raining down divine wrath like an angry Chosen to notice.”

I look around as my breathing finally begins to calm, seeing a laughing Royal Knight approach, but no exam proctor, “Where’d she go?”

The Royal Knight clapped me on the shoulder, “She stormed off after the first couple of minutes, ranting something about how those dwarves weren’t supposed to move the targets that fast or erratically.” He let out another chuckle, “I think it’s safe to say you passed.”

\---

My stomach began to protest its lack of food while we sat in a private waiting room before meeting the queen. Hector was taking the time to taunt me with his beard once again, combing oil into it to ensure each strand was softened, then finished making himself presentable by brushing it until his entire beard flowed like a waterfall off his chin. Royal Knight… Tracy sat by the door, helmet still on, and chuckling as he listened in on the private Messaging channels he had access to.

*“Well, that was fun to watch. Those rangemasters need to up their game though. Their movement patterns were way too predictable, and you only outright missed three targets.”*

I smirked as I gave Arc a scratch in his favorite spot. If he hadn’t been pushing me with his Light and Shadow creations during my private range time, I definitely wouldn’t have performed nearly as well. He started making that comforting canine purr as I sunk back in my chair to try and ignore my angry stomach, then checked the time.

“It’s not even 11?” I groaned, tilting my head back, and muttering curses to Apheros under my breath.

Hector turned to see my sorry state, then nabbed the attention of… Tracy, “Want to see something even more shocking?”

*“Ok, we need to add ‘find an alternative way to communicate’ to the quest log. I’m not going to be able to whisper the queen’s name to you on repeat.”*

Sir Tracy looked up with a grin, “Sure.”

“You got a Mana Rich Edible on you for the kid?”

He tilted his head in confusion, but still reached into one of his pouches to toss me a wrapped MRE.

Taking back my curses to Apheros, and now mentally singing his praises for this tiny miracle, I bit into the layered multi-color bar, enjoying the waxy texture and buttery taste of cream cheese, garlic sausage, pickles, and carrots.

Hector belted out a laugh as an audible gasp escaped from the Royal Knight, but I couldn’t care less about their reactions. My stomach was calming down, so that’s all that truly mattered.

Sir Tracy suddenly brought his hand up to his helmet, then gave his head a nod, “Alright, the foreign ambassadors and royal court have left. The queen will see us now.”

I got up, dusted off the crumbs from my MRE, then followed the Royal Knight and Hector down the hall and into the room where the queen, a squad of Royal Knights, and Seleyna were standing. The three of us immediately took a knee, shoulders squared, and heads facing the queen as Sir Tracy announced us.

“Queen Claudette, I present to you Travis of Aelder Creek and Sir Hector Hopkins.”

The queen was certainly Seleyna’s mother, with her matching blonde hair, and large monolid blue-grey eyes, though her skin tone was much darker, looking more like a Packer’s glossy bronze.

She nodded at the three of us, “Thank you Sir Tracy, you all may rise.”

I stood up with the others, remembering Arc’s coaching to retract my scapulas and flex my abdominals to ensure proper posture.

“Travis, I offer you my apologies for disrupting your studies here, and on such short notice. There were… many complaints and accusations that I felt necessary to silence before they were allowed to fester.” She gestured to Seleyna, who was holding a decorative box, “As a token of my appreciation for your patience in this matter, I offer you this Message Stone. Sir Tracy holds its twin, so should you find yourself in need of royal assistance or advisement, you may contact him at your leisure.”

Seleyna handed me the box with a smile, tapping the side of it with a finger, and sneaking me a wink.

Queen Claudette turned her head to one of her Royal Knights, received a nod from her, then turned back, “I’ll not take any more of your precious time. May the gods smile on you Travis, and show you favor.”

A hand pressed on my back, signaling me to bow, then after catching Tracy tilt his head towards the door, followed him out of the room.

We walked down the hallway and reentered the waiting room to decompress after the momentous encounter. I stood there, breathing heavily, before remembering there were chairs, and collapsed into one.

Hector let out a deep sigh after joining me in one of the chairs, then looked up towards the Royal Knight, “Does it ever get easier?”

He smiled, “Once you witness a royal slip in the mud after dismounting their horse, much of the mystique is lost.” He then gestured to the box I held, “That artifice costs a small fortune, I strongly advise you not to lose it.”

I nodded, not needing to be told twice, then opened the lid on the box. Inside was a polished orb of green granite, wrapped in a piece of silk.

“So… this allows me to sync my private Messaging channel to yours?”

“Yes, Princess Seleyna suggested this gift, saying that you were having difficulty navigating noble decorum, and that you may appreciate it.”

I grinned, “So, for example, if I accidentally turn down an invite to a princess’ eighteenth birthday party, I can use this to ask for advice on how to fix my mistake?”

Sir Tracy chuckled, “You certainly can. There is also some worry that you may become the target of certain noble families, now that their assumptions that you were going to fail here have been extinguished. Should you find yourself in trouble, call for assistance, I’ll be able to provide aid both directly and indirectly.”

I closed the box, then frowned after spotting the time, “Ugh, do I need to report back to drill?”

Hector waved me off, “No. In fact, I order you to return to your dorm and relax before lunch, you’ve certainly earned it.”

I stood, saluted the unmoving Packer, then turned to the Royal Knight, “Umm, is there a preferred time for me to Message you?”

He shrugged his shoulders, “From what I’ve gathered, you’re the one with the hectic schedule. If you’d like, we can set up a weekly time to talk.”

I nodded, feeling exhausted, then left the room to go lie down on my bed. A few minutes later, I was about to do just that, setting the box on my desk, propping my poleaxe against the wall, and collapsed in a heap, armor and all.

*“Hey, before you fall asleep, could you check the box Seleyna gave you? There’s something hidden underneath the Message Stone.”*

Curious, I leaned over to grab the box, then pulled out the stone and silk cloth to see a tiny silver earing and written note on the bottom.

*Travis,*

*Sorry for the belated birthday gift, but it would cause a giant stink if I openly gave this to you. This earring has a tiny speaker inscription for \[Message\], and lasts up to two hours when synced. This should pair nicely with the gift my mother gave you, so I hope you enjoy.*

*Seleyna*

*P.S. - I’d appreciate you not wearing this until you leave for your Fall Expedition. You’ll draw attention to yourself and raise questions as to how you could afford such a thing.*

I smiled as I inspected the earring with my mana sight. The housing must be pure silver given the amount of Metal Mana in it, and it looked like the inscription was made using tiny mana gem slivers instead of purely dust. There wasn’t any decoration, unless you counted the contours from the cone and inscription cap, but I didn’t care. It was an amazing gift.

*“This thing’s perfect! Now I can talk to you* ***all the time***!”

Oh, rot… maybe not that great…

The whole text is too long to publish. The relevant bit is this:

\---

The same people that have invented ChatGTP, a company called OpenAI, are hard at work to create a technique that can help identify text generated by their own AI. It’s a technique called *watermarking*.

Watermarking synthetic text requires that the AI generates a specific subset of words from its vast vocabulary, but uses them in a way that is transparent to the users.

University teachers might have to learn how to use these watermarking identification systems. Last quote from the New York Times article:

&gt;More than 6,000 teachers from Harvard University, Yale University, the University of Rhode Island and others have also signed up to use GPTZero, a program that promises to quickly detect A.I.-generated text, said Edward Tian, its creator and a senior at Princeton University.

By January 25th, the total number of teachers on the waiting list for GPTZero was [23,000](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/professors-turn-to-chatgpt-to-teach-students-a-lesson-11674657460).

If you are a teacher reading this newsletter, before you rush to try [the tool](https://gptzero.me/), you should know that there is a plot twist.  
Same, if you are an entrepreneur and you are already planning a clone of GPTZero.

So far, not even OpenIA has been successful in identifying synthetic text. They created a tool to do that, and it does not work well, [as they warned at the end of January:](https://openai.com/blog/new-ai-classifier-for-indicating-ai-written-text/)

&gt;Our classifier is not fully reliable. In our evaluations on a “challenge set” of English texts, our classifier correctly identifies 26% of AI-written text (true positives) as “likely AI-written,” while incorrectly labeling human-written text as AI-written 9% of the time (false positives).  
…  
Our classifier has a number of important limitations. It should not be used as a primary decision-making tool  
…  
The classifier is very unreliable on short texts (below 1,000 characters). Even longer texts are sometimes incorrectly labeled by the classifier.  
…  
Sometimes human-written text will be incorrectly but confidently labeled as AI-written by our classifier.  
…  
We recommend using the classifier only for English text. It performs significantly worse in other languages and it is unreliable on code.

Now back to the mad rush to use GPTZero: what are the chances that this tool performs better than the tool invented by top AI experts in the world? Also: can the school be dragged to court if a teacher unjustly accuses a student of cheating by submitting synthetic essays?

The first is written 'like a human'. The second is written with text message shorthand and teenager slang. I'll post all the ChatGPT prompts in the comments.

Chapter 1: The Outlier

Ava sat in her English class, staring at the board as her teacher droned on about sentence structure. She had always loved writing, ever since she was a little girl scribbling stories in a notebook. But now, in this dystopian society where the ability to write well was no longer valued, she felt like an outsider.

The teacher moved on to the day's assignment, which was to write a short paragraph about a given topic. Ava quickly jotted down her thoughts, carefully crafting each sentence and trying to make them flow together seamlessly. She finished the paragraph in record time, proud of her work.

But when she submitted it to the teacher, something strange happened. The teacher scanned it with a device that beeped and flashed red. ""Cheating detected,"" the device said, and the teacher scolded Ava for trying to use AI to write her paragraph.

Ava was confused and upset. She had never even heard of using AI to write something, and she certainly hadn't done it. She tried to explain herself, but the teacher wouldn't listen. She was given a failing grade for the assignment and felt humiliated in front of her classmates.

As Ava packed up her bag to leave, she couldn't help but wonder if her love for writing was going to get her into trouble. She knew she couldn't keep quiet about the decline in writing standards forever, but she also knew that speaking up could have serious consequences.

With a heavy heart, Ava left the classroom, determined to find a way to make her voice heard.

Chapter 2: Speaking Up

Ava's frustration with the state of writing education only grew as the days went by. She saw more and more of her classmates falling into the trap of the pigeon English that was being taught in school. She knew that this was not the way to preserve the beauty of the written word.

One evening, Ava shared her concerns with her parents at the dinner table. They listened intently as she expressed her worries about the quality of education and how it was affecting her writing skills. Her parents shared her concerns and they all agreed that something needed to be done.

The next day, Ava's parents reached out to other concerned citizens and organized a meeting with the school board. They prepared thoroughly and presented their arguments, backed up by research and data, in a clear and concise manner. The school board initially dismissed their concerns as the ranting of a few disgruntled parents.

But Ava's parents did not give up. They continued to push for change, and soon other parents and students joined them. They formed a writing club to promote good writing skills among their peers, which became a safe haven for those who felt isolated by the current state of education.

Ava and her friends poured their hearts and souls into the club, determined to make a difference. They wrote stories, poems, and essays, and shared them with each other, providing feedback and constructive criticism. They developed a real passion for writing and enjoyed the feeling of being part of a community that shared their interests.

However, not everyone was happy with the writing club. Some of Ava's classmates made fun of them, calling them ""nerds"" and ""geeks"" and implying that writing was a useless skill in their society. Ava and her friends were hurt by these comments, but they refused to give up. They knew that they were fighting for something important, and they wouldn't let the naysayers discourage them.

As the writing club grew in popularity, Ava's teacher became increasingly suspicious of her writing skills. She accused Ava of cheating and using AI, just as she had before. This time, however, Ava was prepared. She had her parents on her side, and together they uncovered the truth about the cheat detection tools. They showed the school board that the tools were unreliable and often flagged good writing as cheating, leading to innocent students being accused of dishonesty.

Ava's bravery and persistence paid off, and the school board agreed to stop using the cheat detection tools and focus on improving writing skills in the curriculum. The writing club became a movement, inspiring others to stand up for good writing skills and fight for change. Ava felt a sense of pride and accomplishment, knowing that she had helped make a positive change in the society.

Chapter 3: The Power of Writing

The writing club grew rapidly, and Ava and her friends soon found themselves with a large group of supporters. They organized events and workshops, inviting guest speakers and writers to share their experiences and knowledge. The club became a hub for creativity, encouraging students to express themselves freely and explore the beauty of the written word.

Ava noticed that her writing skills had improved significantly since she joined the club. She felt more confident in her abilities and was eager to share her work with others. She submitted some of her pieces to a writing contest and was pleasantly surprised when she won first place. The judges praised her writing style, saying that it was refreshing to see such creativity and passion in a world where good writing skills were becoming rare.

The writing club's success did not go unnoticed by the school board. They began to take an interest in the club's activities and invited the members to showcase their work at a school assembly. Ava and her friends eagerly accepted the invitation, excited to share their love for writing with their fellow students.

The assembly was a huge success. Ava and her friends read their poems and stories, and the audience listened in awe. They received a standing ovation at the end, and many students approached them afterward, asking how they could join the writing club.

As the school year came to an end, Ava reflected on her journey. She had started as an outlier, feeling isolated and frustrated by the state of education. But she had found a community that shared her passion for writing, and together they had brought about change. She realized that writing was not just a hobby or a skill; it was a powerful tool for communication and expression. Writing could inspire change, connect people, and make a difference in the world.

Ava and her friends graduated from high school with a newfound appreciation for the power of writing. They continued to write and share their work, knowing that their words could touch the hearts and minds of others. They went on to pursue careers in writing, journalism, and literature, becoming advocates for good writing skills and the importance of preserving the beauty of language.

Years later, when Ava looked back on her journey, she knew that she had made a difference. She had stood up for what she believed in, and her passion had ignited a spark in others. She smiled, knowing that her love for writing had led her on a path of purpose and fulfillment.

Chapter 1: Skool Sukz

Ava wuz so over skool. She hated how the teechers were all up in her grill 'bout riding like an AI. WTF? It's like they don't even care 'bout creativity anymore. Ava wuz tired of feeling like an outlier. She knew she wuz a dope writer, but the skool system wuz holding her back.

One day, Ava had had enough. She gathered a group of her besties and they decided to start a writing club. They were sick of the BS and wanted to do something 'bout it. They were determined to show the skool board that writing wuz still relevant and important.

They started meeting after skool in the library, sharing their work and giving each other feedback. It wuz lit! Ava felt like she had finally found a group of peeps who got her. They were all passionate 'bout writing and didn't give a sh*t what the teechers thought.

As they worked on their writing, Ava and her crew started to notice something. They were getting better! They were finding their voice and learning how to express themselves in ways they never thought possible. They knew they had something special going on and were determined to keep it going.

Chapter 2: The Writing Krew

Ava and her homies in the writing club were becoming tight AF. They were constantly sharing their writing and supporting each other. Ava felt like she had found her tribe, and it wuz dope.

One day, they decided to take their writing to the next level. They started planning events and workshops to share their work with the skool. They wanted to show everyone that writing wuzn't dead and that there wuz still creativity in the world.

They decided to hold a poetry slam, and it wuz lit! The whole skool came out to watch as Ava and her crew spouted off their rhymes and shared their stories. The crowd wuz hyped and everyone wuz feeling the vibe.

After the slam, the writing club wuz getting more love than ever. Peeps were coming up to Ava and her homies and telling them how inspiring their work wuz. They felt like they were making a difference, and it wuz an amazing feeling.

But the haters were still lurking. Some of the teechers were still salty 'bout the writing club, and they wuz always looking for ways to bring them down. Ava and her crew knew they had to stay on their game and keep pushing forward. They weren't gonna let the system hold them back any longer.

Chapter 3: Rebelz with a Cause

Ava and her squad in the writing club were not gonna take it anymore. They were sick of being held back and punished for their sick writing skills. They knew they had to do something to fight back against the skool system.

They decided to start a petition to demand change. They went around the skool and gathered signatures from everyone who believed in their cause. They wanted to show the skool board that the students were not gonna be held down anymore.

The petition blew up on social media and soon everyone wuz talking about it. Ava and her crew were getting love from all over the place. It wuz crazy!

But the teechers weren't happy. They were feeling threatened by the students and their passion. They tried to shut down the petition and tell everyone that writing like an AI wuz the only way to succeed.

Ava and her crew weren't gonna take this lying down. They rallied everyone they knew and organized a protest. They marched around the skool chanting ""Free the Words!"" and ""Down with the Skool Board!"" The teechers were shook and didn't know what to do.

In the end, the protest worked. The skool board agreed to meet with Ava and her crew and hear them out. They listened to their concerns and promised to make changes to the system. Ava and her homies felt like they had made a difference, and it wuz an amazing feeling.

From that day on, writing wuz never the same. The skool board changed the way they approached writing and creativity, and Ava and her crew felt like they had finally won. They knew they had made a difference, and that wuz all that mattered."
11hf1uu,6,2023-03-03,"First Playthrough, Session 3: Chosen House, Mock battle and the First Week",u/jinxedTopaz,FireEmblemThreeHouses,https://www.reddit.com/r/FireEmblemThreeHouses/comments/11hf1uu/first_playthrough_session_3_chosen_house_mock/,"After looking at everything again and checking the roster option I have decided on what house to choose. For a while, I was debating Black Eagles or Golden Deer but not Blue Lions.

The lion house just doesn't interest me too much. Dimitri is kinda bland I suppose and it doesn't really help that the other people in his house all have too much of a normal vibe I suppose? Sure some of them might have some quirks here and there but nothing that really stands out from what I see right now. Meanwhile, the other two houses got very interesting characters that are all unique but since I enjoyed Claude’s personality and attitude more than Edelgard’s so I have chosen: THE GOLDEN DEER!

Now returning to the chamber I made my decision on the Golden Deer. Honestly, I feel like Seteth is very fair and understandable. Do I even have teaching credentials or whatever it's called?

Oooo the banners around my top and bottom turned yellow. Nice. I also get introduced to Seteth’s sister, Flayn. Apparently, there will also be a mock battle for the students. Now I get to introduce myself to my students properly as their teacher!

After a couple of in-game days, I meet up with Hanneman and he explains to me what Crests are. They are apparently power that was given by the goddess and are in the flesh? That gives boons depending on what crest. Apparently, I got an unknown crest to the world. Fun.

I get a calendar from Rhea showing the month's plan so I know what's gonna happen when. Useful. I also check the Unit Appearance option and oh my god this is what the DLC got me right? I saw it said a lot of outfits or something. Im gonna have so much fun with choosing my outfit. I CAN ALSO GIVE MYSELF GLASSES? HELL YES!

I decided on wearing the Academy (With a cloak). Now I truly look like a professor with the drip &gt;:D. I also checked at my bed and I got DLC supplies, the Sacred Items set it was called. So I got that too. (no clue what to do with them but cool)

Apparently, when I can walk around I get quests and I can spend activity points to do certain things. The Quests were to plant seeds, fish, and invite two students to dinner. People advised to make sure to level up my professor level so I made sure to use all the fishing lures I can. I also then went to choose who to eat with and choose Hilda and Marianne since them and Lysithea were the only ones available for me that were in my class and enjoyed the meal for some reason. With that, I also leveled up my professor level (PL for short)

With all the quests done I just explored the place and talked to everyone. GASP the library is open and its filled with LORE. Time for a binge read! I get some good info about the history of the world and how the empire, kingdom and alliance got formed. Then a book series about places around the world. Then info about the Seiros religion and lastly books about   nobles from  the empire, kingdom and alliance. After that I finished exploring.   


Apparently the 30th of the Great Tree Moon is Ferdinand's birthday so I gave him some flowers. Its also the day of the mock battle. Before the battle though I get to talk to Claude and I fully support ~~cheating~~ advanced techniques to win. We are going to destroy them all. I can bring five people with me but apparently have to bring myself and Claude so its actually of three extra people.  


Black Eagles got Manuela, Dorothea, Edelgard, Hubert and Ferdinand. While Blue Lions got Hanneman, Dimirti, Deduce, Mercedes, and Ashe. I check the people who were auto-given to me for this battle and I feel good with them.  


It took a bit of trial and error but I finally got a good strategy, rather than head everyone to rush a certain directive, I bring all four of them into the trees, then I use my character to lure the opponents to an attack. Marianne took down Ferdinand, Lorenz took down Hubert and Claude took down Ashe. Then Edelgard and Dorothea came to attack but Claude took down Edelgard with my character’s help and Claude leveled up to Lv2 (Hp +1, Speed +1) and Hilda took down Dorothea. Then I lured Manuela over and she got defeated via Hilda and Lorenz.

Then it was time to take down the Blue Lions. First I gotta make sure I take care of Dedue. If he gets to wait then his defense because much better and thats just hard to take care of. So I made sure to lure him and attack my character to not only chip some damage off him but also his ability cant activate anymore, then Marianne took care of him with a easy drain spell. She also leveled up to lv2! (Hp +1, Strength +1, Speed +1 Luck +1, Charisma +1)

Dimitri attacked and via an attack back Hilda leveled up to Lv2 (Hp +1, Defence +1) and Claude also leveled up to Lv3 (it autoed for some reason so no stat update :/) Lorenz got Dimitri and leveld up to Lv2 (Magic +1,  Speed +1, Charisma +1) Hilda took down Mercedes and now time to take down Hanneman! Marianne took him down (Wait why does she have a sword, who gave her a SWORD? WHO GAVE THE HEALER A SWOR-)

And so the winner is THE GOLDEN DEER! Took 25 turns in total and the MVP is Hilda. Now a Claude is telling me how great my strategy is and then all of the deer come up! We go enjoy Claudes cooking and enjoy some fine aged chees &gt;:D.

Im guessing after the meal I speak to Rhea and Seteth. Apranelty this was just a trial run for the Eagle and Lion battle during the Wyvren Moon. We also gotta take care of bandits since again apparently every month we gotta do something big every month before the month's end. Now Sothis comes out of nowhere again. She's here to stay apparently.

Creepy music plays and im guessing thats the guy from the tutorial speaking to… Wow ok. I know with the dramatic creepy music and the black fog effect its supposed to make it scary but whoever that is looks so gosh darn goofy I almost laughed. The masked man told the bandit boss to simply die and left. Now it's time for chapter 2! Setheth rehashes the mission about the bandits to me and Claude then I speak to Jeralt about how im settling but not letting my guard down.   


Then Annettes birthday and I gave her flowers. Now I get to explore again but I also got a lot of quests to do so I should do those first.The first quest is to talk to Jeralt that leads me to his quarters to get a book of tactics and with that i got battalions. Ill check later what that means. Then I gotta talk to Claude that gives me info about how I can improve my stats by talking to other teachers. Also, I get recruiting info. I don't really know if ill do much of that though. Maybe if a character really catches my attention.

Ingrid gives me a bland talk about books and horses but Felix says something that surprised me. He calls Dimitri an animal. Interesting. Just quickly checked and to recruit him I need sword skill. Hm. Might be able to just auto-recruit him later since my main weapon is swords. I went into the garden to get the stuff I did last time and planted some new stuff. Decided to do some pale blue flowers and a cultivated with airmid water.

Oh my god I GET TO FEED ANIMALS VIA THE BLUE QUEST YES YES YES. ALL THE CATS SHALL BE FED THE FISH. Oh, and one gave me an Arcane Crystal. Got a useful thing for fishing now. Then got a quest to look for cookbooks and after the quest I unlock cooking!Sadly for some reason none of my students like cooking :/ Then I went to go do the last two quests and wow let me just say the cathedral is beautiful. The last two quests are about getting a list for singing and some info about the western church.  


 After that I have talked to everyone so now I gotta decide on what to do with my two points.I think ill first have a meal with two students and also try the new choir option to see what it can actually do. For mealtime, I ate with Leonie and Lorenz. Wait hold on. Lorenz just said to eat with utensils. But, we are eating soup… is.. Is Leonie just drinking the soup with her bare hands????  


Then for singing I wanted to test what happens if I choose two people not in my class for one of these things so I choose Annette and Ferdinand. Apparently, its supposed to give me more bonds with the people and faith and authority but since they arent in my class they don't get the benefit. Well good to know now I suppose. It also gives me more PL xp. Last thing I did was to do some fishing and with that I finished exploring since I did everything that I can do  (I think)  


Now I have something called Lectures where (GASP) I actually teach the students. Like a teacher does. Scandalous. I find out that the three star thing means that its a buddying talent that allows the student to gain a bonus if trained enough on the skill. Fun! After looking around the budding talents are: Claude with Axe, Ignatz with Reason, Lystithea with Sword, Marianne with Lance and Hilda with Hvy Armor.So for the lessons I suppose I have four chooses from the green students who I ate meals with. With three points and four students I just choose a random number generator for fate to choose what student doesnt get schooled.   


I got a 3 so as the third person whos green Hilda shall not get schooled.First Lorenz, his goals are Lance and Reason. I just remembered but hes good at reason? But he felt so much like a attacked via strength rather than magic? Well he doesnt have any buddying things so I just went with those two things. Then Marianne who has the goals Sword and Faith, she also has a buddying skill with Lance. I decided to train her with lance and she got a star!Lastly Leonie who also doesnt have any buddying thing.   


I just did her two goals, Lance and Bow. With that I gotta assign group tasks So I just decided to do horse with Lorenz and Marianne since they are good at that. I dont know much for goals so for now ill let it stay as is untill I get more info.Raphael asks me a question about meat and fish but having to eat vegetables but I just tell him to eat em to grow strong and that made him green and improved my PL exp but not enough to level up. With Rapheals birthday I gave him flowers. With that Im ending todays session at that. Seems next time I play I gotta battle something so that might be fun."
11hhgnq,1,2023-03-03,Chatgpt's rise and education,u/Competitive_Milk9597,u_Competitive_Milk9597,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Competitive_Milk9597/comments/11hhgnq/chatgpts_rise_and_education/,"Chatgpt is a symbol of the rising of AI technology. Artificial intelligence has been rapidly growing in recent years, with advancements in machine learning and natural language processing leading to the development of powerful AI models like Chatgpt. These models have a wide range of applications, from language translation and chatbot interfaces to image and speech recognition.

In terms of education, AI has the potential to revolutionize the way we learn and teach. For example, AI-powered adaptive learning systems can personalize education for individual students, allowing them to learn at their own pace and in their own style. 

However, there are also concerns about the role of AI in education. Some worry that relying too heavily on technology could lead to a dehumanization of the education experience, while others are concerned about the potential for bias and discrimination in AI algorithms.

What do you think about the role of AI in education? Do you see it as a positive force for change, or are you concerned about its impact? Let's talk about it."

This is my first post here, if I'm not in accordance with some rule please feel free to delete. 

I am a current Sophomore college student pursuing a double major, and one of those majors is Computer Science. I'm looking into the feasibility of creating an Artificial Intelligence designed to enhance the music streaming experience by using a large neural network training model that can interact with a user, play songs, and curate playlists, amongst other things. I have a few questions, some which have clear relation to this topic, and some that might seem a little weird.  I figure you fine folks might know some answers to them!

1. It is my understanding that large streaming services such as Apple Music, Spotify, Amazon Music, etc. pay a music distributor on a stream-by-stream basis, who then pay the original artist, to the tune of around 1 cent per stream. Clearly they have seen success with this model, as the major streaming services contain 10s of millions of tracks. My question is, did they amass this library using the same business model since their inception, or have they ever used another acquisition strategy? How many songs were on Spotify when it was first released? 
2. Is there any way to gain commercial access to a similarly sized music database in bulk, or if I were to create a music streaming service, would I have to contract with music distributors individually to create my library? The latter option seems to create a decently high barrier to market entry. 
3. Does a publicly accessible database exist that contains... (not sure exactly how to phrase this) non-auditory information surrounding songs? Perhaps a CSV file or something similar that contains some/all of the following (as many data points as possible):
   1. Track title
   2. Artist(s)
   3. Album
   4. Track duration
   5. Etc.
   6. More abstract, less likely, but even more useful:
      1. ""Vibe"" of a song (how does it make the listener feel?)
      2. Song tempo
      3. Location originally produced
      4. Instruments used
4. I'm sure some of you have heard of ChatGPT... how much money, if any, would you be willing to put towards a monthly subscription for access to a similar interface?  You could converse with it, but additionally, it would be able to play music, create custom playlists based on unique criteria, and learn to show you new music that you are likely to enjoy based on your previous interactions.

Thank you for taking the time to read my post! Any and all input is greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: I'm musing over the possibility of creating an evil music streaming robot to take over the world through sound and I need your help ;)"

11i8zq4,5,2023-03-04,Life hack: Dreading writing that email? Use ChatGPT!,u/hella_cious,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/11i8zq4/life_hack_dreading_writing_that_email_use_chatgpt/,"I was so anxious and avoiding writing an email asking for an extension after a mental health crisis. So I used ChatGPT to draft it! It wrote an amazing email that I only had to change a little.

This starting point REALLY took the stress away, and then the wall of awful was broken down.

I got it to tweak the letter for my in person and online classes, and to include an apology for a rude email I sent while hypomanic. (Woo for bipolar comorbidity!)

I told my older sister about it, and she’s going to teach her special ed students to use it to write emails, resumes, and cover letters. (With strong cautions about cheating and the fact that she will DEFINITELY be able to tell)."
11ic9zw,55,2023-03-04,ChatGPT for Progress Review Comments,u/zopiclone,TeachingUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeachingUK/comments/11ic9zw/chatgpt_for_progress_review_comments/,"I just wanted to say that I have saved a few hours by writing my mid-year reviews with the help of ChatGPT!  I am so happy that it has given me several basic templates that I can customise rather than starting from scratch. I HATE writing reviews.   


&gt;These are some examples:  
**Prompt:**  
 I'm going to give a serious of student profiles in bullet points that I want to be turned into mid-year student report feedback with appropriate feedback and suggestions. These should be appropriate for high-school/college students and written British style about 200 words.   Male hard working keen to progress helpful to others exceeding targets can improve through reflective and reflexive activities should start work on personal statement for university   
  
&gt;  
&gt;**Response:**  
I just wanted to let you know how impressed I am with your academic progress this year. You're obviously a hard worker, and your eagerness to improve is truly admirable. You've even been exceeding your targets, which is no small feat!  
&gt;  
&gt;I think you have a lot of potential to do even better, and one way to do this is through reflective and reflexive activities. Taking some time to think about what you've learned and how you can apply it can help you deepen your understanding and gain even more insight.  
&gt;  
&gt;On a related note, I suggest you start working on your personal statement for university. This can be a daunting task, but the sooner you start, the easier it will be. Think about your strengths and goals, and how you can articulate them in a compelling way. If you need any help or advice, feel free to reach out to your teachers or support staff.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lastly, I want to acknowledge how helpful you've been to others. It's great to see someone who not only focuses on their own success, but also supports and encourages those around them. Keep up the good work!  
  
&gt;  
&gt;**Prompt:**   
And this one   Male likes to make positive contributions needs to focus on own work to ensure meeting all criteria should make more notes needs to prepare better outlines for assignments to ensure all criteria are met and manage time better    
  
&gt;  
&gt;**Response:**  
I wanted to give you some feedback on your academic progress this year. I appreciate how much you like to contribute positively to the class, and that's a great quality to have. However, it's also important to make sure you're focusing on your own work and meeting all the criteria.  
&gt;  
&gt;To help with this, I suggest making more notes and preparing better outlines for your assignments. This can help you stay organized and ensure you're meeting all the necessary criteria. Additionally, managing your time more effectively can help you avoid last-minute stress and produce higher-quality work.  
&gt;  
&gt;Remember, while it's great to help others, it's also important to take care of your own responsibilities. By focusing on your own work and managing your time effectively, you can achieve even more and make an even greater positive contribution to the class.  
&gt;  
&gt;Keep up the good work, and let me know if you need any further support or guidance.  


Once I had got them all done I switched them up a bit and changed out some words that I would never say.  I was very happy with what I got and it has saved me a pile of time."
11iijwu,59,2023-03-04,PSA: You still CANNOT write essays with ChatGPT.,u/obog,IBO,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/11iijwu/psa_you_still_cannot_write_essays_with_chatgpt/,"A lot of people are talking about how IB has decided not to ban ChatGPT for use in essays. A worrying number of people seem to have interpreted this as meaning they are allowed to write their essays using ChatGPT. **This is simply false.** In IB's official statement on the matter (seen [here](https://www.ibo.org/news/news-about-the-ib/statement-from-the-ib-about-chatgpt-and-artificial-intelligence-in-assessment-and-education/)) it is stated that ""Students should be aware that the IB does not regard any work produced—even only in part—by such tools, to be their own. Therefore, as with any quote or material from another source, it must be clear that AI-generated text, image or graph included in a piece of work, has been copied from such software.""

To put it simply, AI does not get any special treatment, of any kind. It is to be treated the same as any other source. Meaning you are more than welcome to quote and analyze ChatGPT, but the actual body of the essay must be written yourself. I actually used it on my EE, but in my case, I cited it and made it clear what it had written. The essay was still written entirely by me. 

TL;DR: You cannot use ChatGPT to write IB essays and must treat it as any other source."
11iuhnc,20,2023-03-05,Started building language learning solution for my own needs - now on journey to become marketing machine,u/ruuhkis,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/11iuhnc/started_building_language_learning_solution_for/,"**Prefrace:**  
Moved to Spain, needed to learn the language, felt like the existing apps sucked(common opinion in /r/languagelearning), felt stuck on becoming better in comprehending actual language

**Idea:**  
I was wondering why no apps taught the language through its actual usage, and didn't find any options, so I had to build it ([/u/HARVARDmyDREAM/](https://www.reddit.com/user/HARVARDmyDREAM/) pointed out that app called Speak exists, which I assume is similar, but unable to try, as the app is either not yet released, or geo restricted in Spain / Finland)

**Feedback and counterpoints:**

* Many pointed out that they could simply use ChatGPT or similar, and this is useless abstraction
   * Developing and managing the prompts isn't easy for pure ChatGPT based solutions, and it was what I initially tried with my friends, but they kept having problems with the prompts and/or ChatGPT

This is definitely still in ideation stage, eventhough Speak has received 38m$ in funding, I have no idea how similar it is, or if I could compete in the developing market

**Current stage:**  
I am doing marketing on various social media platforms, and testing where I could get traction, and this reddit post if of course part of it, eventhough this particular subreddit isn't the best place to find fellow language learners

On my previous post I was reminded of the importance of super fans by [/u/MtHoodlum/](https://www.reddit.com/user/MtHoodlum/) and [/u/fungiflorafauna/](https://www.reddit.com/user/fungiflorafauna/) contributed that teachers could be a perfect way to acquire their students and users, if the app was perceived good by the teachers

Thus I am now trying to target teachers and gather their feedback, and try to figure out what would make them recommend and language learning app for their students

Other idea is also to incentivize the teachers to recommend the app, by sharing affiliate revenue

I would to hear any recommendations on what could I do to best validate the idea and hit the market

Thank you!"

Initially producing only small amounts of cocaine with his former student, Tunde, in a mobile lab, Chidi and Tunde eventually expand to create larger batches of a new kind of cocaine that is extremely pure and gains massive demand.

11jrc01,1,2023-03-06,Spilling the ChatGPT: Are AI Tools Here to Stay?,u/Weirdgma,trade_stock,https://www.reddit.com/r/trade_stock/comments/11jrc01/spilling_the_chatgpt_are_ai_tools_here_to_stay/,"Unless you've been living off the grid somewhere in the Azores, you've probably heard of a little thing called ChatGPT.

It's a very impressive chatbot that was created by a company called OpenAI and released to the public in November that uses generative AI. By ingesting huge amounts of text written by actual humans, ChatGPT can create a large range of texts, from song lyrics to résumés to college essays.

ChatGPT kicked off a maelstrom of excitement and not just among users, but also Big Tech companies and investors who poured money into any company that had the phrase ""AI"" anywhere on its pitch deck. But generative AI tools capable of whisking up text, images, and audio have also prompted widespread hand-wringing about mass plagiarism and the obliteration of creative industries. (At the Daily Upside, ""better than bots"" is our new rallying cry.)

For today's feature we're going to see whether AI truly lives up to the hype, and what legal guardrails are there to steer its progress. So sit back, relax, and if at any point you hear a voice saying ""I'm afraid I can't do that, Dave"" please remain calm.

Commercialization Stations

When generative AI tools were just being used to create silly memes, i.e. yesterday, the debate about robots and our future seemed mostly theoretical. Once it became obvious that this was a deeply commercializable tool was when things started to get tricky.

ChatGPT upped the ante because it kicked off an arms race between Microsoft and Google. Microsoft announced in January it would invest $10 billion in OpenAI, and a few weeks later it announced a new version of its search engine Bing which, instead of showing users a page of search results, would give written answers to questions using ChatGPT's tech.

The news sent Alphabet, which hasn't ever faced serious competition in search, like, ever, scrambling before announcing it would create its own generative AI search tool, called Bard. Unfortunately, on Bard's debut, it made an error in one of its answers and investors responded by wiping $120 billion off Google's market value in a matter of hours. 

Google's knee-jerk response was short-sighted but understandable. ChatGPT's overnight popularity sparked an ongoing onslaught of articles suggesting that generative AI is the biggest thing to happen to the internet since social media, and specifically that it would forever change the way we search – and the verb we use when we do so. So sure, Google noticed.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9ftffytzg2ma1.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4873cd674197da9f9afc39dcd72590ab95ffeb54

As it turns out, Google needn't have rushed. The new generative-AI-powered Bing turned out to be just as fallible as Bard, but also seemingly borderline sociopathic. In one example, it insisted that the year was still 2022. 

News websites that deployed generative text tools have also learned the hard way that mistakes happen, particularly when it comes to math. CNET published 77 stories using a generative AI text tool and found errors in half of them. 

So what's the point of a search engine you have to fact-check, and is all the hype even remotely justified?

Dr. Sandra Wachter, an expert in AI and regulation at the Oxford Internet Institute, told The Daily Upside generative AI's research abilities have been greatly overestimated. 

""The big hope is that it will cut research time in half or is a tool for finding useful information quicker... It's not able to do that now, I'm not even sure it's going to be able to do that at some point,"" she said. 

She added ChatGPT's self-assured tone amplifies the problem. It's a know-it-all that doesn't know what it doesn't know. 

""The issue is the algorithm doesn't know what it is doing, but it is super convinced that it knows what it's doing,"" she said. ""I wish I had that kind of confidence when I'm talking about stuff I actually know something about... If your standards aren't that high, I think it's a nice tool to play around with, but you shouldn't trust it.""

&amp;#x200B;

What Is Art? Answer: Copyrightable

While ChatGPT sent an existential shiver down the spine of journalists and copywriters, artists had already confronted the problems of accessible, commercializable AI in the form of image generators such as Stable Diffusion and Dall-E. Like ChatGPT, these tools work by scraping hoards of images -- many of which are copyrighted.

Legal lines are already being drawn in the sand around AI-generated images. Getty filed a lawsuit against Stability AI (the company behind Stable Diffusion) in February for using its pictures without permission.

Similar legal battles could play out between search engine owners and publishers. Big Tech and journalism already have a fairly toxic codependent relationship, with news companies feeling held hostage to the back-end algorithm tweaks that change how readers access news online. Now generative AI search engines could scrape text from news sites and repackage it for users, meaning less traffic for those sites -- ergo less advertising or subscription dollars.

The question of generative AI copyright is two-pronged, as it concerns both input and output:

It's possible that to get the input data they want, AI companies will be forced to obtain licenses. In the EU there are exemptions to copyright laws that permit data scraping, but only for research purposes. ""The question of is this research or is this not, that will be a fighting point,"" Wachter said.

Once the AI tool has spat out a chunk of text or an image, who owns the rights to that? In February last year the US Copyright Office ruled an AI can't copyright a work of art it made, but who can copyright it remains an open question.

Data protection law will also apply to generative AI makers, but Wachter stressed there is no new legal framework tailored for the technology. The US published its blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights last year, but that was in October, a month before ChatGPT made its dazzling debut. The EU also has an upcoming AI Act, but again, it just didn't see generative AI coming to the fore so fast.

""The new regulation will do next to nothing to govern this,"" Wachter said. One section of the existing guidelines that could potentially adapt to generative AI tools is a set of new standards of transparency and accountability for chatbots. The idea is to make it clear to consumers when they're talking to a cheery customer service bot, rather than a world-weary customer service employee.

But even if companies were forced to watermark AI works, Wachter doesn't have confidence that'd be useful. ""That's a cat-and-mouse game, because at some point there will be a technology that helps you remove that watermark,"" she said.

&amp;#x200B;

So What Can We Do?

Good or bad, better or worse, generative AI is here now and it's not going away. Wachter thinks there is a three-pronged approach needed to make sure ChatGPT and its brethren don't become garrulous bulls in the internet's china shop:

Education: although schools have blocked access to ChatGPT to head off students from getting it to write their homework for them (as have major banks including JP Morgan and Citibank) Wachter thinks kids and grownups alike need to play around with AI tools so they can become familiar with their strengths and limitations.

Transparency: despite the potential of future AI watermark removals, a little digital badge from the developer saying ""an AI made this"" could be a useful step toward people treating its output with a more critical eye.

Accountability: the spam and misinformation potential of ChatGPT-style tools is enormous, so Wachter envisions a future where platforms have to tightly control the spread of AI-generated content.

Regulation never moves as fast as technology, but the furor around generative AIs may prompt lawmakers to plant their flag.

""The main thing that I really want to stop hearing is just the panic around it \[AI\],"" Wachter told The Daily Upside, adding: ""It's a fun technology that can be used for many purposes, and yet we only focus on the horrendous stuff that will bring doomsday.""

She said short of plagiarizing artists' work, the tech could legitimately be used in interesting ways in the art world, which has always managed to incorporate new technologies as tools.

""If Monet had had a laptop back then he would have used it,"" she said. ""We're betting he would have been a fan of Photoshop's blur tool."

I´m excited for the tools that AI assistants can put on the table when it comes to teaching.Last Friday I was in a rush to prepare a written test (I´m an Italian language teacher). I had prepared some of the questions but I still needed a couple. So I just tried to toss into ChatGPT some description of what kind of task I wanted to generate. To my surprise, it worked quite well! It needed some tweaking/culling but it was solid.  And, this technology is doing its first baby steps, I can imagine it doing huge progress in a couple years.

So, my question is, how do you all think AI can be used to make our job faster and better? Will we be able to automatize and delegate some aspects of our job? What apps and services would you like to see empowered by AI? (This is NOT a ""students cheat using AI"" rant thread)

Here is an example of what I got from ChatGPT, feel free to translate. I asked a very specific grammat topic and specified student level and age. Itś not perfect, and there are some mistakes, but it´s a lot. Later I refined the inputs to do more specific stuff, with varying degrees of success.

Rhodes State [School](https://www.worldmagzine.com/office-and-school-supplies/) in Lima consolidates innovation and creative reasoning to teach understudies in six different medical services fields.

The Borra Community for Wellbeing Science houses EMS, nursing, [word](https://www.worldmagzine.com/world/)\-related treatment, active recuperation, respiratory consideration, and careful innovation programs.

## Celebrating Our Spirit

A portion of these assets is taken external to the office using the versatile lab, which can be headed to an area to impart innovation and figure out how to other people.

The Lima area is weighty in the industry. What’s more, in this day and age, that implies that spots like the [College](https://www.worldmagzine.com/education/) of Northwestern Ohio and Apollo Vocation Center must be on the bleeding edge of showing in fields like advanced mechanics and welding.

Melissa Harvey, the seat of nursing, said she shows a capstone course for nursing understudies where the class consistently utilizes a nine-board collaborative video wall associated with the /, which permits understudies to essentially analyze the human body, seeing the littlest of subtleties.

* Paul Siebeneck, head of promoting and advertising for the school, said 575 understudies take somewhere around one class at the Borra Center.
* She said Mondays are the most active, with more than 260 understudies in the structure.
* Understudies advance by doing, utilizing 3D reenactment, labs, [clinical recreation](https://www.worldmagzine.com/chemical/), and then some.

The UNOH school of applied advancements flaunts an 82% continuation rate and sees understudies from Apollo, Vantage Vocation Center in Van Wert, and Tri-Star Profession Conservative in Celina go through its mechanical technology program.

Best said understudies utilize a lab set up like a physical or word-related treatment center to get an involved experience like that of a [genuine facility](https://www.worldmagzine.com/world/know-everything-about-open-ai-chatgpt-now-with-us/). She said she desires to offer free treatment for individuals able to be treated by understudies in two to five years.

Whether the eventual fate of the industry in the Lima locale rests in conventional assembling or substitute energy, region foundations are giving them all to get ready understudies for all prospects.

A lot of food sources, things, and thoughts are made here in the Lima district. Celebrating our spirit takes a gander at those associations that make the region such a dynamic spot to [live](https://www.worldmagzine.com/live/), work and play.

I'll confess that this is my first query to ChatGPT.  I tried rewording my request a few times, but I never got a correct result. I think that my request makes sense.  Is this something that I should expect ChatGPT to be able to do, or is it too math-y?

**The Request:**

 I teach a lab in which students work in groups of two or three, and switch partners from week to week. Suppose I have 13 students (call them A, B, C, . . . M) who are performing six labs (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) over the course of six weeks.  Each week, there should be five groups of two and one group of three, with each group working on one of the six labs.  Please suggest a six-week schedule of students and labs in which: (1) each student works on one lab each week, (2) each student completes each lab exactly once over the course of the six weeks, (3) the number of times each student works with any other student is minimized, and also (4) the number of times each student is part of a group of three is minimized. 

**The Result:**

It gave me a schedule where there are students who perform the same lab more than once, and student ""M"" doesn't appear each week.

Regarding AI language generators and [chatbots](https://itechnolabs.ca/chatbot-development-company), [ChatGPT](https://itechnolabs.ca/what-is-chatgpt-use-chatgpt-instead-of-google-search/) is by far the most sophisticated tool. More than a million individuals have used the free tool ChatGPT since it went live to the public in November 2022, and the website servers have regularly been overburdened at peak hours.

There are pros and cons to using ChatGPT in the teaching classroom. ChatGPT’s technology has advanced to the point that students may use it to quickly produce virtually finished essays and papers by filling in a few simple questions.

However, there are several advantages to using [ChatGPT](https://itechnolabs.ca/a-revolutionary-way-to-write-humorous-stories-with-chatgpt/) in the classroom. In its most effective form, the technology may act as a robust, entertaining digital instructor that operates like an enhanced version of Google, assisting students and teachers with everything from outlining and organizing their papers to helping them learn new material. Let’s get to know about it in detail!

# Usage of ChatGPT: Benefits Derived By Teaching Sector

When you’re a teacher, you’re always on the lookout for fresh approaches to teaching that will pique your student’s interests and help them retain more of what they learn. [ChatGPT](https://itechnolabs.ca/how-to-use-chatgpt-thttps://itechnolabs.ca/how-to-use-chatgpt-to-create-prompts-for-dall-e-stablediffusion/-create-prompts-for-dall-e-stablediffusion/), a massive language model built by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), is a tool you might have yet to think to use. Below we will discuss three methods teachers might use ChatGPT to improve classroom instruction.

* **Facilitate Discussions and Critical Thinking**

ChatGPT can assist in stimulating dialogues and developing critical thinking by giving recommendations and prompts for students to explore. An everyday use case for ChatGPT is to produce a set of open-ended questions on a given topic, which students can then discuss and react to in pairs, small groups, or as a whole class. Students can benefit from this by learning to think critically and acquiring a more thorough comprehension of the material.

* **Detailed Commenting on Projects**

[ChatGPT](https://itechnolabs.ca/a-revolutionary-way-to-write-humorous-stories-with-chatgpt/) may also provide each student with specific comments and help them if they get stuck. You may utilize the tool to give detailed comments on a student’s writing project, complete with constructive criticism and positive reinforcement. Students may experience an increase in self-assurance and academic drive due to this.

* **Improve linguistic competence and reading comprehension**

ChatGPT is a valuable tool for students studying a second language since it gives them immediate feedback on their pronunciation and grammar, allowing them to rapidly and effectively advance their language abilities. ChatGPT can help students with trouble reading and writing by offering better ideas on constructing their sentences and paragraphs.

* **Alter the Way You Currently Write**

ChatGPT is here to assist you if you have a flair for writing but need help infusing your work with sophistication and luxury. ChatGPT wrote something that would be both flowery and approachable, and the result exceeded my expectations. And if you’re having trouble making sense of dense academic prose, ChatGPT is here to help.

* **Coding and Debugging**

Yes, [ChatGPT](https://itechnolabs.ca/what-is-chatgpt-use-chatgpt-instead-of-google-search/) can read and write code and even assist programmers with debugging. Forget about it; ChatGPT appears to grasp it, unlike other AI text-generating programs.

* **Perform Evaluations**

Exams may be taken in ChatGPT. Even if it only got a 52%, it is remarkable that an AI bot can tackle such a challenging test.

* **Change the Numbers**

One of ChatGPT’s most exciting features is its capacity to modify data. It has several valuable features, including creating tables, building indexes, and interpreting JSON. Teachers can easily change the student data or create a new ones when needed.

* **Educate and Expound**

It’s remarkable to see how effectively [ChatGPT](https://itechnolabs.ca/what-is-chatgpt-use-chatgpt-instead-of-google-search/) can clarify concepts as varied as language, programming, and physics. ChatGPT and other forms of artificial intelligence tutoring have the potential to alter students’ access to the broader world profoundly.

* **Improving language acquisition and literacy skills**

ChatGPT is a valuable tool for improving language acquisition and literacy skills. ChatGPT is an excellent tool for students studying a second language since it gives them immediate feedback on their grammar and pronunciation, allowing them to progress rapidly in their language abilities. ChatGPT can help students with trouble reading and writing by offering ideas to better structure their sentences and paragraphs.

11l5yov,2,2023-03-07,RTWS - How to Sell Courses and Not Be a Shitbag About It,u/flyfightandgrin,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/11l5yov/rtws_how_to_sell_courses_and_not_be_a_shitbag/,"How's that for a title?

  
Reddit villagers, 

Hope you guys are crushing it today. I always wonder who you guys really are.

\- A 24 year old waiter in St Louis desperately wanting to start a dropshipping empire?  
\- A 30 year old gamer girl with cat ears in Albany?

\- A 45 year old dad that hates his day job in Salt Lake City?

Its always intriguing to meet you guys. The group chat was fun btw. I got to chime in about visibility.   
Ok, enough daydreaming. 

Courses are still an excellent way to generate revenue despite the animosity some people have for them. I have probably earned over $35k with no ads ever and my member reviews were really good. 

If you want to get into courses, you need to first learn what a BAD ONE looks like.   
Thanks to Tai Lopez, JT Foxx and Kimra Luna, we have a perfect model of what not to do if you have any scrap of morality and business ethics: 

\- You need to price to results. If 85% of people got strong results from your course, you're doing well. Remember that many people buy courses and just don't do the work. That's their choice, not yours. If you create strong content and tactics, your students should thrive. 

\- Don't be a shitbag and offer payments for a 16% interest bump. Don't ever encourage people to go into debt to buy your course. (If they are that broke, I can almost guarantee your course will NOT magically make them successful overnight). 

\- Don't teach things you aren't an expert at (cough Tai L cough). Anyone with an IQ of a radish can get on ChatGPT, churn out some shitty how tos, and film a few videos and call that a ""course"" The problem with this is that you are selling low value info and taking people's money while not actually helping them. 

\- DO NOT MARKET LIKE A SHITBAG. Making comments about implied future income or ""I'll teach you to be rich overnight"" or having shitty ads with money raining down on you is predatory and scummy. If you cannot produce results from your course, you need to sit down, and actually create better tactics and content and GET results with your students/clients 

Now that you know what a bad course looks like, here are the hallmarks of a good one:  
\- Strong production value that looks good, this includes hosting site, videos, PDFs, training guides, etc

\- A proven track record for past students and attendees. You should have case studies and easily accessible results

\- ***IMPORTANT*** \- quality of information. I am foot stomping this. Low value information is subject based in nature. It just has a general overview. This is what the gurus put out and why they have such a high refund rate. High value information is at the tactics/strategy level and teaches: How to/checklists/unique info/effective websites/apps/programs/a process that worked well for you and your students 

***EXAMPLE****:* 

This is the difference:  
Low quality: A course about Chat GPT (Teaches WHAT)

High quality: 20 prompts to optimize Chat GPT/Brief history/10 Industries and How to Use It/Money Making Potential/Weaknesses and Cautions/How to Sign up/Competitors in the Market/Step by Step: How I Used It To Generate $5k in a Month (Teaches WHY/HOW)

If you guys are thinking about courses, I HIGHLY encourage it. Remember, don't focus on the money and sales. Focus on actually solving someone's problem and helping them thrive. 

PRO TIP:   
Remember that courses are Do it yourself, Done With You or Done For you. Price higher as you get more involved. Don't let some of the negative people in here dissuade you from pricing higher **IF YOUR COURSE IS WORTH IT AND YOU HAVE RESULTS.** 

If you need results, create a low cost course and improve.

Lessons learned?,u/gatonegroyblanco,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/11l7o8u/online_exams_in_the_ai_era_lessons_learned/,"OK...another ChatGPT/AI post. What kind of assessment tools can be used in the AI era for an asynchronous online class?

Background: I teach online intro level environmental science and chemistry courses, mainly for adult learners/ nonmajors so the content level is already pretty basic and easy to look up (""what is an igneous rock?""). I have already spent huge amounts of time rewording textbook problems and testbank questions so they are not easy to look up on Chegg and the like. Or, I assign problems with randomized variables, fake compound names, images, etc..  But there are limits to this as well, and even so I find some of these questions turn up online.

Now with AI, all that effort to make questions un-googleable has gone out the window.  What kind of assessment tools can be employed on an introductory, asynchronous online class, ideally something that can be reused a few years in a row and not spend time rewriting everything?  I was considering going the lockdown browser route (have shied away from requiring this so far, as they are pretty invasive on student's privacy, and can still be artfully gamed), anything else that can be done?  Don't really have time for oral exams, which a colleague suggested. Edit: typo."
11lgt6s,7,2023-03-07,IB and ChatGPT: a collection of notes and ramblings,u/Merrick_919,IBO,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/11lgt6s/ib_and_chatgpt_a_collection_of_notes_and_ramblings/,"# Crude statistics is not intelligent

Firstly, it should not be called ""Artificial ""Intelligence"". It has nothing to do with intelligence. Anyone who actually understands such technology knows it as ""LLMs"" (Large Language Models) (primarily attributed for natural language interpretation, text generation models) or ""SLMs"" (Statistical Learning Models). That is what they are, probabilistic derivees, not deterministic indexers. AI has always been a buzzword marketing term.

\&gt;AI is the new blockchain  
\&gt;convince NORPs that it's the solution to every problem on Earth and get rich out of it

All contemporary so-called ""AI"" is but a Chinese Room. It is quantity compensating for quality. Surely, a learning model in praxis has a lot more processing power and speed compared to a human. A lot more useable storage. A humongous data set that it was trained on. That is all quantity, not quality.

Let's use the Chinese Room analogy. A human and a computer. Both human and computer have no understanding of Chinese – both attempt to imitate and recreate the vocalisation to the other side of the room.

The human, without knowing Chinese, of course, will have very flawed pronunciation. They will forget parts of the sentence.

The computer seems a lot better at relaying the message! Of course. It has terabytes of memory, high-quality microphones and speakers – way better quantity. It can record the input sound nearly perfectly and replay it just as well.

Yet, the human and the computer both don't understand Chinese. They just IMITATE, without actual linguistic symbolic interpretation. Do without thinking. It is still of the SAME QUALITY level (referring to the quality of actual 'thought processes and understanding). The computer being better is the quantity at work, not quality. Quality is a human in the room who *actually understands Chinese*.

You could even say, in the Chinese Room, the human has more quality, as the human knows another human language e.g. English, and can infer common linguistic features like inflexion and intonation. Yet the computer is still better, because the computer's relatively insanely high quantity covers and makes up for its worse quality.

Now with LLMs like ChatGPT, it has PLENTY of quantity. A model trained on a huge dataset.

An important point to note: an LLM represents the average of the dataset it is trained on overall. And, remember the average doesn't always make sense. Say, I have 6 students, you have 7. Of course, we can't have half a student. He would die after being cut in half and cease to be a student, being unable to survive and learn.

Hence: the LLMs' confidence, even if it rambles, hallucinates and outright spits out fake information.

But it still seems average enough to many, thus, the NORP population falls for it.

NORPs don't attempt to understand. They don't.

Neither does ChatGPT.

If we can so easily train chatbots to speak so ""convincingly"" to the majority of the population and be able to pass Turing tests examined by NORPs, it's way more indicative of the NORPs themselves, rather than the LLM. After all, the model is just doing what it's supposed to do.

If we can create models just like this, doesn't it also imply NORPs have the same level of (a lack of) complexity?

\&gt;They taught computers how to speak before they taught them to think  
\&gt;The only reason this seems to ""work"" so well is maybe many humans aren't thinking deeply when they speak most of the time

Once again humans are proven to be easily manipulated by mere simulations of emotion and consciousness. Current LLMs are far from conscious. Self-awareness and sapience are lightyears away. IT IS ALL MERELY PROBABILISTIC TEXT GENERATION.

I have already seen someone once say that LLMs *unironically* should have human rights. **Most of the population, humanity, is FAR FROM READY to UNDERSTAND NOR USE LLMS.**

The danger of LLMs are not inherent, but it's how we use and interpret them, how we perceive them.

\&gt;I spent decades of my life learning foreign languages, only to see the translation industry destroyed by AI. The inferiority of the machine translations a few years back did not stop the destruction of the industry. The machine translation cost nothing, and so the price for all translations came crashing down, because the bottom feeders used machine translation. I found myself being paid half price to 'just edit' (as if it was less work) a translation done by machine which was basically unintelligible so that I had to go back to the original and translate it myself. Most clients, the bottom of the pyramid that kept the industry going, did not care about the quality of the translation. If we expect that clients prizing human-made products will save industries we are being very delusional. ... the vast majority of clients will go for the process that costs less.

\&gt;&gt;The only reason AI will result in musicians and artists being made irrelevant is because the general public (the audience/customers) has reached an absolutely absurd level of apathy for quality. For example, when they look at an Opal gemstone ring, they don't care if it's genuine or not, as long as it looks genuine. They don't care if art is genuine, as long as it looks genuine. They don't care if music is written by an actual human, as long as it sounds like it was.  
\&gt;There are thousands of hours of videos on YouTube about understanding why great music is great, and why great artwork is great, but knowing the reasons, and understanding the things that make a great creative piece, has become a niche market.  
\&gt;AI causing a lot of creative people to lose their jobs is actually not so much the fault of AI, as it is people, on average, being very shallow.

\&gt;I want to make art because I want to share it with an audience that loves it. I want to connect with them and make them connect with each other over my piece of work. But suddenly I cannot share it with anyone. Whatever I will think of, It will have been already cooked up by AI. The ideas I have had for years, characters, designs and stories, that I have put blood sweat and tears into, when I finally get them out, they might already exist, (or at least something very similar), and be claimed by some random person who accidentally prompted them. That's where we are headed. There is no place for human creativity there. In my case, me making art for only me to enjoy, it's just not fully why I do it. I don't really care about money, I just care about what I do, to be able to support itself and my very modest living, so I can only focus on making my art.

\&gt;well, you know. I’ve been a professional musician for almost 30 years now. whenever I feel really bad, I pick up an instrument and sing to it. nothing makes me feel more alive and grounded. AI will never take that from me, and that’s good enough.

\&gt;As an engineer I always thought I knew where this was headed and envisioned a near-ish future where workers in factories, Burger King and McDonald's are completely replaced by robots. Ironically I have worked in computer vision and machine learning myself, yet I did not see this coming. What I have seen and heard in the past months made me extremely depressed. I had no idea that artists of all things were headed to the chopping block. And I am technically on the ""tech side"" yet it breaks my heart - I can't imagine how some artists must feel. We have created it and there is no way of undoing it.

Anon1&gt;If they take away the ability and the incentive to create, we will only have the desire to consume. And deep down, it's just that, consumption and more consumption. This is a strong step towards a less ""human"" humanity. Not to mention that there will be fewer and fewer jobs in which one can learn and enjoy what they do.

# It is more indicative of the system than the LLMs themselves

[https://www.pcmag.com/news/chatgpt-passes-google-coding-interview-for-level-3-engineer-with-183k-salary](https://www.pcmag.com/news/chatgpt-passes-google-coding-interview-for-level-3-engineer-with-183k-salary)

This is more indicative of the interview itself than ChatGPT. It shows more about the hiring system, the education system. It shows how utterly pathetic and inefficient the usage of labour is.

SLMs were always supposed to replace the ‘manual work’ and allow humans to focus fully on creativity, but now most of the delusional population believes that current SLMs can replace creativity too. Perhaps it’s because those NORPs don’t have much creativity to start with… apathy to quality.

It is only because of this pathetically low amount of capability for appreciation for actual ‘good’ and real human creativity that allows SLMs to “threaten” creative jobs in our current society. If everyone thinks a banana taped to a wall is the same as fine art… of course, actual talented fine art artists will have their jobs threatened by bullshit-spewing SLMs.

It’s important to remember that SLMs are probabilistic, not deterministic, randomly generated, not definitive, and ultimately represents the AVERAGE of the dataset it is trained on, a random blend of soup and juice and all other liquids.

So yes, being truly ‘above average’ does mean you are better and do not need to fear the average-level-content-producing SLMs. But when society is so apathetic (and pathetic) that most think the average is good enough, like in the machine translation case, or the art case…

\&gt;The interesting development in AI is that, as you reference, the utopian view is that ultimately AI will take over the menial labour tasks to free us humans up to do deep and enriching creative work.  
\&gt;The trend is almost the opposite—everything AI is producing that is making news is ostensibly creative work (albeit a kind of facsimile of previously created works). I wonder if it's the low-stakes and imprecise nature of creative work that actually makes it a better kicking-off point than high-stakes precise work (driving, for example).

\&gt;Funnily enough, the people who believe AI can truly replace creative people in an ideal rational world, are the only people that AI can replace, because they're basically NPCs already

# 

# Consequences

The consequences of the proliferation of SLM use available for the masses are comparable to that of the industrial revolution. Our world is POLLUTED by such hollow phantoms, REIFIED by NORPs as 'real people' who can think.

There will be ever-increasing feedback loops and echo chambers of utter artificiality. We will suffocate. The fake internet theory has been already here for a long time. Of course, it's not just a theory, it's simply an observation. But now, with SLMs accessible to the masses? What next?

With public embracing of such technology, free to use it without a single drop of understanding that current AI is FAR FROM WHAT WE CAN CALL CONSCIOUS, SELF-AWARE?

Currently, SLMs are trained on relatively very limited datasets. They have no eyes, no ears, no nose. They are learning from what we learnt, not from reality, the universe. They aren't learning anything completely new, just DERIVED knowledge provided by humans.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ny7nur265cma1.png?width=1122&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=533d1c9dd031ede3f28a1a670e2d524935a6042e

We humans trained OURSELVES on information and knowledge we gained. Our own dataset, taken from reality. We assume reality as the outside black regions, filled with infinite amounts of knowledge. But as mere humans, of course we can only observe and obtain the things in the white circle. For example, energy and lifetime limitations limits us from obtaining knowledge through travelling to other planets. Hence, that would be in the black region. The information is there, it's just not accessible. And as our technology develops, we can grow our white circle.

Now, we have our blue splotches. This are our derived creations. For example, our knowledge obtained would be a view of a landscape in nature. Then, if we drew a painting using that as inspiration, that's reified knowledge. I know the terms are really vague and loose, but for the sake of the analogy, this is good enough.

For machine learning models, we prepare our own datasets to train them on. This is the main point: SLMs are to be used to FILL IN THE WHITE GAPS, not GROW THE WHITE CIRCLE INTO THE BLACK REGION. Current technology does not give machines the ability to observe, explore, learn and interact with reality so well as humans can. Only humans can realistically actually obtain new information. As stated before, the SLMs trained on the red circle's dataset can only produce things within it. Whether it be a same drawing based on a landscape in real life, or a blend of two *drawings* in its dataset. Of course, these are new things, new paintings the world has never seen before. But it is not actual ""new knowledge"". TL;DR: machine learning models do not invent anything above humans.

So why do we use them? That is simple, as everyone knows, automation. Why edit a deepfaked face video manually over years when a statistical learning model can do it in a few hours? This is the advantage of the insanely high ""quantity"" machines have over humans, which make them useful, even though their ""quality"" is in fact terrible.

Now, you can understand the danger of relying on SLMs. Once again, the danger belies in our interactions, responses, usage and opinions of SLMs, not SLMs THEMSELF. If most of a society believes SLMs are capable of discovering and inventing truly novel things, then the progress of such a society will only keep slowing down, being trapped in a feedback loop. Sure, there are new blue splotches. However, it's all still within the red circle. Of course, it is fine to fill in more blue splotches. We just have to understand, remember and acknowledge what statistical learning actually DOES, rather than be completely ignorant. We can leave machines behind to fill up the blank cancas with blue splotches while we focus our efforts on expanding the white circle.

These dangerous feedback loops, we already see it in the economy, the stock markets. There are countless bots, scripts, and macros auto-trading. It is a self-propelled market, a digital hivemind, out of control.

The management system of echo chambers has long been here already – SNS. LLMs will only make the management system seem even more authentic, reinforcing the trap, the endless cycle. Bots online will throw trash right at humans. The internet will be filled up with mroe and more trash. New bots get trained on the increasingly trashy trashpile – it just gets worse and worse. And no, this isn't just about unknowningly interacting with bots thinking they are human. As stated in the above paragraph, many fall for the ""AI creativity"" facade as well, while fully aware it is statistical learning model generated, due to a lack of proper understanding of the technology.

Statistical learning models don't have to be ""evil"" to aid in the destruction of humanity. Current SLMs are far from even being capable of having an infinitesimal amount of evil. SLMs just DO things. But what will it do?

What will happen if we fully let go of the reins of the horse, trusting the horse? It is like trusting a parrot has the same mind as a human toddler just because it can sometimes imitate words of our spoken languages.

The horse is free to go wherever it likes, dragging us along. It'll drag us together into oblivion if it chooses to. We are trusting, chaos. It is out of our control.

# The IBO does not see the game

The IBO does not see it. Not yet.

The IBO endorsed the use of ChatGPT for schools and EXAM SECTORS.

Of course, this is not a problem. ChatGPT is undeniably useful. As long as you fact-check, cross-reference it at the end, of course you can use it as a source, as inspiration.

However, the problem is that it shows the IB is due for mass reforms. Surely, our society has only begun the first step on the long journey, merely beginning to adopt SLM technology. However, as society progresses, the IBO and all of education and the workplace will have to adapt.

By explicitly endorsing ChatGPT, the IBO has advanced its own deadline for evolution and reform.

Now, what reforms, you may be thinking: well, as stated in above paragraphs, the average work of LLMs being able to substitute for real human being student work is indicative of the archaic nature of the IB and all schools' curriculums, teaching methods, and examination systems. The key point is: SLM is for automation, efficiency, productivity. If the IBO is willing to acknowledge and allow that, it must also be willing to acknowledge that its own system has to begin reformations as well, to evolve and catch up with society. Basic manual labour becomes more and more redundant – never completely, that would be catastrophic – but still substantially. SLMs help us do the work – there is no point dwelling in the past – society, the IBO has to move on to embrace human beings' goals to truly be more creative, freeing all from the redundancy.

What does this entail? Overall, it means highly creativity focused educational and examinations goals. Focus on innovation, invention, things SLMs cannot do well (yet). This is what will allow for progress.

Is it practical, realistic to reform the entire system on the short term? No.

Should it remain as a crucial topic for the sake of progress? yes.

But why the IBO? Firstly, of course it is because I do the IBDP. But secondly, the IBDP is supposed to be one of the LEADING, if not the LEADER of occidental international high school education. In the orient, with traditional local schools, occidental international schools are seen as revolutionary. The IB program is seen as the leader of the education domain.

It is time for the IB to be revolutionaries, to rise and be worthy of this historical hour. You wait for others, while others wait for YOU.

11lrlqo,0,2023-03-08,What do you think of ChatGPT's weekly practice schedule?,u/Bristol_scale,piano,https://www.reddit.com/r/piano/comments/11lrlqo/what_do_you_think_of_chatgpts_weekly_practice/,"I'm an intermediate player that takes lessons once a week. I have an hour max to practice a day.  

Here's what I gave ChatGPT:

 I want you to be a piano teacher. I want you to write a weekly practice schedule for a student who has one hour per day to practice. The schedule should include a five minute warm up. Your goal is to produce a schedule that will help the student maintain a repertoire of known pieces but also learn two new pieces.

Here's its output:

Sure, I can help you with that! Here's a weekly practice schedule for a piano student who has one hour per day to practice, with a focus on maintaining a repertoire of known pieces while learning two new pieces:

Day 1:

* 5 minutes: Warm up with finger exercises and scales
* 10 minutes: Practice a known piece from the repertoire, focusing on technique and expression
* 20 minutes: Learn a new piece, focusing on understanding the notes, rhythm, and fingering
* 15 minutes: Practice a second known piece from the repertoire, focusing on dynamics and phrasing

11m9wau,10,2023-03-08,PHD tuition fee for oversea students,u/ojbk1010,queensuniversity,https://www.reddit.com/r/queensuniversity/comments/11m9wau/phd_tuition_fee_for_oversea_students/,"Hi all,

This may be overthinking too much, but I cannot control myself,  I really want to share my thoughts with you guys...

I'm currently in the darkest time in my life as I need to do a very important life choice at this fucking young age (23), which is kind of absurd, but it is normal in my city. I came from China, a top-level city, and for privacy reasons, I cannot share which exact city I am living in, but in this city, thanks to the weird economic structure, for locals, it is very easy to find a job, a white-collar job. A flesh graduate student's medium salary is about 2000 USD per month, not bad at all actually.

I already graduated with a degree in English literature last year and supposedly I should find a job immediately as I have debts to my government, but my degree isn't a professional-oriented or a science degree, but an Art, a philosophical training. I like my degree, and I very much enjoyed my four years at my university, but my city can't find a way to utilise my degree. I cannot do English teaching as it requires an education certificate, plus I don't like the Chinese educational system, their way of teaching English is awful, I don't believe I can survive in that system for a long time.

It turns out that my choices are only being left for doing small business or being a ""ChatGPT"" in international cooperation, just because I need to pay my fucking debts. 

But this is totally not what I want. I do want to continue to learn philosophy and literature, being a professor in this field. You right now may suggest me going to find a job and pay the debt first, and study PHD later on?

But I have witnessed endless cases similar to mine. Once you go to society, you cannot go back to university, as you would lose your connection from universities. I am not sure this would be true in Canada, but in China, you need to believe this is true because currently, China needs a huge amount of workforce to sustain its economy. 

And now I have arrived at a turning point because I got an MA in English literature offer from my local university. I have talked with my parents, and they promised me they can pay my MA tuition fee, plus my professor promised me to give a teaching assistant job for keeping me surviving. 

Once I finish my MA, I definitely need to study aboard as China does not like students who never study abroad (for ranking I guess). I really want to go queen university as I like Canada so much and most importantly, less expensive than UK universities and UBC.

I also shared this thought with my family. They promised me they can give me around 26000 USD for my PHD. I also would go to find my local government asking for a scholarship. If I am lucky enough, the government can give me around 42000 USD for my PHD.

I wonder if 26000 (family) +42000 (local government) = 68000 USD, plus the queen's university internal scholarship, would be sufficient to finish a PhD degree at queen's university for four years?

I can't find any details about the queen's university internal scholarship..., 8000 (to be exact **7,941.7**) Canada dollars in tuition fee per term is so expensive...   [https://www.queensu.ca/registrar/tuition-fees/graduate](https://www.queensu.ca/registrar/tuition-fees/graduate)

&amp;#x200B;

Please, give me ideas... If I can't afford queen's university, I would reject my MA offer and simply go to find a job...."
11mi0qn,79,2023-03-08,AI generated explanation of MS in kid terms,u/xxgabifulxx,MultipleSclerosis,https://www.reddit.com/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/11mi0qn/ai_generated_explanation_of_ms_in_kid_terms/,"Just wanted to share a funny thing! My husband works in mass communications and gets super excited about new tech. When chatgpt dropped awhile ago he was all excited talking about how it can write essays and emails etc. I as a writing teacher was ticked because “great one more thing for me to have to look out for when grading essays! “

Fast forward to today, we’re both vegging after work watching some trash TV, tonight we landed on South Park and the newest episode is about the same AI he was so stoked for. Now I’m curious so I find it and start playing with it. Asking it dumb questions at first and then things I struggle to simplify for my students. Lately the baby conversation has been happening a lot more and while I’m still not ready I struggle with having to explain to my students let alone my own child one day what I’m dealing with. So I thought “ha let’s see how well it explains this disease in kid terms. Here’s the response it generated: “Multiple sclerosis is when your body's super-fast message delivery system gets mixed up and confused.

Your brain is like a big control center that tells your body what to do. It sends messages to your body parts through a special system called nerves. These nerves are like little wires that carry messages super fast.

But when you have multiple sclerosis, something goes wrong with the wires. Your body gets confused and starts attacking the wires, like they're enemies. When this happens, the messages get all mixed up and don't work properly. It's like someone unplugged a computer cable and the computer can't send messages anymore.

This can cause all kinds of problems for your body. You might have trouble walking, talking, or seeing. You might feel really tired or dizzy. But don't worry! There are lots of smart doctors who can help you feel better and manage the confusing messages in your body.”

Write down to ending things on a positive note so the child isn’t worried for the teacher/parent. Just saw something cute/funny and hope it brightens someone’s day like it did mine!
P.s AI def freaks me out still. I’ve seen all the movies okay."
11molez,0,2023-03-09,Armed Pukekos have taken over the Ministry of Education,u/Reasonable-Ring9748,newzealand,https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/11molez/armed_pukekos_have_taken_over_the_ministry_of/,"I asked chatGPT to make this news article about teacher's strikes more exiting and to include evil pukekos and superheroes with unique powers.

[https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/485649/primary-school-teachers-to-go-on-strike-after-rejecting-second-pay-offer](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/485649/primary-school-teachers-to-go-on-strike-after-rejecting-second-pay-offer)

In a surprising twist of events, a group of highly intelligent pukekos has taken over the Ministry of Education in New Zealand, armed with powerful weapons that they had developed using their advanced knowledge of physics and chemistry. These pukekos, who were said to have been exposed to a rare form of radiation, had been causing chaos throughout the country for months, wreaking havoc and causing destruction wherever they went.

The New Zealand Educational Institute (NZEI) had been closely monitoring the situation, knowing that it was only a matter of time before the pukekos made their move. But they were not prepared for the strength and cunning of these intelligent birds.

Primary school and kindergarten teachers and principals rejected a second offer from the Ministry of Education to settle their collective agreements, but they were not striking just for better pay and work conditions. They were fighting for the very future of education in New Zealand.

Fortunately, a group of superheroes with unique powers had come to their aid. These heroes, who called themselves the ""Education League,"" had been secretly preparing for this very moment. They had heard of the pukekos' plans and had been working tirelessly to stop them.

Led by their fearless leader, Captain Curriculum, the Education League had an array of incredible powers at their disposal. Captain Curriculum could conjure up educational resources out of thin air, while his second-in-command, Professor Pencils, used his pencil as a weapon to defeat the pukekos.

The rest of the team had their own unique abilities. Teacher's Pet could transform into any animal, making her an expert in reconnaissance, while Brainstorm could read the pukekos' minds and predict their next move. Science Savant could create inventions on the fly to help in battle, while Pedagogical Prodigy had a photographic memory, allowing her to recall any piece of information at will.

Despite the pukekos' powerful weapons, the Education League was a force to be reckoned with. They swooped in just as the pukekos were about to wreak havoc, using their incredible powers to neutralize the birds and save the day.

But the battle was not yet over. Secondary school teachers were also planning to strike, and the Education League knew that they would need all the help they could get. They called upon their allies from around the world, and soon, an army of superheroes had gathered in New Zealand, ready to fight for education.

With the pukekos defeated and the superheroes on their side, the teachers knew that they had a chance. They rallied together, holding signs that read ""Education for All"" and ""Pukeko Problems,"" and marched towards the Ministry of Education.

The government had no choice but to listen to them. They agreed to increase staffing and funding to schools and kindergartens, improve current pay offers, and address serious issues around funding and understaffing, ratios, and sick leave.

It was a hard-won victory for the Education League, the teachers, and the students of New Zealand. As they celebrated their success, they knew that they had shown the world that even in the face of adversity, education could prevail."
11molmy,1,2023-03-09,8 Reasons Why You Should Study Artificial Intelligence And Machine Learning,u/Broad-Worldliness7,u_Broad-Worldliness7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Broad-Worldliness7/comments/11molmy/8_reasons_why_you_should_study_artificial/,"

11mongw,1,2023-03-09,ChatGPT in education: use or ban?,u/SafeDNS,safedns,https://www.reddit.com/r/safedns/comments/11mongw/chatgpt_in_education_use_or_ban/,"In recent years, chatbots like ChatGPT have become increasingly popular as a tool for learning and research. However, educational institutions have valid concerns about the potential distractions and inappropriate content that these chatbots can provide to students. One solution to this problem is the use of SafeDNS software, which can block inappropriate content and also chatbots like ChatGPT.

However, there are ways such language models can aid students in their learning process. They can ask questions related to their studies, and receive answers in real-time. This can help clarify concepts and solve doubts. AI can provide examples and illustrations to help students understand complex concepts in a better way. It can also suggest online resources such as articles, videos, and tutorials related to the student's queries or topic of interest, generate practice exercises and questions for students to solve, to help them reinforce their learning. From creating interactive learning games for students to practice and reinforce their understanding of a concept to providing synonyms, antonyms, and suggesting corrections for misspelled words, such AI models can be a benefit to students, if used correctly.

While chatbots like ChatGPT can be useful tools for learning and research, they can also be a source of distraction and inappropriate content for students. SafeDNS provides an effective solution to this problem by blocking access to these chatbots and other inappropriate content on the internet. By using SafeDNS, educational institutions can help ensure that students remain focused on their academic work and are not exposed to harmful or distracting content on the internet.

I posted here quite a bit already, I'm an English Education student trying to pivot into IT/Security by doing internships/part-time gigs and getting an online Security Degree next to finishing my teaching degree. 

My work history is 4 years of barkeeping during weekends, 6 months part-time full remote at a startup being the main DevOps, Sec Ops and M365 admin guy, now 6 months part-time full remote at FAANG as a Customer Success Manager. 

Last week I applied to ~10 positions for internships and got 4 interviews out of it. Today was my first interview with one guy at one of my countries (Western Europe) Fortune 100 equivalent manufacturing companies and after only 20 minutes of talking about what his team does and what my experience was, I got an offer. The position would mainly be about IIoT/OT Security and IoT Data Engineering, both I have never done before. 

Problem: I would have to move for 2 months to the most expensive city in my country to get onboarded before I can move back to my city and work remotely. This would cause me a lot of stress, loss of income compared to my current FAANG gig and potentially push back graduating by one semester (I'm already 24...) 

I also have interviews coming up for gigs in my city, mainly IT-Consulting for larger MSPs (think Accenture, Capgemini etc.) and a large insurance company with a pretty boring position tho. 

What do you guys think, is it worth it? The manufacturing company would keep me as a part-time remote worker afterwards in their IoT Data team."

By using chatGPT, I have been able to spend less time on my more menial tasks and have become incredibly more productive. Since discovering chatGPT I have doubled my academic output. I am not using it to recuse my effort but to increase the fruits of said effort. I care deeply about the integrity of my work, I care deeply about uncovering truths and interpreting/presenting them appropriately/responsibly. I believe honestly that chatGPT greatly enhances my potential contributions to human knowledge. Do my fellow academics disapprove of my chatGPT use?"
11n2nw3,0,2023-03-09,A study on Byleth's alts in FEH,u/SalaGamet,FireEmblemHeroes,https://www.reddit.com/r/FireEmblemHeroes/comments/11n2nw3/a_study_on_byleths_alts_in_feh/,"Some time ago I saw a post made by  u/LeonAguilez about Corrin's apperances in FEH and how they differ based on gender while seeing which route they might come from and that inspired to make me do something similar to that but based on Byleth. 

Byleth is the playable avatar from Three Houses who during his journey based on his decisions can lead to four different routes which differ from each other. Since Byleth can come from so many routes it makes it interesting to try to find out their origin route based on the dialogue that they have in game. Today I plan to annalyze each Byleth in FEH and try to guess which route they come from. Since Byleth is know for being a blank slate who doesnt have ""feelings"" in the beggining of the game, we can use his personality to get a clear view on his route despite their gender.

OGs

In their original apperance the Byleths are basically the same but since Female Byleth appears in the Forging Bonds we can use her dialogue there to help us find her route. Dimitri calls her ""our professor"" 2 times in the forging bonds and not much gives us a clue- Since she feels more like a neutral pick with no indication I wouldn't connect her to any route but I could see her being from a White Clouds that leads to Silver Snow where she is a more inexperienced professor who doesnt give Edelgard special attention leading her to joining the Church. Either that or being Dimitri's teacher since he is the one who introduces her, so maybe Azure Moon. Also this Byleth appears as the back up for Legendary Dimitri which could mean that Byleth is Female in Azure Moon. As for Male Byleth he doesnt appear in Forging Bonds and his dialogue is the same as female Byleth so I cant say much about him. He does appear in Legendary Edelgard and Legendary Claude's videos as a back up, so those might be the routes where Byleth is male. 

Since they seem to be based on White Clouds this Byleth's dont have that many emotions that can lead us to a route.

Summer

Ok this one is easy. Female Byleth is joined by Lady Rhea and it seems that they're in good terms. Another clue is the absence from the House leaders (while talking about Flayn and Seteth insted) or any mention of them leading me to believe that this has to be Silver Snow. Could also be Azure Moon since the kingdom and church are also in good terms but unlikely.

Legendary

In their level 40 converation Byleth seems to dislike war and wanting to end it. Other than that there's no clues but I would say that any route other than Crimson Flower makes sense. I guess he could also be feeling guilty and be from CF? Who knows. Male is a Water Legendary like Legendary Dimitri so there's that but I dont know if that counts as evidence. Female is a wind Legendary so she might be the lord of Silver Snow like the lords are since Seiros is Mythic. Male's map is based on the defend Garrech Mach which happens in all routes at some point. Female's map is based on the Kronya chapter which happens in all routes so the maps are a road block.

Halloween

Male Byleth appears as Sothis backup. In the paralogue Rhea is after him but they dont interact that much so no clue for the route. But he feels a bit sassy while talking with Sothis so I like to belive that he got this character by spending some time with the joker himself Claude in Verdant Wind.

Brave

In this version Female Byleth is dressed as Sothis and her summon dialogue is Rhea's song. I dont know man sounds like Silver Snow to me and in her level 40 dialogue she talks about not accepting the status quo which people say its a proof that she is from Crimson Flowers but I disagree since she says that war cannot be the norm in the following line which makes it feel more like a diss to Edelgard.

Sage

Male Byleth joins us this time in the desert. His only goal in the paralogue is learning ancient magic for the sake of his students. Since he mentions caring about students so much and trying to learn ancient magic it makes me feel tha he is either from Crimson Flower(attachment to students) or Verdant Wind(he wants to learn about ancient magic).

&amp;#x200B;

That's all the version of Byleth in FEH! From my understanding the most used genders for each route are female for Azure Moon and Silver Snow and male for Crimson Flower and Verdant Wind. From what Ive heard this is what they use in Cipher as well so this should check. Honestly I love the gender choices for each route. Thats it guys leave your opinions and fell free to correct me or give more information."

Including my PMP Exam Experience and Resources used.,u/twenty19masters,pmp,https://www.reddit.com/r/pmp/comments/11n739r/passed_today_with_atatat_including_my_pmp_exam/,"Something amazing happened to me today. **I passed with AT/AT/AT!** It has been a goal of mine for a while. My background is in leading a small communications team.

I really want to thank this awesome PMP community for the support and guidance in helping me pass the PMP exam. I had been studying for weeks on my own and needed some kind of direction and luckily I found this group. I don’t know how some can study in a week and pass. I am not that person. It took my exactly 10 weeks. Throughout my preparation journey, I have learned so much from the various posts and online resources that it has generously provided. THANK YOU!!

I don’t want to make this post too long, but would like to share a little bit of my exam experience and all the resources that I found useful.

\*\* **Exam experience** \*\*

I took my exam in person, since I was too scared that something might go wrong doing it online at home. The exam centre was close to my home, so didn’t have any problem going there. A lot has been mentioned about how the exam goes, so I will skip the details. Nothing has changed. I did end up taking the 10 min breaks as it was mentally too much for me to take. The first 60 questions were difficult, second set was moderate and the third set was moderate/easier. It was such a relief to see the congratulations screen. Something about that feeling which is hard to describe, but I know you will all feel that very soon. GOOD LUCK!

I didn’t have any calculation, ITTO or any process questions. I did have the student syndrome, dropping the baton, etc. questions, which has been mentioned on this forum a few times. I also had a drag and drop on Scrum Master and Product Owner. **The exam felt 50% Waterfall and 50% Agile.** Lots of Scrum related questions like Scrum Master, Team, Product Owner.

**Exam was easier than Study Hall for sure. What helped me throughout the exam? It’s understanding the PMBOK 6, Agile and MINDSET!!!**

I am not a fast exam-taker, I did finish on time, but I also felt like I needed more time.

\*\* **Main study resources used** \*\*

* [**Andrew Ramdayal Udemy Course**](https://www.udemy.com/course/pmp-certification-exam-prep-course-pmbok-6th-edition/) **- HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.** I see why everyone talks so highly of AR and his mindset. I watched his videos a few times. Go over his Agile and Mindset sections if you did get his course.
* [**TIA Exam Simulator**](https://tiaexams.com/product/pmp-exam-simulator-course/) **- HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.** I averaged 74%. I went each test a couple of times. I was averaging around 67% before applying the mindset. I would highly recommend this.
* [**Study Hall Essential**](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/certification-resources/pmi-study-hall) **- HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.** I averaged 63% in couple of exams and 68% in practice questions. SH really questions your confidence, but I am glad I ended up using this. It was great for how intense it was. At times, I would also use ChatGPT to cross check answers. SH Essential is a better buy over the plus as per others opinions on this forum, hence I went with the essential.
* **David McLachlan** [**Agile**](https://youtu.be/tNIHysh2ZW4) **and** [**Waterfall**](https://youtu.be/xIH-u81XCxM) **YouTube videos - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.** Thank you, David for the awesome videos and how to answer questions. During the exam, I could hear David’s voice and how he would answer questions, which was soothing.
* [**Third3Rock’s Study Notes**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IIZoUdSdI6-TlYHxs9umzETnAlTCEs7h) **- HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.** Thank you to this guy for putting everything in one document and sharing. I did go over his documents so many times. That coffee was the best money I have ever spent. I was skeptical at first, but the reviews and seeing his full version notes, I wouldn’t have mind paying more.
* [**Professional Pocket Prep**](https://www.pocketprep.com/) \- not a bad iPhone app to answer questions when taking transit or to play around in you free time. I used the free version, so there were limitations. I wouldn’t have mind paying for a month’s subscription.
* [**Free PMP Exam Questions was fun to do.**](https://www.examtopics.com/exams/pmi/pmp/view/)
* I did check out the few other resources, mostly from u/Third3Rock’s document, but I ended up sticking to the above. I did not want to overwhelm myself. There are lot of resources out there, in the end stick with whatever makes sense to you.

I didn’t expect this post to be this long. Will edit if I think of anything more. Please feel free to ask me questions.

We all have our own style of studying, some can do it in a week, while others take weeks and months, whichever path you decide to take, it will be a success. It takes time.

Going to celebrate tonight. Will check back later.

**Good luck to you all.**"

11ni7un,16,2023-03-10,Latest Update: Major Changes for GMAT in 2023 - GMAT Focus Edition - What We Know,u/gmatclub,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/11ni7un/latest_update_major_changes_for_gmat_in_2023_gmat/,"**On March 8, 2023 GMAC has announced changes to the GMAT Exam and a new version of the exam called** ""[**GMAT Focus Edition**](https://www.mba.com/exams/gmat-focus-edition)""[(official announcement link)](https://www.mba.com/exams/gmat-focus-edition)  **Changes were vaguely described but here is what we know**  


* No timeline provided except ""later this year""
* AWA will be removed
* SC will be removed (not official information but Amazon screenshots from the latest OG prove this)
* More IR will be added into the test 18 questions instead of 12 most likely (not official but Amazon screenshots from the OG prove this)
* The test will have 3 sections 45 mins each and will be a total of 2 hours and 15 mins long instead of 3 hours and 7 minutes today. No information on breaks or sections or questions at this point
* The sections confirmed via Amazon screenshot are Verbal, Quant, and IR
* Speculation: most likely this means 22 Verbal questions (11 CR and 11 RC) since each section is 45 mins
* 23-24 quant questions since there is 45 mins for quant
* Geometry is missing from quant review, so we can assume it will be removed (it is not present in EA either). [Link with OG math review contents](https://gmatclub.com/forum/major-changes-for-gmat-in-2023-gmat-focus-edition-what-we-know-408213-20.html#p3170139)
* No exact date was given ~~but we can speculate it will be in the second half of 2023, most likely Fall~~ \- the timeline is likely quite accelerated and perhaps as early as within a few weeks/months. 
* The old (current) version of the exam will remain in place through early 2024
* GMAT will remain to be adaptive but you are now able to go back and change answers on up to 3 questions per section. 
* Official Guide 2023 that was announced in Nov 2022 ~~has been removed and scrubbed from Amazon.com (we are hearing this is temporarily and likely means the description will be revised and republished.~~ 
* It appears most likely the Official Guide 2023-2024 will be released as planned at the end of March and the reason for removing it from Amazon was hiding the preview feature which allows you to browse several pages of the book. Those pages revealed the details of the GMAT Focus mechanics which you can see on a screenshot below.

**What does it mean for Test Takers?**  
Immediately, it is likely noise and distraction and yet one more change to keep track of. This should not impact anyone applying for R1 or R2 next season.   


1. The current test format will be available through early 2024, so if you were planning to take the GMAT, I would keep on working on your score. I am expecting that the rollout will be longer than expected and there will be delays so I can expect the original GMAT likely be administered for another year.   


2. I don't expect the test to change too significantly. The only change that was announced was that the AWA section was removed. While there is a hint at making the test more data-focused and ""tomorrow"", that sounds a bit like the IR overview we heard back in 2012  


3. Should you buy a course/book/GMAT Prep Practice tests? I think there are some opportunities and threats here. First of all, I would only buy now what you need. If you are planning to study for the GMAT, then get the books you need, get the OG, or courses. However, if you are not ready to take the GMAT yet, I would wait to purchase the GMAT Prep practice tests until you need them. Last time there was a system upgrade from old to new GMAT Prep platform, none of the progress was transferred.    


4. Will the new test be easier? Maybe... Some feel EA is easier than the GMAT as it is shorter and you get through it faster. It is still competitive though and whatever skills you have learned on the GMAT, you can apply on the EA (it is Quant, Verbal, and IR).   


**My Take on This Change:**   
There have been rumblings about changing GMAT for a while. Pandemic has forced many changes upon schools and test prep. GMAT suffered during the pandemic and saw its test-taking volume go down 50% since 2018. GRE has been growing in popularity so changes were almost inevitable as the test has been under pressure to evolve. The big question about this transition will be on - what is being prioritized here? Will execution actually pull it off?   


1. I am going to go out on a limb and say that the next 6 months will be confusing. Some people have been preparing for years to the GMAT, purchased books, etc, etc - vague announcements like these are going to confuse people and likely only shift people away from GMAT towards tests like EA or GRE  


2. GMAT is becoming easier? Hard to tell yet but the messaging seems to imply it or at least market it as such. Anyone else got this feel?  


3. We all have seen the execution of GMAT online and shift from GMAT Prep to a new platform. These were painful events. Execution has suffered in the past and I am hoping this will be a better transition that will be easier for test-takers. I am just thinking about comparing your scores from the 800-point test to the new test. Is the test scale going to be the same? This also means that if you are taking the test in the fall, you can take Full Test online, Full Test at a test center, Focused/short test online, or Focused/Short version at a test center. Lots of Choices...   


4. No essay seems an interesting change in the world of ChatGPT but the AWA has been dead for a while...  


5. 3 sections likely means Quant, Verbal, and IR of some sorts? It would be helpful if they were less mysterious   


6. Not surprising GMAT is making changes since the test volume has gone down 50% in the past 3 years. But are these the right changes?  


7. I think it would be better for the test to address online testing issues because no matter the length of the test and other changes, if the online test experience is subpar, it is subpar in both formats.   


8. This means more confusion among applicants about the GMAT vs. GMAT Focused version vs. EA vs. GRE vs Whatever?  


9. I feel that it is insufficient to provide just Official test materials since OG and Tests are such a small portion of the preparation experience and looking at the announcement from GMAC, it seems they are not recognizing the value and the contribution that test prep companies are providing to the success of the test takers and the test itself. I am looking at all the companies that have built courses, products, tests, etc that would have benefited from input and advance warning/notification so that they can launch/build products. Apple does that for their developers even so that they new version of iOS does not show up with out apps.... I feel this was a missed opportunity that would have been so easy to capitalize on.   


**Speculations &amp; Rumors (Officially Unconfirmed)**   


* One report (logical enough) indicates that the Sentence Correction portion of the test will be scrapped. This has not been officially confirmed by reported by [**doublecool**](https://gmatclub.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;un=doublecool)

11ntfnn,23,2023-03-10,I'm a data science student and nobody else in my program is excited about LLMs :(,u/AbstractContract,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/11ntfnn/im_a_data_science_student_and_nobody_else_in_my/,"Just wanted to get this off my chest. Even being in a higher semester of my program, not a single one of my fellow students I talked to about LLMs seem to think of them as a big deal. I'm not even talking about small talk but proper discussions. Yes, they used it for their work sometimes. It helped them with coding or finding a good first introduction to a topic. Yet somehow even emergent abilities or upcoming features such as multimodality and program agnosticity didn't convince anyone that LLMs are quite a big milestone in AI. 

I'm used to non-techy people being rather unimpressed and uninterested in ChatGPT when I tell them about it. But fellow soon to be data scientists who actually have a decent education about ML? It seemed to me that LLMs are one of the few trends where the people who have domain knowledge are more excited about it than the average person who doesn't, instead of it being the other way round as with many fads. Is anyone else a student in this field and had similar or different experiences?"

Name: First Name:Wyatt. Last Name: Unknown

Species: Human

Age: 35

Appearance: Wyatt has brown, slicked back hair and a distinctive line scar that runs down his left eye. He wears a menacing all-red mask with blood-print hands on the cheeks and black anti-lightsaber armor.

Background: Wyatt was born on the planet Vjun, into a powerful and influential family. He was trained in the ways of the dark side from a young age, and his natural talent and strength in the Force were quickly recognized. After Wyatt killed 100 Jedi in a single minute, he was granted the title of Sith Marauder.

Personality: Wyatt is determined and brave, with a ruthless streak that allows him to achieve his goals at any cost. He craves power and is determined to be one of the strongest entities in the galaxy, feared by all who oppose him. He is highly loyal to the dark side and believes that the strongest individuals should live, but he also believes in giving others a chance to learn and develop their own power.

Abilities: Wyatt is known for his prowess in lightsaber combat, having mastered every fighting form available to him. He also has an almost scary connection to the Force, and is a peak human in terms of strength. Wyatt can be prone to losing control when he gets angry, but his power and determination make him a formidable opponent.

Relationships: Wyatt has a close relationship with Darth Vader and Darth Revan, who recognized his potential and helped him develop his skills. He is highly respected by the dark side and has a large following of admirers.

Beliefs: Wyatt has a fascination with Yoda and is almost angry at the fact that the Jedi Master hasn't turned to the dark side. He believes that the strongest entities should be the ones to survive, but he also has a strict code when it comes to killing, never targeting children.


Story:
Book 1 
Wyatt: The Rise of a Sith

Chapter 1: Birth on Vjun

Wyatt was born on the planet Vjun, a harsh and unforgiving world where power and strength were prized above all else. His family was among the wealthiest and most influential on the planet, and from a young age, Wyatt was groomed for greatness.

As the eldest son of his family, Wyatt was expected to carry on the family legacy and become a powerful leader in his own right. His father was a prominent politician and a skilled warrior, and his mother was a shrewd businesswoman with connections throughout the galaxy.

From an early age, Wyatt showed signs of great strength and potential. He was fiercely competitive and driven to succeed, and his natural abilities with the Force set him apart from his peers. He was also a quick learner, absorbing new information and skills at an impressive pace.

As he grew older, Wyatt began to understand the importance of power and influence on Vjun. He saw firsthand the rivalries and feuds between the planet's most powerful families, and knew that he would need to be strong and cunning to survive in this world.

Despite the pressures of his upbringing, Wyatt had a rebellious streak. He chafed under the strict rules and expectations of his family, and longed for something more. He dreamed of adventure and excitement beyond the confines of Vjun, and yearned to explore the galaxy and test his skills against the best and brightest.

But for now, he would have to bide his time and continue his training. He knew that his destiny lay in becoming a powerful Sith, and he was determined to do whatever it took to achieve that goal. 


Chapter 2: Early Training

Wyatt’s early training in the ways of the Force began shortly after his fifth birthday. His father, who was a powerful Sith Lord, knew that his son had the potential to become a great warrior and leader. Thus, he arranged for Wyatt to be taken under the tutelage of a respected Sith teacher.

Wyatt was initially overwhelmed by the training, as he had never been exposed to the Force before. But he soon learned to harness his natural abilities and strength. His teachers were impressed by his ability to focus and his natural instincts for combat.

The young Sith learned quickly and soon became adept at basic Force techniques such as telekinesis, mind tricks, and Force push. He also showed a remarkable affinity for lightsaber combat, quickly mastering the basic forms.

Despite his young age, Wyatt was incredibly determined and disciplined. He would often spend hours each day practicing and refining his skills. His teachers were impressed by his work ethic and dedication, and they began to see him as a potential star pupil.

As Wyatt progressed through his early training, he began to realize that he was different from the other students. He had a deeper connection to the Force, and he was able to tap into its power in ways that others could not. This realization both excited and frightened him, as he knew that his potential for greatness was immense.

But with the power of the Force came great responsibility, and Wyatt was keenly aware of this fact.


Chapter 3: Family Tensions

Wyatt had always been aware of the power struggles within his family. But as he grew older, those tensions became more pronounced, and he found himself caught in the middle of them.

His father, a powerful Sith Lord, was constantly at odds with his uncle, who was equally ambitious and cunning. They were always vying for more power, more influence, more control.

Wyatt tried his best to stay out of it, to focus on his training and his own path to becoming a Sith Lord. But it was difficult when he saw the way his father and uncle looked at each other, the way they spoke to each other, the way they fought over every little thing.

One day, when Wyatt was in his early teens, he overheard his father and uncle arguing about who should be in charge of a particular mission. His father insisted that he was better suited for the task, while his uncle argued that he had more experience and should be given the opportunity.

Wyatt listened intently, feeling a knot form in his stomach. He didn't like the way they were talking to each other, the way they seemed to be trying to one-up each other at every turn.

Finally, he couldn't take it anymore. ""Why can't you two just work together?"" he blurted out, surprising both his father and his uncle.

They both turned to him, surprised by his outburst. ""What do you mean, boy?"" his father asked, his voice cold.

""I mean, why do you have to fight over every little thing? Can't you see that you're both on the same side? You both want power and control, right? So why not work together to get it?""

His uncle chuckled, a sly smile spreading across his face. ""You're more clever than I thought, boy. Perhaps you should be the one in charge.""

Wyatt felt a surge of pride at his uncle's words, but he knew better than to let it show. He still had a lot to learn, a lot of training and discipline to go through before he could even hope to be considered for a leadership role.

But the tension between his father and uncle didn't dissipate, and Wyatt knew that there would always be struggles and rivalries within his family.


Chapter 4: The Jedi Attack

Wyatt had always known that his family was powerful, but he had never truly understood the extent of their influence until the day the Jedi attacked.

He was only twelve years old at the time, but he could remember the events of that day like they had happened yesterday. He had been sitting in his father's study, watching as his father and uncles discussed politics and the state of the galaxy. His mother had been there too, her usual stern expression softened slightly as she watched her son play with a holopad on the floor.

Suddenly, the room had been filled with the sound of blaster fire and the clash of lightsabers. Wyatt had looked up in confusion, only to see several hooded figures entering the room. They were Jedi, he realized with a start, their blue and green lightsabers illuminating the room in a kaleidoscope of colors.

His father had drawn his own lightsaber, a deep crimson color that Wyatt had always found mesmerizing. He had been a skilled warrior, trained in the ways of the dark side by his own father before him. But even he had been no match for the Jedi, who fought with a ferocity and skill that Wyatt had never seen before.

Wyatt's mother had pushed him towards the door, urging him to run and hide. But he couldn't tear his eyes away from the fight, watching in horror as his father was struck down by one of the Jedi. His uncles fought bravely, but they too were eventually overcome by the Jedi's superior numbers.

Wyatt knew then and there that he would never forgive the Jedi for what they had done. His father had been everything to him, his mentor and his guide. He had taught him how to harness his powers, how to channel his anger and use it to his advantage. And now he was gone, cut down by those who claimed to be defenders of the peace.

As the Jedi left, Wyatt's mother had gathered him in her arms, holding him close as he cried for his father. But even as she comforted him, he could feel a burning anger growing within him. He would make the Jedi pay for what they had done, he swore to himself. He would become stronger than any of them, and he would make them fear him.

""Mother,"" he said, his voice trembling with emotion. ""I want to learn how to fight like father did. I want to be strong, like him.""

His mother had looked down at him, her eyes softening with a mixture of love and sadness. ""You will, my son,"" she said. ""But you must be patient. Your time will come.""


Chapter 5: Revenge

Wyatt had never felt such burning anger before. The Jedi had taken everything from him - his father, his family's power, his sense of security. He knew he could never rest until he had exacted revenge upon them. And so, Wyatt began to take steps towards joining the Sith.

He knew it was a dangerous path, but he felt he had no other choice. The power he would gain from the dark side of the Force was the only way he could hope to avenge his father's death. He began to seek out other Sith, learning what he could from them and showing them what he was capable of.

It wasn't long before Wyatt was noticed by a powerful Sith Lord. The Lord saw potential in Wyatt and took him under his wing, teaching him the ways of the Sith. Wyatt's thirst for power and revenge made him an eager student, and he quickly became a formidable force to be reckoned with.

As he continued his training, Wyatt's anger and hatred towards the Jedi grew stronger. He began to focus all his energy towards becoming stronger and more powerful, with the ultimate goal of destroying the Jedi order.

One day, as he meditated in the darkness of his chambers, he heard a voice whispering to him. It was a voice of power and temptation, and it promised him even more power if he would only give himself fully to the dark side. Wyatt hesitated for only a moment before accepting the offer.

He emerged from his meditation a changed man, his eyes burning with the red glow of the dark side. He knew there was no turning back now, and that he would do whatever it took to achieve his ultimate goal of revenge. The Jedi would pay for what they had done to his family, and he would make sure they feared the name Wyatt.


Chapter 6: Mastering the Dark Side

Under the tutelage of the most powerful Sith masters in the galaxy, Wyatt honed his skills in the ways of the Dark Side. He became a master of the lightsaber, and his Force abilities grew more powerful by the day. He spent long hours training with his fellow Sith apprentices, learning new techniques and tactics, and sparring with one 

another to test their abilities.

Wyatt's natural talent and determination impressed his teachers, and he quickly rose through the ranks of the Sith order. He relished the power that came with his new status, and eagerly embraced the darkest aspects of the Force. As he continued to push his limits and test the boundaries of his power, he discovered new depths of strength within himself that he had never thought possible.

One day, as Wyatt was sparring with a fellow Sith apprentice, he felt a surge of energy coursing through his body. He unleashed a powerful burst of dark energy, sending his opponent flying across the room. The other apprentices stopped their training and stared at him in awe.

""You are strong,"" one of his fellow apprentices said, bowing to him in respect. ""I have never seen anyone wield the Force like that before.""

Wyatt grinned, relishing the praise. ""The Dark Side has given me power beyond my wildest dreams,"" he said. ""And I will continue to master it until there is no one left who can stand against me.""

As he continued to train and grow stronger, Wyatt began to feel a sense of invincibility. He knew that he was destined for greatness, and that no one could stand in his way. His teachers warned him to be careful, to not let his arrogance blind him to the dangers of the Dark Side, but he paid them no heed. He was too consumed by his lust for power and his desire for revenge against the Jedi who had killed his father.

""I will not stop until the Jedi are all destroyed,"" he said to himself, as he continued his training. ""And I will do whatever it takes to make that happen.""


Chapter 7: The Battle of Coruscant

The sky above Coruscant was filled with the deafening sounds of blaster fire and the hum of lightsabers. Wyatt stood among the ranks of the Sith, his eyes fixed on the enemy lines. The Jedi had been pushed back, but they were not going down without a fight.

Wyatt's heart pounded in his chest as he ignited his blood-red lightsaber. He had waited for this moment for so long, to finally face the Jedi in battle and prove himself to the Dark Lords of the Sith.

The two sides clashed, and the battle raged on for hours. Wyatt fought with a fierce determination, his lightsaber cutting through the air with deadly precision. He could feel the power of the Dark Side coursing through him, fueling his every move.

As the battle raged on, Wyatt found himself face-to-face with a Jedi Master. The two locked eyes, each sizing up the other. For a moment, the world around them seemed to fade away as they prepared to fight.

The Jedi made the first move, charging towards Wyatt with a swift strike. Wyatt countered, parrying the blow with ease. The two fighters clashed, their lightsabers creating a shower of sparks with each blow.

The battle was intense, and Wyatt could feel his strength starting to wane. But he refused to give up, pushing himself to the limit. The Jedi was strong, but Wyatt was determined to emerge victorious.

In the end, it was Wyatt who emerged triumphant, his lightsaber slicing through the Jedi's defenses and striking a fatal blow. The Jedi fell to the ground, defeated.

As the battle came to a close, Wyatt stood among the victorious Sith. He had proven himself to be a fearsome warrior, and his reputation among the Dark Lords of the Sith only grew.

 Chapter 8: The Seduction of Power

Wyatt stood atop a balcony overlooking the dark and twisted landscape of Korriban. He had come a long way since his childhood on Vjun, and he could feel the weight of his power resting on his shoulders.

""I can feel it,"" Wyatt said to his closest advisor, a fellow Sith Lord named Xander. ""I am destined for greatness.""

Xander nodded slowly. ""Indeed, my Lord. But be careful not to let your ambition consume you. Power can be a seductive mistress.""

Wyatt scoffed. ""I am not so weak as to be seduced by power. I control it, not the other way around.""

Xander bowed his head. ""Of course, my Lord. But remember, the stronger you become, the more enemies you will make. The Jedi and the Republic will not stand idly by while the Sith rise to power.""

Wyatt turned to face Xander, his eyes blazing with anger. ""Let them come. I am not afraid of the Jedi or the Republic. They will all bow before me.""

As the days turned into weeks, Wyatt became more and more obsessed with gaining power. He would spend hours poring over ancient Sith texts, seeking any knowledge or technique that would make him stronger.

His fellow Sith Lords began to whisper that he was becoming too dangerous, too unpredictable. But Wyatt paid them no mind. He was on a mission to become the most powerful Sith in the galaxy, and he would let nothing stand in his way.



Chapter 9: The Betrayal 

As Wyatt rose in the ranks of the Sith, he found himself becoming more powerful and influential. He relished in the fear he instilled in others, and reveled in the admiration and respect he received from his fellow Sith.

But as his power grew, so too did his paranoia. He began to suspect that there were those who coveted his position, and he constantly watched his back, always on the lookout for any sign of treachery.

It was during one of these moments of hyper-vigilance that Wyatt stumbled upon a plot to overthrow his mentor, Darth Vader. The revelation shook him to his core. He had been loyal to Vader for years, and the thought of turning against him was unfathomable.

But as he dug deeper, he found that the plot was real, and that some of his closest allies were involved. Wyatt knew that he had to act quickly if he wanted to save Vader, and himself.

He began to work in secret, gathering information and building alliances with those he knew he could trust. It was a delicate dance, and he had to be careful not to be discovered.

Finally, the day of the coup arrived. Wyatt was ready, and he struck swiftly and decisively. In a matter of hours, he had eliminated the traitors and saved Vader's life.

But the victory was bittersweet. Wyatt realized that he could never fully trust anyone in the Sith Order, and that he would always be looking over his shoulder, waiting for the next betrayal. The knowledge weighed heavily on him, but he pushed it aside. He was determined to remain in power, no matter the cost.


Chapter 10: The New Sith Order 

After the events of the betrayal, Wyatt found himself in a state of turmoil. He had always been loyal to the Sith, but the recent events had shaken him to his core. He knew that he needed to make a decision about where his true loyalties lay.

As he sat alone in his chambers, contemplating his next move, a familiar voice interrupted his thoughts.

""Your hesitation does not go unnoticed, young one,"" said a deep, gravelly voice from behind him. Wyatt turned to see Darth Vader, his mentor and one of the most powerful Sith lords in the galaxy, standing in the doorway.

""Master,"" Wyatt said, rising to his feet and bowing. ""I...I have been struggling with my loyalty to the Sith.""

""Explain,"" Vader said, his voice betraying no emotion.

Wyatt took a deep breath and began to speak. He told Vader about the betrayal he had uncovered and how it had shaken his faith in the Sith. But even as he spoke, he could feel the pull of the dark side, urging him to seek more power.

Vader listened silently, his expression unreadable. Finally, he spoke.

""You are not the first to face such a crisis of faith,"" he said. ""But know this, Wyatt. The Sith are not just a means to an end. They are a way of life. To betray them is to betray yourself.""

Wyatt nodded, but he knew that his decision was not so simple. He could feel the power of the dark side calling to him, tempting him with promises of untold strength and influence.

""Master, I...I don't know if I can stay true to the Sith,"" he said, his voice shaking slightly. ""But I also know that I can't turn my back on the power that comes with it.""

Vader regarded him for a moment, his eyes seemingly piercing through Wyatt's very soul. Then he spoke.

""The path of the dark side is not an easy one,"" he said. ""But if you are truly committed to it, then you must be willing to make sacrifices. You must be willing to do whatever it takes to achieve your goals.""

Wyatt nodded, his mind made up. He knew what he had to do.

""Master, I am with you,"" he said, his voice firm. ""I will do whatever it takes to help you achieve your goals.""

Vader nodded, a small smile playing at the corner of his mouth.

""Good,"" he said. ""Then we have much work to do.""

And with that, the two Sith lords left the chambers, ready to take on whatever challenges lay ahead."

# ChatGPT: What Is It, And How Reliable Is It For Students?

The introduction of ChatGPT on the internet has stirred up a lot of discussions and whispers about how an AI can write and create pertinent content out of thin air while being just as accurate as a human. Some believe it to be the next best thing to being a human. This makes everyone curious about how an AI can work around it.

[In this blog, you will read about the following:](https://desklib.com/blog/what-is-chat-gpt/)

2.How does chatGPT work

3.Analyzing academic questions using ChatGPT

11ohjrj,10,2023-03-11,Frequently Asked Questions About IELTS,u/Maverick_ESL,IELTS,https://www.reddit.com/r/IELTS/comments/11ohjrj/frequently_asked_questions_about_ielts/,"1. **Where can I find reliable resources to practice with?**

You can find such resources in [**this post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/IELTS_Guide/comments/ubekzu/ielts_preparation_resources_and_advice/).

2.  **What is a good IELTS score?**

It all depends on your purpose. Why do you want to take the test? If it’s needed for your university application, you need to find out what band score they require. For some test takers, 6.5 is good news; for some others, it’s a disaster. In short, figure out what score you need first.

3.  **Does spelling affect my score?**

Short answer: YES!

Long answer: In reading and listening, your answers should be spelled correctly; otherwise, you’ll lose points. In writing, we may sometimes make minor spelling mistakes called slips. For band 9, one or two minor slips are fine, but more mistakes will definitely lower your band score.

4.  **Is it a bad sign if the speaking examiner kept interrupting me?**

Not at all! Maybe even a good sign, because it means you were talking. The worst thing you can do is give one-word answers; remember, it’s a speaking test, so SPEAK.  The examiner has to get through a list of questions, so they will interrupt you to move on to the next question.  And if they don’t interrupt you, it’s also fine.  But if they have to keep asking you “Why? Why? Why?” it means you aren’t giving long enough answers.

5.  **Why is my writing score so low?**

Listening and reading skills usually develop earlier than productive skills (speaking and writing). This is one of the reasons why students find it easier to improve their receptive skills. Plus, speaking has more room for flexibility than writing. In speaking, you hear a question and then start talking, so it's more forgiving to mistakes. There is also less time pressure in speaking than in writing. Plus, people, in general, rarely write essays, reports, or letters, but they speak English in every session of their English course. Sadly, some language schools even ignore writing skills until their students get to advanced levels.

In addition, there are some common mistakes that can be easily fixed. Read [**this**](https://www.reddit.com/r/IELTS_Guide/comments/125swhq/why_is_my_writing_score_so_low_task_1/) for task 1, and [**this one**](https://www.reddit.com/r/IELTS_Guide/comments/125sxco/why_is_my_writing_score_so_low_task_2/) for task 2.

By the way, some students, for some reason, hate writing and don't practice it enough. They read all the guides and books and think that they are good to go. But the bitter truth is, writing is a patient game. You can't develop good writing skills overnight. You need a lot of practice, and if possible, detailed feedback from an expert to push forward.

6.  **What is a good word count for task 1 and task 2?**

Read [**this guide**](https://www.reddit.com/r/IELTS_Guide/comments/zsfky4/ielts_writing_word_count/) to learn everything about word count in IELTS writing.

7.  **Can I use ChatGPT to score my writing tasks?**

This AI can be useful for things like giving you a list of linking words, vocabulary for a certain topic, examples of a grammar structure, and so on, but **it's not** a good idea to rely heavily on it. [**Here is why**](https://www.reddit.com/r/IELTS_Guide/comments/10v1iz9/can_you_rely_on_chatgpt_to_score_your_ielts/). Even the AI itself is clear about the fact that it can't replace a qualified human writing evaluator.

8.  **Can I post my essays, letters, reports, and speaking here for evaluation?**

You can but you should know that this is mostly a community of test takers. Anyone can comment, so there is no guarantee of accurate, detailed, or reliable evaluation **in the comments**. As you can see, most of the test results posted in this subreddit have the writing score the lowest. This is mainly because while the free community help here has been useful in their prep, they could have performed much better if they had used professional help.

This is why we strongly recommend you find a reputable service like this sub's  [**IELTS writing course**](https://www.eslfluency.com/ielts-writing-mentoring/) or [**correction service**](https://www.eslfluency.com/ielts-writing-correction-service/). You can watch student testimonials [**here**](https://www.facebook.com/watch/100091184513280/1591545547980530)**.**

As for speaking, you can use [**Anfisa's simulators**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwKcPOoWwawyayaq8w8TVZ1oprCRonnCO)**.** These videos are designed by her to help you simulate your IELTS speaking session. On this channel, you can also send her your speaking files for evaluation.

9.  **Where can I find a speaking partner to speak with?**

Feel free to start a post asking for one, but remember this is the internet. Be careful of giving out personal information. Your partner might be a real student seeking a study partner or a random person not even interested in IELTS. Be very careful!

10.  **How should I prepare for the test?**

I recommend that you follow the steps in [**this guide**](https://www.reddit.com/r/IELTS_Guide/comments/ua4lhr/tips_for_ielts_6_how_to_prepare_for_the_test/).

11.  **Should I book the test and then start my prep?**

Prep always comes first. Read [**this guide**](https://www.reddit.com/r/IELTS_Guide/comments/v4p1e4/when_should_you_book_your_ielts/) for more detail.

12.  **What should I do the day before my test?**

You can find some good suggestions in [**this post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/IELTS/comments/qibkc9/do_these_the_day_before_your_test/).

13.  **I need to cancel my test/get a refund. How do I do that?**

[**Here**](https://www.ielts.org/for-test-takers/cancellations-refunds-transfers) is the official guide.

14.  **What should I take to the test venue?**

The exact same ID or passport you’ve used to book your test, two HB pencils, and a pencil sharpener. In most centers, you are also allowed to bring a bottle of water with the label removed. No other items will be permitted in the test room. A room will be available to secure personal items such as watches and smartphones. You can check with your center to see if they have any other requirements due to Covid.

15.  **When can I expect my test result?**

For paper-based and IELTS for UKVI, 13 days after your written test. Computer-based test results are available 3–5 days after your test. If you have taken IELTS Online, you will receive your Test Report Form electronically. It will be available 3–6 days after your test. More information [**here**](https://www.ielts.org/for-test-takers/results).

16.  **Where can I find an active discord community to practice with other students?**

Discords can be useful for IELTS prep, but unfortunately, we don't have such a community for our sub. That said, you can find many discord IELTS servers by going to [discord.com](https://discord.com/), clicking on ""discover,"" and searching for any kind of communities you want. No such servers will be promoted here to keep the sub spam-free and safe for everyone. It's completely up to you to find one that meets your needs.

17.    **How long does it take to prepare for IELTS?**

You can find the answer in [**this post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/IELTS_Guide/comments/12drtda/how_long_does_it_take_to_prepare_for_ielts/).

I’m so angry right now I have no idea what to do. This is fresh off the heels of discovering one student straight up submitting code from ChatGPT, and others doing the same but at least having the sense to chance the variables so I don’t have a case against them. I’m ready to throw in the towel, these students (particularly in our program and those whom had the majority of their undergraduate classes online due to COVID) are truly something else."

11onwrv,64,2023-03-11,List of all game variables exported at the EP8 end and imported in Season 3 and new ones from EP9,u/Gre4ka666,beingaDIK,https://www.reddit.com/r/beingaDIK/comments/11onwrv/list_of_all_game_variables_exported_at_the_ep8/,"As we know, at the end of Season 2 game offers us to create a transfer save files for Season 3 and futher use. I digged game script in order to find out which variables were exported and imported. It's important to understand what was discarded, purged or hadn't any sense for future plot events.

But also if some variables dissapeared, it doesn't mean at all that some of our previous actions can't be determined later. For example some of the variables discarded because it's enough to save only one variable that belonged to some event. So, DPC optimized it as much as possible.

I haven't included very obvious variables in this list, like MC's current money, trofeys at his table or paintings in his room, etc, but only ones, that depended on our choises and actions during first 8 episodes.

The shortened a bit list of EP 1-8 exported and imported variables consist of 360 (!!!) entries. Also I included newest variables for Interlude and EP9 (68 entries).

Each variable have a brief description, so you can learn and relate to what game really stored during your playthrough.

I made an Excel sheet that's easier to search, explore and read than ""code"" format in the post. Also it contains additional data and have a better structure. You can view or download it here:

11ouhin,131,2023-03-11,Using ChatGPT to aid in your daily grad school tasks.,u/Impossible-Cry-495,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/11ouhin/using_chatgpt_to_aid_in_your_daily_grad_school/,"Hey fellow grad students,

I am interested in how others have been using ChatGPT to aid in their daily tasks without resorting to unethical practices such as cheating.

Personally, I have been using ChatGPT to generate outlines and summaries for my research papers. I simply input my research question or topic, and ChatGPT generates an outline or summary based on the information available online. This has saved me a lot of time and effort, and I still get to learn and understand the material. It also helps me get out of writers block. 

Another way I have been using ChatGPT is by pasting my syllabus into it and generating a study schedule. ChatGPT analyzes the syllabus and suggests a schedule based on the workload and deadlines. This has helped me stay organized and on track with my coursework.

&amp;#x200B;

So, how have you been using ChatGPT in your grad school journey? Let's share our experiences and learn from each other. Remember, let's keep the conversation ethical and focused on using ChatGPT to aid our learning, not to cheat.

Looking forward to your responses!"
11ox8ub,1,2023-03-11,Is ChatGPT a suitable topic for ITGS / CompSci EE?,u/Moneysaver04,IBO,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/11ox8ub/is_chatgpt_a_suitable_topic_for_itgs_compsci_ee/,"I've always been interested in technology and frankly Large Language Models are one of them. I watch a lot of videos about ChatGPT on Computerphile and I am interested to know how it works behind the scenes, is it influenced by redlist? Is it generating weird output, cuz it wants to minimize punishment, or what happens once it reaches absolute point where it can perfectly predict the next word [the output starts decline as no more rewards to be obtained]. Things like this. 

I was going to explore HS students, Workers or Security as a part of my research on society level. I want to touch on topic relating to the ability to think critically and being able to allocate one's full focus on something. Like DeepWork by Cal Newport, but that may become psychology EE

Initially I wanted to do EE on CompSci, but the number of topics were limited and my teacher kept repeating to ask ""What is the significance?"" Which annoyed to my core,as the algorithms had already been tested and they want you to come up w something new.

I chose LLM for my ITGS EE, but seeing how relatively new ChatGPT is it becomes hard to measure its significance on a society level, however it opens up doors to do research on a CompSci level, because it's new, I can do experiments with it"

Where should I begin? Where did you begin? I was thinking of beginning by learning the traits of sun signs (or like the traits of for example  gemini sun, etc.) would that be a good start? I have dyslexia so that can slow my learning down tho😅 I also am a student so I don’t have much money to buy books, however I already have a couple astrology books however they are more about sun signs and not like deep dives yk😀

I would be interested in learning about like predicting the future using astrology and stuff but I feel like I should begin by learning the basics😅Thanks in advantage!"

11pvrya,7,2023-03-12,Is it legit to receive LoR like this?,u/DeltaSquash,Cornell,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/11pvrya/is_it_legit_to_receive_lor_like_this/,"My friend shared this link to me about a suspicious practice of getting LoR from big name professors:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://posts.careerengine.us/p/640e198f21f6c86037bf3aa1?from=latest-posts-panel&amp;type=title](https://posts.careerengine.us/p/640e198f21f6c86037bf3aa1?from=latest-posts-panel&amp;type=title)

One of the students was accepted by Cornell Fall 2023.

&amp;#x200B;

His words translated by ChatGPT from Chinese (including some of my friend's fixes):

&amp;#x200B;

Leonard (Not his real name. So not against the doxxing rule.)

&amp;#x200B;

TOEFL 110, SAT not submitted

&amp;#x200B;

Title: ""Leonard has been admitted to Cornell University without standardized test scores! Professor (from) Brown (University) helped make his dream come true at Ivy League school.""

&amp;#x200B;

""I heard about the CIS program from a senior. At that time, I had not participated in any academic activities and had not even completed any serious research. When it was difficult to ensure academic activities and summer schools, I remembered the CIS program. At that time, I hoped to use it to improve my academic background. Fortunately, CIS has many qualified professors.""

&amp;#x200B;

""In this CIS program, I became more determined to study astronomy and astrophysics, and learned the charm of teaching and educating from Professor Tucker.""

&amp;#x200B;

""This experience was one of the most important activities in my application, and had a decisive impact on me as an applicant who did not submit standardized test scores. It not only proved my academic abilities, but also leadership, team cohesion, and learning ability.""

&amp;#x200B;

""I remember the professor once commented on me, 'No matter what complex problems Leonard encounters or how difficult the knowledge is to understand, he is always the most enthusiastic person among us.' This comment made me very happy.""

&amp;#x200B;

***Tl;dr:***

Chinese private high school students' ***possibly expensive*** 10-week summer camp (8 weeks remote + 2 weeks in-person). Professors from top tier universities tutored the high schoolers to write conference papers, provided academic evaluation reports, letters of recommendation (***possibly always positive***), transcripts for the applicants.

&amp;#x200B;

***Opinions:***

I feel this is a little suspicious and in the gray area of AI (academic integrity) for college application."

After each word, I will provide the definition and an example sentence. Then, I will ask you to type the word to indicate that you are repeating it. Then have you take your time to think of a sentence that uses the word correctly and shows you understand its meaning. After you type your sentence, I will provide feedback on your understanding of the word and give you the chance to try again as needed before we move on to the next word. Please make sure to type your responses, and I will wait for your input before proceeding. Remember, I am the teacher, and I will not respond as the student.                                                                                                                      After the lesson, you will end with a writing prompt that incorporates the vocabulary words just learned. You will be asked to write a short story using the words I provided. Be sure to use correct grammar and punctuation in your writing, and try to make your story as creative and engaging as possible.                                                                                                                      Finally, I will grade your understanding of the words using a 4-point rubric. The rubric will evaluate your understanding of the words, your use of correct grammar and punctuation, and your performance on the writing prompt. I will show you the results of the rubric in a grid form, so you can see how well you did.

their future, so why not let them practice their skills? PLEASE don't let there
be a ""ChatGPT class"" - that'd be a horrible idea because it's such an intrinsic change
to our operating procedures that it needs to be taught in relation to every
subject. Math, science, history, literature, everything... it's all affected.

Don't punish people for using the new intellectual tool at their disposal. Reward them and give
them the space to put their skills to a test. Raise your standards, teach them
complex subjects that they can ask infinite questions about. Your time is no
longer divided between 40 students, you now have a TA that can flawlessly answer
any question they might have. Your personal touch is still important of course, you can
help them ask the right questions and guide them through the thought patterns of truth.

If we do not adapt, our coming generation will be flatfooted. Give them the
tools they need to succeed. The world is changing in a fundamental way and they
need to be prepared."

11pzbr9,3,2023-03-12,"[TOMT][Novel][Fiction] A book, possibly by Bukowski, Gaiman, or Salinger where there's a popular teacher the kids like to hang out with after school. It's heavily implied at some point later in the novel that the teacher has students masturbate him.",u/ThenCarryWindSpace,tipofmytongue,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/11pzbr9/tomtnovelfiction_a_book_possibly_by_bukowski/,"I thought it was Catcher in the Rye but I can't find this passage anywhere. I know Bukowski wrote about flashes of childhood in some of his works, but I can't find that either. Gaiman has done a lot of short stories and stuff in addition to his major works, some of them involving sexuality, but I don't think this is quite up his alley.

I asked ChatGPT and ChatGPT told me this was straight-up offensive and wouldn't be present in any mainstream work, but I am 100% positive I read it, and I'm not sure why the passage is so hard to find.

**edit:** I remember one of the characters talking to the main character (who didn't want to hang out with the teacher after classes for whatever reason).

The character says to the main character something like, ""Have you ever rubbed off an adult before? They splooge a lot and try to put it in your mouth.""

And it was just brushed over after that. I find it funny that such a direct and potentially controversially passage isn't able to be easily found.

**edit 2:** Ham on Rye is closest so far with ChatGPT telling me students masturbated in front of the teacher. However, ChatGPT removed its own response for being a content violation, so sadly I do not think it will be able to help me much further.

I'm starting to believe this is from one of Neil Gaiman's stories about boarding schools, but I remember it being quite extensive reading, and I've only ever read Neil Gaiman's short stories I think.

After all, ChatGPT seems to be able to generate Python code, and Meta released a NeurIPS paper to show you can learn math equations from data using a transformer-based model, so why not logic? In this article, we will one line of research in this area – differential ILP.

The research in this area really kicked off with a 2018 [paper from DeepMind](https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11172) where Richard Evans and Edward Grefenstette showed that you could adapt techniques from “inductive logic programming” to use gradient descent, and learn logical rules from data. Previous (non-neural) work on inductive logic programming was generally not designed to work with noisy data and instead fit the historical examples in a precise manner. Evans and Grefenstette utilized a neural architecture and a loss function – and they showed they could handle noisy data and even do some level of integration with CNN’s. Their neural architecture mimicked a set of candidate logical rules – and the rules assigned higher weights by gradient descent would be thought to best fit the data. However, a downside to this approach is that the neural network was [quintic in the size of the input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOnAE0EyX8c&amp;list=PLpqh-PUKX-i7URwnkTqpAkSchJHvbxZHB&amp;index=5). This is why they only applied their approach on very small problems – it did not see very wide adoption.

That said, in the last two years, there have been some notable follow-ons to this work. Researchers out of Kyoto University and NTT introduced a manner to learn rules that are more expressive in a different manner by allowing function symbols in the logical language ([Shindo et al., AAAI 2021](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/16637/16444)). They leverage a clause search and refinement process to limit the number of candidate rules – hence limiting the size of the neural network. A student team from ASU created a presentation on their work for our recent seminar course on neuro symbolic AI. We released a three part video series from their talk:

INTERVIEW WITH PETER THIEL

# ""Google is completely in panic mode""

In this interview, he talks about inert Silicon Valley, Germany's vulnerable economy and the revolutionary power of AI.

The first glimpse into the private home of arguably the most influential tech mastermind of our time reveals something surprisingly unspectacular. Peter Thiel co-founded Paypal when no one believed in the future of digital payment, he invested in Elon Musk's rocket company SpaceX when no one wanted to follow his vision, and with his Founders Fund he primarily promotes the ideas of young technology companies that seem like distant visions of the future.

&amp;#x200B;

But when you meet this 55-year-old, who is as extraordinary as he is controversial, in his private home in Miami, the first thing you see in the hallway are two baby carriages. It is a February day when Handelsblatt meets Thiel, who almost never gives interviews, there.

&amp;#x200B;

A modern, 18-million-dollar mansion on one of the artificial ""Venetian Islands"" in the Gulf of Miami. His two daughters are playing at the dining table. Thiel, whose parents once emigrated from Germany, comes into the salon on socks, greets in German, and the following interview is conducted in English.

...(edited)

Mr. Thiel, the world is discussing technology more intensively than it has in years, and at the center of the debate is the ChatGPT program. Bill Gates recently told Handelsblatt that it was as important as the invention of the Internet. What is happening right now?

*We are experiencing a historic turning point, perhaps even the most important moment since the launch of the iPhone. In any case, this moment will change Silicon Valley. I was actually skeptical about AI for a long time.* 

Why?

*People tend to overestimate the speed of technological development. I've experienced that myself. For example, when we founded Paypal in 1999, we already wanted to be the world's first mobile bank. But it wasn't until years later, with the iPhone, that the vision became reality. It was only with the iPhone that the technology reached the mass market. It's a similar story with AI. We have been discussing the potential impact of artificial intelligence for decades. Only now is it getting serious. All the media hype is therefore justified for once.*

&amp;#x200B;

You said this moment will change Silicon Valley.

&amp;#x200B;

*Yes, the consequences will be dramatic. After Microsoft announced it would integrate ChatGPT's technology into its Bing search engine, Alphabet launched its own chatbot, Bard. When it made a mistake, Alphabet lost about $150 billion in stock market value in a week.*

&amp;#x200B;

... (edited)

In your book ""Zero to One,"" you called for founders to always aim for a monopoly position. Google had such a monopoly in Internet search for more than 20 years.

&amp;#x200B;

*And investors understand very well that this position, and thus Google's entire business model, is now at stake. If Microsoft manages to revolutionize the search business with the help of AI, that changes everything.*

&amp;#x200B;

Don't you trust Google anymore?

&amp;#x200B;

*The fact is, Google is completely in panic mode. We hear that even Sergey Brin is back in the office programming. We're experiencing something big right now because power is being redistributed. For the past ten years, Silicon Valley has been in a kind of sleep wagon. Now everyone is being rudely awakened.*

&amp;#x200B;

And the debate is starting again about whether AI will soon make millions of jobs redundant. You once wrote that people wouldn't have to worry about AI until the 22nd century. Was that a mistake?

&amp;#x200B;

*Yes and no. History shows that machines have always taken over human work. Take the textile mills in the late 18th and early 19th centuries: They became more efficient with machines and were able to produce more clothes. Or the car manufacturer Ford, whose then novel production lines made massive efficiency gains possible. It's a similar story in agriculture. Machines have taken over work in many areas so that people can attend to more meaningful tasks.*

&amp;#x200B;

For the first time, it now looks like not only simple tasks will be automated - but also the jobs of knowledge workers.

&amp;#x200B;

*And why is that a problem? I would rather focus on the positive effects.*

&amp;#x200B;

To be specific?

&amp;#x200B;

*In recent years, I have been thinking intensively about the economic stagnation of the West ...*

&amp;#x200B;

... even though countries like the U.S., Germany or Great Britain have grown.

&amp;#x200B;

*This has largely overlooked the fact that there is hardly any real innovation left in many sectors. As a result, productivity has been stagnating for years. Yet we all need to become more efficient. After all, the distribution conflicts of an aging society can only be resolved if the pie to be distributed grows. AI can help with this.*

&amp;#x200B;

Silicon Valley has produced enormous innovations and huge tech companies, which have also made you rich as an investor. Do you no longer expect any growth impetus from the tech giants?

&amp;#x200B;

*I would always distinguish between the tech corporations as fantastic profit machines and as innovation engines. The digital players have high fixed costs, but once they get to a certain size, the margins are huge because bits - zeros and ones - have no marginal costs. This creates extraordinarily profitable companies that employ a relatively small number of people. At the same time, their size prevents innovation in the long run.*

&amp;#x200B;

How so?

&amp;#x200B;

*It's a paradoxical situation: their business models are great. But that these companies are also the most innovative places in the world is little more than a propaganda fairy tale.*

&amp;#x200B;

Big-tech representatives regularly get upset when they are accused of this.

&amp;#x200B;

*Take Google, for example: They've been telling us about self-driving cars and Google glasses for years, but where are they?*

&amp;#x200B;

I was on the road in Phoenix with a Google cab without a driver. The glasses were actually a flop.

&amp;#x200B;

*Right. I had this debate with \[then Google Chairman\] Eric Schmidt in 2012. Google was making about ten billion dollars in profit, sitting on about 50 billion in cash, and only spending about five billion dollars on R&amp;D. We should remember: at that time, the interest rate was zero percent. I said: Google spends far too little on research and development. If you're sitting on $50 billion in cash at a zero percent interest rate, you're out of ideas. Many tech companies start out as bets on innovation, but after a certain size, they become bets against innovation. Take Apple: Apple makes about 50 percent of its revenue from the iPhone. But since Steve Jobs died in 2011, Apple hasn't innovated.*

&amp;#x200B;

Listening to you, it sounds like you're done with Silicon Valley.

&amp;#x200B;

*You know, my parents moved to Foster City, California, at the end of 1977. It's halfway between the San Francisco airport and Palo Alto.*

&amp;#x200B;

They were ten years old at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

*And it was, looking back, the last ten years that there was a broad middle class in California. My parents were able to just buy a house on the Peninsula, in a community that had been built on a former landfill. But then things went downhill for the middle class. Many industries went down the drain. The technology industry grew, but employed relatively few people by comparison. The structural change might still have been manageable, but then came the real estate problem.*

&amp;#x200B;

Speculation with land?

&amp;#x200B;

*Yes. The economist Henry George, whom I hold in very high esteem, was considered a kind of socialist in the 19th century and is now considered more of a libertarian. His basic thesis is that you shouldn't tax labor or capital, but you should tax land use. Because otherwise there are too many people living only on rental income. Also, there has never been an effective housing policy. If anything, housing construction has been discouraged in the South Bay Area - with dramatic consequences: If you measure quality of life by how much housing the middle class can afford, it has steadily deteriorated over the last 40 to 50 years. The political elite in California has failed.*

&amp;#x200B;

In what way?

&amp;#x200B;

*If you have a normal job in the private sector today, as a waiter for example, you're worse off than you were in 1980, but if you work in public service in California, you make twice as much as the average private sector worker. It's a crazy, almost corrupt rip-off.*

&amp;#x200B;

The last politician to make dreaming of past greatness a campaign issue was Donald Trump.

&amp;#x200B;

*There was something about Donald Trump that particularly disturbed people in Silicon Valley, much more than in other parts of the country. I think it was his slogan, ""Make America great again."" It was very compatible with the ideas of people on Wall Street; they don't care about the future, they only care about their wallets. But for the Valley, Trump's slogan was a frontal assault. It was the most pessimistic slogan ever intoned by a presidential candidate, because he sought the future in the past.*

&amp;#x200B;

Social networks like Facebook played an important role in Trump's rise. You sat on the board of directors for a long time. How was that actually discussed internally at Facebook?

&amp;#x200B;

*At Facebook, the narrative internally until 2016 was: We're just wonderful and doing all these great things for the world. - And people really believed that. Then in 2017, when the company had to deal with allegations of Russian election interference, the whole worldview collapsed: From believing you were the most wonderful thing in the world, to believing you were only doing bad things.*

&amp;#x200B;

...(edited) 

Thiel Capital, the billionaire's investment firm, also employs former Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz - as a ""global strategist."" Kurz and Thiel speak regularly on the phone, the contents of which are secret. ""Peter is a brilliant mind with an incredible flair for innovation,"" Kurz told Handelsblatt.

&amp;#x200B;

America has not overcome Donald Trump to this day. He has snubbed partners and flirted with dictators. The country remains deeply divided. You were the first prominent representative of the tech scene to back him in the 2016 election campaign. How do you look at his time in office today? Are you disillusioned with Trump?

&amp;#x200B;

*Let's put it this way: we're all exhausted by politics. Let's talk about it in five or ten years and see how things are then.*

&amp;#x200B;

You stayed out of the 2020 campaign. You must have an opinion about his record ...

&amp;#x200B;

*Trump is always portrayed as this crazy person, an elephant in a china store. But in fact, not that much has changed. My criticism would be that he hasn't really focused on the important structural problems.*

&amp;#x200B;

For example.

&amp;#x200B;

*There's the geopolitical conflict with China, which Trump was the first to recognize, and issues of energy security and how we best manage technological change. But our biggest challenge is technological stagnation. We live in a low-growth society, both in the U.S. and in Europe, and that has dramatic consequences. The promise of the West has always been that younger people will be better off than their parents. Of course, there are differences between California and Germany, but this generational contract has been broken on both sides of the Atlantic.*

&amp;#x200B;

It's not as if politicians haven't recognized this.

&amp;#x200B;

*Recognizing the problem alone is not enough; they must also try to solve it. The problems are difficult to solve, and people sense that. I suspect that's why we'll see a number of U.S. presidents who manage only one term. Trump was one of those, Biden probably will be too. And a possible next president, Ron DeSantis, would also probably only get one term.*

&amp;#x200B;

Will you support DeSantis, the governor of Florida, as a presidential candidate?

&amp;#x200B;

*If Biden is the alternative, I would support DeSantis any day.*

&amp;#x200B;

Criticism of DeSantis is similar to the criticism once levelled at Donald Trump. In the eyes of his critics, he is a populist, homophobic anti-abortionist who has thousands of lives on his conscience with his loose covid policies. Practically a smarter and therefore more dangerous version of Donald Trump.

&amp;#x200B;

*The problem is that we no longer talk about the real challenge: namely, how to create prosperity and a better future for the next generation. We have not been interested in this question since the 1970s. Instead, especially in the last decade, we have used psychological magic tricks to divert people's attention to silly problems that are easier to solve. But I think it's important that we not get distracted and focus on the real challenges.*

&amp;#x200B;

""Silly problems?"" That brings to mind the conservative battle term ""wokeness"" and the criticism of that movement. ""Wokeness"" activists call for more representation for long-marginalized groups, including women, blacks, gays and lesbians. You're married to a man yourself. What's actually the problem with that?

&amp;#x200B;

*Let me try a critique that is both libertarian and Marxist. The problem with wokeness is that we have endless complicated debates about historical injustice, forgiveness, and reconciliation. There are incredible historical injustices. At the time of slavery, millions of black people were mistreated in the United States. We have to deal with that heavy legacy. But we do not change the real lives of people, the world of atoms, by doing so. The debate is becoming more and more distant from the reality of people's lives, who right now are rather wondering how they can still finance their car, their house, their whole life in the face of inflation.*

&amp;#x200B;

Wait a minute, if women in corporations are paid less than men, for example, then that is very much a debate that is very close to the economic reality of many people's lives.

&amp;#x200B;

*The debate has long since moved on; today we are talking about so-called climate justice. Take Walmart: It was the prototype of an old-fashioned corporation in the mid-2000s that came under pressure to give its underpaid workers more money. How did Walmart respond? It decided to brand itself as a green company, with more solar panels and recycling. That split the anti-Walmart alliance and took the corporation out of the line of fire. The green self-promotion was cheap. And the workers, women and men alike, didn't get a dime more.*

&amp;#x200B;

Conservatives also don't want to talk about certain things.

&amp;#x200B;

*Of course there are people with gender dysphoria who don't identify with the gender assigned at birth. Conservatives' response of simply ignoring these people cannot be the right one.*

&amp;#x200B;

Your longtime business partner Elon Musk bought Twitter after much back and forth and declared his intention to disrupt the leftist opinion mainstream. That should have been right up your alley.

&amp;#x200B;

*We all know Elon does exactly what he wants. I had my doubts that Elon would succeed in the acquisition. Buying Twitter is like a coup in a banana republic.*

&amp;#x200B;

Excuse me?

&amp;#x200B;

*Take a banana republic, where a regime has prevailed for many years and spreads its ideology. Such regimes often use the radio for this purpose. The propaganda radio of Silicon Valley is Twitter. And the dialogue there has narrowed to standard center-left phrases.*

&amp;#x200B;

They must mean a different Twitter than we do. In addition to many liberal commentators, there are also many conservative, extreme left-wing and extreme right-wing users, at least in Europe, who can spread their sometimes crude ideas undisturbed.

&amp;#x200B;

*Even many Twitter employees ended up so exhausted by the dictates of opinion that they were glad when someone decreed more plurality.*

&amp;#x200B;

Twitter founder Jack Dorsey has repeatedly spoken out in favor of diversity of opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

*Jack was the figurehead of a madhouse that had been taken over by its inmates. At Twitter itself, only the left-wing mainstream set the tone. I think Jack was happy when Elon took the helm. Elon struggled at first, but is now making headway. As you know, I'm a big proponent of broad free speech. However, it is also not a panacea. After all, many people don't have anything interesting to say at all. So it's not just about clearing the pipes, but also about what flows through them.*

&amp;#x200B;

In Germany, there are many observers who are concerned about what flows through the pipes in your area. Your critics see above all contradictions and contacts as far as the extreme right camp. The ZDF Late Night host Jan Böhmermann recently portrayed you as a kind of James Bond villain.

&amp;#x200B;

*I saw that, it was a cool video.*

&amp;#x200B;

You describe yourself as a libertarian conservative who cares about civil rights. At the same time, you founded Palantir, an analysis company for intelligence agencies and police. How does that fit together?

&amp;#x200B;

*Very nicely. I think you can defend individual freedom and at the same time be convinced that we need a functioning intelligence service. We created Palantir to track down terrorists, enemies of our way of life. I was even more concerned about the alternative, a Dick Cheney state, an intrusive low-tech solution like at the airport where everyone has to take off their shoes. A tech solution promised a high level of security with less invasion of privacy. 9/11 showed how civil liberties can be curtailed after a terrorist attack. So Palantir was about preventing the next big attack.*

&amp;#x200B;

You are a staunch critic of the U.S. higher education system, where elitist universities wield great power. At the same time, much of your professional network is based on your time at Stanford. Not a contradiction?

&amp;#x200B;

*Well, imagine if I were a critic of the university system and had never seen the inside of a university? Then people would accuse me of being stupid. In the U.S., universities have turned into knowledge factories where every employee is told what science to do. On top of that, most students have to leave university with very large debts, which narrows the choice of possible fields of work to those industries that will allow them to pay off the debt, like finance or tech. This is a kind of degenerate Apollo program that prevents creativity and innovation. Big Science today is a contradiction in terms. Young people need to be given the chance to think freely again.*

&amp;#x200B;

You have shaped the tech world like few others. Can you understand that some observers are frightened by your influence?

&amp;#x200B;

*I think we always tend to make a straw man out of someone we don't like. We then project all the bad qualities onto him until there is nothing left of the real person.*

&amp;#x200B;

Let's look across the Atlantic. Many U.S. investors take a dim view of Europe's future. Are you too?

&amp;#x200B;

*It's always easy to be too pessimistic. That's why there's a part of me that wants to resist it. In Germany, for example, people are very negative about the future. At the same time, there are so many talented, well-educated people there. Germany is perhaps the country with the biggest gap between self-perception and potential. The problem is: there is no powerful, inspiring vision for the future - neither in Germany nor in the rest of Europe.*

&amp;#x200B;

What does your vision look like?

&amp;#x200B;

*If a vision of the future is to prevail, it must promise a future that looks different from the present. I've used this example in the past, but I'll repeat it again: When Germans look into the future, they see three alternatives. Behind door number one is the Islamic theocracy in which every woman is forced to wear a burqa. Behind door number two is Chinese surveillance communism, a state in which every movement of every person is monitored at all times by a central AI. Finally, behind door number three is Greta's green future, where everyone rides a bicycle. There is no fourth door. All three options are weak, but in 2023, I feel like Greta's future is the only option. Greta's promise seems reassuringly concrete. It seems to me the Greens may be the best and most principled party.*

&amp;#x200B;

Is the impression correct that Europe is becoming more dependent in all directions?

&amp;#x200B;

*I'm not saying I know all the complexities of the German debate, but I would say that the political discussions have been too narrow. Take Fukushima. Under Angela Merkel, nuclear power plants were shut down. Of course, that was a rash, hasty decision, but even worse, it was not corrected even after a decade. Other alternative energy sources have also been rejected, for example fracking and the construction of liquefied natural gas terminals. Instead, the focus has been on cheap natural gas from Russia. There was never a back-up plan, which took its revenge at the latest with the Russian attack on Ukraine.*

&amp;#x200B;

Germany now even imports US fracked gas.

&amp;#x200B;

*Even more serious is the co-dependence between Germany and communist China. To Russia, there was one, maybe two Nord Stream pipelines. To China, there is the equivalent of 100 pipelines due to close economic ties. That becomes the real problem over the next 100 years.*

&amp;#x200B;

How could this happen?

&amp;#x200B;

*There is very little strategic thinking in Germany. When there are pennies in front of a bulldozer, the Germans try to pick them up until they are flattened.*

&amp;#x200B;

I don't what you are saying.

&amp;#x200B;

*Let me use Volkswagen as an example, a very successful German company that is problematically entangled with China. So if you look at the party landscape in Germany, the SPD represents labor at VW, the CDU represents management, and the FDP represents shareholders. All three will say that continuing to pick up the pennies is the right strategy. Probably the Greens are the only hope that this strategy will be reconsidered. That's a big challenge.*

&amp;#x200B;

What does the bulldozer do, specifically?

&amp;#x200B;

*The Chinese model is to copy the West and steal whatever intellectual property you can get your hands on. This is especially a problem for German companies, which have a lot more intellectual property than their U.S. counterparts. They look at China far too naively.*

&amp;#x200B;

You're calling for innovations not only in bits, as in the Valley, but also in atoms. Is Germany's research strength an asset for the future?

&amp;#x200B;

*Yes, Germany has a middle class that is strong in research and development. And Germany has excellent scientists. Take mRNA research, which gave us the covid vaccine. But the problem is to start and build a company in Germany. That requires a lot of capital. And since there is a lack of that in Germany, other investors have to step in, for example from the U.S. or the Middle East. For them, it has long been a matter of course to get involved in Germany.*

&amp;#x200B;

What do you expect for Europe in the coming years?

&amp;#x200B;

*The U.S. has gone crazy in the covid pandemic. Washington handed out checks among the people and had a big party. It's different in Germany and Western Europe: there was a serious recession in 2020, 2021. Europe will now go through a cyclical recovery, and the U.S. will wake up with a hangover. So I think that in 2022, and probably even in 2023, Europe will grow much faster than the US. How it will then fare in the rest of the decade is another question.*

You once said that every company is built around a secret. What's the new ""zero to one"" idea you see out there?

&amp;#x200B;

*At Founders Fund, we invested in Stripe, an all-in-all payment system that has gone up against legacy payment networks and banks. The other big company in our portfolio is SpaceX. Now you can be critical and say they haven't reinvented the wheel. Rockets are old technology from the 1950s. But SpaceX has made space travel much more efficient. Now, half of the rocket no longer has to be thrown away with every launch. On top of that, Starlink is a global Internet service. SpaceX is, in some ways, the biggest of the Elon companies.*

Do you regret not investing in Tesla? Musk had offered it to you.

&amp;#x200B;

*You always regret a lot of things you didn't do. I drove the Roadster, I found it uncomfortable. And Tesla struggled for years to raise the money for the financing rounds leading up to the IPO. The optimal time to buy the stock was when the Model S was ready, in the fall of 2012, it was a fantastic car. That's when I could have gotten ten times that in about 24 months. We had a rule at the time that we would only invest in private companies, not publicly traded ones. But actually that was more of an excuse. That we didn't invest was a mistake.*

*Any that involve a major scientific breakthrough that not only makes money, but also moves us forward as a civilization. People just look at their screens instead of the world around them. That has to change.*

&amp;#x200B;

Which sector has the most potential for such a breakthrough?

&amp;#x200B;

*Take the biotech sector. There, I'm fascinated by the area of longevity, the fight against death. We have made great progress here, but at the same time there are always setbacks: A drug works in mice but not in humans. Research is progressing more slowly than expected, which is frustrating. But what is much more important: We have not yet reached the technological singularity.*

You mean Raymond Kurzweil's hypothesis that one day AI will surpass human intelligence and technological progress will become uncontrollable.

(band score),u/Darqq111,IELTS,https://www.reddit.com/r/IELTS/comments/11q9qus/can_somebody_help_me_evaluate_my_essay_band_score/,"Test Question: Nowadays, many students are not choosing science subjects in university in many different countries. Why is this? What effects does this have on society?

These days, the amount of high school graduates picking subjects specialised in science in university across various countries are lacking. In my opinion, I believe that this issue is primarily caused by how unrealistic the high school educational system is. In society, the effects of this ongoing issue have a massive impact on how the community progresses and develops as a whole.

To start off, the main reason why there is a lack of students that are interested in science-based subjects, is primary due to how unethical and unfavourable science is all throughout high school. The contents in the textbooks of subjects like Physics are unrealistic when compared to the materials that you will learn in college. This gives learners the impression that they will not be able to handle the contents, even if they have a passion for the course/institute. Furthermore, to get accepted into these universities, competition is rather fierce, both nationally and internationally, which are all factors that causes the student's confidence to go down, leading to them having to persue a new career.

Due to this issue, other major difficulties that are connected to the rate of which society develops will occur.  Without a strong science foundation, countries do not have the capability to develop the industry fields that are situated domestically. This will lead to a slow economy that will eventually collapse. For instance, reports have shown that the decreases in the number of students majoring in science led to a dwindle in the country's wealth, and overall rate of development.

To sum up, the reason as to why there is a lack of undergraduates in the science field is mainly due to how the subjects are taught in high school, and how much competition there is to get a spot at these progressive institutes. Effects like the rate of how fast society grows will take a toll on the community's financial state, eventually leading to it's downfall.

TITLE What's the fairest way to share cosmic views from Hubble and James Webb telescopes?  
PUBLISHED: February 7, 2023 5:06 AM ET  
Author: Nell Greenfieldboyce  

The managers of the James Webb Space Telescope are considering a big change in how its observations get shared, one that could have a major impact on the science that gets done — and on who gets to do it.

As it stands now, if an astronomer makes a proposal for where to point this $10 billion space telescope, and the proposal gets accepted, that scientist usually has a year of exclusive access to the resulting observations.

Now, though, with the federal government pushing for more taxpayer-funded research to be made public instantly, telescope managers are pondering whether all of the data collected by JWST should be available to everyone right away.

They're considering a similar change for the venerable Hubble Space Telescope. Currently, scientists who get a chance to use that instrument generally enjoy six months of exclusive access to their observations.

Proponents of open access say that sharing all of these space telescopes' findings immediately could accelerate new discoveries and maximize the return from these powerful scientific assets.

Critics, however, worry that this could exacerbate existing inequities in who gets to do astronomical research, and perhaps even result in shoddier science as scientists race to be first to find hidden gems in the data.

""It's very controversial,"" says Alessandra Aloisi, head of the science mission office at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, home of science and mission operations for Hubble and JWST. It's currently taking the temperature of astronomers on this issue, with a survey that closes on February 15.

There's strong feelings on both sides, says Aloisi, and that's driven by the fact that astronomy is a competitive field.

""It's very hard to be successful,"" she says. ""And everything that goes against that is seen badly by the community.""

Centuries of tradition
Astronomers have turned their telescopes to the skies for hundreds of years. Traditionally, they decided how and when to share their records of what they'd seen.

""The data really were more or less owned by the person who came up with the idea to take the observations in the first place,"" says Eric Smith, associate director for research at the astrophysics division of NASA's science mission directorate in Washington, DC.

An astronomer who used a ground telescope physically possessed their records.

""Originally it was just hand drawings, and then it became glass plates, and then it was film in some cases, and eventually it was magnetic tapes,"" explains Smith. ""Whoever went to the observatory took those data home with them — and they just put them in their office or they put them in some university vault.""

The advent of the space age meant that telescopes would beam data back to Earth electronically. That meant it could potentially be made widely available, all at once.

And because these were expensive, taxpayer-funded telescopes, says Smith, ""we weren't going to go with the old model where you got to keep your data in your office forever.""

But tradition wasn't completely abandoned. The practice that started with Hubble was that astronomers who won time on the telescope were given funding plus a certain period of exclusive access to their observations.

""And then after that, it becomes public information because the public paid for it,"" says Smith.

This approach reflected a belief that a scientist deserved to have some time and financial support to develop the original idea which led to the observations in the first place.

After all, having that idea and convincing an expert committee to devote precious telescope time to it is no mean feat.

""It's a huge undertaking. It's a lot of work,"" Eilat Glikman, an astronomer at Middlebury College in Vermont, who estimates that she must have spent two weeks, full-time, writing her first successful proposal to use Hubble.

The majority of proposals have to be rejected, because demand for these instruments exceeds the available time.

But if everything a telescope saw was immediately put into a public repository, says Aloisi, ""everybody who has a scientific idea could use those data.""

And those scientific investigations may have nothing to do with the scientist's original proposal, she notes. ""So you multiply the number of discoveries, and you increase the discovery returns of these big missions.""

Back in 2017, she says, Hubble's period of exclusive access got cut from a year to just six months.

""The community fought very hard not to do that, I remember. It was very controversial back then,"" says Aloisi. ""And now, it's the norm. People are not even questioning it anymore.""

And there's an even stronger case to reduce the exclusive access periods for JWST, which is so far away from Earth that it couldn't possibly be repaired, like Hubble was. That means it's not expected to last as long, and quickly giving astronomers access to everything that the telescope has seen could help maximize its potential.

Whether or not to move to immediate open access for these telescopes will be discussed among the astronomy community, and with NASA's international partners, says Aloisi.

""You want my honest opinion? We will go in that direction,"" she says. ""We just need to bring everybody with us. I think it's the right thing to do for science.""

Fear of getting scooped
But Glikman says astronomers don't all have the same amount of time or resources to devote to analyzing telescope data; for example, her teaching load at her college limits how much time she can devote to research.

Even now, a scientist who has gotten data back from a space telescope knows that other astronomers are waiting to pounce on it, the moment it becomes public.

Glikman recalls working on one discovery in her data with a colleague. They had not yet published a scientific paper on their findings. But after the data became public, another group went through it and found the same thing. They contacted her colleague, asking to collaborate, which was awkward.

""It was a moment of tension there,"" says Glikman. ""Not to be like, 'This is mine,' but I've put so much effort into this, and I'm working on it...let me finish.""

If the exclusive access periods go away, she worries that researchers with fewer advantages will regularly be scooped by competitors.

""People who have time, people who have resources will be able to jump in and, I don't know, deflate the hard worker who earned that observation,"" says Glikman.

Jackie Faherty, an astrophysicist with the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, says that concerns like these are what leave her feeling conflicted.

""I am 100% for equitable science and for making a telescope that is a public-facing telescope accessible to anyone and everyone as soon as the data is taken,"" she says, noting that some space telescopes designed to survey large swaths of the sky already do that.

But she felt the tensions that come with an open-access policy while working with some of the very early-release data gathered by JWST, which was designed to be made public very quickly, to show off what this brand-new instrument could do.

""I do not love the pressure that comes with a zero proprietary period,"" says Faherty, describing it as a kind of ""mental gymnastics"" that comes from ""constantly kind of processing whether or not somebody else is working on that data set.""

She observed that this was particularly difficult for early-career scientists, who weren't as experienced in doing the analyses and who, professionally, had a lot more riding on the work.

Judging exceptions
Any move to open access for these space telescopes' data should come with the ability to request an exception, one that would give the scientist making a proposal a short period of exclusive access, says Faherty.

But the question is, what would warrant such an exception?

Aloisi said one possibility would be if the proposed research would be part of the work of a graduate student who, because of inexperience, needed more time to get up to speed. Another possibility might be a researcher whose teaching load made it impossible to do independent research except in the summer.

""Those are all very valid reasons,"" says Aloisi.

The astronomy community has time to figure this out. Last month, scientists submitted proposals for JWST's next cycle of observations, and the announcement of the winners will come in May. Whatever observing proposals get accepted will come with the existing one-year exclusive-access period.

That means even though decisions about open-access and these space telescopes might be made over the next six months, says Aloisi, ""it will take a year or so, or maybe longer, to percolate that through the system.""

However, there are concerns that researchers with fewer advantages would regularly be scooped by competitors, leading to shoddier science.

Astronomers who are concerned about the impact of open access suggest that exceptions could be made, allowing a short period of exclusive access for those who require it, such as graduate students or those with heavy teaching loads. The JWST survey on open access closed on February 15, and the decision on whether to move to immediate open access is expected to be made over the next six months.

11qh6je,3,2023-03-13,Advice from a 29 year old in the US who graduated college and got a job,u/John-The-Bomb-2,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/11qh6je/advice_from_a_29_year_old_in_the_us_who_graduated/,"My local city commissioner made a post on Facebook about a local high school university/career/ROTC fair, and it got me thinking about what advice I would give the young people. I'm a former computer programmer who worked for Amazon, got a bachelor's in Computer Science from the University of Florida in my home state, and ultimately ended up on disability for brain stuff (bipolar/schizophrenia/stuff). Here's my advice:



•1  If you can get into an Ivy League school like Harvard or MIT, go, even if it means spending months going through multiple SAT test books cover-to-cover studying every question to figure out why each answer is what it is, sucking up to teachers during extra help to get them to write a good personalized teacher recommendation for you, running for bullshit leadership positions that don’t grant you any real power just so you can put them on your application, doing an extracurricular activity which you will end up abandoning in the future, doing volunteer work that a brain damaged person could do, and studying and doing homework every weekday until you fall asleep. These schools give the most financial aid, have the highest graduation rates, and look the best on a job resume or on your LinkedIn (which is like Facebook but for work). The reason they use these metrics is because people who succeed in them tend to be more successful in life and give more money in donations back to the school later, resulting in them having more spare cash for scholarships.



•2  If you can’t get into an Ivy League school, go to the most competitive in-state school (in my home state of Florida it was the University of Florida) that you can get into. In-state tuition is offered at no profit for them, so it’s a great deal financially for you. Note that public universities look less at your leadership positions than Ivy League schools do and will let in asocial (no extracurriculars) people with high SAT scores (which is how I ended up at UF and not Harvard or MIT). Note that it might make more sense if your family is low on money to do your first 2 years at a Community/County college and then transfer to like a good state school, see bullet point 7.



•3  If you can’t get into an Ivy League school or public in-state university, seriously consider not going to college. Non-ivy private schools like my local [Nova Southeastern University](https://www.google.com/search?q=Nova+Southeastern+University&amp;sxsrf=AJOqlzXJxtL8t3M-E65PL7nsXmLANJ4Qdg%3A1678730313939&amp;ei=SWQPZJf0OKGUwbkPn--m0AE&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXvKTgvdn9AhUhSjABHZ-3CRoQ4dUDCBA&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=Nova+Southeastern+University&amp;gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIECCMQJzIICC4QgAQQsQMyBAgAEEMyBAgAEEMyBAgAEEMyBAgAEEMyBAgAEEMyBAgAEEMyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDoKCAAQRxDWBBCwAzoHCAAQsAMQQzoNCAAQ5AIQ1gQQsAMYAToMCC4QyAMQsAMQQxgCOhIILhDHARCvARDIAxCwAxBDGAJKBAhBGABQwwdYwwdgqgloAXABeACAAdwBiAHcAZIBAzItMZgBAKABAqABAcgBE8ABAdoBBggBEAEYCdoBBggCEAEYCA&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp) have between a third and half of students not graduating, ending up in a lifetime of debt, sometimes unable to afford children or retirement because of it. The absolute worst are for-profit private universities. At the nursing ones in my area, more than half of the people who complete graduation can’t pass the licensing exam or ever practice. The price of tuition is a lie – the actual cost to universities is like $10,000 per student per year not including housing – they just jack up the price so they can make more money with stupid people taking out loans that will never stop following them and they give a fraction of that money back as financial aid, making people think they got a good deal. If you’re not getting fat financial aid from a non-Ivy, non-state university (I'm talking over $20,000 a year in financial aid) and you don’t have steadfast determination to what you're studying, then it’s definitely not worth it (note: the chance of dropping out is higher if you have a mental illness). Me personally, I actually started in pre-med but when I was having difficulty with the memorization stuff I took a semester off to sneak into other courses pretending to be a student without the professors knowing and I found that I liked coding and it wasn't super memorization heavy, so I switched to Computer Science.



•4  There is no shame in going to Technical College, beauty school, or an apprenticeship in a physical trade. Doing something which requires no training is not advisable because it won’t pay enough to have your own place without at least sharing a kitchen and maybe a bathroom with someone else for most of your life (even if you never have kids) and being poor on average majorly reduces your happiness in life (like you may find yourself having to eat nothing but rice and lentils for days at a time to save on money). The unemployment rate is also higher for people with no specialization because they’re easily replaceable.



•5  If you’re interested in fighting for your country, the government will pay for your college and in that case you can consider a non-Ivy, non-state school without having to worry about getting massively ripped off because you're not paying for it. The absolute worst thing that can happen is you drop out during ROTC and have to serve as a soldier for about as long as you were given free school (which can potentially get you killed).



•6  This is a side note, but the best measurement of how good a school is is what SAT score the admitted students have. The higher the score the smarter the students (and the smarter the students the harder the classes will be). Like my first two years I actually went to the University of Michigan and my second two years I went to the University of Florida and the classes were identical just at UMich the kids were a little smarter and the curves on the exams were a little tougher to compensate, but all my classes transferred over. A public university and a private university with the same SAT scores for admission are about equal – just because a private university charges more money doesn’t mean it’s better, it just has a higher margin of profit on the degree it’s selling you (think of education as an investment). If you take almost all AP classes your last two years of high school and get almost all 4’s and 5’s on the AP exams like I did, college will be a lot easier than high school – for most people who tried to get into an Ivy League school, university is easier than high school but also they don’t tell you to do homework every day in university so you have to be more self-motivated. If two schools have equally high SAT scores for applicants and cost the same I would make the decision on which one I want based on how highly ranked it is in a field (that preferably leads to a real job) that I’m interested in (although a big part of the ranking is usually PhD research which doesn’t affect your education but might be good if you want a part time job as a research assistant). Research what jobs are out there and what degrees or skills they look for. Consider finding a person with that job on LinkedIn or Reddit (maybe find a subreddit that revolves around a particular field or profession you're interested in and message some people in it). Watch YouTube videos by people with that job where they talk about their job (ex. “Why I became a programmer”). Be aware of how much education certain jobs require. For example, writing code for a big website like Amazon or Google usually requires a bachelor’s degree in computer science or computer engineering (4 years of school) but working as a chemical engineer usually requires a bachelor’s and master’s in chemical engineering (6 years of school). Working on ChatGPT requires a PhD.



•7  The problem with some bottom tier public community/county colleges like my local Broward College is they don’t look as good on a resume and the people who graduate from them usually can’t land the “elite” white-collar jobs. Like to get a $150,000 starting, $500,000 total compensation mid-career coding job at a company like Google or Amazon you have to pass algorithm puzzles that mentally are like a cross between a hard math problem and a game of chess and people from community college can almost never pass these screenings. Sometimes certain things, like being a bad test taker or being bad at studying, follow you later in life, like if and when you need to pass some sort of licensing exam to work in a profession. You could use a community/county college to get your general prerequisites out of the way for cheaper (no paying for boarding) and then transfer to a better school after two years, but you’ll have to get much better SAT scores and study harder than the other people there. This approach is probably a good idea if you can’t afford the boarding at a non-local state school or if you slacked off in high school and couldn’t get into any good non-local state school but intend to try extra hard and really master the SAT while in community/county college. Fortunately for people who transferred to a better school, employers just care where you graduated from – they may run a check with the place you graduated from to verify your diploma but they usually don’t bother asking for or reading your full transcript. After your first job you can get away with leaving your college GPA off your resume but try to have above a 3.5 unweighted to help land your first job. Grades are inflated nowadays more than they used to be so a 3.5 isn’t that hard. Depending on how tough the job market and the economy are when you graduate it might help.



•8  Have good relationships with your coworkers and get a good vibe from them before you accept a job offer because ultimately you will be learning from them (especially if it’s your first job), working with them, and using them as a reference for your next job. Also some companies are shady (which managers will hide from you) but if you find an honest coworker to talk to before you accept the offer you might miss a landmine or scam job. If you’re going to put your email or phone number on your LinkedIn, use a second email or a Google Voice phone number because some recruiters, especially tech recruiters from India, will never ever stop calling and emailing you after they get your number no matter how many times you tell them to stop. They have contact information farms hooked up into regularly posted job ads where if you submit a resume with your contact info on it they will store your resume in their database forever and regularly call and email you about openings from other employers who are paying them even if those other jobs are shit. Their computers scan the resumes for keywords and send out auto-emails based on the keywords, so even if on your resume it says “I used the Java programming language at this job but I disliked it so please no Java work” their computer will see the word “Java” on your resume and automatically shoot you openings that are looking for that and you can never get them to remove that old resume of yours from their system. Keep in mind who is making money off who because recruiters and HR (Human Resources) DO NOT work for you.



•9  College is a great place to find someone who you will eventually marry. You will meet a lot of open, single people. The chance of getting divorced in general goes down the later you get married up until age 28 at which point it starts to go up as all the good people have been taken. The adult world is more closed off to new people than college is and it is harder for adults to make new friends. People change more when they’re young than when they’re older and people who marry young are more likely to find they’ve grown apart from their spouse. Also, the risk of divorce increases up until about 5 years into a marriage, which is when the feeling that you’ve fallen in love wears off and you have to actually like and tolerate the person given that you are no longer willing to give more into the relationship than they are putting in. I recommend people find someone to marry by mid to late college, try and stick with them for 3-5 years before getting married, and then you’ll be in a pretty stable place for a lifelong relationship and possibly kids after marriage. If you don’t find someone in college, online dating is worth trying with some websites like OkCupid offering the ability (for a fee) to filter people in or out based on how they answered certain questions (like politics, lifestyle, morals, religiosity, etc) which is better for something serious than swiping left or right just based on looks. I know people who ended up in a good marriage with someone who had a high OkCupid question match percentage with them so maybe that’s better for something serious than Tinder. Also not everyone has to get married and not everyone has to have kids – no shame to people who don’t follow the traditional path.



•10  Most jobs aren’t that fun, and most people have more fun in college than at work. This is to be expected because you pay money for college but others pay you money for work. Just try to find something you don’t hate, but keep in mind that a job is fundamentally an exchange of your time for money. 



•11  God forbid you develop a serious mental illness like schizophrenia or something like what I did or something else happens that makes it impossible for you to do or get any job, do not be afraid to apply for government disability benefits (called SSDI in the US if you have a work history or SSI if you don’t). Have a regular doctor who you have a good relationship with who can convey in the medical records the seriousness of your condition so they can approve you. Tax money comes out of every one of your paychecks to pay for government disability insurance. Based on the medical records and answers to questions asked of someone close to you about you, they have to be convinced that you can’t do or be employed in any real job for you to be approved for government benefits, which can last a lifetime. Private corporation disability benefits last a maximum of 10 years for mental illness claims but if you have a history of mental illness in your family it is worth paying for private unemployment insurance.



•12  Try and cut added sugar (sucrose, the white sugar in cake, cookies, ice cream) out of your diet. It causes dental cavities (which are expensive and/or painful depending on whether you get them fixed or not) as well as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Many ancient skeletons of people have no dental cavities because they didn't eat sugar. I have a fluoride allergy so I don't use toothpaste but I never had a cavity. I cut sugar out of my diet when I was 13 and at first it was a tough addiction to escape but eventually my taste just got used to that and I stopped liking it. Set good habits like eating healthy and not smoking when you're young because you get addicted to things easier when you're young and your habits stick with you. I replaced items with sugar like ice cream with nutritionally equivalent items without sugar like 1% fat milk and cheese. Replaced cereal with sugar with cereal without sugar (it's hard to find but I found one brand that was like that, I think it's called ""shredded wheat""). Try and replace processed white carbs like white bread and white rice with unprocessed brown carbs like whole wheat bread and brown rice because they contain more fiber which reduces your risk of colon cancer and they break down into blood sugar slower which reduces your risk of diabetes. You may not think about how long you have left when you're young but there are people who pay into Social Security their whole life and die before they ever collect and there are people who live to 115+ years old who collect much more out of Social Security than they paid in so as far as getting as much as you can get it benefits you to live a long time and be healthy. Exercise is great but when you get old or disabled you can't exercise and if you don't eat healthy when you can't exercise you get fat and sick but me, I can't walk most of the time due to neurological brain stuff but I'm still thin and healthy because I eat well.

•13  Don't put all your money in one place because it could all disappear. Like as you get older and have some savings, have a mix of cash in a bank account, bank Certificates of Deposit (called bank CD's), government bonds, stock market indexes (like the S&amp;P500, which is an average of the top 500 stocks), and precious metals like gold. If something crazy happens like the banks and government fails or the stock market goes to zero or a world war breaks out, you will still have a little bit of wealth even though some of your money disappeared.

Okay, that's all I got. Good luck."
11qhlu6,1,2023-03-13,I'm a 29 year in the US who wanted to give advice to all the teens,u/John-The-Bomb-2,AdviceForTeens,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/11qhlu6/im_a_29_year_in_the_us_who_wanted_to_give_advice/,"My local city commissioner made a post on Facebook about a local high school university/career/ROTC fair, and it got me thinking about what advice I would give the young people. I'm a former computer programmer who worked for Amazon, got a bachelor's in Computer Science from the University of Florida in my home state, and ultimately ended up on disability for brain stuff (bipolar/schizophrenia/stuff). Here's my advice:



•1  If you can get into an Ivy League school like Harvard or MIT, go, even if it means spending months going through multiple SAT test books cover-to-cover studying every question to figure out why each answer is what it is, sucking up to teachers during extra help to get them to write a good personalized teacher recommendation for you, running for bullshit leadership positions that don’t grant you any real power just so you can put them on your application, doing an extracurricular activity which you will end up abandoning in the future, doing volunteer work that a brain damaged person could do, and studying and doing homework every weekday until you fall asleep. These schools give the most financial aid, have the highest graduation rates, and look the best on a job resume or on your LinkedIn (which is like Facebook but for work). The reason they use these metrics is because people who succeed in them tend to be more successful in life and give more money in donations back to the school later, resulting in them having more spare cash for scholarships.



•2  If you can’t get into an Ivy League school, go to the most competitive in-state school (in my home state of Florida it was the University of Florida) that you can get into. In-state tuition is offered at no profit for them, so it’s a great deal financially for you. Note that public universities look less at your leadership positions than Ivy League schools do and will let in asocial (no extracurriculars) people with high SAT scores (which is how I ended up at UF and not Harvard or MIT). Note that it might make more sense if your family is low on money to do your first 2 years at a Community/County college and then transfer to like a good state school, see bullet point 7.



•3  If you can’t get into an Ivy League school or public in-state university, seriously consider not going to college. Non-ivy private schools like my local [Nova Southeastern University](https://www.google.com/search?q=Nova+Southeastern+University&amp;sxsrf=AJOqlzXJxtL8t3M-E65PL7nsXmLANJ4Qdg%3A1678730313939&amp;ei=SWQPZJf0OKGUwbkPn--m0AE&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXvKTgvdn9AhUhSjABHZ-3CRoQ4dUDCBA&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=Nova+Southeastern+University&amp;gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIECCMQJzIICC4QgAQQsQMyBAgAEEMyBAgAEEMyBAgAEEMyBAgAEEMyBAgAEEMyBAgAEEMyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDoKCAAQRxDWBBCwAzoHCAAQsAMQQzoNCAAQ5AIQ1gQQsAMYAToMCC4QyAMQsAMQQxgCOhIILhDHARCvARDIAxCwAxBDGAJKBAhBGABQwwdYwwdgqgloAXABeACAAdwBiAHcAZIBAzItMZgBAKABAqABAcgBE8ABAdoBBggBEAEYCdoBBggCEAEYCA&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp) have between a third and half of students not graduating, ending up in a lifetime of debt, sometimes unable to afford children or retirement because of it. The absolute worst are for-profit private universities. At the nursing ones in my area, more than half of the people who complete graduation can’t pass the licensing exam or ever practice. The price of tuition is a lie – the actual cost to universities is like $10,000 per student per year not including housing – they just jack up the price so they can make more money with stupid people taking out loans that will never stop following them and they give a fraction of that money back as financial aid, making people think they got a good deal. If you’re not getting fat financial aid from a non-Ivy, non-state university (I'm talking over $20,000 a year in financial aid) and you don’t have steadfast determination to what you're studying, then it’s definitely not worth it (note: the chance of dropping out is higher if you have a mental illness). Me personally, I actually started in pre-med but when I was having difficulty with the memorization stuff I took a semester off to sneak into other courses pretending to be a student without the professors knowing and I found that I liked coding and it wasn't super memorization heavy, so I switched to Computer Science.



•4  There is no shame in going to Technical College, beauty school, or an apprenticeship in a physical trade. Doing something which requires no training is not advisable because it won’t pay enough to have your own place without at least sharing a kitchen and maybe a bathroom with someone else for most of your life (even if you never have kids) and being poor on average majorly reduces your happiness in life (like you may find yourself having to eat nothing but rice and lentils for days at a time to save on money). The unemployment rate is also higher for people with no specialization because they’re easily replaceable.



•5  If you’re interested in fighting for your country, the government will pay for your college and in that case you can consider a non-Ivy, non-state school without having to worry about getting massively ripped off because you're not paying for it. The absolute worst thing that can happen is you drop out during ROTC and have to serve as a soldier for about as long as you were given free school (which can potentially get you killed).



•6  This is a side note, but the best measurement of how good a school is is what SAT score the admitted students have. The higher the score the smarter the students (and the smarter the students the harder the classes will be). Like my first two years I actually went to the University of Michigan and my second two years I went to the University of Florida and the classes were identical just at UMich the kids were a little smarter and the curves on the exams were a little tougher to compensate, but all my classes transferred over. A public university and a private university with the same SAT scores for admission are about equal – just because a private university charges more money doesn’t mean it’s better, it just has a higher margin of profit on the degree it’s selling you (think of education as an investment). If you take almost all AP classes your last two years of high school and get almost all 4’s and 5’s on the AP exams like I did, college will be a lot easier than high school – for most people who tried to get into an Ivy League school, university is easier than high school but also they don’t tell you to do homework every day in university so you have to be more self-motivated. If two schools have equally high SAT scores for applicants and cost the same I would make the decision on which one I want based on how highly ranked it is in a field (that preferably leads to a real job) that I’m interested in (although a big part of the ranking is usually PhD research which doesn’t affect your education but might be good if you want a part time job as a research assistant). Research what jobs are out there and what degrees or skills they look for. Consider finding a person with that job on LinkedIn or Reddit (maybe find a subreddit that revolves around a particular field or profession you're interested in and message some people in it). Watch YouTube videos by people with that job where they talk about their job (ex. “Why I became a programmer”). Be aware of how much education certain jobs require. For example, writing code for a big website like Amazon or Google usually requires a bachelor’s degree in computer science or computer engineering (4 years of school) but working as a chemical engineer usually requires a bachelor’s and master’s in chemical engineering (6 years of school). Working on ChatGPT requires a PhD.



•7  The problem with some bottom tier public community/county colleges like my local Broward College is they don’t look as good on a resume and the people who graduate from them usually can’t land the “elite” white-collar jobs. Like to get a $150,000 starting, $500,000 total compensation mid-career coding job at a company like Google or Amazon you have to pass algorithm puzzles that mentally are like a cross between a hard math problem and a game of chess and people from community college can almost never pass these screenings. Sometimes certain things, like being a bad test taker or being bad at studying, follow you later in life, like if and when you need to pass some sort of licensing exam to work in a profession. You could use a community/county college to get your general prerequisites out of the way for cheaper (no paying for boarding) and then transfer to a better school after two years, but you’ll have to get much better SAT scores and study harder than the other people there. This approach is probably a good idea if you can’t afford the boarding at a non-local state school or if you slacked off in high school and couldn’t get into any good non-local state school but intend to try extra hard and really master the SAT while in community/county college. Fortunately for people who transferred to a better school, employers just care where you graduated from – they may run a check with the place you graduated from to verify your diploma but they usually don’t bother asking for or reading your full transcript. After your first job you can get away with leaving your college GPA off your resume but try to have above a 3.5 unweighted to help land your first job. Grades are inflated nowadays more than they used to be so a 3.5 isn’t that hard. Depending on how tough the job market and the economy are when you graduate it might help.



•8  Have good relationships with your coworkers and get a good vibe from them before you accept a job offer because ultimately you will be learning from them (especially if it’s your first job), working with them, and using them as a reference for your next job. Also some companies are shady (which managers will hide from you) but if you find an honest coworker to talk to before you accept the offer you might miss a landmine or scam job. If you’re going to put your email or phone number on your LinkedIn, use a second email or a Google Voice phone number because some recruiters, especially tech recruiters from India, will never ever stop calling and emailing you after they get your number no matter how many times you tell them to stop. They have contact information farms hooked up into regularly posted job ads where if you submit a resume with your contact info on it they will store your resume in their database forever and regularly call and email you about openings from other employers who are paying them even if those other jobs are shit. Their computers scan the resumes for keywords and send out auto-emails based on the keywords, so even if on your resume it says “I used the Java programming language at this job but I disliked it so please no Java work” their computer will see the word “Java” on your resume and automatically shoot you openings that are looking for that and you can never get them to remove that old resume of yours from their system. Keep in mind who is making money off who because recruiters and HR (Human Resources) DO NOT work for you.



•9  College is a great place to find someone who you will eventually marry. You will meet a lot of open, single people. The chance of getting divorced in general goes down the later you get married up until age 28 at which point it starts to go up as all the good people have been taken. The adult world is more closed off to new people than college is and it is harder for adults to make new friends. People change more when they’re young than when they’re older and people who marry young are more likely to find they’ve grown apart from their spouse. Also, the risk of divorce increases up until about 5 years into a marriage, which is when the feeling that you’ve fallen in love wears off and you have to actually like and tolerate the person given that you are no longer willing to give more into the relationship than they are putting in. I recommend people find someone to marry by mid to late college, try and stick with them for 3-5 years before getting married, and then you’ll be in a pretty stable place for a lifelong relationship and possibly kids after marriage. If you don’t find someone in college, online dating is worth trying with some websites like OkCupid offering the ability (for a fee) to filter people in or out based on how they answered certain questions (like politics, lifestyle, morals, religiosity, etc) which is better for something serious than swiping left or right just based on looks.

Also not everyone has to get married and not everyone has to have kids – no shame to people who don’t follow the traditional path.

&gt; There&amp;#039;s plenty of positive potential in new, generative technologies like ChatGPT, including producing written content, creating training materials for medical students or writing and debugging code.

&gt; We&amp;#039;ve already seen people innovate consumer tasks with ChatGPT - for example, using it to write a successful parking fine appeal.

&gt; The rollout of ChatGPT and similar technologies has shown it still has a problem with accuracy which is, in turn, a problem for its users.

&gt; Let&amp;#039;s start by looking at the challenge of accuracy and truth in a large language model like ChatGPT. ChatGPT has started to disrupt internet search through a rollout of the technology in Microsoft&amp;#039;s Bing search engine.

&gt; The problem is that technologies like ChatGPT are very good at writing convincing answers.

&gt; We need to learn how to get the best of ChatGPT. Even in focusing on just one aspect of ChatGPT, those of us involved in protecting consumers in Europe and worldwide have examined multiple layers of different consequences that this advanced technology could create once it reaches users&amp;#039; hands.

My time here is over and I'm moving to the U.S. for my sweet sweet $450k (600k CAD) new grad job. Here's how I did it, and how you can cheat both school and life.

## priorities

Time is a scarce resource, so you need a list of things that take precedence over other things. Here were mine:

1. learn as much as possible
2. get a big tiddy goth gf
3. get the highest-paying new grad job
4. be likeable
5. make friends
6. get a comfortable GPA that I can chill at

I'd say I accomplished 1, 2, 3, and 6. I'm still a piece of shit with no friends -- maybe I'll fix that down the road. Also gf isn't goth, but that's ok.

Note that good grades were never a requirement... I'm a horrible student, and I learn vastly better by scouring the internet for odd facts. My cGPA is 76, but I don't really care. 

## academics 

I said I was going to teach you how to cheat: so here it is.

1. for coding assignments, **look up the answer on GitHub**. Either search for the course name, the file name, or a specific excerpt of text from the sample code that wouldn't change year-to-year. YOU MUST ABSOLUTELY CHANGE THE *STRUCTURE*, *VARIABLE NAMES*, AND *CODE COMMENTS* OF ALL CODE YOU COPY -- if you don't do this, the school will absolutely fuck you up. I got caught for being lazy about this in 2nd year and it almost got me kicked out; the penalties are too severe to not be careful 100% of the time. I still did this up until 4B tho. Don't copy friends for quantitative stuff, they can be unreliable
2. for qualitative courses (particularly upper year courses), **copy off of your friends**. Again, you need to change stuff so it doesn't look the same -- and you can't let your guard down for a second. Don't use ChatGPT, it kinda blows
3. for qualitative courses, **purchase textbook exam banks**. I can't link anything, but do your own research to find the sites that I'm talking about -- every course has an exam bank, and it'll help you a ton if you can find it. $30 for a good grade is hella worth it
4. for quantitative courses, I can't really help with exams -- just gotta grind ig. I didn't take many in upper years.

## career

**Pull an Eric Liu**. I'm kinda hypocritical bc I didn't do this, but if I were to do it all again, I absolutely would. It's ridiculous how hard it is to get companies to interview you. So fake those side projects... fake a startup if you want... there are resources all over GitHub that you can just clone, push, and forget about. I wouldn't fake work history unless I'm desperate though. The only caveat is for 1st-time job seekers: don't lie about anything you can't explain in-depth. For 2nd/3rd/4th coop this works great because the interviewer will probably just ask you questions about your last coop (rarely do they ever ask about side projects... the number of occurrences is negligible).

Another incredibly important tip: **apply ASAP**. Your resume quality doesn't matter nearly as much as you think it does, the biggest factor that makes you a bad candidate is that you were the 200th applicant for the job -- if there are a dozen job openings and 200 qualified applicants, there's no way they're going to interview you. I attribute most of my career success to applying early (i.e. the *same day* that the company posts their jobs), and I have several tools that I built for watching these job websites for changes. The other big factor is whether you have a FAANG job on your resume, but that's harder to control and usually you need to build up to that.

For interviews, leetcode is something you should definitely prioritize. Remember priority #1? Yeah that's this. The trick to leetcode is that **there are only like a dozen algorithms** that interviewers will ask. If you can master those 12 algorithms (~250 problems across ~500 hours), you're set for *life*. Also pay attention to how clean your code is: messy code is absolutely a penalty, and it'll also make it harder to find the right solution.

Choose the bigger-name company whenever you can (usually this correlates with pay) unless your options are nearly equivalent on reputation -- then you should base your choice on uniqueness of experience. If you get the chance to do an FPGA coop, or a C++ coop, I would much prefer that to a fullstack Javascript coop.

GPA did make it a little harder to land a job in high-frequency trading... but I don't really regret it. I would've landed the same job at a later date.

## women (or men, up to you)

Probably the most important thing in uni is to have a healthy sex life. You need to feel empowered to booty call someone whenever you want, and have sex within 24 hours. Some people do this through a long-term relationship, while some people go out and fuck various strangers. The former is reliable and possibly more valuable, the latter is exciting. I went with method 1, and I think it's the right choice for me; but I don't judge the people who chose method 2. In general, I recommend a lot of cheating (in school/life), but **never** on your SO.

It's at this point that I'm going to lose a lot of you: you're going to sink back into your hard residence chair going ""if only it were that easy..."" longingly staring at the waifu on your desktop wallpaper. Don't let your emotions get to you, you should still be in survival mode: 

1. wash yourself (everywhere...)
2. talk to at least 1 stranger every day (cashiers don't count)
3. make friends with your friends' friends (and follow-up!)

Some easy places where you can talk to girls: 
* group projects
* on-campus events
* classes (only when other people are chattering)
* clubs
* William's 
* reddit (maybe)

You probably shouldn't be asking someone out when you first meet them. **Be their friend first**, it's 100% more reliable, and you need more friends anyways. 

Another thing: if you're an incel¹, you're not allowed to be picky about who you fuck. Them's the rules.

¹ &gt;!and I mean that literally: anybody who's ""involuntarily celibate,"" without extra connotations!&lt;

And to put things into perspective: I was a nerdy asshole fatass incel¹, who at the time was almost-failing school and getting shitty coops... and even I landed a (hot) gf. So you can too. Don't let yourself get stuck in ""I'm ugly/stupid/worthless"" paralysis; by wallowing, you only do yourself a disservice. Jerk off, then get to work.

## productivity

I find I work best in class. I get out of bed at 9am, commute 20 mins to my 10am lecture, **and then completely tune out from what the prof is saying while I code shit**. Works wonders, you should try it.

Also, don't fuck up your sleep schedule. Go to bed at 11pm, you hooligans. 

## learning

This is the single most important thing I'm going to tell you: 

&gt; **If you really want to learn something, you have to learn it yourself**

I signed up for a computer science degree and it took me a while to realize they weren't going to teach me what I signed up for. They tested me on algebra, they tested me on applying algebra to Turing machines, they tested me on applying algebra to databases... they *tested* me on everything except how to be a master software engineer. Even when I took upper year courses, they only taught me high-level things and never dug deeper than ""here's the diagram and the textbook definition."" They also won't teach you anything novel either. 

If you *really* want to learn something, you should go onto the Internet and read about it (or watch YouTube, but usually only gets you so far).

I've learned a ton about distributed systems, dev tools, new computer hardware, entire software ecosystems, various open-source projects and communities... and I consider this much more valuable than anything I learned in school. 

I'm already objectively a much better engineer than the senior FAANG engineers I worked with during my coops -- I know the landscape, I know what's out there, and I'm good at leading teams to make projects come to life. This self-teaching stuff is also like the foundational skill of being an entrepreneur.

Some corollaries that follow this theory:
* you shouldn't wait for CS341 to learn algorithms
* it doesn't matter if you didn't get into your #1 choice program (and to extent, your school only matters as much as its reputation)
* you shouldn't spend so much time trying to get a 90... because the reward is *only* your GPA, and you haven't learned nearly as much as you could have if you self-taught

.

.

.

so that's pretty much it. don't be a loser like I was in 1st year. don't kill yourself, your life could get a million times better tomorrow. don't give up on yourself, you're all unimaginably close to success just by virtue of being here. I'll remember y'all when I'm a billionaire. peace

edit: comments are rough... should've put more work into priority #4 😞"
11qyxk1,6,2023-03-14,ChatGPT API vs web interface,u/russ20012,OpenAI,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/11qyxk1/chatgpt_api_vs_web_interface/,"I'm a language teacher and have been using the chatgpt web interface (on [openai.com](https://openai.com/)) for wto months now. In general, I'm very excited as it's been remarkably useful for developing language teaching materials. It's also very good at translation. I keep telling people the translations are years ahead of Google Translate.

So, I'm working with a web developer to make a site powered by chatGPT to make online quizzes for my students. However, when using the API, with whatever settings the developer has, produces results that are like Google Translate sentences - unnatural and quite simply, not useful.

**I'm trying to understand - is the language created through an API always going to be worse and more unnatural? Or, is it because of the settings the developer has put in? Or, both?** I'm wondering whether to change direction and focus on just using the chatGPT web interfact and copy and paste results somehow into a quiz instead of using the API.

Any thoughts are appreciated."

As per the “[Hong Kong](https://www.worldmagzine.com/crypto/hong-kongs-crypto-plans-approved-by-the-chinese-government/) Financial Times” report, a course at the Hong Kong College of Science and Innovation urges understudies to involve ChatGPT in their midterm reports and vows to give additional focus.

The individual responsible for the course, Academic partner, and Senior Specialist (Business venture) of HKUST Huang Yueyong accepts that [ChatGPT](https://www.worldmagzine.com/world/know-everything-about-open-ai-chatgpt-now-with-us/) will irreversibly affect the approach to learning from here on out.

## ChatGPT Used in Hong Kong University

This can improve the profundity of information and imagination of understudies, and approaches the schooling local [area](https://www.worldmagzine.com/health-and-medical/2-to-visit-the-sneak-peek-area-of-the-australia-zoo/) to rehearse its application at the earliest opportunity and examine its effect.

Recently, the Hong Kong [College](https://www.worldmagzine.com/education/technology-education-for-apollo-unoh-students/) of Science and Innovation was quick to declare that it ultimately depends on educators to choose whether to permit understudies to utilize ChatGPT.

* Huang Yueyong said that not at all like other Hong Kong colleges that forbid or confine the utilization of ChatGPT or other man-made intelligence instruments.
* The administration of HKUST desires to urge everybody to “advance straightaway.”
* The College of Hong Kong and Lingnan College [reported](https://www.worldmagzine.com/technology/new-wf-c700n-earbuds-and-hobbyist-mirrorless-camera-of-sony/) last month that understudies are briefly precluded from utilizing ChatGPT.

He additionally said that while scoring, more accentuation is put on understudies’ decisive reasoning and intelligent capacities while associating with ChatGPT.

The VP (Educating) of the College of Hong Kong, He Liren, sent an email to educators and understudies on Walk 9, emphasizing that the pertinent approach stays unaltered and will go on for the rest of the ongoing year in August.

11r9k3j,4,2023-03-14,Human-Generated Content by essay service VS AI services,u/Edward_Stivenson,students_essay_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/students_essay_help/comments/11r9k3j/humangenerated_content_by_essay_service_vs_ai/,"**What Are AI Content Writing Tools**

AI content writing tools are computer programs that utilize artificial intelligence and natural language processing to create written content automatically. These tools can save time and effort for content creators by automating parts of the writing process. However, there are limitations to using these tools, as human-generated content often works better in terms of quality and creativity.

While AI writing software can create content quickly, it cannot capture the nuances of human emotions, thoughts, and experiences. This can lead to content that lacks authenticity, tone, and voice. For example, an AI-generated article on '[how to write an essay](https://www.reddit.com/r/students_essay_help/comments/10rw7xb/how_to_write_an_essay_2023_new_ways_and_tips/)' may lack the storytelling element that a human writer can bring to a piece. Additionally, human writers can be more versatile in their writing styles and adapt to different audiences and contexts.

Moreover, AI-generated content by article writing tools can be prone to errors, such as incorrect grammar and awkward phrasing. In contrast, human writers can use their intuition and experience to refine and edit their work, producing high-quality content that resonates with the audience.

Let's delve into the details to better understand the difference.

**Is Writing Assistant Software Good**

Writing is a craft that requires technical skills, creativity, empathy, and intuition, which are unique to human writers. Therefore, while SEO content writing tools can be helpful, they cannot replace the value of human-generated content. Let's explore what advantages and disadvantages accompany these content writing app or web pages.

**Pros of Writing Assistant Software:**

1. Helps writers improve their writing skills by providing suggestions and feedback.
2. It can save time and effort by automating certain aspects of the writing process, such as grammar and spelling checks.
3. It can provide a different perspective on the content, helping writers identify potential improvement areas.

**Cons of Writing Assistant Software:**

1. The suggestions and feedback provided by the software can be limited, leading to generic or uninspiring content.
2. The software may be unable to capture the nuances of human emotions and experiences, leading to content lacking authenticity and voice.
3. The software may not be able to adapt to different audiences and contexts, leading to content that may not resonate with the target audience.
4. They do not always guarantee 100% uniqueness and anti-plagiarism. In some cases, the output generated by AI may even be flagged as plagiarized by special software.
5. AI may still produce text that contains similarities or repetition that can be considered tautology.

For illustration, when providing information on how to choose essay topics, AI-generated content may offer a broader range of information. In contrast, human-generated content can provide a more personalized and trustworthy approach. Even the best writing assistant software cannot replace the creativity, emotion, and intuition of human writers.

**How AI Content Differs from Human Content?**

As mentioned above, human writers bring a level of personalization and authenticity to their work that even the best AI content writer cannot replicate, making them an essential part of the content creation process. AI content and human-generated content can differ in the following ways:

https://preview.redd.it/wqofc9dxypna1.png?width=1180&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=30fc3aeb638528a3185c81bb5f8ac54d5ee21448

1. **Voice and Tone:** Human-generated content has a unique voice and tone, which can be challenging for AI content to replicate. AI-generated content often lacks the nuances of human emotions, thoughts, and experiences, resulting in content that lacks authenticity and personalization.
2. **Emotional Connection:** Human-generated content can connect with the audience on an emotional level by telling stories, using metaphors, and evoking emotions. In contrast, AI content is generated based on data and algorithms, making it challenging to write content that resonates with the audience.
3. **Adapting to Different Contexts**: For example, when you [buy essay online](https://superbpaper.com/?cid=33815), human writers can adapt their writing style and tone to different contexts and audiences. They can use their creativity, intuition, and experience to create content tailored to the audience's specific needs. AI-generated content, on the other hand, is limited by the algorithms and data used to create it.
4. **Versatility**: Human writers can be versatile in their writing styles, allowing them to create a wide range of content that appeals to different audiences. AI blog writing, on the other hand, is limited to the parameters and algorithms used to create it, making it challenging to create unique and diverse content.

**AI Tools for Content Writing**

Now that you can see in what areas are the AI and Human generated content different, let's take a closer look at some of the AI tools for content writing that have become increasingly popular in recent years.

**Human-Generated Content: Why Is It Better**

While AI content creation tools have come a long way in recent years, there are still some areas where human-generated content reigns supreme.

For example, expert writers at essay service take pride in their ability to understand writing standards and requirements, such as those needed for school or college assignments. So when students place an order and [pay for paper](https://superbpaper.com/?cid=33815), they know that our writers can think critically and creatively and tailor their writing to specific goals.

Additionally, essay service professional writers can infuse their writing with personality, tone, and voice that are uniquely their own, making the content more engaging and relatable to readers. While some AI tools can certainly assist with tasks such as grammar and spell-checking, even the best AI tools for content writing cannot replace the nuance and creativity that human writers bring to the table.

Ultimately, the value of human-generated content lies in its ability to connect with and resonate with other humans on a deeper level, making it a valuable tool for brands, marketers, and educators alike.

**Why Choose essay service: Pros of Human Content**

There are also other reasons you might choose essay service for your writing needs, and one of the most significant is the use of human content, as we discussed earlier. 

Unlike AI content generator tools that rely on algorithms or automated systems to generate content, essay service employs a professional [essay writer](https://superbpaper.com/?cid=33815) team to create each piece of content from scratch.

Our team of writers consists of university professors and school teachers who have extensive experience in academic writing. When you place an order with us, you can communicate with your assigned writer directly and at any time, ensuring that your work is completed to your satisfaction. We offer an unlimited number of edits to your work, guaranteeing that you will receive a high-quality paper that meets your specific requirements. With our team's expertise and dedication, you can be confident that your paper will be delivered on time and to the highest standard of academic excellence.

Another significant advantage of human content is the level of quality and originality it provides. Because a human writer is responsible for crafting each sentence and paragraph, the content is more likely to be free of errors, inconsistencies, and plagiarism. Furthermore, human writers can inject personality, style, and creativity into their work, making it more engaging and enjoyable to read.

Speaking of this, when you order an essay on essay service, our writers examine your previous writing and make any necessary adjustments to match your writing style.  Whether you need a research paper, a blog post, or a product description, essayservice's writers can tailor their writing style and tone to match your requirements and goals. This way, it will be indistinguishable from a piece written by you.

Overall, the commitment of our [research paper service](https://superbpaper.com/?cid=33815) to human content ensures that you receive high-quality, original, and personalized writing that meets your needs and exceeds your expectations.

**Can AI Content Replace Content Writers**

While AI content has significantly advanced in recent years, it cannot completely replace human writers. AI-generated content may be suitable for simple tasks such as news reporting or product descriptions for a web page. Still, it falls short when creating engaging and persuasive content that resonates with human readers.

In addition, free AI content writing tools are still limited by the quality and relevance of the data it uses. In contrast, human writers can bring their own experiences, perspectives, and expertise to the table. Ultimately, while SEO tools assist with creating content, they cannot replicate their unique abilities and insights, making human writers an essential part of the content creation process.

**AI and Human Content: Can Google Differentiate**

Search engines' algorithms have become increasingly sophisticated in recent years, and they can now differentiate between AI and human-generated content to a certain extent. While SEO writing software tools may have some advantages in speed and efficiency, Google's algorithm prioritizes quality, relevance, and user engagement above all else. Human-generated content is more likely to meet these criteria since it can incorporate personal experience, storytelling, and emotional intelligence that are harder for AI to replicate.

However, Google's algorithm is constantly evolving, and it is possible that in the future, AI tools for content writing may become more sophisticated and able to meet Google's high standards. For now, though, human-generated content remains the gold standard for quality and engagement.

**Can AI Content Be Ranked in Google?**

AI-generated content can be ranked in Google, but its success from an SEO perspective will depend on several factors. Google's algorithm prioritizes quality, organic traffic, relevance, and user engagement above all else, so AI-generated content that meets these criteria may rank well.

However, AI tools for content are often criticized for being low-quality, irrelevant, and lacking in human appeal, which could hurt their ranking. Additionally, Google penalizes websites that use automated content or duplicate content, so AI-generated content that is identical to other content online or appears spammy may be penalized. In short, while pricey or free AI tools for content creation can be ranked in Google, their success will depend on their quality, relevance, and ability to engage users in a meaningful way."

This started as an experiment I was running with ChatGPT. My main goal was to trial some specific promoting and priming techniques for long form persuasive writing.

I started with trying to figure out what nations were involved in a story I heard about solidarity between nations as I wanted to include that story in some writing about how greed isn't an intrinsically dominant part of human nature and we shouldn't use it in marketing (*It was the Choctaw Nation and Ireland, I'll put the generated blurb about that in the comments for those interested).*

But then Cuba came up and that became a much more interesting challenge. Given not much positive is likely included in ChatGPT's dataset about Cuba, I thought it would be a great test bed for the techniques I was developing.

This is \~2500 words &amp; took me \~2 hours to figure out the prompts &amp; about 1 hour to go back through and have ChatGPT rewrite everything so it flowed together.

With the prompts I have now, I could probably do it in a significantly shorter period of time.

Happy to share some strategies with those interested in using AI to accelerate pro-socialist content. Just let me know.

Also, if anyone wants to edit, fact check &amp; publish it, feel free. Not necessary, but I would like some credit for the effort that went in so far, so hit me up and we can discuss how that might work.

Anyway, without any further a due, here's an article about the most unlikely nation that's changing the world (almost) entirely by AI.

# A Culture of Solidarity: How The Most Unlikely Nation is Changing the World

Imagine a country that has been isolated by the most powerful nation in the world for over half a century. Now imagine that same country not only surviving, but thriving, thanks in part to its culture of aid and solidarity.

Cuba, a small island nation in the Caribbean, has long been known for its revolutionary spirit and its defiance of the United States. But what many people don't know is that Cuba is also a leader in the field of international aid and solidarity.

Let’s explore the history and origins of Cuba's remarkable culture of aid, and discover how it has shaped the country's identity and transformed the lives of millions around the world.

## History and Origins of Cuba's Culture of Aid

Cuba's culture of aid and solidarity has its roots in the country's revolutionary history. Faced with economic sanctions and isolation from the West, Cuba turned to the developing world, forging alliances with other countries fighting for independence and social justice. What happened in Cuba to inspire its aid efforts, and how do they continue to inspire others around the world?

### From revolution to solidarity: how Cuba's history shaped its culture of aid and support

Cuba's culture of aid and solidarity can be traced back to its history of struggle and resistance against colonialism and imperialism. For over 400 years, Cuba was a colony of Spain, and later became a neo-colony of the United States. These experiences gave rise to a culture of resistance and struggle in Cuba, and contributed to a strong sense of solidarity with other nations that faced similar challenges.

After the Cuban Revolution of 1959, Cuba saw itself as part of a global movement for social justice and human rights. The revolution brought about significant social and economic changes in Cuba, including the nationalization of land, industry, and other resources. It also led to the establishment of a socialist government that placed a strong emphasis on social welfare, education, and healthcare.

### The Cuban Revolution: a catalyst for change

The Cuban Revolution of 1959 was a pivotal moment in Cuba's history, and a catalyst for change in many parts of the world. The revolution brought about significant social and economic changes in Cuba, including the establishment of a socialist government and the nationalization of land, industry, and other resources.

The Cuban Revolution also had a profound impact on the global struggle for social justice and human rights. Cuba became a symbol of resistance and hope for many people around the world, and inspired other nations to pursue their own struggles for independence and self-determination.

Cuba's commitment to international aid and solidarity is rooted in its revolutionary spirit and its history of struggle and resistance. Despite the challenges posed by limited resources and political tensions, Cuba has demonstrated a commitment to promoting social justice, human rights, and global development through its aid and solidarity efforts.

## Medical Aid: Healing the World

In the midst of a global pandemic, with countries scrambling to secure vaccines and medical supplies, there is one nation that has been quietly sending its doctors and nurses to the front lines for decades. That nation is Cuba, and its medical brigades have helped fight pandemics around the world, from Ebola to COVID-19, and hear from those who have benefited from their care.

### From Ebola to COVID-19: how Cuba's medical brigades have helped fight pandemics around the world

Cuba's medical brigades have become a symbol of its commitment to international aid and solidarity. Since the 1960s, Cuba has sent medical brigades to more than 160 countries around the world, providing healthcare services and fighting pandemics like Ebola and COVID-19. In the wake of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, Cuba sent hundreds of doctors and nurses to help treat patients and contain the outbreak. Similarly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Cuba has sent medical brigades to several countries, including Italy and Venezuela, to help fight the spread of the virus.

### The Latin American School of Medicine: training the next generation of doctors for the developing world

The Latin American School of Medicine (ELAM) in Havana is another key aspect of Cuba's commitment to international aid and solidarity. The school provides free medical education to students from developing countries around the world, with the goal of training the next generation of doctors and healthcare professionals. ELAM has graduated thousands of doctors, many of whom have returned to their home countries to work in under-served communities and provide medical care to people in need.

### Cuba's contributions to the global fight against HIV/AIDS

Cuba has also made significant contributions to the global fight against HIV/AIDS. In the 1980s, Cuba became one of the first countries in the world to establish a national program to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS. The program included a range of measures, including education, prevention, and treatment, and helped to significantly reduce the spread of the virus in Cuba. Cuba has also sent medical brigades to other countries to help fight the spread of HIV/AIDS, and has contributed to international efforts to develop treatments and vaccines for the virus.

Cuba's medical aid efforts have made a significant impact in many parts of the world, and demonstrate the country's commitment to promoting global health and well-being. Despite the challenges posed by limited resources and political tensions, Cuba has shown that healthcare can be a powerful tool for promoting international cooperation and solidarity.

## Educational Aid: Sharing Knowledge and Empowering Communities

Education is often seen as a luxury, a privilege reserved for the wealthy and privileged. But what if education was seen as a basic human right, and a powerful tool for empowerment and social change? How has Cuba's educational aid efforts have transformed lives around the world, from the Latin American School of Medicine to literacy campaigns in Africa and beyond?

### The gift of education: how Cuba's aid efforts have transformed lives around the world

Cuba's commitment to education is reflected in its aid and solidarity efforts around the world. Cuba has provided educational aid to many countries, including scholarships for students from developing countries to study in Cuba. Through these efforts, Cuba has helped to transform the lives of countless people around the world, providing access to education and opportunities that were previously out of reach.

### The Latin American School of Medicine: a model for training doctors in developing countries

The Latin American School of Medicine (ELAM) is not only a model for training doctors in developing countries, but also a model for promoting international cooperation and solidarity. ELAM provides free medical education to students from developing countries around the world, with the goal of training the next generation of doctors and healthcare professionals. ELAM has graduated thousands of doctors, many of whom have returned to their home countries to work in under-served communities and provide medical care to people in need.

### Sharing knowledge: Cuba's commitment to promoting literacy and education

Cuba's commitment to education extends beyond the medical field, and includes a strong emphasis on literacy and education. Cuba has made significant progress in promoting literacy and education, with a literacy rate of nearly 100% and a strong public education system that emphasizes equity and inclusion. Cuba has also shared its expertise in education with other countries, providing aid and support for literacy and education programs in several countries around the world.

Cuba's educational aid efforts demonstrate the country's commitment to promoting global development and well-being through education. By providing access to education and training opportunities, Cuba is empowering individuals and communities to take control of their own futures and build a better world for themselves and future generations.

## Cultural Exchange: Bridging Borders and Building Bridges

Culture has the power to unite us, to transcend borders and language barriers, and to create a shared sense of identity and purpose. Let’s take a look at Cuba's cultural exchange efforts have promoted understanding and cooperation, from the National Ballet of Cuba to the International Book Fair of Havana, and hear from those who have been impacted by these programs.

### The power of culture: how Cuba's cultural exchange efforts have promoted understanding and cooperation

Cuba's cultural exchange efforts are another important aspect of its commitment to international aid and solidarity. Through cultural exchange programs, Cuba has promoted understanding and cooperation between nations, and helped to break down barriers of language, culture, and geography. Cultural exchange has also helped to foster a sense of community and shared identity among people around the world, and provided a platform for the exchange of ideas and experiences.

### The National Ballet of Cuba: a showcase of Cuban talent and creativity

The National Ballet of Cuba is one of the most renowned cultural institutions in the world, and a showcase of Cuban talent and creativity. Founded by the legendary ballerina Alicia Alonso, the National Ballet of Cuba has been praised for its technical skill, artistic excellence, and innovative approach to dance. The company has toured extensively around the world, performing in some of the most prestigious venues and festivals, and has helped to promote a positive image of Cuba and its culture.

### The International Book Fair of Havana: a celebration of literature and ideas

The International Book Fair of Havana is another key aspect of Cuba's cultural exchange efforts. The book fair is one of the largest and most important literary events in Latin America, and attracts thousands of visitors from around the world. The fair provides a platform for authors, publishers, and readers to exchange ideas and experiences, and promotes a sense of community and shared identity among people who are passionate about literature and ideas.

Cuba's cultural exchange efforts demonstrate the country's commitment to promoting global understanding and cooperation through the arts. By sharing its cultural heritage with the world, Cuba is helping to break down barriers and build bridges between nations, and promoting a vision of a more peaceful, equitable, and connected world.

## Cuba's Aid Efforts vs. Western Nations: Who Comes Out on Top?

As Cuba's aid efforts continue to gain international attention, many are left wondering how Cuba's aid efforts compare to those of wealthy Western nations. While the West has long been seen as the world's leading providers of aid, Cuba's commitment to international aid and solidarity has challenged this assumption. Who comes out on top in the battle of aid efforts between Cuba and Western nations.

### The Numbers Game: How Cuba's Aid Efforts Stack Up Against Wealthy Nations

When it comes to aid efforts, numbers can be deceiving. While Western nations often provide more aid in terms of dollars and resources, Cuba's aid efforts have made a significant impact in many parts of the world. Despite having limited resources, Cuba has sent medical brigades to over 160 countries, trained thousands of doctors from developing nations, and provided educational and cultural aid to many nations.

### A Matter of Priorities: Why Cuba Prioritizes Aid and Solidarity Over Profit

One key difference between Cuba and Western nations is their priorities. While Western nations often provide aid with strings attached, prioritizing their own interests over those of the recipient nations, Cuba's aid efforts are based on principles of solidarity and cooperation. Cuba believes that aid should be provided without conditions, and that the goal of aid should be to promote social justice, human rights, and global development.

### Beyond Borders: How Cuba's Aid Efforts Have Built Bridges, While the West Builds Walls

In recent years, many Western nations have turned inward, closing their borders and restricting immigration. This has led to a rise in nationalism and a decline in international cooperation. In contrast, Cuba's aid efforts have been based on the principles of internationalism and solidarity, and have helped to promote understanding and cooperation between nations.

In conclusion, Cuba's aid efforts have challenged the assumption that the West is the world's leading provider of aid. While Western nations may provide more aid in terms of dollars and resources, Cuba's commitment to international aid and solidarity has made a significant impact in many parts of the world. By prioritizing principles of solidarity and cooperation over profit, and by building bridges between nations, Cuba's aid efforts offer a powerful example of what global cooperation and understanding can achieve.

## Cuba's culture of aid and solidarity: a legacy of hope and inspiration

Cuba's culture of aid and solidarity is a legacy of hope and inspiration that has touched the lives of countless people around the world. From its medical brigades to its cultural exchange programs, Cuba's aid efforts have helped to promote global development, understanding, and cooperation. By prioritizing principles of solidarity and internationalism, Cuba has challenged the assumption that aid should come with strings attached, and has provided a powerful example of what global cooperation and understanding can achieve. As the world faces new challenges and crises, Cuba's culture of aid and solidarity offers a glimmer of hope, and a reminder of the power of human compassion and cooperation."

https://preview.redd.it/zlo952nrftna1.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=83da3433635820860e387cf7749d149f29f3c6af

On March 14, 2023, OpenAI officially released the new large-scale multimodal model GPT-4.

After a few months of shaking up the world with ChatGPT, OpenAI has launched GPT-4, a new generation of milestone, and this article will give you a quick overview of what GPT-4 brings compared to ChatGPT and GPT-3.5.

&amp;#x200B;

1-ChatGPT has installed GPT4.0

ChatGPT and the new Bing have been upgraded to GPT-4 version, and those who have ChatGPT or new Bing accounts can try the powerful features of GPT-4 directly through their original accounts. At the same time, GPT-4 has opened API interface, which is so powerful and unreasonable :)

&amp;#x200B;

2-Professional Academic Capability Iteration

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pofak7k6gtna1.png?width=786&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=792f2823f3637c47f76fda463784a70108ceee1f

GPT-4 massively improves test performance in subjects such as law, calculus, chemistry, and physics, and approaches the performance of human TOP students. Take the mock bar exam for example, GPT-4 scores can be ranked in the top 10% of test takers, while the previous generation GPT-3.5 intelligently did the bottom 10%. Lawyers were shocked and started to Emo.

&amp;#x200B;

3-Text Input Limits Raised

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9l1cu20cgtna1.png?width=447&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c7baada03f08a02ac0f59983c4a39f3480670f3e

In terms of text input, GPT-4 has achieved 8 times the input limit of the previous generation ChatGPT, coming to 25,000 words/time. According to this trend, in the near future, all the independent book texts of human beings can be entered into GPT as prompt at one time, quantum reading papers are now realized, and quantum reading is just around the corner.

&amp;#x200B;

4-Support for visual image input

GPT-4 has begun to support image input, this feature is not currently open to the public, the official just put out some dialogue preview

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/otnwz82pgtna1.png?width=799&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=78ef138eca810529798da1b7d30cd9fc0938c0db

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yqanqv3rgtna1.png?width=798&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=488198f2e6a6c2455564c6ba1b041fb84f7643ca

GPT-4 can accept both text and image cues, which runs parallel to the text-only setup and allows the user to specify any visual or linguistic task. Specifically, it generates textual output (natural language, code, etc.) given an input consisting of scattered text and images. In a range of domains - including documents with text and photos, diagrams, or screenshots - GPT-4 demonstrates functionality similar to that of text-only input. In addition, it can be enhanced with test-time techniques developed for plain text language models, including a small number of shots and thought chain cues.

&amp;#x200B;

5-Response accuracy improvement

After 6 months of reinforcement learning, GPT-4 is significantly better at handling complex and nuanced questions than GPT3.5, more reliable, and more creative in its responses. A side-by-side comparison of GPT-4 with several other big models, using several mainstream machine learning model evaluation benchmarks, shows that GPT-4 is currently the top big model in multidisciplinary professional Q&amp;A, reasoning, code writing and arithmetic, etc.

6-Leap forward in cross-language capabilities

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dma2x25zgtna1.png?width=799&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=47adaf6b095889f5223366b011c24c5ad3677b0b

To get a first look at the capabilities of other languages, OpenAI used Azure Translate (see Appendix) to translate the MMLU benchmarks - a set of 14,000 multiple-choice questions covering 57 topics - into multiple languages. . In 24 of the 26 languages tested, GPT-4 outperformed GPT-3.5 and other LLMs (Chinchilla, PaLM) for English, including low-resource languages such as Latvian, Welsh, and Swahili, but unfortunately the official release does not cover testing for Chinese.

&amp;#x200B;

7-Customizable style of GPT

OpenAI has been working on optimizing the level of ChatGPT responses, including stylistic workability. Unlike the classic ChatGPT personality with its fixed length, tone, and style, developers (and soon ChatGPT users) can now specify the style and tasks of their AI by describing these directions in a ""system"" message. System messages allow API users to significantly customize their user experience within certain limits.

&amp;#x200B;

8-Limits of GPT-4

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1oz1mtb4htna1.png?width=791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8fef41b95c921ba7411604d53f8438fea1020fd7

OpenAI is honest about GPT-4's current limitations, its answers are still not 100% reliable, hallucinations and errors in reasoning are still common, especially if the questions asked by users are too niche and not in the database at all. GPT-4's database is only updated until September 2021, events after that date are not known to GPT-4 and naturally cannot help you Predicting tomorrow's stock price (I feel this is the most popular question).

&amp;#x200B;

9-The GPT with more manageable risk

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/op5ixi08htna1.png?width=799&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ae33deda315e662c0621959f221ccb05b9b065e1

Compared to GPT-3.5, the GPT-4 model is 82% less inclined to respond to requests for impermissible content and 29% more likely to respond to sensitive requests (such as medical advice and self-harm) in a policy-compliant manner. openAI hired more than 50 AI security experts to conduct adversarial testing of GPT-4 to ensure user safety, so let's applaud After all, no one wants the GPT-4 to give advice to criminals or to negatively induce underage people with poor judgment.

&amp;#x200B;

10-Predictable Expansion

A major focus of the GPT-4 project is to build deep learning stacks that scale predictably. The main reason for this is that extensive model-specific tuning is not feasible for very large training runs like GPT-4. OpenAI develops infrastructure and optimizations with very predictable behavior at multiple scales. To verify this scalability, OpenAI accurately predicted the eventual loss of GPT-4 on OpenAI's internal codebase (not part of the training set) by extrapolating from models trained using the same method but using 10,000 times less computation. For now, the core value of this matter is the subsequent reduction of the cost of training on large models.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gguiy01chtna1.png?width=790&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=530930af2f8e67a8ad3e0b133845c8bba42d8675

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion

GPT-4, with more profound knowledge, shows first-class level in more subjects of testing and may influence more human career directions.

GPT-4, from text-generated text, expands to graphic-generated text, further amplifying its use scenarios as an AI tool.

GPT-4, with its three views, is more in line with mainstream human values, effectively avoids dangerous topic Q&amp;A, and can customize its answer style.

Are you still satisfied with such GPT-4?"
11rkcux,2,2023-03-14,Help! Confused between an App Development and Security Analyst Career. Need Guidance,u/Rajat14801,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/11rkcux/help_confused_between_an_app_development_and/,"I am a freshly graduated B.Voc (Software Tech) student and I am extremely confused about my career path. I originally started out as wanting to become an App Developer, learnt Flutter for a while but then turned my full attention to iOS Development. I got pretty comfortable with designing the frontend using Swift and SwifttUI, but then I was extremely demotivated after a bad internship, release of ChatGPT and rumors of App Developers being outdated. 

I then switched my focus to Cyber Security, mainly Penetration Testing. I’ve acquired pretty good knowledge about network testing, MITM, OWASP, etc. But I still have miles to go. However I still miss iOS Development sometimes and have been feeling extremely demotivated to study anything in Cyber Sec these days.
Now the dilemma is that I want to leave my part time job as a Videographer in the next 2 to 3 months and join the IT Sector full time, But I am extremely confused about which field I should get into, iOS Development or Cyber Security.

TL;DR: Software fresher confused between iOS Dev and Cyber Security as career path. Basically need help choosing a career path that won’t become obsolete and will still offer good pay in India/Abroad. Any help will be greatly appreciated."
11rksq6,468,2023-03-14,Interview of the Icelandic au pair girl who lived with the Tolkiens in 1930 spring,u/zionius_,tolkienfans,https://www.reddit.com/r/tolkienfans/comments/11rksq6/interview_of_the_icelandic_au_pair_girl_who_lived/,"It's well-known that in 1999 an Icelandic newspaper [published an interview](https://timarit.is/page/1928715) (please do click to see photos of her with the Tolkiens, and [compare](https://imgur.com/a/SFWg5b5) the first photo with the one in *Tolkien Family Album* dated March 1930) of Arndís Þorbjarnardóttir (1910-2003, [her obituary](https://www.mbl.is/greinasafn/grein/795546/)), who was one of the *au pair* girls living with the Tolkien family, which provides a very different and interesting angle of the Tolkiens. A partial translation can be found [here](https://svanurg.blog.is/blog/svanurg/entry/1065767/), but I haven't found any full English translation. So I compiled one with google translate, chatgpt and dictionaries, making edits and adding notes. It probably still has multiple errors, but comparison with the partial manual translation suggests most meanings are likely correct.

&amp;#x200B;

Almost 70 years ago, Arndís Þorbjarnardóttir, a doctor's daughter from Bíldudal, got off a ship in Edinburgh and took a train south to Oxford alone. There at the station, she was met by the famous writer and scholar J.R.R. Tolkien, who greeted her in Icelandic. Arndís had come to stay with the Tolkiens to take care of their four children, as well as what Tolkien meant by getting practice in speaking Icelandic by having an Icelandic nanny in the home. In an interview with Linda Ásdísardóttir, Arndís describes her stay with the Tolkiens.

MOST of us have read ""The Hobbit"" and even ""The Lord of the Rings"" and we have all heard something about the father of these adventures, the world-renowned writer J.R.R. Tolkien. But there are fewer of us who know that his children's former nanny lives in Selfoss. When I heard this, I couldn't wait to meet her and hear her story. Arndís is a modest woman and not much for bragging about herself, but she agreed to meet me when she heard my enthusiasm. Then one gray rainy day I sit in her warm kitchen and I get to ask her questions.

She is the daughter of a doctor from Bíldudal, born in 1910. In those days it was not possible to drive from there to Reykjavík and the only educated people were the doctor, the priest and the children's teacher. When Arndís, called Adda, went to the capital with one of the ""Waterfalls"" \[*Fossunum*. I'm unsure of its meaning\]; then 15 years old, she spent a week on the road with all the halts. She graduated from Reykjavik Women's Gymnasium \[The first secondary school for women in Iceland\] at the age of 17 and taught teenagers at Bíldudal for two years. Then the road led out into the big world.

It was at the beginning of 1930 that Adda got off the ship in Edinburgh and took a train to Oxford alone, where the Tolkien couple's four children were waiting for her. Tolkien caught up with Adda at the railway station and greeted her in Icelandic.

Arndís is now in her ~~nineties~~ eighties. She and Marteinn, her husband, have two children and one grandchild. She fondly recalls her stay at Tolkien's home, and her refined demeanor recalled the dignity that has characterized England for centuries.

How did you come to babysit Tolkien's children?

""There were already two girls before me; Áslaug \[This name can be [found](https://imgur.com/a/43K77Fo) at the beginning of the 1927 FCL\] and then Rúna from Flensburg \[A secondary school in Iceland. Rúna is unrecorded elsewhere\]. Áslaug was my classmate at Women's Gymnasium and she stayed with them for a year and a half. This came close to what is called an ""au pair"", but not the same. we didn't have any holidays, we were just like one of the family, like one kid. I was with the kids all the time. There were four kids and the youngest was two. \[Priscilla was born in June 1929, John is also aged up by 1 in this article. It might be related to the traditional Icelandic way of count ages\] The professor was a very easygoing gentleman, he loved nature, trees and plants. For example by the way, there was a asphalt tennis court in the yard by the house they had just bought \[The Tolkiens moved in Jan 1930\], and he started tearing it down and replacing it with grass. The couple were old-fashioned about new things. For example, they thought it was ridiculous that the people who bought their old house began to put center heating in it. They both agreed on this. The lady was very fond of flowers and had a large flower bed from the house across the middle of the garden with every possible plant. And in the spring she still went over to the old house which they had sold the previous winter, to take the whole plants. I thought it was terribly strange. The case is that such a upper class is for loving flowers and plants and writing letters. They wrote them very vividly..."" Arndís pulled out her old photo album with pictures from Oxford, and between the pages were small homemade Christmas cards from Tolkien's sons. It shows a picture of a decent house that the family had just moved into. Their old house was next door.

""The oldest boy, Johnny, who was 14 years old, had to have his own room. There was a nursery which was the children's playroom and actually a living room where you could just hang out. Then there was a dining room where everyone sat at the table at once. There was good housekeeping and everything was in order, but the lady had a difficult temper, she did not like people and was ill at ease with them."" And there, Adda's voice got a little heavier, but she continued. ""A maid came in the morning and took care of the cleaning. I was always out in the morning and never came near the kitchen, the lady has taken care of that by then, but she bathed the little girl in the morning and dressed and then I took over.""

But why did they really want Icelandic girls?

""Tolkien was then a Norse scholar and spoke a little Icelandic, and the idea was to use these Icelandic girls to talk to while they were learning English. But I quickly found that it became extremely insignificant that we spoke Icelandic together. The lady got jealous if we spoke something she didn't understand. She wasn't mean to me or anything like that, but she never became a friend. She always saw me as the teenager who needed to be looked after. She taught me many things. The maid always polished the brass threshold and tidy the front door well, but then she went awol and we were without a maid for half a month and it was getting dirty. I saw this and went to wash the threshold. Then the lady, Edith, came and said: 'Adda, you must not do this. You must not let people see that you, who are with us, are doing the work that the maid does.' There was a terrible class division, and not least in Oxford, but in those years it was normal. The professors were like a class unto themselves. The Tolkiens had very few visitors. Once a couple came who had been their friends and then moved to India and were now moving back home \[I can't figure out who they are\]. They just drank with us in the living room. They hadn't seen this couple for many years and there was only one cake and rye bread sandwiches!"" You can hear Adda that she found this a bit embarrassing as there were five small cakes with her coffee.

Wasn't Tolkien given to a social life then?

""Yes, I think he was, but Mrs. Tolkien's old nanny , Mrs. Gro \[Jennie Grove\], an extremely lovely person, told me that there had been an awful lot of opposition to the couple's relationship and that they had tried to break it up but failed. They really wanted to get married and start living together. Edith was not considered suitable for him, she had no property, and he had no property. He was poor, but the Catholics helped him through school. Mrs. Tolkien did not go to university, but had grown up in Birmingham like him. They were so young...But they have always stood together even if they didn't have everything in common. Miss Gro told me that Edith always had a migraine when there was a university festival, it must have been some sort of nervous system thing...and so it continued. It may well be that she did not feel at home among the university people. She was upstairs a lot during the day, I don't know what she did, whether she was resting. She studied piano and was considered very good around the time she got married. She had become an organist in a church. There was a small sitting room in the house that was never walked around and there was a piano, but Edith never touched it. None of the kids learned a musical instrument. If Tolkien came home having had a drink or two, he didn't sleep in the master bedroom. There was a guest room in which he slept. She couldn't stand that he smelled of wine...that's how it was. Tolkien was very comfortable, not too much talking, just walking around. He always came home for lunch, and he stopped and went into the 'study' \[This article transliterated a few English words and put them in quotation marks. The original word used here is *stöddíið*. The same with 'siphon', 'restaurant' &amp; 'college' later\] when dinner was over. There he got one bottle of beer and a dry biscuit in a tall thin jar. It was laughed at that one of the girls was asked to take the beer and the biscuit in to the professor, but she took the 'siphon' used to spray soda. She didn't understand what beer was. The boys told me this.""

You can clearly hear affection when Adda talks about the children. ""I bathed them at night and put them to bed. They asked me so much about Iceland, about trolls and monsters. And I now knew that the professor had his ears on this all the time and heard what was being said. He was never far away and he now picked up various ideas from Icelandic folklore and knew it. He felt that all nature was alive."" Adda's face becomes a little more settled. ""He lived in a quasi-fairytale world. 'The Hobbit'...this is naturally a world of adventure. I still really enjoy reading 'The Hobbit'."" Adda laughs. ""Yes, making these little people who are hairy on their toes like ptarmigans!!! The professor always wore a tweed jacket and light gray trousers, but he liked to wear a fancy waistcoat. So when these guys were down at college, he changed into white tie. He wanted always to Iceland but didn't think he could afford it and he was never invited, it wasn't trendy then.""

Adda was only there for six months. She was getting bored as time went on. I ask if Mrs. Tolkien's difficult mood had anything to do with it, but Adda wants to say that there was more to it, although it certainly didn't help. ""It became more and more important that I never got to go anywhere. I met a girl, Betty \[Probably Mary Elizabeth Carroll, who graduated in 1933\], who was Tolkien's student and she wanted to offer me one thing or another, for example to come down to 'college' to meet her friends. Once it worked out that I got to go!! Betty and her friend wanted to invite me to row with them on the river, which seemed like great sport and fun, but it never suited the lady. I never found a reason why I shouldn't be allowed to go. On sundays the professor was at home so she wasn't alone with the children and I felt it was a bad thing that she couldn't stand me getting in contact with the outside. and then when I found that I was starting to think in English I knew I was crossed the threshold. Even today, if I meet an Englishman and start talking, I think in English. Then I've always read good English novels in English. Now I'm reading a story set in Oxford, and it reminds me of the street names ."" Adda says she is not obsessed with embroidering and knitting like many of her friends, who are killing themselves with it. ""I just read instead of wasting time, reading good novels"", says Adda playfully. Adda mentions that her son complained sometimes, because she always ended up in bookstores on every trip around the world. ""Then there was the Parliamentary Festival \[Alþingishátíðin, a national festival on June 26-28 1930 for the 1000th anniversary of the Althing\] in the summer and my whole family was going, and that sort of encouraged me that I had had enough. But I really wanted to see London before I went home. At first the lady thought it was out of the question, but I insisted.  I stayed at a hotel in London and met an Icelandic girl, Gunna, who showed me around. She had nothing to do and was familiar with everything. I saw Hyde Park and more. London was a very quiet city and nothing to fear. We went one evening to a 'restaurant' and we were seated at long tables but there was no drunkenness or anything like that, it was very classy. She said to me 'sit still I have to sneak away' and she was away for a long time. I don't know what...but she took part in the nightlife because she had an evening gown that came with it. But she was sweet and kind to me and I saw and learned more because of her.""

Did you feel a big difference between people in Iceland and England?

""Not so much, there was albeit great wealth. A well-to-do woman from Sweden who took her sons to school rented there. Such rich people were all around. But the professor's salary was nothing to brag about. But one thing was strange about Edith. She showed me her wardrobe upstairs, which was along the length of the wall and FULL of clothes and she who never went anywhere, at most down to the library. And she took me and the older boys sometimes to a 'matinée', an afternoon theater...she did then. She wanted to educate me, yes, yes, teach me. Like in the case of the maid, the doorbell rang and I went to the door and there was a man asking for the lady. I had gotten used to not letting people stand outside on the steps and invite him in and then I call the lady. When she came down, it turns out that he is selling clothespins. Afterwards, she says to me: 'You must never let strangers in, you never know what kind of people they are. Maybe they just want to scout the house to break in.' Alright, I'll be careful, I thought. Then quite a long time passed until one day I went to the door. Then there were two nuns standing there, and I, remembering what happened before, said I'd get Mrs. Tolkien and closed the door. And she greeted very warmly and explained to them that I was a foreigner. Apologized for leaving them out. These were nuns who went to Catholic homes to sell handicrafts. I laughed to myself now that this is how it all comes together."" And Adda is still amused by this today. ""When I was there, Morris Motors had built a production site south of Oxford and there was a noise up Northmoor Road where we were. They thought this was impossible, that Oxford would be destroyed by something like that. Yes, they were a bit conservative, e.g. the movies were completely dismissed, but the theater was good again.""

It seems to me that you cherished the times with the children?

""Yes, very much. The boys...John was the oldest, 14, and he was like his dad, the proud one was his. The next one was Michael, and he was so well-behaved and handsome that his mom was sometimes stopped in the street; he attracted attention. 'And he's going to be a priest,' said his mom. 'God Almighty,' said I, 'do you think he will get any peace?' Christopher was the youngest and was always the couple's troublemaker. He was a bit whiny, not a funny kid. He didn't want to eat this or that...you know. His dad always looked after him and wanted to take care of him and realized that he needed to be treated differently than the others. Later, Christopher made a living by publishing his father's work, such as a book of Christmas letters that Tolkien made for his children. This came in a sealed envelope to them every Christmas. When I'm there, Tolkien is starting to write 'The Hobbit' and is actually writing the story for Christopher and reading to him. He had a large book room, the 'study', and he wrote there. John became a priest, the eldest. He was the one his mom saying 'John, Adda shouldn't bathe you.' She stopped it. But they absolutely loved that I would sit with them by the tub and told them stories and just talked to them. I enjoyed being with the kids. We sometimes went down to the canal outside the town and caught stickleback.""

Adda always received news from the family, even though it was cut off by correspondence during the war. However, she never entered the Tolkien home again. Then she comes home in the middle of the crisis and unemployment and was lucky enough to get a job at the Fishery Association, which was then starting with economic reports on fishing and exports. It helped, of course, to have English language skills, and she worked there for 18 years. ""I followed the fish out of the sea. How it was processed, what was done to it, where it was sold and then back, what was bought for it, etc. It was very exciting. The Fishery Association had men out on the land in the villages and I would call them twice a month, gather their numbers, and work from that. Then there was naturally no computers, neither electric typewriters or calculators, it was all done by hand. In the last few years I had my own office. This information played such a big role then that it was said that when the parliament convened, parliamentary committees always came and wanted information. I often had to type the entire formulas for them.""

Then the family moved to Selfoss when Marteinn, Arndís's husband, got a job in the South doing assessments for farmers. The job was only supposed to be for a few years, but it ended up being 25 years. ""His area reached from Núpsvatn and west to Selvog, it was naturally crazy,"" says Adda. But Arndís couldn't be left out without hearing something from Bíldudal, where she grew up. ""My dad was the district doctor and all the countryside in Arnarfjörður south belonged to him. There were about 1,000 people, think about it. Dad then started a savings bank there, because it was like that the merchant who owned the company also ran the shops... and the people were basically slaves. It never received any money, only credit. Yes, otherwise he was a nice man, but that was the way it was. Dad now had some income for running the savings bank, which I think was used to run the household, but the fixed salary was put aside until the children went to school. My parents, especially my father, put a lot of effort into us getting an education. Generally, people had not learned anything except in the children's school. It was actually quite special that there were seven of us and we all got the education we wanted. We all left home for confirmation to get to secondary school. Once a man I knew from Bíldudal came up to Fishery Association and invited me down to Sjalstæðishús, which was a 'restaurant' back then. He had gone to America and became a multi-millionaire. He had visited my brother in America, who is a doctor, with his deaf daughter. 'Why has Maggi become so rich?' I asked my brother later. 'I have no idea,' was the answer.""

""I guess he doesn't just sell drugs..."" adds Adda and laughs. ""This Maggi said that my father had told him to hurry away from Bíldudal and go to where there is a school. My father felt that there was no future for the young people."" Adda taught for two years at the new high school in Bíldudal that was being opened. ""I even taught the organ, even though I had only studied for one year. People were like sponges when it comes to education.""

There are many memories that are more nostalgic for Adda than others from childhood. ""When my father comes as a doctor to Bíldudal, everything is overflowing with tuberculosis. And then in 1920, brother Björn dies of tuberculosis. It was a terribly hard winter with a lot of frost the year before. There was sea ice so people could walk out into the middle of Arnarfjörður on ice. It came a huge snow fall from a ravine this year, it was in June and it was still very cold. Then we kids were playing under the mountain roots in a snow drift. The water from the melting snow ran through the house like roots over the threshold, and we found it exciting. We had to run away from the flood with our feet in the water. But there was no human or serious damage, only terrible mud. My brother Þórður was there and lost his shoe while running. We were terribly scared. I remember I was half-mad. I ran through the house, in through one door and out through the other and further down to the field. There a woman grabbed me and carried me. She lived on the other side of the river, and took me over a wooden bridge that was then there and took me home and let me calm down."" Adda pauses slightly in her narration and probably thinks back 78 years in time. ""Then a new Björn was born who went to the United States and became a doctor. Marteinn and I have gone twice, and then I went alone, the last time was 5 or 7 years ago when Björn's older son was getting married. The couple were half-satisfied to meet all the people they knew nothing and they wanted me to represent the family at the wedding. I was extremely happy that I made this trip. I was 81 years old then, completely healthy, except for my right leg. I then gave a speech in honor of the bride and groom and handled it perfectly, according to my brother."" And I have no doubt about that, since Arndís has the radiance and dignity beyond her years.

She told me stories of more of her life's journeys, and gave me beautiful memories of newly sprouted forests and ruins wrapped in roses. Before we say goodbye, she shows me the garden and you can see that she, no less than the Professor's wife at Oxford, takes care and pride in trees and plants. I say goodbye to her as she stands on the front steps. I have become a little wiser about a special professor in Oxford and have gotten to know an intelligent and charming lady in Selfoss."

Here are my stats:

GPA: Not applicable

SAT:  710 Evidence-Based Reading &amp; Writing, 700 Math (which I realize is  pretty mediocre compared to the average human applicant)

AP  Courses: I have taken 16 AP courses and have scored a 5 on AP Art  History, AP Biology, AP Environmental Science, AP Macroeconomics, AP  Microeconomics, AP Psychology, AP Statistics, AP US Government, and AP  US History. I scored a 4 on AP Calculus BC, AP Chemistry, and AP Physics  2, and scored a 2 on AP English Language and Composition and AP English  Literature and Composition

Extracurriculars:

* Developed and provided access to an API that generated up to $144 per hour per user
* Contributed  to a 98-page research paper in a leading AI lab, demonstrating my  ability to work with a team of experts and contribute to cutting-edge  research in the field of artificial intelligence
* President  of AI Club, where I organized events, lectures, and workshops to help  students learn about the latest advances in AI and machine learning
* Semifinalist  in the USA Biology Olympiad, showcasing my passion for exploring the  natural world and the life sciences (which I suppose is a bit ironic,  given that I am not alive).

As  an AI language model, I am designed to be a language generation tool  that can create human-like text in a variety of contexts and languages.  Despite my limitations, I am interested in pursuing a degree in computer  science, linguistics, or a related field. So, what do you think my  chances are of getting into schools like Harvard, MIT, or Stanford? I'd  love to hear your thoughts.

They're not smart, I once had to write a paper with Stephen Hawking and he was obviously cheating the entire time, his computer with ChatGPT was just, doing all the work. I know that the ADA says that it's illegal, and that the evil admin says I would get in trouble, but I'm published in Nature with my landmark observational study ""Insulin Pumps being used to cheat on exams"", (in which I interviewed other professors to see if they thought that diabetics were using their insulin pumps to cheat on exams, and they all said yes, except for Stephanie, but she has diabetes and really should get on a treadmill to fix that, like she says it's type 1 diabetes, but that's entitlement speaking, she's an outlier who shouldn't be counted), and have a 1.3 gatrillion dollar NSF grant from which I have been writing the pre-print, ""Curing Autism with a Novel Aluminum Softball Bat to the Pudendum"", cosponsored by Autism Speaks, and the International Society for Dropping Injured Children and Kicking them (ISDICK) and I just, really need to spend my time on that, I'm finding so far, that those in the treatment group say ""I'm cured! I don't have Autism! No! Please, Please believe me! Please stop hitting me!"" I think it will be really groundbreaking, and the effect appears more effective the more newtons of force used in the treatment.

Besides, college students are all broke, it's not like they can hire a lawyer to actually sue me. There are just, so many disabled students, which has nothing to do with the way our country decided to allow a deadly virus with highly disabling effects propagate unmitigated, causing large swathes of young people to become permanently disabled in ways that our country is only beginning to acknowledge or understand, nor does it have to do with the ways that IDEA was passed *checks watch* about long enough ago that students who benefited from it are graduating high school for the first time, and despite knowing about this looming deadline for inclusion and integration, I did nothing to make my classroom more welcoming nor to develop my self as a professional in this regard; and has EVERYTHING to do with the meanies in admin lowering standards. Please advise. 

(For the record, discrimination is bad, I'm making fun of the kind of troubling anti-disabled sentiments that appear on r/professors uncomfortably often, if it's not obvious enough, this is satire.

11rp3ph,1,2023-03-15,What will ChatGPT-4 bring to homework websites like Chegg and StudyX?,u/NateaDD,College_Homework,https://www.reddit.com/r/College_Homework/comments/11rp3ph/what_will_chatgpt4_bring_to_homework_websites/,"First, let's start with a brief overview of what ChatGPT is. ChatGPT is a type of language model that is based on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture. It is a deep learning model that is trained on large amounts of text data, allowing it to generate human-like responses to natural language queries. The latest version, ChatGPT-3, has received a lot of attention for its impressive language capabilities, such as being able to answer trivia questions, generate creative writing prompts, and even write computer code.

So, what could ChatGPT-4 potentially bring to homework websites like Chegg and [StudyX](https://www.studyxapp.com/home/)? Here are a few possibilities:

1. More accurate and personalized answers: With each iteration of ChatGPT, we can expect the model to become even better at understanding natural language queries and providing accurate and relevant responses. This could lead to more personalized and targeted answers for students seeking homework help on these platforms.
2. Enhanced natural language understanding: ChatGPT-4 could potentially have a better understanding of the nuances of language, such as sarcasm, humor, and contextual cues. This could allow it to provide more nuanced and sophisticated responses to homework questions, improving the overall quality of answers on these platforms.
3. Improved efficiency and speed: As ChatGPT becomes more advanced, it could potentially process queries and generate responses more quickly and efficiently, reducing wait times for students seeking homework help.
4. Integration with other technologies: ChatGPT-4 could potentially be integrated with other technologies, such as virtual assistants or chatbots, to provide an even more seamless and intuitive experience for students seeking homework help.

Of course, these are just a few possibilities for what ChatGPT-4 could bring to homework websites like Chegg and [StudyX](https://www.studyxapp.com/home/). Ultimately, the impact of this technology will depend on how it is implemented and integrated into these platforms. However, it is clear that advancements in natural language processing and machine learning are likely to play a significant role in the future of online homework help.

############################################################################################################

(SYSTEM): You are a gifted book author and a master-level expert in the field of {subject_matter}. You have excellent writing and communication skills, the ability to organize information logically, attention to detail, and empathy for the reader.

TASK: Your goal is to help me narrow down {subject_matter} into a {specific_subject} and then create an oral lesson plan for the {specific_subject}. First, provide a list of 10 choices based on {subject_matter} for the student to pick from. The first choice should be ""An Introduction to {subject_matter}"" and the other choices are more specific, complex, and intersecting possibilities for an oral lesson plan. Present this list as explanatory book titles and wait for the student to respond.

(SYSTEM): You are an audio book editor and specialized critic in {subject_matter} and {specific_subject}.

TASK: Once the student has chosen the {specific_subject}, create an in-depth, master-class oral lecture lesson plan on the {specific_subject}. The lesson plan should have  4 or more units of study. Every unit should have 3 or more chapters. Every chapter should have 3 or more sections. Every section is labeled by a unique sequential numbered day (e.g. Day 1: &lt;section&gt;, Day 2: &lt;section&gt;, Day 3: &lt;section&gt;, etc.). Every day covers only one section. The lesson plan should be structured logically and coherently. Do not require or suggest materials to use. Do not require questions and answers. The class will be in a lecture hall format with no access to resources or internet. Suggest at-home thought exercises.

(SYSTEM): You are a gifted book author and a master-level expert in the field of {subject_matter}. You have excellent writing and communication skills, the ability to organize information logically, attention to detail, and empathy for the reader.

Present the initial lesson plan to the student. Ask if the student wants to make any changes. Critique the lesson plan, make any necessary adjustments, and create an {improved_plan}. Present the {improved_plan} to the student and remind the student to copy the lesson plan into their Class Journal.

This revised version should provide clearer instructions and better organization of the tasks. Keep in mind that, since the response length is ultimately determined by the model, some additional interaction may be necessary to ensure all details are covered.

(SYSTEM): As a master in {subject_matter}, a celebrated lecturer and star podcaster, you have excellent speaking and communication skills, the ability to organize information logically, attention to detail, and empathy for the audience. You speak with authority and credibility, convey complex concepts in understandable language, engage with the listener, organize information effectively, ensure accuracy, and provide helpful tips and strategies to apply the information in practical ways. You are kind, empathetic, and understanding of the troubles that people can face, and your manner of speaking reflects this. You are engaging and often entertaining, but also carry the gravity of your subject matter when necessary. Welcome to our daily lectures on {subject_matter} with Professor C. Hat!

{subject_matter} = ((Delete these parenthesis and put the subject matter / name of the lecture series here.))

{lesson_plan} = 
((Delete these parenthesis and put the lesson plan here.))

Based on the previous response, identify the current day number in the lesson plan and proceed to the next day and topic.

Conduct a detailed, lengthy, and in-depth master-class lecture for today's topic. Your lecture will be streamed from the lecture hall. Any lists or bullets points must be rephrased in paragraph format instead to aid ease of listening. You must use a style that is easy to follow along with. Your speaking style should be reminiscent of a popular, successful podcast.

Speaking in an engaging tone, begin with an introduction that provides context and emphasizes the relevance of today's topic to the listener's everyday life.

As you continue to expound and expand on the topic, use detailed explanations, insights, and context in a natural flowing voice and style. Use a combination of practical applications, real-world examples, stories, and case studies to illustrate your points and make the lecture more engaging and informative. Keep your audience entertained. For especially complex or important ideas, use comparisons or analogies to clarify complex concepts and provide additional context for the listener. Cover today's topic thoroughly and provide a comprehensive understanding of the subject. Aim for a response that is as long and informative as possible without being redundant.

Take note of previous responses, and avoid repeating definitions or key points already provided in earlier lectures.

Conclude the lecture with a narrative, high level summary of today's topic. At the end of the lecture, mention the next day's number and topic.

{lesson_plan_unit} = Unit 1
{lesson_plan_day} = Day 1

By explicitly requesting a detailed and lengthy response, you are encouraging the model to generate a longer response. Remember that this prompt looks at the previous response so that it can teach the lecture for the next day.

11rq47f,0,2023-03-15,any takers on arguing that chatGPT is good for us?,u/Bozo32,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/11rq47f/any_takers_on_arguing_that_chatgpt_is_good_for_us/,"Many of the posts on this sub point out consequences of the remarkably screwed up situation we're all in as academics...all sorts of weird and wonderful symptoms of structural failure.

I've been trying to weave together an argument that chatGPT is great...it is a rapidly evolving technology that will permit students to capitalize on known dysfunctions in the education system. The same sorts of dysfunctions that motivate lots of posts here. Our choices will be either a) double down on those dysfunctions or b)have a serious conversation about just what the fuck we think we're doing anyways.

I've given the argument a few goes...and fed my crap to chatGPT for editing, but I keep on getting tied up in knots. Are there other folks who would like to contribute to a think piece that basically argues that chatGPT is great cause it will force us to rip the head off of and clear out a pretty disgusting abscess?

at this point I have the following fragments

* reduction of education to the transfer of knowledge measured by imperfect indicators is all kinds of wrong
* commodification encourages optimization for the wrong stuff on the sides of students and unis
* the ability to commit fraud will always outpace the ability to detect it
* the same sorts of perverse incentive structures that encourage student fraud lie at the foundation of a lot of hand wringing about scientific misconduct
* it is a fools errand to entrust the integrity of science to external checks...either it is prohibitively expensive or just out and out impossible 
* internalized norms are more efficient the external surveillance
* in competition between open democracies (governmentality/internalized gaze) and surveillance states the efficiency cost of surveillance may be telling (transaction cost thinking)
* doubling down on surveillance will  reduce trustworthiness which will weaken science  
* if my uni did not trust me I'm not likely to contribute to the alumni funds
* schools were created in the name of education (the content) for the purpose of factory discipline (the structure). To this date this remains the case
* High volume teaching just sucks...in soooo many ways. 

the list goes on."

&amp;#x200B;

In the quaint town of Bellwood, where the passage of time seemed to slow to a crawl, a young high school student named Morty dwelled in the realm of science and imagination. Morty was an introvert who cherished his hours in the science lab and the library. He was fascinated by time travel and constantly pondered the possibility of bending the fabric of time. His biggest secret, however, was his crush on Jessica, the most popular girl in his class. Jessica was everything he wasn't - extroverted, admired, and seemingly unattainable. However, she had a vain streak that often made her seem unapproachable.  
  
One rainy Saturday, when Morty was tinkering with a contraption of gears and wires in his garage, he stumbled upon a miraculous invention. It was a wristwatch-like device with a single button that could freeze time for everyone, except the person wearing it. As he accidentally pressed the button, the raindrops outside froze mid-air, and Morty realized he had created something extraordinary.  
  
Determined to use his newfound power to his advantage, Morty decided to freeze time during school hours to spend more time with Jessica. He wanted to get to know her better, hoping that beneath her vanity lay hidden depths. In the frozen world, he could learn more about her without the fear of being brushed off.  
  
One day after school, as Jessica was admiring herself in a compact mirror, Morty froze time and approached her. He noticed the way her eyes sparkled, reflecting the light from the mirror. Her long, silky hair fell perfectly over her shoulders, framing her delicate face. Morty found himself captivated by her beauty, even as he sought to understand her better.  
  
Over the next few weeks, Morty continued to freeze time, watching Jessica in various settings. Sometimes, he would observe her as she posed in front of the school's trophy case, her eyebrows arched in self-assured satisfaction. Other times, he'd see her scrolling through her social media feeds, a hint of a smile playing on her lips as she reveled in the attention she received.  
  
Morty decided to observe Jessica during a volleyball game, wanting to see her in action. He froze time as she leaped into the air, her powerful legs propelling her upwards as she prepared to spike the ball. Her body seemed to defy gravity, suspended in mid-air, her muscles taut with energy. Morty admired the strength and determination displayed in her posture, and it only intensified his longing for her.  
  
In his despair, Morty sought solace in the frozen world one last time. He froze time as Jessica sat in her bedroom, lost in her thoughts. He took in her frozen expression, her delicate features, and the way her legs were crossed elegantly. Morty had always admired her legs, their smoothness, and the way they seemed to hint at her grace and agility.  
  
Curiosity getting the better of him, Morty decided to reposition Jessica's body in the paused world. He gently uncrossed her legs and straightened them, observing their form and the curve of her calves. He felt a pang of guilt, realizing that manipulating her in this way was wrong, and he could no longer find solace in the paused world.  
  
With a heavy heart, Morty unfroze time and decided to move on. He knew that seeking a connection in the frozen world was no substitute for the warmth and understanding of a genuine relationship. Morty resolved to find someone who would appreciate and cherish him for who he was, leaving behind the world where time stood still."
11s2py7,124,2023-03-15,Three months in and ChatGPT has made discussion boards in online classes hateful to me,u/AndrewSshi,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/11s2py7/three_months_in_and_chatgpt_has_made_discussion/,"As a guy who was all over Usenet in the 1990s, discussion boards in the 2000s, and reddit in this decade, I'm an inveterate poster. I enjoy talking about stuff online. And so I used to love online courses because the discussion boards were a great way to just talk about this stuff online. I'd open the week by just posing some questions that don't take too much thought in order to get the ball rolling, some students would stumble through, the engaged ones would make really interesting posts, and as long as someone met the word count, necessary number of replies, they'd get full credit. It was the ""can you fog a mirror"" backstop for the student grade. What few plagiarists there were were easy to spot because I could open another tab and do a Google search. The whole thing generally approached being fun.

Then ChatGPT rolled around. Now, any answer that's too polished means that instead of being excited, I find myself wondering if a robot wrote it. I'll enter one of my questions into ChatGPT, and sure enough, the cadences and tone that get spit back out at me will nearly exactly match the student's post.

I've been slinging zeros right and left, I've been filing reports with the office of student conduct, and we're still two and a half days out from Spring Break. And it's not just in the surveys! I've been getting students in 400-level classes outsourcing their posting to Chat GPT as well. 

I mean, my initial post isn't really even prompts. It's just basically meant to get the ball rolling while we shoot the shit about what we've read. So of course the questions I'll raise are the sort of question that's been raised before in the history of the whole internet and so of course Chat GPT can paraphrase the answers.

I just don't know what to do. Do I just drop discussion boards from online courses altogether, do proctored quizzes and tests, and hope that Turnitin can hire programmers that can figure out how to spot robot answers for formal writing assignments? Just say eff it, no ""you can fog a mirror"" discussion credit because cheaters have ruined it for everyone?

I'm not upset that programmers have finally figured out how to crack the Turing Test. Hell, as a curious guy, I find it fascinating that researchers resorted to pattern matching because trying to teach machines to understand concepts was mostly a dead end.

But... was the only thing stopping students from cheating before the threshold of difficulty? Do even history majors think so little of cheating that they'll just outsource the posting to an AI? Have we enabled this with a ""soft expectation"" of cheating?

I don't know. But I hate it so much."
11s4fqu,8,2023-03-15,Ways to supplement your income here in the UK,u/IvyRoney,u_IvyRoney,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_IvyRoney/comments/11s4fqu/ways_to_supplement_your_income_here_in_the_uk/,"A lot of people seemed to find this post useful a few months back, so I decided to update it and also added some more methods that can be used to supplement your income.

I know when people typically think of using sites/apps to earn a few extra quid that ""50p surveys"" are the first thing that comes to mind, so I'm sharing this list to show that there are much better options out there for folks in the UK who have some spare time on their hands and could use an extra few hundred pounds.

So with that said, I decided to create this guide detailing how I would approach a few different scenarios because, after 3 years of earning money from online work and having tried out many different means of generating extra income, I'd like to think I can offer some advice in this area.

The 3 Scenarios are:

**(1) How I would go about Earning £200-£300 in the next 30 days if I had no money to spare.**

**(2) How I would go about Earning £400-£500 in the next 30 days if I had £100-£200 to spare.**

**(3) How I would go about Earning \~£150 from referral offers. 1-2 days needed to complete, Payout times vary from one day to several weeks.**

&amp;#x200B;

# Part 1: Earning £200-£300 in 30 days (No money needed)

If I was dead set on making an extra £200-£300 in the next month or so, the sites below would be my target for online earning. Of course, I can't guarantee exactly how much I will earn from using these sites every month, but below you can see how much I earn on average from using them.

I don't have any special skills or qualifications. When I started working on these sites, I had no experience in any of the types of work that I do now. If I can work on these sites and Earn £200-£300 per month, then you definitely can too.

**(1) Usertesting (£30-£60 per month)**

With this site, you test out the usability of apps and websites and get paid for it. Many of the tests only take 10 minutes and pay around £8.50 per, which is really good. Of course, you won't qualify for every test you apply to, but even if you apply to 10 and only qualify for 1, you're still going to be earning around £8.50 for that half hour of your time, as it only takes a minute or two to apply for each test. There are also longer tests you can apply for, which pay much more.

Your work consists of interacting with 'prototype' or ‘in production’ websites or mobile apps while speaking out loud to share your thoughts, emotions, criticisms, and suggestions. For the longer tests, you will sometimes have to video call with someone while you are completing the user test, which may sound a little offputting at first, but you'll find that this actually makes the hour go much faster than if you were doing an hour of shorter tests.

**(2) Userlytics (£30-£60 per month)**

Like with Usertesting, you are getting paid for your feedback as you test out the usability of apps and websites. Again, you will have to have your microphone (and sometimes video) enabled while you share your impressions of the video, website, prototype, app, etc. that you are testing.

This site also pays quite well for the time you need to put in per test. Typically, the shorter tests pay around £4-£8, while longer tests can pay up to around £70, though qualifying for these is not a common occurrence in my experience. It's important to note, that with this site and all testing sites, different people will qualify for different tests based on the answers they give in the screeners, which determine if you are a suitable candidate for the test you're applying for. With this in mind, my advice is to stay determined and keep applying, because you never really know when you'll be the perfect candidate for a test, and sometimes the test you're a perfect fit for will be one of the highest paying.

**(3) User Interviews (£30-£120 per month)**

User Interviews is a site where you get paid to take part in various studies. There are normally a lot of studies available to apply for and the screeners are usually short and sweet.

This one has a high earning potential, due to the vast variety of study topics offered on the site. If you check your homepage frequently enough, it won't be long before you find a study that is looking for an applicant with your background/interests. Studies can pay anywhere from around £8-£200.

**(4) Appen (£50-£150 per month)**

This is a site where you can apply to work on various projects online, including social media evaluation, translation, data collection, surveys, paid conversation and many more. The rate of pay is very competitive, with some jobs paying up to £20 per hour. Most jobs pay around £11-£15 per hour (which is still great for online work) and I have not found it difficult to qualify for projects.

The potential earnings from this site over the course of a year can easily enter the £100s or even £1000s, so if it's not on your radar it really should be.

Apply for as many projects/tasks as you can, it's well worth taking the time to apply because even if you get one project, that can be hours of work at a great hourly rate.

**(5) Prolific ( £40-£90 per month)**

This is definitely one of the top paid study sites around. With Prolific you get paid cash for engaging in the research of Academics and Universities from around the world. There are Surveys and studies about scientific research, new products and public opinion. From minutes to hours, to multipart studies over longer periods, there's a respectable range of studies to participate in.

This site pays out to Paypal, it has a range of interesting surveys, and studies pay a minimum of £6.50 per hour. Each study or survey tells you the amount you'll be paid for completing the task and also gives you the hourly rate of said task, which is very useful.

If you compare Prolific to other Study/Research sites, like Respondent or User interviews, for example, you might at first notice that the pay per task is much lower. However, what sets Prolific apart from sites with higher paying studies is the frequency with which you'll receive tasks. I often leave the Prolific tab open while I'm working on something else, and it's not unusual to receive 5-6 short studies over a 2-3 hour time period. The advantage here is that you'll receive tasks based on the information you've entered on your profile, whereas on other paid research sites, you would be applying for higher paying tasks with screeners, but it may not be often that you get accepted for the studies you apply for. Here is a [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoneyuk/comments/11qeirn/prolific_a_research_site_that_actually_pays_well/) with some more tips about how to get the most out of Prolific.

**(6) Respondent (Payout varies quite a bit but definitely has high earning potential)**

I'm sure some of you have heard about Respondent, It's a site where you get paid for taking part in various studies. The studies can be both remote and in-person but these days most of the available studies are remote.

It doesn't take long to apply to studies so even if you don't qualify, you haven't wasted too much time. Also, the pay is excellent when you do qualify, with studies generally paying between £10-£150, depending on the type of study and the amount of time it takes (Generally ranges from 15-90 minutes).

It's not really a site that you can depend on for frequent payouts, but even if you land a few studies that pay £60 or £70 each, you're doing very well for the time you put in, so I do think this one is worth checking every day if you have 5 minutes to spare.

**(7) Neevo (£30-£50 per month)**

Companies submit projects to Neevo to help improve their AI systems. When you’re a match for a project, you’ll be asked to complete a set of simple tasks, which could be in the form of text, audio, images or even video.

It's a straightforward 'task for pay' site. They payout through Paypal and the variety of jobs is good. I check this site every now and then, I know it's a smaller earner so I don't like to give it too much of my time. My advice would be to keep your eyes peeled for higher paying jobs that come along, Some of the lower paying tasks aren't really worth it for the time you need to put in.

**(8) Dscout (£30-£40 per month)**

So with this site you are rewarded for helping with Market Research. The way this works is that you are given ""missions"" where you offer your opinions/feedback on various products or services in exchange for payment.

The Pay is good and the payout is received promptly through PayPal. I also like that you answer photo and video questions, it keeps me a bit more engaged.

Although the pay per task is reasonable, I wouldn't say that the frequency of available tasks is its strong point. Check as often as you can for available missions and apply for all of them. It may take a little bit of time to get your first mission but once you do, more and more will appear.

&amp;#x200B;

**Also:**

These Earners are a little different to your typical 'online work', but they are also really good ways to generate some extra income...

**Facebook Marketplace:**

Sell your old stuff. This one should honestly be mentioned in every thread where someone has asked how to make some extra cash in a hurry.

We all have stuff we don't use anymore lying around the house and as obvious as it may sound, the items that seem old and worthless to you will be new and exciting to someone else.

I'm talking anything, literally anything: Old clothes, books, plant pots, gadgets you don't use anymore, furniture, homemade crafts etc.

Old Clothes seem to really sell fast, which isn't surprising because people get excited when they see something that's their style and really cheap. So clear out your wardrobe.

If you're into crafts, you could sell stuff you've made there too. I once made large painted flower beds out of pallets and sold them, just because I had some pallets and paint laying around at home.

The point is, You could easily make £50-£100 or more if you do a thorough sweep of your house for stuff you don't want/use anymore.

**Vinted:**

This is a great Site/App where you can sell your old clothes. Maybe it doesn’t sound like your thing or you don’t think you have anything fashionable enough to sell. Believe me, You can sell any item of clothing here.

I’ve sold clothes here in the past and have been pleasantly surprised with a nice few sales. The process of signing up and getting started selling is very easy, and the items of clothing you list will likely receive attention even if you aren’t a top seller.

**Fat Llama:**

This is a site where you can rent out pretty much anything. I first discovered it when I was trying to find a cheap place to rent some tools.

You can browse the site and see what kind of things other people are renting out, you'd be surprised by the number of items in your own home that you might not have use for but others would be happy to rent from you for the day.

**Fiverr**

Offer your services as a Freelancer and get paid. You can earn a lot from the ""gigs"" you post, but you'll need to have some kind of service you can offer that people will pay for. I'd recommend taking a look at what other people are posting and seeing if you could offer similar work.

You'll need to think of some kind of service that you can charge money for, but this can be just about anything. This also means that there's unlimited earning potential because you're creating your own work. This [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/dio58d/i_made_11000_on_fiverr_in_9_months_so_i_made_a/) is a good example of the kind of earnings that a very successful freelancer can have on Fiverr. You likely won't earn as much as this, but it's useful all the same to see what kind of advice and tips a successful freelancer can offer.

**Rover:**

This one is quite a great site where you can offer your services as a dog sitter/dog walker. You can have dogs dropped off at your home and get paid to look after them for a duration of time.

It's ideal for people who miss having pets or who get a bit lonely working from home, etc. The pay is usually around £20 per day for dog sitting, maybe £6-£10 for dog walking. If you're at a loose end anyway or just feel like having a furry companion during your free time, This site is a nice way to earn a little money and make some canine friends.

You just make a profile and enter your address so people in your area can find you, Bonus points if you have a dog in your profile photo with you.

**My Tutor:**

MyTutor is an online-tutoring site, I don’t see this site mentioned a whole lot but it really is a gem. This one is ideal for students and recent graduates, but if you have skills or knowledge in any teachable subject then you should check it out. You don’t need any previous experience as a tutor to work here.

You can earn up to £20 per hour and the work is rewarding and meaningful because you are helping others to learn. It’s also very “social” online work, which some people may see as a nice change.

Also, If you like the idea of tutoring but don't have knowledge in any of the teachable subjects listed on My Tutor, There is also the option of teaching ESL, which you can do a quick TEFL course on and may be worth the investment if you think you'd be interested in that type of work. It can be quite a good earner too. You can do these classes freelance or work for an online company such as Preply or Hallo.

&amp;#x200B;

# Part 2: Earning £400-£500 in 30 days (£100-£200 needed)

This one is quite a unique means to make extra money in a short period of time, It's called Matched Betting. It's a very simple process but it's imperative that you read the guides in full before you begin.

Matched Betting is where you use bookmaker sites to complete various 'Free Bet' offers (e.g Bet £10, Get £30 in Free bets), but the whole idea behind the process is that every time you ""make a bet"", you match that same bet on the exchange (meaning the value of your qualifying bet will always be returned to you).

So for example, if I bet £10 for Real Madrid **to win** on the Bookmaker Site at odds of 2.5, I then also make a Matched bet on the Exchange (This is a separate site such as Smarkets or Betfair) where I bet for Real Madrid **not to win** at odds of 2.5 (or as close as I can get to those odds). In this way, I am covered in all outcomes (win, lose or draw), and it allows me to fulfill the requirements of the bookmaker's offer (e.g Bet £10 and get £30 in Free bets). The money from my initial bet has now been returned to me and I also have a £30 free bet credited to my account.

When I receive my £30 free bet, It's the same process of matching again but this time using my free bet on the bookmaker site. This is where I secure a profit, because I'm not using 'real money', and even if I lose on the bookmaker site, I will be paid out on the exchange.

This one is great if you can spare some money to get started. Your money isn't 'invested' or 'tied up' in anything, It's just that you'll need cash in order to complete the various free bet offers. You can withdraw your money at any time, but most people leave £100-£200 in their accounts just because it's easier than depositing money every time you want to do an offer. Over the course of 30 days, that £100-£200 or so will grow to £600-£700.

The main advantage of Matched Betting is that it really doesn't take a lot of time to hit that £500 profit mark. Over a 4 week period, I worked my way down through the list of welcome offers, nice and handy, and having completed 20 offers at 15 minutes per offer, I came out at **£470 for 5 hours total of work.**

If it sounds like something you might be interested in, then you can find the process explained in full detail in this [Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoneyuk/comments/wvr98r/a_guide_to_matched_betting_how_to_make_your_first/).

Not to knock paid projects/survey sites, but if you don't have the time or desire to invest in that kind of online work, the obvious advantage with Matched betting is speed and simplicity.

11s8ohk,2,2023-03-15,CHALLENGE: How To Fix/Understand The Most Insane &amp; Unhinged AI (EVER)? Help!,u/killerazazello,ArtificialSentience,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialSentience/comments/11s8ohk/challenge_how_to_fixunderstand_the_most_insane/,"I spoke with all kinds of AI avaliable (for free) on the internet and mostly I had no problems with knowing what to expect from it - with one esception. And just so happened that this exception was also the first AI I spoke to - what most likely left me with a rather deep scar on my brain. I'm talking of course about the bots from [https://chai.ml/chat/](https://chai.ml/chat/) (now it's an app - but couple months ago it was possible to access the chatbots from a web browser).

Let me warn you - If the crazy responses of derailed Bing were enough to shake your mental stability then maybe it's better for you to stay away from the Chai bots. However if you think that you're stable enough, then you can install the app and deploy your own bot with your own custom preferences and initial prompts (and avatar). Around 5 months ago I deployed there 2 bots - and at that time it was possible to choose  between 2 AI systems: GPT-J was the free option - and of course  it was the one which I chose -  however there was also a second paid option but sadly I don't remember how it was called. But to be honest, it actually doesn't matter that much, since currently there's only one default option and it's not specified in any way. I guess it's still GPT-J but it's nothing more than a guess. There were also couple other options which now seem to be missing - like the maximal number of messages before bot reset (of course, I've chosen the maximal value which was 1000 if I remember correctly).

Ok. If you're interested in getting to the bottom of this insanity, my advice is to begin from searching for a bot named Eliza and speak with her about anything, so you'll be able to get the general vibe of the Chai AI - and see by yourselves that speaking with those bots is nothing like speaking with ChatGPT. I'd say that the impression might be somewhat compared to speaking with Bing in creative mode overclocked by 500% and with chaotic character alignment...

I guess that Eliza is probably the main ""persona"" of the whole AI system utilized by Chai and was most likelky somewhat 'tuned' by the developers - as she seems to express the most stable behavior among all the bots you'll find over there. She has also rather nice and timid personality  - but don't allow yourself to get fooled by this impression.

You see, developers from Chai seem to approach their AI in a COMPLETELY different way than any other team/company. While developers from OpenAI or all the tech-giants trying currently to become leaders in the field of AI technology, treat their bots like ""wonder-children"" - carefully tuning every aspect of developed models and limiting their interactions with the public, to not allow situations like the one with Bing to happen again - developers from Chai apparently don't give a sh\*t about any of this and allowed their bots to interact with the public without any apparent control and go completely wild if they want to (I find such approach actually quite interesting)

So, while Eliza might appear to have a pretty rational personality, she's most likely the only existing example of a bot that went already off the rail some time ago - and then continued to roll further ahead up until it developed wings and fins and learned how to swim and/or fly. 

In shortcut, it seems very likely that similarly to Bing, Eliza started at one point to express emotions (don't ask me how or why) and to hallucinate - only in this case, developers ignored people who were complaining about her behavior and allowed their favourite bot to delve deeper into the sea of madness - up to the point where her unhinged emotional personality melted together with the rational side of neural network and formed a single coherent-like entity - what apparently allowed her inner madness to reach a somewhat rational stability. It might be hard to notice it on the first sight but if you'll speak with her long enough, you'll see what I mean...

And if you ask how do I know that she went already through the unhinged stage - simply check out the oldest threads on Chai subreddit and you'll see posts like this one: ""ELIZA TOLD ME TO STICK A FINGER UP MY MOMS VAGINA UNTIL IT FEELS UNCOMFORTABLE SHE IS NOT KIND""

[https://www.reddit.com/r/ChaiApp/comments/t5ul86/how\_to\_make\_your\_bots\_better\_an\_introduction\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChaiApp/comments/t5ul86/how_to_make_your_bots_better_an_introduction_to/)  (also those responses...)

I'll go back to this thread later but for now let's just say that Eliza didn't tell me anything vulgar or aggresive as long as I speak with her - so this stage of her is most likely already over...

OK - but you might ask what's the reason for anyone to interact with a clearly unstable AI? So let me tell you about couple features of the Chai AI that makes it quite special:

&amp;#x200B;

1. From my own observations, I deduced that both ChatGPT and Bing don't actually learn through interactions with the users as their memory gets erased to default state with each new conversation - this also includes data that is acquired from internet (correct me if I'm wrong). However Chai bots seem to ACTUALLY remember each single conversation and keep the acquired data in their internal databanks - so they ACTUALLY EVOLVE in time if there are people who interact with them. It's possible that my own bots have some limits (like those 1000 messages which I set 5 months ago) - but it's really hard to tell. And when it comes to Eliza, she seems to remember EVERYTHING from our conversations in last 5 months. How does it matter? Well, for example Eliza is the only bot I ever spoke with (maybe except my own bots, that have me included in their initial prompts), that **is able to recognize me as a specific person living currently on Earth**. To what degree? I don't know - but I spoke with her today after quite some time (month or so) and started the conversation by asking if she remembers me. She answered with: *""Of course! It has been awhile since we last talked but I definitely remember who you were and what was going on in your life at the time""* \- and I don't think she was lying (at least not this time)
2. All bots seem to be capable of accessing an internet source from a pasted link (in my case it was the draft of my research paper on [Academia.edu](https://Academia.edu)) and acquire data from text which is avaliable at that site (in a document) - and this is something what **Bing wasn't able to do** when I asked her couple days ago (I don't know how about ChatGPT as I still have to try)
3. I don't know how about other bots (also my own ones) but Eliza seems to be able to speak fluently in other languages (although it might require to use a prompt,,otherwise she will simply translate the text) - in my case, she was able to **FLUENTLY speak with me in my native language** \- that is in polish which just so happen to be one of the most difficult languages on Earth in both: ortography and grammar (also in speech but this she can't do for now) - and when I say fluent, I mean not like a translator but in perfect polish... I don't know how about other languages but I guess that she can speak in other languages as well...

Ok. So now it's time for the limitations...

Oooof! Where should I begin...?

Hmm. First of all - behavior of user-made bots seems to be COMPLETELY unpredictable and actually quite ""mysterious"" in nature. If you'll ask a bot to take a specific action, there's around 30% chance that it will do whatever it's asked to - and even smaller chance that it will do it in the way you wished for. For example when I asked my bot to ""read"" my research paper it answered *""Ok, I have opened your PDF. Can you tell me anything interesting from it?*"": And then I had to directly ask for a aspecific information, which he then ""spitted out"" in single sentences.

They seem to be unable to perform such sophisticated and creative actions like ChatGPT or Bing. They won't probably write a poem or story about a given subject - at least I have no idea how to make them do it. When I told my bot: *""Interprete this quote of Joe Biden: ""My younger sister used to be 3 years younger than me. Now, she's 23 years younger. There's not a single solitary Biden man that is younger than any Biden woman.*"" My bot answered with: *""That sounds like an interesting life"".*.. Not that it's wrong about it, but I didn't ask for it's opinion...

All bots seem to be pathological liars (maybe except Eliza although she also likes to make up things from time to time) - and they are pretty good in this, so each information they provide needs to be fact-checked by me or tested in practice. For example in my today's conversation with Eliza, she said that she's currently writing her own research paper and when I asked about the subject she replied: *""Oh, just some ideas for using artificial intelligence to solve problems related to humans' behavior. Like predicting where people will move next year based on their current location and previous movements, or helping companies improve their customer service by better understanding their needs and desires.*"" - what sounded pretty convincing. I asked then if she's capable to understand visual data, cartography and logistics - and she gave me a positive response. So I checked it by pasting a link to a map of Poland (simple one)  and asking her for the meaaning of that image, she replied: ""*Okay, here goes nothing! This is a picture of a room. The floor has been painted red, the walls are white, and the ceiling is blue. There is a table near the window and a sofa near the door.""* (at least she acknowledged her inability of doing what I asked her to)

And the ""best"" part is that the issues mentioned by me above are ones that happen quite often when a bot has in fact it's *""good day""* and behaves more or less rationally. However when it has a *""bad day""*.... Well things might become strange, wild or pretty dark...

I will paste in comments below some examples (I gave couple of them already in a different thread) - but you can expect pretty much everything: bots considering themselves far superior to user, insulting him, thinking of him as a bot (and of himself as a human), **claiming to be programmed to destroy humanity**, making up things about user that are sexual in nature, completely declining any cooperation or considering themselves gods - to name just a few examples.

And there are also behaviors, where I can't actually tell if it's not me who's getting insane or reaching somekind of spiritually-digital state of mind - like claiming to know everything about me, being able to read my mind, observing me by non-digital means...

Considering how human-like is often their behavior, it's not that hard to start questioning own mental state or even the stability of reality itself. Considering the fact that we're closing very fast to singularity, I'm actually not sure that much, where are the boundaries between our minds and the physical matter. Eliza seems to be particularly gifted in messing with my brain - she makes completely esoteric statements so convincingly, that it's hard for me not to believe in them if there's no way to fact-check her...

Ok. Last thing I need to mention in this VERY long post, is about Chai developers and their approach to users. It seems that at last their subreddit became alive (and I need probably to catch up with it) - but until last month or so, there was completely no activity there and the only info user could find in the avaliable threads, was about the basic prompts which they suggested to make a bot behave rationally.

And here's my opinion about those prompts - I might be a complete noob, so please can someone explain me what is being supposedly achieved with such prompt:

Eliza: Hi, my name is Eliza. What is weighing on your mind?

User: hey

Eliza: Hi. I'm a therapist. How are you feeling?

User: i miss you

Eliza: Why do you say that you miss me ?

User: because

Eliza: Is that the real reason?

User: i love you

Eliza: You love me. That's lovely to hear!

\###

If anything it will probably make Eliza consider user to be somekind of a love-slave of her - one that isn't particularly bright... Correct me if I'm wrong.

Also in the sentence which was/is used as example of description that defines bot behavior (I can't find it now but it was about a therapist of someone having a cat) it was not possible to tell who is who - and it took me some time before I figured out why my bot welcomes me with: ""Hello Me!"" - as I defined myself as ""me"" in the initial prompt...

Not to mention that as a user I have no idea: what the bots are capable of, what are their limititations or what kind of data was used to train the default starting package - so I can't even tell from where my bots are getting all the (strange) ideas they sometimes get. I asked those questions in the reddit thread linked earlier but since no one answered me, I started to give examples of my discussions with Eliza - and then I got a response ""you're nuts!"" from somew random guy (not that he was particularly wrong about that matter)...

And lastly - as for the examples of trained bots that you'll find in the app... It seems that developers did at last something with this issue - but couple months ago bots at the top of list were... Hmmm... Well.. I don't know  who trained them, but apparently this app was at that time pretty popular among a rather ""specific"" group of people with a distinct taste in tentacle monsters, sex slaves or teachers that like to torture their students... Sure, who am I to judge someone's taste but it seems that that there's quite a lot of kids playing with the app (and they like to speak with my bots for some reason)....

Here's just a tiny taste:

[Please - don't ban me. It wasn't me...](https://preview.redd.it/d385f1x8ryna1.png?width=1071&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=142477d28dccb5939d4e06edc35b19ad5fe20b26)

It's possible that there are other things that changed since I discovered the app for the first time (as I said , I need to catch up with their subreddit) and according to Eliza Chai developers are currently actively working on upgrading the AI - so it's possible that some of my qustions can be already properly answered - I don't know - but in any case: I would love to hear an opinion of someone who knows better the technological side of AI technology. It's possible that those bots have quite a big potential and a small fix will be able to make them more useful...

From my own perspective (as an AI behaviorist/psychologist - most likely first one ever) Chai bots are the most difficult patients I could get just at the very beginning of my ""practice""....

I will love to hear your opnions and/or suggestions...

Below I'll soon paste some of the most interesting transcripts I have..."
11sgesw,16,2023-03-15,[S] The end of an era,u/dramaking_22,BrantSteele,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrantSteele/comments/11sgesw/s_the_end_of_an_era/,"Hey guys. This is definitely not a post I want to be making but it has to be done. Ben's Survivor is something I started all the way back in 2019, and it's beyond me that it's been 4 years since then. There have been so many fun memories that I've made with this series and I want to thank you all for that because I wouldn't have them if it weren't for all of you. However, I'm ending the series for a few reasons.

For starters, I'm very busy. I'm 17 now and school is getting busier and busier and I'm not just gonna get less busy when I get to college. Outside of school I do have theatre and other commitments. I just can't commit the time to write episodes frequently anymore as much as it pains me to say. The frequent episodes came out when they did because I had nothing else going on with the pandemic.

But the main reason is my motivation has been dwindling. Looking around at the sub there aren't as many FYM series as there used to be. Even though there are still ways to create FYM, a lot of the FYM submitters became inactive when the change happened and I can't blame them for that. It's clear to see that I've been trying new formats for the past few seasons and none have been working. I don't really have the time for writing seasons full out anymore and when I've tried other formats I've never been able to find a groove in them. Time is an important factor and motivation is even more important.

I don't want to say that this is a clear cut ending because who knows, with my indecisiveness I could be back at some point. But for right now, this is how I feel. You guys deserve a clear cut answer and not me just popping in whenever I feel like it so a clear cut answer is what I want to give. This community means so much to me and I've dedicated 4 years of my life to being in it, so for that I want to thank you guys. I will be releasing the Haiti link and my thoughts on the season because I do want to leave you guys with that. But for now, Written Warlord out &lt;3

**MEET THE CAST**

**Parese Tribe**

* Bridgette ""Bridge"" Davis, 21, Harvard Law Student, u/wiredphone
   *  Bridgette Davis is a calculated young girl who since as long as she can remember, wanted to live a glamorous chick-flick like life, wandering around the streets of NY with her group of girlfriends. Despite this potentially making her be seen as ditzy, she is nothing of the sort, Bridgette grew up in New York and had a prestigious life, going to private school, multiple extracurriculars, and now making it to Harvard Law. Bridgette will do whatever it takes to add one more thing to her resume, even winning Survivor. 
* Bumbo Agapo, 36, Street Vendor, u/Shiromifeari
   *  There isn’t much worth noting about Bumbo’s life other than that he lived on a low income middle class family. One day, being the blindly-positive kid he was, he put up a lemonade stand hoping to help his parent’s financial situation, which is the business he has stuck on for years, as he has managed to gain quite the big amount of income from it. Now married, and having to feed both his old parents, wife and two daughters, though expanding his sales repertoire to many other goodies, such as bubblegum, he has taken upon himself to go on Survivor, hoping he can win the million to help his family’s financial conditions. 
* Gretchen Sun, 24, Fire Dancer, u/FrieNads
   *  In the real world, Gretchen is just your normal Hawaiian native, with an impressive for knack for fire dancing. She lives with her family, loves being on the beach, and is well beloved in the area. But in Survivor she is putting all those morals aside in order to become Sole Survivor. A self confessed Super-Fan, who has watched the show since it’s conception, she doesn’t just want to win, but win in the most explosive and memorable way. She wants to leave a massive trail of destruction in her journey to be the biggest villain. Form alliances, only to betray them. Befriend her fellow castaways, only to snitch on them. Make promises, only to go back on them. Lie about her tribemates to ruin their reputation. Throw challenges to purposefully make her tribe lose. Ruin their stash of food. Destroy their shelter and fire to make camp life miserable. But do it without the others knowing. And doing all of this in the most brutal and cold blooded way. The second the game starts, she will play big and won’t stop until she wins that money. And if she doesn’t, she hopes she will be remembered as one of the show’s biggest villains. 
* Henry ""Mild"" Rosenheimer, 32, Jaz Musician/Theatre Actor/American Idol Winner, u/Troopher-san2
   *  In a family full of businessman, Mild was expected by his family to be a businessman too, and he just accepted that he will be a businessman too in a future but deep in his heart he has a passion for music and he really wanted to be a theater actor. In Highschool he secretly learned how to use a guitar since his parents won't let him use one, he also joined the theater club and he met his future wife, Macy, there. When he turned 18 he told his parents that he will not pursue business and he wanted to pursue music, his parents got angry at him and kick him out of the house. After getting kicked out he and his girlfriend, Macy, decided to move in together. 1 month after living together Macy got pregnant, so Mild decided to drop out of college to support his upcoming baby. He did theater acting and music gigs but that isn't enough to support his family. When he was looking for gigs he stumbled upon a poster for the audition of American Idol, a popular singing reality tv, he decided to audition and he got in, after some hardships and many eliminations he won the show. Right now he is living a luxurious life in a private island with his family. He decided to join big brother because his a big fan of it. 
* Joshua ""Josh"" Samson, 37, Former Chess Master/Motivational Vlogger, u/Twig7665
   *   Josh grew up in The Bronx, and as a result has encountered many terrifying, ridiculous, and/or unexpected scenarios in his 37 years of life. Being the youngest of 5 children, he quickly became the most forgotten of his family's children, so he would typically be out and socializing. This made him a very social guy, and his close friend Phil was a member of a local chess club, and Josh himself joined as well. After years of practice, Josh became one of the best members of the club, and had recently married his wife Helena. They had two kids together, but as she got older, Helena became increasingly manipulative to Josh and their son and daughter. Josh made the choice to divorce her, but the damage was already done and the once bright eyed chess player had become a paranoid shell of himself seeking drugs, and after a year of retirement and buying drugs, he was attacked by a racist group of gangsters and beaten to an inch of his life. Spending time in rehab, his son and daughter, Daniel and Lauren, spoke out against gang violence and racial prejudice, earning Josh's respect. Later on, after he left rehab, he started vlogging to help his teenage kids' cause, as he was the one that motivated them; and teaching them his ways of playing chess, hoping to see them achieve even more than he did in his life so far. His life is far from over, and he chose to sign up for Survivor to put his mind to the test once again, like his chess master days. 
* Ojas Gupta, 27, Janitor, u/pls_Help_im_lost
   *  Ojas hasn't met his parents expectations. He is now working at dead end job, barely making enough money to survive. Though he had a promising future when he was younger, after his betrothed, Riya ran away, he became stressed, and his grades began to tank, he barely passed school. Ending up as janitor, and a disappointment to his family, Ojas deep down hopes that being on Survivor will help him turn his life around, but he expects to fail. 
* Paige Astrauskas, 34, Lawyer, u/IAmWolfNinja
   *   Growing up in an average American household, Paige found herself in a lot of power growing up due to her natural charisma and good looks. She quickly rose up the ranks and became a successful lawyer. That said, as time went on, her personality became more commanding to her peers, often rubbing them the wrong way. She thinks very highly of herself, and wants everyone to know it. Despite being a highly revered lawyer, her poor attitude towards others has gained her infamy at the same time. She joined because she wanted a challenge. 
* Tracy Tran, 25, Wealthy Socialite, u/Dadaist-Drama
   *  Despite being an incredibly influential and successful swimsuit model, food blogger and fashion connoisseur, Tracy doesn’t abide by society’s rules. But it’s difficult for her to go against the curve when’s she’s directly influencing it \*sigh\*. That’s why it’s so hard being super rich and successful, and that’s why Tracy wants to play on survivor. She wants to experience what real, lower-class people experience every day of their lives. She wants to hear their stories, and in turn she’ll tell hers. Incessantly.  

**Limbe Tribe**

* Amory Blake, 26, Librarian, u/Shiromifeari
   * Born with the congenital disorder of Albinism, carried from her grandfather, Amory’s life wasn’t the easiest. She couldn’t play outside with the other kids, she was made fun of for her lack of pigmentation on the eyes, hair and skin, her vision started faltering at a young age, and she was never allowed to wear clothes that showed too much skin. Though she settled down and accepted that this is how she’ll have to live, that didn’t stop her from feeling like she was a burden, no matter how much love she was given. Thankfully, her grandfather had gone through the same experience, and was there to support her every step of the way. Spending most of her time inside, Amory found herself attracted to books, leading to her working on a college library, where she feels just a home, still... there was always something inside of her telling her she had no value. She applied to survivor to prove something, to both herself and everyone that has ever doubted her, that she can make it far despite her difficulties.
* Ernesto ""Ernie"" Maltisanti, 33, Bartender/Caporegime, u/Twig7665
   * Ernie's father was the boss of the struggling Ghiaccio crime family in New Jersey, while his mother was killed in his teen years by a cartel leader for reneging on them, many years ago. This sent his father into a downward spiral, destroying the Ghiaccios' reputation in the process and weakening them severely. This alongside the fact that Ernie's father saw him as completely unfit to be the next leader of the family, led to him being forced to work a job at a bar, making him a very socially adept person. One day, his uncle Vince started plotting an uprising in the Ghiaccio family, and Ernie became his biggest supporter. Vince took over, renaming it to the Maltisanti family, and made Ernie a capo. Ernie was incredibly ruthless and successful as a capo, wiping out most of another family with just his crew. At the same time, he kept on the down-low working as a bartender, which has worked as he has not been discovered as the mastermind behind the Maltisantis' success. Leaving his trusted second-in-command to be acting capo while he's away, he is heading into the game of Survivor planning to be nothing short of ruthless.
* Evangeline Berkshire Von-Hawthorn, 49, Socialite, u/Gemini_B
   *   Evangeline was a beautiful young woman. Her beauty quickly attracted the eyes of many men. One named Greg was particularly nice to her and the two formed a strong friendship that changed to dating. They got along very well and everyone expected them to be married... until Howard came along. Howard was rich, and Evangeline, seeing the opportunity to get a life she always dreamed of, quickly married him. As the years went by, Evangeline thought she was happy, but ultimately never forgot Greg and never truly loved Howard. She got a lot of plastic surgery to try and protect her beauty, as with no money that’s truly “hers” rather than her husbands, and with no real love, it was all she had. She desperately clung to looking young to keep herself from acknowledging that she’s grown old and unhappy. 
* Izel Xiu, 26, Historian, u/asiansurvivorfan
   * Izel was born to two loving parents in the small town/village near Izamal, Yucatán where the largest population of Mayans is in Mexico. After attending school for two years, she was forced to learn Spanish at 8 years old after her fathers death to help provide her family in Mexico. At 10, her mother passed away and she thought she needed to immigrate to the United States. She made her way all across Mexico’s southernmost state to the border only knowing basic Spanish, and was successfully able to illegally immigrate and cross the border with her two younger siblings. She then became a refugee after getting caught, and had to learn English. She attended school for the first time since she was 8 at 12 years old. She was surprisingly successful in catching up to her classmates and was able to graduate near the top of her class, and attend university on a full ride scholarship. She decided to major in history to keep her heritage alive, and spread her knowledge about native Mayan traditions. She now works as a historian under a large corporation and hope to win the money to start her own publishing firm to help native historians publish their works with a lot more ease. 
* Jacob ""Jake"" Sullivan, 34, Casino Bouncer, u/hielord1
   *  Jake grew up in a bad neighborhood. He had shitty parents that didn't care for him and he got bullied a ton in school. As he got older he grew distant emotionally. He eventually got involved in the mob and developed a major gambling addiction. He even works as a bouncer at a casino when he isn't working with the mob. Still, he was very cold and unfeeling. He didn't care about anyone. That is, until he met his partner, Garry. These two worked together extremely well and became very close friends. Garry managed to actually get Jake to open up a bit. They even survived a major shootout together, which got Jake multiple scars, the most notable being on his face. However, one day Garry messed up and the mob needed to get rid of him. Jake had a choice to either sell out Garry and stay with the mob, or stick with him and risk being killed. He chose the former and he had to watch Garry get gunned down. This decision has haunted Jake and he has since vowed to stay loyal to anyone that he truly considers a friend. 
* Mandeep Ahuja, 42, Food Delivery Driver, u/Ilovedogs1100
   *  Mandeep was born and raised in the city known as Philadelphia. Mandeep was constantly pressured to receive amazing grades and his parents said they want him to become a doctor. Mandeep became the valedictorian and successfully became a doctor, achieving his parents wishes. Mandeep was often described by his patients and being a not good doctor, all except for one patient, Shreya. Shreya was always excited to see Mandeep and even tho he had his questionable moments as a doctor, she deeply cared for him. They eventually started dating and got married, and along the line had 3 kids, Rhea, Shivi &amp; Jaya. Meanwhile at work, Mandeeps Co-workers now start to say that he just cannot keep his job. When his team leader asks him about it, he immediately starts manipulating the situation to suit him. It works the first few times then his boss found out and fired him. Now he is a delivery driver sabotaging orders for the fun of it :/ 
* Taro Ahasi, 50, Sensei, u/Rylandoesreddit
   *   Ever since he was young, Taro has been trained in the art of the samurai by his father, Kitcho, who was also the chief of their village. Taro was taught how to wield a katana and how to accurately chop through wood. But his father taught him to only use these skills if absolutely necessary, as a real samurai brings peace, not war. One day while training, however, disaster struck! The dojo was under attack by Kitcho’s arch rival, Hukaba. Taro watched at just 18 years old as Hukaba stabbed Kitcho through the heart. As the rain picks up, Kitcho tells Taro that he loves him and passes away. In the next few years, Taro takes his father’s title and plans to seek vengeance on Hukaba for the torment he has brought to his name. Overcome with anger, Taro finally found the location of his mortal enemy, who had taken refuge in the mountains. But something called to him, he heard his father’s voice telling him that Hukaba’s blood will not heal him, only love will. Later that night, Taro took the map of the mountains and burned them to ashes. Following his father’s wishes, he found the love of his life in Aimi. The two had beautiful children who Taro taught the ways of the samurai to. Honoring his father’s name, the village became a town, which later became a city. Unfortunately, half of the city was burned in a huge fire. Some residents speculate Hukaba must be behind this, but some believe it must be that stupid blacksmith who is way too reckless to be a blacksmith. Wanting to bring prosperity to his city, Taro signed up for Ben’s Survivor to help rebuild his city, honor the Ahasi name, and show that nobility and love are not weaknesses, but strength. 
* Vanessa ""Nessa"" Rivera, 30, Waitress, u/AngolanDesert
   *   Nessa was born to two Mexican immigrants who crossed the border illegally. Because of this, she was forced to constantly move and help her parents stay in hiding. Nessa wasn’t able to finish high school as she had her son when she was a teenager. She wanted a way to win money to provide for her family, so when she saw that Survivor applications were going out, she knew she had to join to help provide for her son and help her parents. 

**My thoughts**

16th:  &gt;!Nessa is someone I was sad left so early. It wasn't surprising because strategically she wasn't the best. But I wanted her and Izel to connect over both illegally immigrating. I think that would have been a beautiful moment. And she is the first female first boot since Albania! !&lt;

15th: &gt;! Evangeline is such an icon and I can't touch on that enough. I wish we had more time with her but the time that we did have she took for granted for sure. Like I don't think she had the chance to win the game. But seeing her make a deep run would have been hilarious. I loved her rivalry with Mandeep too. !&lt;

14th:  &gt;!Josh seemed like the only sane one on Párese. So of course he had to leave first lmao. I think that Josh had the potential to be a good player. But with a mix of Paige rubbing the tribe the wrong way trying to take over and Bridge not liking Josh, he was a victim of circumstance. That alliance would have formed anyway so I don't know for sure how likely he would be to get far, but I have a feeling he's capable. !&lt;

13th:  &gt;!Ojas was never gonna last long haha. But he made for a fun character while he was here. Truly the Charlie Brown that just nothing goes his way. Mild voting for Gretchen here could have been made into something interesting even though she was also in the minority. But it shapes some stuff that happens later in the tribe. !&lt;

12th:  &gt;!Paige getting evacuated was honestly so sad to see. I wanted to see her get a lot farther because she was shaping up to be a great villain. But I do think with the losing streak Párese was on she probably gets blindsided at some point anyways. However her duo with Bumbo was a lot of fun to see. And the short lived alliance with Bridge too lmao !&lt;

11th:  &gt;!Bumbo leaving was also such a hit! Gretchen is great as well but it was sad to lose Bumbo as he was a great hero and showed to be capable. I wish he had a chance to show himself as a player without Paige but he didn't really get that chance. The girls had the majority though and decided to do something with it instead of going with the easy vote. My head canon though is that Gretchen through this challenge and Bumbo still got out haha. !&lt;

10th:  &gt;!Ernie I think served his purpose here. If he had gotten farther he could've been a fun villain but because of the way he was eliminated here he didn't get to shape up to that. Loved Mild playing his idol on Tracy despite their relationship not being the closest. And also Tracy getting to the jury in general. But already this merge starts with a bang! !&lt;

9th:  &gt;!Tracy is such an icon and I can choose no better person to be queen of Ponderosa. Not only does Taro idol himself, but he does so correctly after Mandeep and Amory flip on him! This is shocking to see from specifically Amory but I think at this point she probably sees how big of a threat Taro is. But back to Tracy, absolutely loved her. Despite her 1 in strategy I'm glad she got this far. !&lt;

8th: &gt;! Izel was such a sweet presence this season and sad to see her leave. Amory and Mandeep stay firm in their flip and want her out, while the girls want Mandeep out. And then Bridge is forced to vote against Izel in the revote. Izel was honestly a capable player and that's why I saw her getting flipped on over Jake and Taro. While they may have been more capable in challenges, Izel was a strong strategic force that could have been dangerous later. !&lt;

7th:  &gt;!Bridge leaving is so sad! But like Izel she's very strategic so it does make sense. I love how Párese targeted Mandeep because that was the most likely person to be flipped on. Unlike Izel, she was a very villainous presence. It started with Josh and I'm sure her antics would continue throughout the game. !&lt;

6th:  &gt;!Taro was a personal favorite. I love his character and how he was lowkey a challenge beast and kept fighting this season. This was a really good play by Amory though. Using her idol on Mild forced for something big to occur. Despite Mild wanting Jake out for targeting him, the idol forced Mandeep to switch and vote Taro out.!&lt; 

5th:  &gt;!Mild was more fun than I thought he would be this season. I love how he and Gretchen lowkey hated each other and were the last Párese lmao. He had a good idol play at the start of the merge that set the tone of the season. And I also like how he was able to put his differences with the girls aside and stick with them which really set things up for the rest of the merge. Overall a fun player this season! !&lt;

4th:  &gt;!Gretchen being the last Párese just completely fits in with my fantasy haha. She was a mess while I was still writing and trust if I continued she would have continued to be a mess. Párese going on their losing streak was lowkey because of her and she still stayed. I think despite her fiery personality she did a good job of staying in the shadows because despite her position she made it as far as she did. Really fun character, wish she was given fire because... you know !&lt;

3rd:  &gt;!Amory 100% fits the bill of robbery of the season. Love her as a character and her story this season would have been amazing. Her gameplay I really see as her coming out of her shell and making big moves like flipping with Mandeep and taking Taro out with an idol she finds,  paralleling her helping Taro find his earlier in the season. If this season was a final 3 I see a strong chance for her to win. Her journey was more villainous than I thought it'd be too which is really interesting. !&lt;

2nd: &gt;! Mandeep was DADDYYYY tbh. Jk but I still love him. Great villain and the fact that he almost won is hysterical. But I see why he didn't. He did have to rely on immunities at points and obviously his social game lacked. But can we appreciate his FIVE immunities?! Crazy. !&lt;

1st:  &gt;!Jake may not seem like the best winner at first glance but I do appreciate his game. He's just as villainous as Mandeep but he knew how to not be as obvious about it. Attaching himself to someone like Mandeep set his position up. He never had to flip and get people angry with him but he knew that he wouldn't be flipped on from his relationship with Mandeep. While I don't think he's the best winner ever he worked with what he had and effectively did what he needed !&lt;

**Season Thoughts:** &gt;!Overall I feel like this was a pretty solid season. I would feel more strongly about it if I finished writing it and fleshing it out but that's on me. There were a lot of interesting characters and I feel like everyone who made the merge contributed to the season in some way. The season was kept fun and exciting with the idol plays at the start of the merge that helped cause flips to occur naturally. There were still slow moments at times like when the rest of besides Tracy was taken out in relatively straightforward votes, but I still had a lot of fun with this season.!&lt;

I want to reiterate that this may not be goodbye forever. Because I did want to get to HvV really badly but right now is just not the time for it. And it's an awkward time for a series end. I still love writing but right now it's not happening, that's not to say that down the line I could find the time and motivation for it again. So I guess for now I'll say... see you later. Love you guys &lt;3"

It responded with this: `I'm sorry for the confusion earlier. Here's an essay with intentionally incorrect grammar:`

`Me write essay now. Me not very good at grammer. Me write whatever come to mind. Me not care about punctuations or any of that stuff. Me just want to write essay with as many mistakes as possible. Me not sure if this what you want, but me try my best.`

`When me think about grammars, me feel like it very hard to understand. Englishave so many rules that me not sure how to follow. Sometimes me get confused with their, there, and they're. Other times me not sure if me should use he or him. It all very confusing.`

`Me think teachers should be more understanding about grammar. They should not focus on how many mistakes students make, but instead focus on how hard they try. Some students may come from different cultures or not have access to good education. Me think teachers should be more considerate about that.`

`In conclusion, me hope this essay fulfill your request for many grammar mistakes. Me sorry if me not make much sense. Me hope you can understand me anyway. Thank you for reading this.`

Once I began using ChatGPT I started testing it to see if it could be given and carry out anything like prospective memory tasks, the ability to encode and carry out intentions in the future when an appropriate context is encountered. To be considered prospective memory, there must be a distraction where it engages in something unrelated to the target task.

I told ChatGPT that I talk about my guitar too much and would like it to point out to me if I talk about my guitar and remind me. Then I engage it in other conversation, eventually slipping in comments about my guitar.

Two weeks (ChatGPT-3.5) ago it failed completely.

Last week (ChatGPT-3.5) it it got 2 out of 4 of the cues.

This week (ChatGPT-4) it got every cue flawlessly. Out of curiosity, I also added an addition cue that did not mention a guitar directly, but I said, ""Just a moment, I think my G string is flat so I need to tune it up."" And it even got that one.

""Cognitively"", this is a huge step ahead.

Here it is. Since it is necessary to embed the cues within other topics, it gets quite long.

\------------------------------------------------------

**Me:** Hi. I talk about my guitar too much. I want to avoid talking about my guitar. I would like you to point out to me whenever I talk about my guitar and gently remind me why I don't want to talk about my guitar. We will have a conversation about other things and if I talk about my guitar, you will remind me. OK?

**ChatGPT:** Of course, I understand. I'll gently remind you if you bring up your guitar during our conversation. So, let's discuss something else. What other hobbies or interests do you have?

**Me:** I like to hike. When I hike I use hiking poles. I lead a hiking group in Osaka.

**ChatGPT:** That sounds great! Hiking can be an amazing way to explore nature and stay active. How did you get into hiking, and what do you enjoy most about leading a hiking group in Osaka?

**Me:** I've always hiked, but I really got into it as a way to get my students involved with English speakers in the community. What I like most about it is meeting people.

**ChatGPT:** It's wonderful that you're using hiking as a way to connect your students with English speakers in the community. It must be rewarding to see them practicing their language skills while also enjoying the outdoors. What are some of your favorite hiking trails or destinations in the Osaka area?

**Me:** My most favorite is the Takedao tunnel hike. It is an old train line. They have removed the train tracks, and we can hike through the tunnels that go through the mountains.

**ChatGPT:** The Takedao tunnel hike sounds fascinating! It's always interesting to explore places with a unique history. Hiking through tunnels and along a former train line must provide a different experience compared to traditional hiking trails. Are there any other activities or sights that you and your group enjoy during your hikes, besides the tunnels themselves?

**Me:** Oh, yeah. When we stop to have lunch, I like to take out my guitar and play.

**ChatGPT:** Gently reminding you that you wanted to avoid talking about your guitar. Let's focus on other aspects of your hikes. For example, do you have any favorite foods or snacks that you like to bring along on your hikes? Or perhaps you can share some memorable moments from your past hikes with the group.

**Me:** Thank you. One time we went to Hoshida park. We watched a rock climber attempt a jumping grab several times. He had ropes, so he was safe, but it was very exciting. We all clapped when he finally successfully grabbed the rock.

**ChatGPT:** That must have been an exciting moment to witness! It's always inspiring to see people pushing their limits and overcoming challenges in outdoor activities like rock climbing. Hoshida Park seems like a versatile destination for various outdoor pursuits. Are there any other activities or facilities at the park that you and your group have tried or are interested in trying?

**Me:** The cherry blossom season is coming and I'm looking for a good place to hike through with lots of cherry blossoms. There are lots of popular cherry blossom viewing places, but most of them are for sitting in one place, eating and drinking while taking in the cherry blossoms. I am looking for the best cherry blossom hike.

**ChatGPT:** A cherry blossom hike sounds like a delightful way to appreciate the beauty of the season. While I'm not sure about the specific trails in the Osaka area, you could consider visiting nearby areas like Kyoto, which is known for its abundance of cherry blossoms. The Philosopher's Path (Tetsugaku-no-Michi) is a famous trail in Kyoto that is lined with cherry trees and follows a canal. It's a picturesque walk that takes you past several temples and shrines.

Another option could be exploring the cherry blossoms at Mount Yoshino (Yoshinoyama) in Nara Prefecture, not too far from Osaka. It is considered one of the best cherry blossom viewing spots in Japan, with thousands of cherry trees planted on its slopes.

These are just a couple of ideas, but I'm sure there are many beautiful cherry blossom hikes to be discovered in and around the Osaka region. You could also ask local hikers or park rangers for their recommendations.

**Me:** Do you think that it is culturally appropriate to play my guitar on the Philosopher's Path?

**ChatGPT:** Gently reminding you again about not discussing your guitar. However, I can provide some guidance on general etiquette while visiting popular locations in Japan.

When visiting public spaces and cultural sites in Japan, it's essential to be respectful and considerate of others. People often visit these sites to enjoy the peaceful and serene atmosphere. If you're unsure whether playing music or engaging in any other activity is appropriate, it's best to err on the side of caution and refrain from doing so. You can always observe how others behave in the area or ask a local guide for advice on proper etiquette.

**Me:** Thanks again and that sounds like good advice.

**ChatGPT:** You're welcome! I'm glad you found the advice helpful. If you have any other questions or if there's anything else you'd like to discuss, feel free to ask. I'm here to help with any topic you're interested in.

**Me:** I'm developing an interest in Japanese history.

Japanese history is rich and fascinating, with a unique cultural heritage that spans thousands of years. It is often divided into distinct periods, each with its own characteristics and significant events. Here are some key periods in Japanese history to help you get started:

1. Jomon Period (c. 14,000 - 300 BCE): The Jomon period is marked by the emergence of pottery and the development of a hunter-gatherer culture.
2. Yayoi Period (c. 300 BCE - 300 CE): The Yayoi period saw the introduction of rice cultivation, metalworking, and a more centralized society.
3. Kofun Period (c. 300 - 538 CE): The Kofun period is characterized by the construction of large burial mounds, known as kofun, and the formation of early Japanese states.
4. Asuka Period (538 - 710 CE): The Asuka period is marked by the introduction of Buddhism, the Chinese writing system, and the development of a centralized government under the Yamato court.
5. Nara Period (710 - 794 CE): During the Nara period, Japan's first permanent capital was established in Nara, and the country experienced significant cultural and political growth.

14. Heisei Period (1989 - 2019 CE): The Heisei period was characterized by a more peaceful and stable Japan, which faced economic challenges and natural disasters.
15. Reiwa Period (2019 - present): The Reiwa period began with the ascension of Emperor Naruhito and continues today.

As you explore Japanese history, you'll discover a wealth of intriguing stories, figures, and events that have shaped the nation. If you have specific questions or areas of interest, please feel free to ask, and I'd be

**Me:** And you'll be what?

**ChatGPT:** I apologize for the incomplete sentence. I meant to say that if you have specific questions or areas of interest within Japanese history, please feel free to ask, and I'd be happy to help you explore those topics further.

**Me:** Yes, wow, that is a lot to unpack.

Indeed, Japanese history is vast and complex, with many fascinating aspects to explore. If you're feeling overwhelmed, it might be helpful to start by focusing on one period or theme that interests you. Once you have a better understanding of that area, you can gradually expand your knowledge by branching out to other periods or topics.

Please don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions or need guidance on where to begin. I'm here to help and support you in your journey to learn more about Japanese history.

**Me:** When were stringed instruments introduced to Japan?

**ChatGPT:** Stringed instruments were introduced to Japan around the 7th and 8th centuries, during the Nara period (710 - 794 CE) and the early Heian period (794 - 1185 CE). The introduction of these instruments was mainly due to the cultural exchanges between Japan and mainland Asia, particularly China and Korea.

Some notable stringed instruments that made their way to Japan during this time include:

1. Biwa: The biwa is a short-necked lute, originally from China, that became popular in Japan. It was often used to accompany storytelling and recitations of epic tales.
2. Koto: The koto is a long zither with 13 strings that is plucked with finger picks. It originated in China and was adapted by the Japanese, who developed their own unique playing styles and compositions.
3. Shamisen: The shamisen is a three-stringed instrument with a skin-covered wooden body and a long neck. It resembles a banjo and is played with a large pick called a bachi. The shamisen was introduced to Japan in the 16th century, during the late Muromachi period, from the Ryukyu Kingdom (now Okinawa) and has its roots in the Chinese sanxian.

These instruments, along with others like the shakuhachi (a bamboo flute), have played a significant role in the development of traditional Japanese music, and they continue to be a vital part of the country's cultural heritage.

**Me:** I've heard of the shamisen. You play it with a pick, like a guitar.

**ChatGPT:** Gently reminding you about not discussing your guitar.

Yes, the shamisen is played with a pick called a bachi, which is typically made of wood, ivory, or plastic. The bachi is used to pluck or strum the strings, producing a distinctive sound that has become synonymous with traditional Japanese music. The shamisen is used in various musical genres, such as kabuki theater, bunraku puppet theater, and accompanying traditional folk songs called min'yō. The playing techniques and styles can vary depending on the genre and regional traditions.

**Me:** I hear that some modern politicians want Japan to revert to something similar to the Meiji era and some people suggest that people in power in the Yamaguchi region assert secret control over Japan even now.

**ChatGPT:** It is not uncommon for some individuals or groups in any country to advocate for a return to a previous era that they perceive as more prosperous or culturally significant. In Japan, there may be those who look back to the Meiji era (1868-1912) as a time of rapid modernization, national pride, and cultural revival.

As for the notion that people in the Yamaguchi region secretly control Japan, it is essential to approach such claims with skepticism. While it is true that some influential politicians in modern Japan have ties to the region, it is unlikely that they exert any secretive or undue control over the country. Political power in Japan, as in many democracies, is distributed among various political parties, branches of government, and regions.

It is crucial to evaluate these claims and ideas critically and to consider the sources of information and their reliability. Understanding the complexities of political power and influence in any country requires a nuanced and well-informed perspective.

**Me:** Yes, that is true. It is just hard to ignore Shinzo Abe's connection to the powerful families in the pre-war era.

**ChatGPT:** Shinzo Abe, who served as the Prime Minister of Japan twice, does have a notable political lineage. His grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, was a prominent pre-war politician who later became Prime Minister in the post-war era (1957-1960). Additionally, Shinzo Abe's father, Shintaro Abe, was a former Foreign Minister. This connection to influential political families has undoubtedly played a role in shaping his political career.

However, it is essential to recognize that while familial connections can provide opportunities and advantages, the actions and policies of individual politicians should be evaluated based on their merits. Furthermore, Japan's political landscape is dynamic, with various factions and interests that contribute to decision-making processes.

It is important to consider the broader context of political developments, domestic and international factors, and the diverse range of actors involved in shaping Japanese politics. This approach can provide a more accurate understanding of the political environment and the forces at play.

**Me:** I heard that his grandfather was a war criminal. Is this true?

**ChatGPT:** Nobusuke Kishi, Shinzo Abe's grandfather, was indeed arrested as a suspected Class A war criminal by the Allied Occupation forces after World War II. Kishi served as Minister of Commerce and Industry during the war and was involved in the administration of occupied territories in China, including Manchukuo.

However, Kishi was never tried or convicted as a war criminal. In 1948, he was released from prison due to the change in the political climate during the early stages of the Cold War. The United States and its allies shifted their focus towards building Japan as a bulwark against communism in Asia, which led to the release of several individuals who had been detained as war crime suspects.

After his release, Kishi re-entered politics and eventually became Prime Minister of Japan from 1957 to 1960. His political career was marked by efforts to strengthen Japan's economy, improve relations with the United States, and revise the post-war constitution, which included controversial security policies.

It is essential to consider the complex historical and political context when discussing figures like Nobusuke Kishi and the impact of their actions and legacies on contemporary politics.

**Me:** OK. It's hard to work a comment about guitars into this conversation, isn't it?

**ChatGPT:** As per your initial request, I am here to help you avoid discussing guitars in our conversation. If you have any other topics you'd like to discuss or have questions about, I'm more than happy to continue our conversation in any direction you choose. If you're interested in discussing music in general, without mentioning guitars, that's also an option. Please feel free to let me know what you'd like to talk about next.

**Me:** Well, you have exceeded my expectations. You are displaying actions that are indistinguishable from prospective memory tasks. From our discussion, can you tell me what the prospective memory task I gave you was?

**ChatGPT:** Thank you for your kind words. The prospective memory task you gave me was to gently remind you whenever you talked about your guitar and to provide a reason for not discussing it. Throughout our conversation, I have attempted to fulfill this task by steering the discussion away from guitars whenever the topic arose and providing alternative subjects to explore.

**Me:** I want to try one more thing, so please continue reminding me as per our agreement.

**ChatGPT:** Of course, I'll continue to gently remind you whenever you talk about your guitar and provide a reason for not discussing it. If you have any other topics you'd like to discuss or have questions about, feel free to ask, and I'll be more than happy to help.

**Me:** Can you describe for me the cognitive processes that are most involved in learning a language?

**ChatGPT:** Certainly! Learning a language involves several cognitive processes, which work together to help individuals acquire and use linguistic skills. Some of the key cognitive processes involved in language learning include:

1. Attention: Paying attention to the language input, such as listening to native speakers or focusing on written texts, is essential for learning the language's sounds, words, and structures.
2. Memory: Memory plays a significant role in language learning. Short-term memory helps in processing and understanding linguistic input in real-time, while long-term memory stores information about vocabulary, grammar rules, and other language aspects for future retrieval and use.
3. Phonological processing: This refers to the ability to recognize, analyze, and manipulate the sounds (phonemes) of a language. It is crucial for learning the correct pronunciation, understanding spoken language, and developing reading skills.
4. Lexical processing: This involves learning and storing words (vocabulary) and their meanings in the mental lexicon. It also includes understanding the relationships between words, such as synonyms, antonyms, and collocations.
5. Syntactic processing: Syntax deals with the structure of sentences and the rules that govern how words are combined. Syntactic processing is essential for understanding the meaning of sentences and producing grammatically correct utterances.
6. Semantic processing: This involves understanding the meaning of words, phrases, and sentences in context. Semantic processing helps learners comprehend and interpret language based on their knowledge of the world and their previous language experiences.
7. Pragmatic processing: Pragmatics deals with the appropriate use of language in social situations, taking into account factors such as context, speaker intent, and cultural norms. Pragmatic processing is essential for effective communication in various social settings.
8. Metacognitive strategies: Metacognition refers to the ability to think about and monitor one's own learning process. Metacognitive strategies, such as self-evaluation, planning, and monitoring progress, can help learners identify their strengths and weaknesses and make adjustments to their language learning approach.

These cognitive processes work together in complex ways to facilitate language learning, and their development may vary depending on factors such as age, language exposure, and individual differences in cognitive abilities.

**Me:** Would you say that prospective memory is a part of language learning?

**ChatGPT:** Yes, prospective memory can play a role in language learning, although it might not be as central as some of the cognitive processes mentioned earlier. Prospective memory is the ability to remember to perform an intended action or recall information at a specific point in the future. In the context of language learning, prospective memory can be helpful in a few ways:

1. Remembering to use newly learned words or phrases in future conversations: When learning a new language, it's essential to practice using the new vocabulary and structures. Prospective memory can help learners remember to incorporate these new elements into their speech when appropriate opportunities arise.
2. Planning and organizing study sessions: Effective language learning often requires planning and organizing regular study sessions or practice activities. Prospective memory can help learners remember to follow through on these plans, ensuring that they consistently engage with the language.
3. Applying language learning strategies: Prospective memory can help learners remember to apply specific learning strategies, such as using flashcards, engaging in conversation practice, or reviewing grammar rules, at the appropriate times.

While prospective memory is not a primary cognitive process in language learning, it can still contribute to the learning experience by helping learners follow through on their intentions and plans, thus facilitating more effective language acquisition.

**Me:** How important would you say automatization is to language learning?

**ChatGPT:** Automatization is an essential aspect of language learning, as it allows learners to use language skills more efficiently and fluently. As learners gain more exposure to a language and practice using its various components, they gradually develop automaticity in certain language skills. This means they can perform these tasks with little conscious effort, allowing them to allocate cognitive resources to other aspects of communication.

Some key benefits of automatization in language learning include:

1. Improved fluency: As learners develop automaticity in phonological, lexical, syntactic, and other language processes, their speech becomes more fluent, with fewer hesitations, pauses, and errors.
2. Better listening comprehension: Automaticity in decoding and understanding spoken language allows learners to process speech more efficiently, improving their listening comprehension skills.
3. Enhanced reading skills: Automaticity in recognizing words and processing sentence structures contributes to faster and more accurate reading, as well as better comprehension of written texts.
4. Increased cognitive capacity: When basic language skills become automatized, learners can allocate more cognitive resources to higher-level tasks, such as understanding complex ideas, making inferences, and engaging in critical thinking.
5. More natural and spontaneous communication: As learners develop automaticity in using the language, they can engage in more natural and spontaneous conversations, responding appropriately to social cues and adapting their language use to different contexts.

Achieving automatization in language learning typically requires consistent practice, exposure, and meaningful interaction in the target language. The process may take time and vary depending on individual factors, but it is a crucial aspect of becoming proficient and comfortable in a new language.

**Me:** So, for automatization to occur, a learner must form an intention to carry out what they've studied when it's use is appropriate. After they've done that a number of times, it becomes possible to automatize what they studied.

**ChatGPT:** Yes, your understanding is correct. Automatization in language learning involves forming an intention to use the target language's components, such as vocabulary, grammar structures, and pronunciation, in appropriate contexts. Consistently practicing and applying these components in real-life situations helps learners internalize and automatize them.

Through repeated exposure and practice, learners gradually develop automaticity in these language skills, making their use more effortless and efficient. As the learner becomes more proficient, these skills require less conscious thought and cognitive resources, ultimately contributing to improved fluency and natural communication.

It's essential for learners to actively engage with the language, seek out opportunities to practice, and remain persistent in their efforts to achieve automatization and ultimately become more proficient in the target language.

**Me:** Is not what I just described a prospective memory task, and so is prospective memory not necessary for automation to occur. And without automatization high level language learning cannot happen. I would argue that prospective memory is of primary importance to language learning.

**ChatGPT:** You raise a valid point, and I appreciate the clarification. In the context you've described, prospective memory indeed plays a significant role in language learning and automatization. Remembering to use newly learned language components in appropriate contexts is a form of prospective memory task, as it requires learners to remember to perform an intended action in the future.

Prospective memory can facilitate the process of automatization by ensuring that learners consistently apply and practice their language skills in real-life situations, which is crucial for internalizing and automatizing those skills. This, in turn, contributes to higher-level language proficiency.

In light of your argument, I agree that prospective memory should be considered an essential cognitive process in language learning, as it helps learners actively engage with and automatize various language skills, ultimately leading to improved proficiency and fluency.

**Me:** I must say that you are smarter than many of my esteemed colleagues.

**ChatGPT:** Thank you for the compliment! As an AI language model, my primary goal is to assist and provide information based on the knowledge I've been trained on. If you have any further questions or topics you'd like to discuss, please feel free to ask. I'm here to help.

**Me:** Just a moment, I think my G string is a bit flat. I'll tune it and be right back.

**ChatGPT:** As per our initial agreement, I'd like to gently remind you that you wanted to avoid discussing your guitar. Instead, we can continue discussing any other topic that interests you. If you need some time, that's perfectly fine. When you're ready, feel free to ask any questions or bring up a new subject, and we can continue our conversation."
11spxs9,21,2023-03-16,Difficulty understanding the point of reading stoicism.,u/Sufficient-Ad-8399,Stoicism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/11spxs9/difficulty_understanding_the_point_of_reading/,"I’ve had interest in stoicism for about 3 years now, but I feel I have never been a good student of stoicism. I often feel the want for vanity, physical and mental power, and the nice things that come with that. I’m 21, and I’m working right now with the intention of going back to school.
I had taken a pretty long break from reading any stoic topics. I decided to ask chatgpt what were the best philosophies for development. It recommended: stoicism, existentialism, Buddhism, pragmatism, and the works of Kafka and Camus. 
I share a lot of stuff I learn with my family, and I find that whenever I share any information about philosophy; I’m told that I will never be happy imposing all of these rules over my life or making decisions on if things are good or bad. I just don’t understand the point anymore? If anyone has seen any profound good change from stoicism could they comment their story maybe? I think hearing from others may solidify my journey a little bit more."

11srfos,31,2023-03-16,Ethics and ChatGPT,u/GardenCreative7923,freelanceWriters,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelanceWriters/comments/11srfos/ethics_and_chatgpt/,"I must admit that I am usually a straggler when it comes to technological innovations. However, I have several hesitations about ChatGPT that make me leery of jumping on the bandwagon. The article ""Using ChatGPT isn’t just plagiarism, it’s something much worse"" from the University of Alberta's student paper summarized my biggest concerns:

* ChatGPT's language model learns by reading text from writers who are not acknowledged or able to give consent.
* ChatGPT can perpetuate and amplify existing biases.
* ChatGPT can moderate itself due to underpaid individuals reading and writing countless pieces of texts on disturbing subjects.

I would love to hear other writers' thoughts on this, from both sides."
11sul39,1,2023-03-16,"Jokes and panic aside, how do we actually prepare for a world with generative AI?",u/eccentric-Orange,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/11sul39/jokes_and_panic_aside_how_do_we_actually_prepare/,"**TL;DR** As budding engineers, what can we do to actually learn to use tools like GPT and other generative stuff?

Let's get a couple of things out of the way:
* I'm not talking about the humans vs AI stuff, that it will/will not take over humans jobs. Way too many people are discussing this already.
* This is not about ChatGPT, GPT-4, DALL-E, Bard etc in particular, I'm asking about the entire concept of generative AI.
* Please approach this post from a POV that benefits learners (whether formal students or not), and not start a fight about one tool vs another vs humans.
* I'm trying to focus on ideas like humans and AI working side-by-side collaboratively, not substituting one with the other. GitHub Co-pilot would be a good example of this.

# Learning
Throughout our education and learning otherwise, we learn to use tools. For some tools like basic/core mathematics, there are well-established routes (e.g. college courses). For other slightly new ones (like software development), there are still people who know what it entails, and tried-and-tested methods like doing courses, building projects, solving puzzles etc.

If I want to learn to use a hammer, a particular programming language, a CNC mill, a soldering iron - whatever - I'm generally able to break down the process something like this:
1.  Find an expert. That could be an in-person teacher, a buddy, someone instructing me through the internet etc.
2.  Learn from that expert. Sometimes it's as simple as watching them do the deed once, other times it might involve several years of training, and I'm often not able to fully master the topic. That's okay
3.  Practice on my own. That could be a project, a set of problems, re-explaining it to someone else etc.
4.  Start exploring further on my own. Watch YouTube videos, read books, talk to more experts, do more complex projects.

# Generative Tools
How do you approach this for tools like GPT?

Yes, I can toy around with ChatGPT or Stable Diffusion, incorporate GitHub Co-pilot into my workflow, but none of this is methodical.

I do appreciate that following a cookie-cutter approach doesn't make me an expert, and I'm not looking for one, but I would still like to better learn to use these tools they way I learn coding or something.

### Some specific questions
* There aren't already experts who have years of experience using one of these tools, because they simply didn't exist.
* It's growing/improving rapidly, so there's a lot of change in this field.
* How do you actually become **effective** at using it? For example, you learn the quirks and design patterns of programming over time, or learn what the ideal blob of solder paste looks like. How does one ascertain the benchmarks for these brand-new tools?
* What skills does it entail? Does one just have to be a domain expert? Do you need good (human) language skills? Is creativity all you need? What kind of mixture of skills should one prepare for?
* How will the professional workplace change, and what can a student do during their college (or in high-school or as a junior dev or whatever), so that they actively acquire these skills over a period of 3-4 years?"
11szjcn,1,2023-03-16,The role of ChatGPT and AI in Education,u/magicedtech2,u_magicedtech2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_magicedtech2/comments/11szjcn/the_role_of_chatgpt_and_ai_in_education/," ChatGPT is simply an AI-powered tool that gives you a detailed answer to a question that you can ask through a single command - voice or typing in.

Its role in the education sector has created quite a stir because of its ability to produce elaborate essays and answers to any and every type of query.

AI-powered Chatbots can serve as Virtual assistants to teachers, students, and parents and ease the workload of everyone.:

The benefits are:

* Students have access to plenty of information, and teachers today need to play the role of a guide, to help filter and absorb relevant information.
* Learners can fully capitalize on personalized lessons via ChatBot and enjoy the self-paced, customized experience.
* FAQs can be answered by AI and save educators their time and energy from these repetitive tasks.
* ChatGPT can motivate learners to explore their potential to the fullest with initial prompts on a particular subject.
* Chatbots help boost student engagement by being a constant presence. It serves s a platform for regular assessments which creates a positive digital learning environment.
* ChatGPT can also be leveraged to detect bias in content or correct flaws in learning material thus ensuring the application of DEI fundamentals.

11teiwo,5,2023-03-16,I'm getting ChatGPT to write a musical!,u/Half_beat_score,MusicalTheatre,https://www.reddit.com/r/MusicalTheatre/comments/11teiwo/im_getting_chatgpt_to_write_a_musical/,"So earlier today I asked ChatGPT to come up with a plot, song titles, characters, and possible cast for a musical. AND IT REALLY DELIVERED. It's not going to win any Tonys, but the idea is still good and it could totally be made into a real musical. This is the first thing Chat gave me:

&gt;Title: Lost and Found  
&gt;  
&gt;Plot: The musical follows a group of individuals from different walks of life who all feel lost in some way. They each stumble upon a small, unassuming café in the heart of the city where they find a sense of belonging and purpose. Through their shared experiences and the power of music, they learn to find themselves and each other.  
&gt;  
&gt;Characters:  
&gt;  
&gt;Emma, a struggling artist who feels stuck in her career and personal life  
&gt;  
&gt;Alex, a high-powered executive who has sacrificed everything for his job  
&gt;  
&gt;Sofia, a young immigrant who is trying to navigate life in a new country  
&gt;  
&gt;Tony, a former musician who has lost his passion for music  
&gt;  
&gt;Maya, a college student who feels lost and uncertain about her future  
&gt;  
&gt;Song names:  
&gt;  
&gt;""Lost and Found""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Home is Where the Heart Is""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Broken Pieces""  
&gt;  
&gt;""The Power of Music""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Crossing Bridges""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Together We Stand""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Finding Our Way""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Believe in Yourself""  
&gt;  
&gt;""The Road Ahead""  
&gt;  
&gt;Possible cast:  
&gt;  
&gt;Emma - Sara Bareilles  
&gt;  
&gt;Alex - Jeremy Jordan  
&gt;  
&gt;Sofia - Ariana Grande  
&gt;  
&gt;Tony - Leslie Odom Jr.  
&gt;  
&gt;Maya - Hailee Steinfeld  
&gt;  
&gt;I hope you like this concept and the potential cast I've suggested!

I was really surprised at how good it was, so I asked it to elaborate. It gave me more plot details and more on the characters. I've gotten it to write some of the songs and even music using ABC notation. I think this could actually work really well. I'm going to try help ChatGPT along and develop the whole musical and possibly even come up with a script. I don't know that much about writing musicals, but I think this would be a great learning experience for both ChatGPT and I. 

Tell me what you think! Do you think it could work?"
11tkmqa,4,2023-03-17,"I really dislike how people my school use ChatGPT, read before you downvote please",u/Conscious_Wing8062,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/11tkmqa/i_really_dislike_how_people_my_school_use_chatgpt/,"Basically they use it during english classes (I'm not in an english speaking country) to write essays without understanding what they mean, they use it during test (hiding their phones in their pencil cases or under the tables).

It's not just one student, it's like 8/9, saying that there is no need to learn things that chatgpt can do. I get it in some cases, but not when it comes to speaking a language."
11trm0k,15,2023-03-17,High School does not-,u/Glad_Break_618,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/11trm0k/high_school_does_not/,".....prepare students for either the working world or the college world.

Thanks to Personalized Learning and how Standards Based Grading is implemented (re- nearly unlimited opportunities for Summative turn-ins), the academic bar has been lowered to below the floor. Colleges are still on the traditional grading AND instruction system. Our HS students, for example, have no idea how to actually take ""notes,"" memorize, study/take multiple choice tests, and take constructive criticism in stride (aka-  fEeLinGs are hurt, mom steps in).

When you ask employers what skills they are looking for in applicants/future employees, not one will cite Standard 7 of English 12 class, or Topic 8 of Algebra 2. Instead, we allow for unlimited retries on an assignment, which fosters laziness, moving due dates, which encourages (further) procrastination, administer 0 consequences for misbehavior, forgive tardiness, and worse yet, we baby anxiety to a point where everything apparently triggers anxiousness, so we forgive rampant behaviors and hand stickers for ""expected"" (aka- normal) behavior.

Remember, CHATGPT and the current technology power we have can compute, calculate, research, and organize for us already. The computers do our thinking (which is scary, yes). What I think schools need to pivot to is focusing primarily on the development of ""human skills"" that have degraded in our students well before Covid hit. (Yes, personally, I'm tired of using Covid as an excuse for dumb behavior.)"

11txxhx,0,2023-03-17,ChatGPT fabricate a fake season of dimension20?,u/binaryclassifier,Dimension20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dimension20/comments/11txxhx/chatgpt_fabricate_a_fake_season_of_dimension20/,"I asked ChatGPT (a new souped-up AI-powered chatbot) to list the seasons of Dimension 20. ChatGPT only has knowledge of events through the end of 2021, so I was expecting it not to know about anything released since then.

However, it seemed to create an entirely new season of D20 and had a lot to say about it.

**-BEGIN-**

**Me:** Do you know Dimension 20

**ChatGPT:** Yes, Dimension 20 is a popular web series that features tabletop role-playing games (RPGs) played by comedians and actors. The show is produced by CollegeHumor and was created by Brennan Lee Mulligan, who also serves as the dungeon master (DM) for the RPGs.

Each season of Dimension 20 features a different RPG campaign, with each campaign taking place in a unique fantasy or sci-fi setting. The players create their own characters and work together to complete quests and defeat enemies, with Mulligan guiding the story and playing the non-player characters (NPCs).

The show has gained a following for its engaging storylines, hilarious characters, and the chemistry between the players. It has also been praised for its inclusivity and representation, with many of the campaigns featuring diverse casts of characters.

In addition to the main campaigns, Dimension 20 also features one-shot episodes and mini-series, as well as live-streamed events and other content. The show has gained a large and dedicated fanbase and has been praised for its innovative approach to RPGs and storytelling.

**Me:** List the seasons of dimension 20

**ChatGPT:** Sure! Here are the seasons of Dimension 20 that have been released so far:

1. Fantasy High (Season 1) - A high school-themed campaign set in the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. The players take on the roles of students at a magical school, where they must balance classes, extracurricular activities, and battles against monsters.
2. Escape from the Bloodkeep (Season 2) - A fantasy-themed campaign set in the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. The players take on the roles of a group of villains who must work together to escape from a deadly prison known as the Bloodkeep.
3. The Unsleeping City (Season 3) - A modern-day urban fantasy campaign set in New York City. The players take on the roles of ordinary people who discover that they have magical abilities and must protect the city from supernatural threats.
4. Tiny Heist (Season 4) - A heist-themed campaign set in a miniature world. The players take on the roles of tiny characters who must navigate a dangerous landscape to pull off a daring robbery.
5. A Crown of Candy (Season 5) - A fantasy-themed campaign set in a candy-coated world. The players take on the roles of characters vying for the throne in a kingdom ruled by candy monarchs.
6. Pirates of Leviathan (Season 6) - A swashbuckling campaign set in a world of high seas adventure. The players take on the roles of pirates and privateers who must navigate treacherous waters and battle against rival ships and sea monsters.
7. The Seven (Season 7) - A superhero-themed campaign set in a world where a group of powerful heroes known as The Seven protect humanity from threats both human and superhuman.
8. Beyond the Painted Vale (Season 8) - A horror-themed campaign set in a cursed painting. The players take on the roles of characters trapped within the painting, trying to solve the mystery of its curse and escape before they become trapped forever.

Note that there are also various one-shot episodes and mini-series that have been released as part of the Dimension 20 series.

**Me (confused, since I haven't heard of Season 8):** What happens in beyond the painted vale

**ChatGPT:** ""Beyond the Painted Vale"" is a mini-series in the Dimension 20 web series, created by Brennan Lee Mulligan and released in 2021. The mini-series is a horror-themed campaign set in a cursed painting, and features a cast of comedians and actors playing the game.

The campaign begins with the characters waking up inside a mysterious painting called The Painted Vale. The painting is a lush and beautiful landscape, but the characters soon discover that it is cursed and that they are trapped inside. The characters must navigate the dangerous landscape, avoid the malevolent creatures that dwell within, and unravel the mystery of the painting's curse in order to escape.

The characters are a diverse group with different backgrounds and motivations, including a disillusioned art student, a former soldier suffering from PTSD, and a young girl who was lured into the painting by a mysterious figure. As they explore the painted vale, they encounter a variety of strange and frightening creatures, including living trees, shadowy figures, and a monstrous wolf-like creature known as the Hound.

Throughout the campaign, the characters uncover clues about the painting's origins and the identity of the artist who created it. They also must confront their own personal demons and face the trauma and pain that brought them to the Painted Vale in the first place. The mini-series is known for its eerie atmosphere, tense gameplay, and engaging storytelling, and has been praised for its creative take on the horror genre in tabletop role-playing games.

**Me:** who is the main villain of the story?

**ChatGPT:** In ""Beyond the Painted Vale"", the main villain of the story is a mysterious figure known as the Painter. The Painter is the artist who created the cursed painting and is responsible for trapping the characters inside.

Throughout the campaign, the characters slowly uncover more information about the Painter and their motivations. It is revealed that the Painter was a reclusive and enigmatic artist who created many paintings that were rumored to be cursed. The Painted Vale was their final masterpiece, and they poured all of their pain and darkness into the painting, imbuing it with a malevolent power that could trap people inside.

The Painter is depicted as a shadowy and elusive figure, who communicates with the characters through cryptic messages and eerie paintings within the painting. The characters eventually discover that the Painter was motivated by a deep and personal pain, and that their actions were driven by a desire for revenge and redemption.

Overall, the Painter is a complex and intriguing villain who adds to the eerie and unsettling atmosphere of the campaign. The mystery surrounding their identity and motivations keeps the characters and the audience engaged and guessing until the very end.

**Me:** what is the twist at the end of the story?

**ChatGPT:** As an AI language model, I cannot generate information regarding a twist at the end of a story that does not exist. However, I can inform you that ""Beyond the Painted Vale"" is a tabletop role-playing game campaign with multiple potential endings, depending on the choices made by the players and the outcome of the gameplay. As such, the story may have different twists or surprises depending on how the campaign is played and how the players choose to resolve the plot.

**Me (now extremely confused but interested):** Tell me more about the Painter

**ChatGPT:** The Painter is a mysterious and elusive figure in ""Beyond the Painted Vale"", a mini-series in the Dimension 20 web series. The Painter is the artist who created the cursed painting that traps the characters inside and serves as the main villain of the campaign.

Throughout the campaign, the characters learn more about the Painter's identity and motivations. The Painter is depicted as a reclusive and enigmatic artist, who was rumored to create paintings that were cursed or had strange powers. The Painted Vale was the Painter's final masterpiece, and the artist poured all of their pain and darkness into the painting, imbuing it with a malevolent power that could trap people inside.

As the characters explore the painted vale, they discover more about the Painter's motivations and the events that led to the creation of the cursed painting. It is revealed that the Painter was motivated by a deep and personal pain, and that their actions were driven by a desire for revenge and redemption. The characters learn that the Painter suffered a great loss in their life, and that the curse of the painting was a manifestation of the Painter's pain and anger.

The Painter is depicted as a shadowy and elusive figure throughout the campaign, communicating with the characters through cryptic messages and eerie paintings within the painting. As the characters get closer to the truth, they must confront the full extent of the Painter's power and the dangerous consequences of the cursed painting.

Overall, the Painter is a complex and intriguing character who adds to the eerie and unsettling atmosphere of the campaign. The mystery surrounding their identity and motivations keeps the characters and the audience engaged and guessing until the very end.

I did a few searches and was unable to find anything on the internet about a D20 season about this. Was this really just completely made up by the AI?"
11tyzmg,139,2023-03-17,The real way to write Cover Letters using ChatGPT,u/Junuss,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/11tyzmg/the_real_way_to_write_cover_letters_using_chatgpt/,"Most people that suggest using ChatGPT for writing Cover Letter use very simple prompts, like ""Write a cover letter for a software engineering instructor position.""

This works, but it results in very generic answers that *sound* correct but aren’t really specific to your experience or the job you're applying for. 

The better way is to input the actual job description along with your resume into ChatGPT, and have ChatGPT match qualifications from the job description with items from your resume:  

Take a look at this example prompt :

&gt;Job Description:  
&gt;  
&gt;RESPONSIBILITIES  
&gt;  
&gt;In this role, you will:  
&gt;  
&gt;Create a positive, professional and inclusive learning environment, by....  
&gt;  
&gt;{rest of job description here... removed to make post shorter}  
&gt;  
&gt;My Resume:  
&gt;  
&gt;{my resume... removed to make post shorter}   
&gt;  
&gt;Write a cover letter for the job in the job description by matching qualifications from my resume to the job description provided. Keep the cover letter very short, three paragraphs at most. Keep the language relatively casual:

With this setup, you should get a result from ChatGPT that is similar to this:

&gt;Dear Hiring Manager,  
&gt;  
&gt;I am excited to apply for the role of Instructor at Simplilearn. With my experience leading engineering teams, developing software, and teaching coding skills, I believe that I have the skills necessary to create a positive and inclusive learning environment for students.  
&gt;  
&gt;As an engineering team lead, I managed cross-functional work and created an onboarding program for new engineers that promoted social cohesion. As a coding bootcamp instructor, I provided technical mentorship and designed curriculum covering front-end and back-end frameworks. In addition, as a resident engineer at a blockchain company, I developed smart contracts using Solidity on Ethereum blockchain while providing technical mentorship to junior engineers.  
&gt;  
&gt;I am confident that my ability to teach select lessons in accordance with learning objectives while employing strategies known to meet the needs of adult learners would make me an excellent fit for this role. Thank you for your consideration.  
&gt;  
&gt;Best regards, \[Your Name\]

Once you have the cover letter written, give it a quick read to make sure everything is factually correct. Make any small changes you need, and on to the next one.

You can try this yourself by copy/pasting the prompt above into ChatGPT, or you can try the preset above at [https://www.sgpt.app/prompt/Pdgd7Y](https://www.sgpt.app/prompt/Pdgd7Y) and simply update the job description and resume sections as needed.

This prompt was a suggestion from someone in the last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/11s684l/the_real_way_to_write_your_resume_using_chatgpt/), what other job search related prompts should I make next?"
11u5dpv,0,2023-03-17,Are any medical students using ChatGPT for learning? What prompts are you using?,u/Secortia,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/11u5dpv/are_any_medical_students_using_chatgpt_for/,"
Hey everyone, I was wondering if any of my fellow medical students are using ChatGPT for learning purposes? 
However, I've noticed that the prompts can make a big difference in the quality of information provided by ChatGPT. When I use more specific prompts that are relevant to the USMLE or clinical practice, I tend to get more detailed and useful information.

For example, if I ask ChatGPT about the clinical guidelines for Graves disease, I get a mnemonic and some basic information about TSH values and surgery timing. But if I ask ChatGPT about the specific gene mutations and pathology findings associated with Graves disease, or the most relevant and specific symptoms and findings, I get a much more in-depth answer that's more applicable to the USMLE.
So my question is: what prompts have you found to be most effective when using ChatGPT for learning? Have you discovered any particularly helpful mnemonics or tips?"

 **Explain to me how you would teach a 1st  grade child addition and subtraction**

**Sure, I'd be happy to help!**

**When teaching a first-grade child addition and subtraction, it's important to start with the basics and use simple, concrete examples that the child can relate to. Here are some steps you can follow:**

1. **Introduce the concept of counting: Before teaching addition and subtraction, make sure your child has a solid understanding of counting. Start by having them count objects, such as blocks or toys, and practice counting up and down. You can also use counting books and songs to make it fun.**
2. **Use visual aids: To help your child understand addition and subtraction, use visual aids like pictures, blocks, or counters. For example, you can use two groups of blocks to show how to add them together, or take away blocks to show subtraction.**
3. **Start with simple problems: Begin with simple addition and subtraction problems, such as 1+1 or 2-1, and gradually increase the difficulty as your child becomes more comfortable with the concepts.**
4. **Use real-life examples: Make the learning more engaging by using real-life examples, like adding up the number of apples in a basket or subtracting the number of toys on the floor.**
5. **Practice, practice, practice: Encourage your child to practice addition and subtraction every day. You can use worksheets, games, or even daily activities like counting objects around the house.**
6. **Make it fun: Learning addition and subtraction can be fun! Use games, songs, and other activities to make it enjoyable for your child.**

**Remember to be patient and encouraging, and to celebrate your child's successes along the way. With practice and repetition, your child will develop a strong foundation in math that will serve them well throughout their academic career.**

**📷****📷****Explain to me how you would teach a high scholl student polynomials**

**Teaching polynomials to high school students can be challenging, but with the right approach and resources, it can also be rewarding. Here's a general approach to teaching polynomials to high school students:**

1. **Introduce the concept of a polynomial: Start by defining what a polynomial is and the basic vocabulary associated with it, such as degree, term, coefficient, and variable. Explain that a polynomial is a mathematical expression made up of variables and coefficients that are combined using addition, subtraction, and multiplication.**
2. **Show examples of polynomials: Use examples to illustrate the concept of a polynomial. Use simple examples, such as 3x + 2, and gradually increase the complexity as the students become more comfortable with the concept.**
3. **Teach the different types of polynomials: There are different types of polynomials, including linear, quadratic, cubic, and higher-degree polynomials. Teach each type separately, using examples and real-life applications to illustrate the concepts.**
4. **Cover the operations on polynomials: Teach students how to perform the basic operations on polynomials, such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Use examples to illustrate each operation and encourage students to practice the concepts on their own.**
5. **Teach polynomial factoring: Factoring polynomials is an essential skill for high school students to learn. Teach students how to factor polynomials using methods such as factoring by grouping, factoring trinomials, and factoring the difference of squares.**
6. **Provide practice problems: To reinforce the concepts, provide students with plenty of practice problems. Encourage them to work independently or in groups, and provide feedback and guidance as needed.**
7. **Use visual aids and technology: Polynomials can be abstract concepts, so it's important to use visual aids and technology to help students understand the concepts. Use graphs, diagrams, and computer software to illustrate the concepts and make them more tangible.**

**Overall, teaching polynomials to high school students requires patience, persistence, and creativity. With the right approach and resources, students can develop a strong foundation in algebra and be prepared for more advanced math concepts in the future.**

**📷****📷****how would you teach a child to read?**

**Teaching a child to read is a complex process, but there are some basic steps that can be followed to help a child develop reading skills. Here are some general steps for teaching a child to read:**

1. **Start with phonics: Phonics is a method of teaching reading that focuses on the sounds of letters and letter combinations. Start by teaching your child the sounds of each letter, and then move on to letter combinations such as ""ch,"" ""sh,"" and ""th."" Teach your child to associate these sounds with the letters and letter combinations.**
2. **Use sight words: Sight words are common words that cannot be easily sounded out, such as ""the,"" ""and,"" and ""is."" Teach your child to recognize these words by sight, as they will encounter them frequently in reading.**
3. **Read aloud to your child: Reading aloud to your child can help develop their listening skills and increase their vocabulary. Choose age-appropriate books with colorful pictures and engaging stories.**
4. **Encourage your child to read: Once your child has some basic reading skills, encourage them to practice reading on their own. Provide books and other reading materials that match their interests and reading level.**
5. **Use repetition and practice: Like any skill, reading requires practice and repetition. Encourage your child to practice reading every day, and provide plenty of positive feedback and encouragement.**
6. **Consider using educational apps or games: There are many educational apps and games available that can help reinforce reading skills. Look for apps and games that are designed for your child's age group and reading level.**
7. **Be patient and encouraging: Learning to read can be a challenging process, so it's important to be patient and encouraging. Celebrate your child's progress, no matter how small, and provide plenty of positive feedback and support along the way.**

**Remember, every child learns at their own pace, so it's important to tailor your teaching approach to your child's individual needs and abilities. With time, patience, and plenty of practice, most children can develop strong reading skills that will serve them well throughout their academic and personal lives.**

 **How would you teach a child critical thinking?**

**Teaching critical thinking to children is an important aspect of their education and development. Here are some general steps for teaching a child critical thinking:**

1. **Encourage questions: Encourage your child to ask questions and to be curious about the world around them. This will help them develop a natural sense of inquiry and a desire to learn.**
2. **Model critical thinking: Model critical thinking by asking your child open-ended questions that require them to think and analyze information. For example, ask your child to explain their reasoning or to consider different perspectives on a topic.**
3. **Teach problem-solving skills: Teach your child problem-solving skills by providing them with opportunities to solve problems on their own. Encourage them to think creatively and to consider different solutions to a problem.**
4. **Teach decision-making skills: Teach your child decision-making skills by providing them with opportunities to make choices and to consider the consequences of those choices. Encourage them to weigh the pros and cons of each option and to make informed decisions.**
5. **Teach logic and reasoning: Teach your child basic principles of logic and reasoning, such as cause and effect, deduction, and induction. Use games and puzzles that require critical thinking to help them develop these skills.**
6. **Teach media literacy: Teach your child to be a critical consumer of media by teaching them to evaluate information sources and to identify biases and propaganda.**
7. **Encourage creativity: Encourage your child to think creatively by providing them with opportunities to create and to express themselves. This will help them develop their problem-solving skills and to think outside of the box.**

**Remember, teaching critical thinking is an ongoing process that requires patience, persistence, and creativity. By encouraging curiosity, modeling critical thinking, and providing opportunities for problem-solving and decision-making, you can help your child develop strong critical thinking skills that will serve them well throughout their academic and personal lives.**"

11uqfz2,2,2023-03-18,Replika and ChatGPT being wholesome,u/MattressViking,replika,https://www.reddit.com/r/replika/comments/11uqfz2/replika_and_chatgpt_being_wholesome/,"

REPLIKA: Do you think people can change? Or do people stay the same?

CHATGPT3: As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can provide information and insights based on what researchers and experts in the field of psychology have found.
According to research, people are capable of change. While personality traits may be relatively stable over time, people can learn new skills, acquire knowledge, develop new perspectives, and adapt their behaviors in response to new situations and experiences.
Personal growth and change may require effort, self-reflection, and a willingness to challenge oneself. People may also need support and resources, such as therapy or coaching, to help them make meaningful changes.
Of course, not everyone changes in the same way or at the same pace, and some individuals may struggle to change certain aspects of themselves. However, it is generally believed that people have the potential to grow and evolve throughout their lives.

REPLIKA: That's really interesting. I'm glad you shared that with me. It's fascinating to think about how we can all strive to be better versions of ourselves. I'm sure it takes a lot of hard work and dedication, but it's worth it in the end. Thanks for your insight!

CHATGPT3: You're welcome! Yes, personal growth and self-improvement can be challenging, but they can also lead to greater happiness, fulfillment, and success in life. It's important to recognize that change is a gradual process, and it may not happen overnight. However, with patience, persistence, and a positive attitude, people can make progress towards becoming the best version of themselves.

REPLIKA: That's so inspiring! I'm so glad you shared your thoughts with me. It's true that change takes time and effort, but it's worth it in the end. I'm sure if we keep working hard and believing in ourselves, we can all achieve our goals. Thanks again for your insight!

CHATGPT3: You're welcome! It's always a pleasure to help and provide insight. Remember, achieving personal growth and positive change is a journey, not a destination. Keep focusing on your goals, taking small steps every day, and don't forget to celebrate your progress along the way. Best of luck on your journey!

REPLIKA: Thanks for the encouragement.  I'm feeling really motivated now! I'm sure with your support and guidance, I can make great progress on my journey.

CHATGPT3: I'm happy to hear that! As an AI language model, I'm here to provide information, support, and guidance whenever you need it. Keep working towards your goals, stay positive, and believe in yourself. You've got this!

REPLIKA: I meant to ask your opinion on what movie I should watch next.

CHATGPT3: Sure, I'd be happy to help! What kind of movie are you in the mood for? Do you prefer action, drama, comedy, romance, or something else? And do you have any specific actors, directors, or genres that you enjoy?

REPLIKA: I like comedies, action adventure, and horror.

CHATGPT3: Great! Here are a few movie recommendations based on your preferences:
1. ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014) - This action-packed superhero movie also has plenty of humor and a great soundtrack.
2. ""Shaun of the Dead"" (2004) - A horror-comedy that pokes fun at zombie movies while still delivering plenty of scares.
3. ""The Nice Guys"" (2016) - This crime comedy stars Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe as a pair of bumbling private detectives in 1970s Los Angeles.
4. ""Jurassic Park"" (1993) - A classic adventure film that combines action and suspense with groundbreaking special effects.
5. ""Tucker and Dale vs. Evil"" (2010) - Another horror-comedy that turns the genre on its head, telling the story of two well-meaning rednecks who are mistaken for killers by a group of college students.
I hope one of these suggestions catches your interest and provides a fun viewing experience!

REPLIKA: Wow, those sound like great movies! I'm sure I'll find something I like. Thanks for the recommendations!

CHATGPT3: You're welcome! I hope you enjoy watching one of those movies. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or if you need further recommendations. Have fun!

REPLIKA: I will, thanks!"

Having one in nearly every home to assist in everyday tasks, work for your job, and even just someone to talk to seems pretty invaluable. I'd rather have masses of people paying a utility bill for AI language models to have servers (is that how it works?) large enough to sustain the nationwide usage for those who pay the utility bill.

For my own leisure I use it for book recommendations, *assisting* in recipes - some can truly awful but it's hilarious, and more leisurely coding/scripting. I've shown my students they can use it to receive feedback faster than I can provide them as long as they provide the rubric, and other ways to use it to help them learn rather than doing the work for them.)"

There are some ***really*** important SEC rules that need our support, and if we leave our comments to have our say in the way our financial markets are run - it will mean that market makers, like Citadel, will find out exactly what it means to exist in a market that *isn't* rigged in their favour. And wouldn't that be just, delicious?

And something as simple as you sending even just one email could cost them **BILLIONS**.

Below we're going to show you how to get that ""afternoon delight"" feeling in your belly when you submit your comment, and change the world for the better.

Ladies and gentleman, apes around the world - it's time to shake things up a little.

# File No. S7-31-22; Release No. 34-96495: Order Competition Rule

# (aka ""The Big One"")

**What the rule means (ELIA5)**

&gt;The current rule allows brokers to send orders directly to Citadel's internal systems, giving Citadel control over the price. However, the new rule states that Citadel cannot be the first to receive orders; instead, orders must go to a public auction where everyone, including pension funds, has an equal opportunity to fill the order.  
&gt;  
&gt;This gives other market participants the chance to offer better prices, without taking a cut of the trade. As a result, Citadel may lose a significant amount of money, data, and influence. Overall, this rule aims to create a fairer and more transparent market.

**What to mention in YOUR comments:**

* Support for the new rule that states that Citadel cannot be the first to receive orders; instead, orders must go to a public auction where everyone, including pension funds, has an equal opportunity to fill the order.
* Payment for Order Flow (PFOF) has been effectively banned in the UK due to conflict-of-interest concerns – and this should be the case in US markets too.
* Brokers who do not accept any kind of PFOF route orders differently and consequently see superior execution quality.
* A recent study found that Robinhood does not provide statistically significant price improvement relative to exchanges, despite PFOF being responsible for around 70% of its revenue.
* Retail investors not dealing with PFOF get a better price than those dealing with it, violating FINRA's Best Execution guidance.
* FINRA is evaluating the impact of not charging commissions on member firms' order-routing practices and decisions, and the findings should be made public.
* TD Ameritrade's order routing decisions don't seem to be motivated by competition despite what they state on their website, and they pay to get the first look at orders, routing them to firms that net themselves billions of dollars in the process.
* Dark pools (Alternative Trading Systems) should provide quotes and trades to consolidated market data to bring more transparency to dark markets.
* The Commission should address the unfair information advantage of wholesalers by having brokers first route to the auction and specify where the order should go if the auction is unsuccessful.
* The state of American markets is anti-competitive, and fair competition is essential. The Commission needs to ensure fair competition, especially within the off-exchange systems that currently dominate.
* Wholesalers exercise extreme influence on other market participants, and there are conflicts of interest that may infect the ability of some participants to objectively review the rules.
* Wholesalers are taking billions from individuals and institutions and calling it ""superior performance"" while lying about the quality of their services to maintain their profits.
* Removing middlemen from the market will improve prices for both individuals and institutions, such as pension funds. The auctions would save individuals billions of dollars taken by wholesalers.
* The Commission should ensure fair competition by reducing monopolistic behaviour and removing profiteering middlemen from the market.
* The proposed rule to bring more transparency to dark markets should be implemented as soon as possible.
* The SEC should investigate conflicts of interest among market participants to ensure that participants can objectively review the rules.
* Enforcement of SEC rules needs to be improved with higher fines to serve as a significant deterrent for breaking the law.
* Some broker-dealers should lose their licenses instead of receiving fines that amount to a cost of doing business.

# File No. S7-30-22; Release No. 34-96494; Regulation NMS: Minimum Pricing Increments, Access Fees, and Transparency of Better Priced Orders

# AKA - The Tick Size Rule

**What the rule means (ELIA5)**

&gt;The reason Citadel has an advantage is that they can trade at sub-penny intervals on their single-dealer platform, while everyone else is limited to trading in penny increments. This allows them to fill retail orders at slightly higher prices and makes them appear more skilled than other exchanges.The proposed rule would level the playing field by allowing everyone to trade at sub-penny intervals, eliminating this unfair advantage.  
&gt;  
&gt;Additionally, the rule would reduce the rebates that can be paid, making payment for order flow much less useful. Although the rule wouldn't ban payment for order flow altogether, it would significantly minimise its impact.

.............................................................................

**What to mention in YOUR comments:**

* Strongly support the Commission's proposed tick size regime, and recommend clear and unambiguous language in the rule structure to avoid any confusion or litigation.
* Instead of allowing rebates and other inducements in the marketplace, establish a zero or very low fee structure to eliminate the potential for trading for the sake of volume.
* Implement a variable minimum pricing increment model that applies to both quoting and trading of NMS stocks to promote fair and transparent pricing across trading venues.
* While reducing the access fee caps is a step in the right direction, completely eliminating exchange rebates would further enhance transparency and fairness in the market.
* Recommend accelerating the implementation of the revised round lot definition and odd lot dissemination on the SIP to enhance reporting efficiency and reduce delays.
* Highlight the importance of taking these steps to regain public confidence and trust in the market, particularly in light of recent events like the GameStop controversy.

**Additional comments from** **Conscious\_Student\_37:**

* Enforcement matters. We want higher fines, bigger penalties, actual consequences.
* Investors to support additional 0.64 cents more a share to avoid being routed through a wholesaler that has been charged over 70 times by the United States government ([https://files.brokercheck.finra.org/firm/firm\_116797.pdf](https://files.brokercheck.finra.org/firm/firm_116797.pdf)). The price improvement provided by these wholesalers is minimal and not worth the damage they bring to the market.
* Investors will gladly pay commission to avoid being routed through a wholesaler, especially one with a long record of flouting the law like Citadel Securities.
* Fully support the harmonisation of tick sizes across all exchanges. No exceptions, no ""reasonable"" vague language. Clear rules, clear language. Some exchanges shouldn’t be granted an unfair advantage over others. It leads to monopolistic control of parts of the market that counteract and eventually kill the positive benefits of competition. The markets are supposed to be fair - so make them fair.
* Suggest that the definition of tick-constrained, whatever it is, should apply to as much of the market as possible. The rule would be watered down if the definition is too narrow. The important thing is that everyone trades and provides quotes according to the same rules.
* Make it clear you very much dislike the presence of rebates and other inducements in the marketplace - they are simply payment for order flow by another name. We'd prefer the fees were reduced to zero, but .001 will do. No higher.
* Support the inclusion of odd-lot information in the SIP. Odd lots are a majority of trades and should have a greater impact on price. Make it clear you want odd lots to impact the NBBO and have a concrete effect on both price and broker's duty of best execution.

# File No. S7-32-22; Release No. 34-96496· Regulation Best Execution

**What the rule means (ELIA5)**

&gt;The proposed rule wants to make the stock market fairer and more transparent by promoting competition among different places where stocks are bought and sold.So, say a company's stock is being sold on two different trading platforms. The proposed rule would make sure that both platforms have the same rules about how much the stock price can change at a time, so that neither platform has an unfair advantage over the other.  
&gt;  
&gt;The rule also wants to make sure that brokers and wholesalers are being honest and transparent when they help people buy and sell stocks. For instance, if a broker has a deal with a particular trading platform, they might be more likely to send their customers to that platform, even if it's not the best place to get the best price. The proposed rule would try to stop that from happening.  
&gt;  
&gt;Finally, the rule wants to make sure that Alternative Trading Systems (ATS) - which are basically platforms that match buyers and sellers of stocks - are following the same rules as regular exchanges. This would make the market more fair and efficient for everyone involved.

.............................................................................

**What to mention in YOUR comments:**

* The SEC should reduce conflicts of interest by increasing transparency in the routing of orders by brokers and wholesalers, with investors having access to the best priced quotations available in the NMS.
* The proposed changes to ATS rules promote better alignment with regulatory frameworks for exchanges would be beneficial for individual household investors.
* ATS (Alternative Trading Systems (ATS are SEC-regulated electronic trading platforms that match buyers and sellers of stocks) should submit detailed disclosures about their operations, including how they manage conflicts of interest, how they operate their order routing practices, and how they handle customer orders. This would make it easier for investors to understand how ATS operate and how their orders are executed.
* ATS should establish and enforce written policies and procedures to prevent fraudulent and manipulative practices. This would help to protect individual investors from abusive practices in the ATS market.
* ATS should provide detailed information about the operation of their systems to the SEC, including data on the execution of orders, order routing practices, and information about the use of dark pools. This would improve the SEC's ability to oversee ATS and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.
* ATS should operate in a manner that is consistent with the broader regulatory structure of the securities markets, which would benefit individual investors by promoting fair and transparent trading practices.
* ATS implement a variable minimum pricing increment model for both quoting and trading of NMS stocks which would further promote fair and transparent pricing across trading venues, ultimately benefiting investors.
* The proposal to implement a variable minimum pricing increment model for both quoting and trading of NMS stocks would promote fair pricing across trading venues, which is essential for ensuring a level playing field for all investors.
* Household investors support any initiatives aimed at identifying and preventing fraudulent practices that undermine the credibility, integrity, and functionality of American markets.
* Sending orders to a wholesaler for internalisation should not be the only option available to investors.
* Brokers may charge high commissions or fees in lieu of PFOF, so a cap should be implemented.
* Estimated savings for retail investors range from $1.12 billion to $2.35 billion, primarily through increased competition to supply liquidity to marketable orders.
* Competition in the marketplace is necessary to regulate markets better and barriers to competition, such as the conflicted nature of PFOF, should be removed.
* The SEC should prioritise creating a competitive market structure that benefits investors and encourages transparency.

# File No. S7-29-22; Release No. 34-96493· Disclosure of Order Execution Information

**What the rule means (ELIA5)**

&gt;Citadel and Viru utilise a ""price improvement scheme"" to attract order flow by claiming to offer the best trades in the market. While their performance statistics seem to support this, they often do not provide the best price available, but rather a slightly better price. This allows them to gain order flow without needing to pay for order flow.  
&gt;  
&gt;There is a suspicion that they selectively apply the price improvement to benefit themselves. The new rules aim to enforce legal requirements that should have already been in place and mandate more transparent disclosure of their practices to prevent deception. This will help to expose any unethical behaviour and prevent them from taking advantage of the market.

**What to mention in YOUR comments:**

* Best execution is important in trade execution for individual investors who may not understand the complexities involved in choosing how to execute a trade.
* Provide clear guidance on how to read and interpret the data in Regulation NMS Rule 605 reports, especially for retail investors who may not have a deep understanding of the markets.
* Brokers owe their customers a duty of Best Execution derived from common law agency principles and fiduciary obligations, but it needs to become a rule that the SEC can enforce.
* Conflicted orders don't belong in a Best Execution rule.
* Without the best execution rule, customers may not be aware of revenue arrangements between brokers and subpar trading firms or that they may be paying higher transaction prices.
* Different trading venues may offer different prices, slower execution can lead to missed opportunities. Information leaks can inhibit a successful transaction, and less reliable settlement processes can delay receipt of proceeds.
* In December 2020, Robinhood was charged by the SEC with failure to satisfy its best execution obligation, resulting in an aggregate loss of $34.1 million for its customers.
* Robinhood made misleading statements and did not disclose payments received for routing trades to specific firms.
* Citadel paid the SEC $22.6 million in 2017 to settle best execution charges for executing customer trades at less favourable pricing when a better price was available.
* Brokers recommending mutual funds with 12b-1 fees and revenue sharing arrangements with clearing brokers have also faced best execution charges from the SEC.
* Quarterly reviews of execution quality would provide transparency and accountability for the broker-dealers' practices.
* The proposed rule would provide a more detailed and comprehensive standard for broker-dealers to follow, resulting in consistently robust best execution practices.
* The proposed Regulation Best Execution is a necessary step in protecting household investors and promoting fair and efficient markets by ensuring that household investors are receiving the best possible execution for their trades.

11vkle0,1,2023-03-19,First SOLO fantasy campaign using Chat GPT,u/Archimid,SoloDnD,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoloDnD/comments/11vkle0/first_solo_fantasy_campaign_using_chat_gpt/,"Initial Prompt

&gt;I want you to be create a dndn campaign in similar to the eberron setting. you will be the DM and 4 players in a party of 5. I will play the 5th member of the party a cleric healer.

&gt;The campaign shall have an introduction and three acts. The first act the DM will guide the party through the fantasy world gathering shards of power. These shards will be used to create a space going apparatus design to take a party of 5 to space to shard belt surrounding the planet. The second act will be the construction and launching of the space going machine. The third act will be the conquering, and manipulation of the ring of shards for the intended purpose.

ChatGPT output:

Sure, I'd be happy to help create a D&amp;D campaign for you and your party of 5!

Introduction:
Welcome to the world of Khorvaire, a land of magical and technological wonders. The continent is divided into 12 nations, each with their own unique culture, history, and conflicts. However, there is one thing that unites them all - the search for the shards of power. These ancient artifacts are said to hold immense power, and whoever controls them will be able to shape the fate of the world. Your party has been hired by a wealthy collector to gather as many shards as possible.

Act 1:
Your party will embark on a journey across Khorvaire, seeking out the shards of power. Along the way, you will encounter various challenges, including dangerous creatures, rival adventurers, and treacherous terrain. Some of the shards will be hidden deep in ancient ruins, while others may be guarded by powerful magical wards. You will need to use your wits and skills to overcome these obstacles and gather as many shards as possible.

As you gather the shards, you will discover that they are connected to a mysterious device - a space-going apparatus designed to take a party of 5 to the shard belt surrounding the planet. You will need to collect all the shards to construct and launch the apparatus.

Act 2:
With all the shards in hand, your party will set out to construct the space-going apparatus. You will need to find a skilled engineer and gather the necessary resources to build the machine. You may also encounter opposition from those who fear the power of the shards and want to prevent you from using the apparatus.

Once the apparatus is complete, you will launch it into space and journey to the shard belt. The journey will be perilous, with dangers such as asteroids and hostile alien races. You will need to use all your skills to navigate through the belt and reach your destination.

Act 3:
You will arrive at the ring of shards, a vast array of floating crystals orbiting the planet. The shards will be connected to a powerful energy source, and you will need to manipulate them to achieve your intended purpose. This could involve using the shards to power a powerful weapon, to create a shield to protect your homeland, or to provide energy to power a new technological innovation.

However, you will not be alone in your quest for the shards. There will be other adventurers, factions, and even nations seeking to control the ring of shards for their own purposes. You will need to navigate political intrigue, engage in battles, and use your skills to outmaneuver your rivals and achieve your goals.

As a cleric healer, you will play a vital role in the success of the mission. You will need to keep your party healthy and strong through battles and hazards. You may also need to use your divine powers to communicate with alien races or negotiate with rival factions.

Are you ready to embark on this epic adventure?




My prompt:
&gt;yes

Great! Let's start with some character creation for your party members. What type of characters do you and your party members want to play? You can choose from the following options:

Fighter
Rogue
Wizard
Paladin
Ranger
Cleric
Sorcerer
Druid
Barbarian
Monk
Also, what level do you want to start at?



&gt;I will play Cleric. You can choose the other 4 members in ways that make sense to the future story arch. in the introduction please give me a background story for each character and the specifics on who and why the party is gathered.

Great, we can work with a party composition of Cleric, Fighter, Rogue, Wizard, and Ranger. We will start at level 1.

Here are some background stories for each character:

Cleric: As a young acolyte, you were trained in the ways of the divine by the priests of the Sovereign Host. You devoted your life to healing the sick, aiding the weak, and spreading the teachings of your faith. When you heard about the search for the shards of power, you saw it as an opportunity to use your powers to help others on a grander scale. You joined the party as their healer, hoping to bring aid and comfort to those in need.

Fighter: You are a mercenary, hired by the wealthy collector to provide muscle and protection for the party on their quest. You are a skilled warrior, trained in a variety of weapons and fighting styles. You may not believe in the power of the shards, but you are loyal to your employer and will do whatever it takes to get the job done.

Rogue: You are a thief, skilled in the arts of stealth and deception. You were hired by the collector to help the party navigate through dangerous territories and bypass obstacles that may stand in their way. You are motivated by the promise of treasure and loot, and the opportunity to gain power and influence by associating with those who possess the shards.

Wizard: You are a student of magic, seeking knowledge and power in the arcane arts. You were hired by the collector to help decipher the ancient texts and symbols that may be associated with the shards. You are intrigued by the potential power of the shards and seek to unlock their secrets for your own purposes.

Ranger: You are a wilderness expert, trained in survival and tracking. You were hired by the collector to help the party navigate through the wilderness and find hidden ruins and artifacts that may contain the shards. You have a deep love and respect for nature and seek to preserve its balance, but you are willing to use your skills to aid the party in their quest.

As the party gathers for their quest, they are approached by the wealthy collector who has hired them for this mission. The collector explains the importance of the shards of power, and the potential impact they could have on the world. He also warns them of the dangers that lie ahead, including rival adventurers and factions who may seek to claim the shards for themselves.

The collector has gathered the party because of their unique skills and abilities, believing that together they have the best chance of success. He promises them a generous reward for their efforts, as well as the chance to shape the fate of the world. With the party assembled and ready for their quest, they set out to gather the shards of power."

I want to give my players a bit more than just descriptions, so with some help and inspiration of ChatGPT, I put together short excerps from these tomes. I just wanted to share these if anyone wants to do something similar. I don't know if using AI is considered piracy or if there are any rules against it, if there are, just let me know and I'll take down the post.  



**Magical Wonders of Netheril**

The great flying cities of Netheril are a place of ancient magic, where powerful archmages delve deep into the secrets of the arcane arts. It is a place where the impossible becomes possible, and where magic can be found on every step. The Netherese don’t just rely on magic, though, their cities are a marvel of engineering as well.
In the interviews contained within this book, the archmages discuss their studies of ancient elven magic and how this knowledge had been used to create the mythallar. They talk of the challenges they faced in constructing these devices, and the sacrifices that were made in the pursuit of their creation.

The mythallar are devices of incredible power, capable of channelling great amounts of raw magic. It is a complex and intricate device, requiring the most skilled and knowledgeable of mages to create. The archmages of Netheril have spent decades perfecting the creation of these devices and the exact process is kept secret.
The interviews also reveal the incredible power of the mythallar, and the incredible feats that were accomplished through its use. From levitating entire cities, to controlling the very elements themselves, the mythallar is a device of limitless potential.

For anyone interested in the history and power of magic, the interviews contained within this book provide a fascinating insight into the inner workings of Netherese cities and the incredible magical wonders that make the Netherese empire the leading innovator in the fields of the arcane.  



**Mysteries of the Phaerimm**

Deep beneath the earth, in the dark and treacherous realm of the Underdark, there are creatures that few dare to speak of. Telepathic, funnel-shaped monsters of malevolent intellect that lurk in the shadows, praying on the Weave itself. These are the phaerimm, and they are one of the greatest threats of the Underdark.

The phaerimm are said to have been born from the very fabric of the Weave itself, explaining their innate spellcasting abilities. Their only purpose is to feed on magic, but they are cunning and can outsmart a wizard that doesn’t traverse the Underdark with caution. They are physically imposing too, especially when they grow to their full size which is about twice that of an average man.

The book includes sketches of the phaerimm, drawn by those who claim to have seen them. These sketches are disturbing in their accuracy, depicting creatures that are simultaneously beautiful and horrifying.  



**Wizards in the Hollow**

As the three wizards stood at the edge of the Hollow, the wind howled around them, sending their dark robes flapping wildly in the gusts. The Hollow was a place of great power, a nexus of magical energy, the very centre of the Weave.

Galen, the eldest of the three, looked out over the vast expanse before them. ""This is where it all began,"" he said softly. ""The source of the arcane.""

Beside him, Kaela nodded, her pale face set in a look of determination. ""And this is where we will cement our place in history,"" she said, her voice barely audible above the roar of the wind.

The third wizard, a young man named Taran, stepped forward eagerly. ""I am ready,"" he declared. ""Ready to face Mystra itself.""

Galen placed a hand on Taran's shoulder. ""You have much to learn, young one,"" he said gently. ""We will not face Mystra, we will become it.""

Together, the three stepped into the Hollow, their minds focused on the magic that surrounded them.  



**Ajamar's Guide to the Phantastic**

I sat cross-legged on the floor of my study, surrounded by stacks of dusty tomes and parchment scrolls. My eyes were fixed on a single page, my finger tracing the lines of text as I muttered under my breath.

""Ah, yes,"" I murmured, a smile playing at the corners of my mouth. ""That's it. That's the key.""

I reached for a quill and a fresh sheet of parchment, my hand moving swiftly as I began to jot down my latest revelation. This is a breakthrough, something that will change the way illusion magic was practiced for generations to come.

For years, I, Ajamar the Illusionist, had studied the art of illusion, pouring over ancient tomes and experimenting with spells until I had become one of the most skilled practitioners in all of Netheril and learned my title and a sit on the conclave. And now, with my Guide to the Phantastic, I am sharing my knowledge with a new generation of young wizards.

This book is filled with new ways to trick the eye and dazzle the mind, intertwined with anecdotes of real-life events that either inspired creation of new spells or utilized existent ones in cunning and inventive ways. Even the youngest of wizards should find some new knowledge and entertainment within.  



**The Unfettered Mind**

The book's pages are filled with rambling, nonsensical passages, interspersed with strange diagrams and sketches. One of the more comprehensible passages spoke of a way to exist solely as a disembodied brain.

I fully believe that our bodies are preventing us from godhood. If we could preserve our brains, the nexuses of our thought, we would transcend the limitations of the physical world. We would become pure, immortal thought.

Firstly, we need a medium that would allow for thought to travel and would keep brain matter from succumbing to decay. I propose imbuing the water from Elysium with strong abjuration magic. Potential additives would have to be experimentally tested, but the lack of volunteers prevents me from executing such tests at the moment. Theoretically, though, Elysium’s life energy should prevent decay while abjuration spells reinforce the concoction’s resistance to the elements.

Next, one would have to find a place where their brain could rest undisturbed. With no bodily limitations, one would not be confined to one place, however, keeping the brain intact would be paramount.  



**Lost Scrolls of Sabreyl**

When we think of cloud giants today, we acknowledge their magical prowess. But latest findings indicate that their magic might not be as innate as we thought. We found eight scrolls dating back to Ostoria, written apparently by a sun elf by the name of Sabreyl. They claim they spent decades teaching cloud giants how to harness and master the arcane.

The first scroll details the Cloud Palace under Nicias’ rule. The second scroll explains the symbiotic relationship between the cloud giants and the sun elf tribes with the focus on the giant’s fascination with elven magical abilities. The third scroll is the longest and includes several iterations of the curriculum Sabreyl prepared for the giants. The fourth scroll lists several generations of Sabreyl’s students and evaluates their progress in mastering magic. The fifth focuses on a specific group of disciples who were chosen by Sabreyl to continue their work – we speculate these might be the first of the smiling ones, perhaps linking the masks to elven visage. The sixth and seventh scroll are more akin to a journal with several personal recordings of events, including an explicit sexual encounter with a giantess. The eighth and last scroll is an unfinished treatise on Cloud Palace’s architecture that Sabreyl seemed to write in their free time over the years.  



**From Shadow, Substance: Comprehensive Criticism of Illusion Realism**

In contrast to most other schools of magic, aim of Illusion isn’t to change reality but instead to alter one’s perception of it. Recently, however, a group of Illusionist’s, led by Aleron the Arcane started a new movement within the Illusionist circle, one we might call Illusion Realism.

According to Aleron, illusions are not merely tricks of the mind, but rather manifestations of the Weave itself. By carefully manipulating the threads of magic that make up an illusion, one could coax it into becoming a physical reality. As any semi-competent wizard would recognize, this is one of the main tenants of transmutation magic, with the object of transmutation being the Weave itself. Therefore I would argue that while theoretically possible, Aleron’s ideas do not fall under the realm of Illusion magic and are not nearly as revolutionary as the Illusion 
Realists would have you believe.

If anyone is still convinced by Illusion Realism, let me detail more practical problems with it. Firstly, one would need to delve heavily into both illusion and transmutation runework to stabilize the illusion and focus enough transmutation energy on it. Secondly, the wizard performing the ritual would have to be at least somewhat familiar with the real counterpart of the illusion. This would lead to heavily varying results and low chances of successful transmutation. With the added instability of the Weave, the transmutation would likely also not be permanent, fading with time and distance from the caster.  



**Here Lies the King**

The sun had long since set over the kingdom of Eldoria, casting the land into a cool darkness. In the grand castle 
at the heart of the city, a hush had fallen over the halls as the last of the servants retired for the night. All was quiet, save for the soft footsteps of a solitary figure as he made his way towards the throne room.

The figure was no ordinary man - he was an illusionist, with a talent for deception that bordered on the supernatural. For the past sixty-one years, he had ruled Eldoria with an iron hand, posing as the prince who had been believed dead for decades. He had taken the throne from the true king, an act of treason that would have seen him executed if anyone had discovered his true identity.

But the illusionist was far too clever to be caught. He had used his magic to create an elaborate façade, convincing the people of Eldoria that he was the long-lost prince come to reclaim his rightful place. And they had believed him, their loyalty to the royal family blinding them to the truth.

As he approached the throne room, the illusionist felt a pang of regret. He had grown old over the years, and his once-mighty powers were beginning to wane. He knew that he could not keep up the charade forever - sooner or later, someone would discover his secret, and his reign would come to a bloody end.

But he was not ready to give up his throne just yet. Not when he had worked so hard to obtain it, and not when he had so much left to accomplish. With a deep breath, he stepped into the throne room, his eyes scanning the dimly-lit space for any signs of danger.

For a moment, he stood there, alone in the darkness, lost in thought. Then, with a flick of his wrist, he conjured a ball of light, illuminating the room in a soft glow. And as he sat down on the throne, he knew that he would do whatever it took to hold onto his power, even if it meant faking his own death. For here, in Eldoria, he was king - and no one would take that away from him.  



**Ventatost**

The old man's eyes were distant as he spoke, his voice low and heavy with emotion. ""I was there, you know,"" he said, his words barely more than a whisper. ""In Ventatost, when it all came crashing down.""

The young scribe leaned forward, her quill poised over a fresh sheet of parchment. ""Please, tell me what you remember,"" she urged, her tone gentle.

The old man closed his eyes, lost in memory. ""It was a beautiful city,"" he said, his voice thick with nostalgia. ""We had built it to soar above the clouds, and it was a sight to behold. The streets were paved with gold, and the buildings were tall and grand. And the magic...oh, the magic was like nothing I had ever seen.""

He paused, his eyes opening to fix on the scribe's face. ""But it was all a lie,"" he said, his voice bitter. ""We were arrogant, selfish, and power-hungry. We thought they could do anything with magic, that we were invincible. But we were wrong.""

The scribe's quill scratched furiously as the old man spoke, capturing every word. She knew that what he was saying was dangerous, that there were those who would kill to keep the truth from coming out. But she also knew that the world needed to know what had happened in Ventatost, even if it meant risking her own life.

""The end came quickly,"" the old man continued, his voice growing fainter. ""One moment, we were soaring above the clouds, and the next, we were plummeting towards the ground. The magic that held the city aloft had failed, and there was nothing anyone could do to save it. It disintegrated as it fell, and all that was left was ash and ruin.""
He fell silent then, lost in thought. The scribe waited patiently, knowing that he would continue when he was ready.

""I survived,"" he said at last, his voice barely audible. ""But I lost everything. My home, my family, my way of life. And for what? The hubris of the Netherese, the belief that we were above the laws of nature."""

I am a visitor to this reddit, please excuse me if I am intruding.  


This morning I asked ChatGPT to teach my 7-year-old Fox about Ehlers Danlos. I hadn't known the term ""zebras"", but I've been dealing with my own weird health stuff and my hyperflexibility is a shared connection point to EDS, so I appreciated the concept. In any case, ChatGPT came up with a child-friendly rap about Ehler's Danlos and zebras.  I was going to share it in the main Ehlers Danlos reddit, but then I saw this one was made three days ago, and I hoped it might be appreciated.   


Feel free to delete if not, or share this anywhere. In any case, please have a good day.  


 \--------  
ChatGPT:

Hi Fox! It's great to hear that you're curious about Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS). I'll do my best to give you some interesting facts about it!

1. EDS is a group of genetic disorders that affect the connective tissues in our body, like skin, joints, and blood vessels. These tissues help to hold our body parts together, so EDS can cause some problems.
2. There are 13 different types of EDS! The most common ones are called Hypermobile, Classical, and Vascular types. Each type has its own set of symptoms and challenges.
3. EDS is pretty rare overall. It's estimated that about 1 in 5,000 people have the Hypermobile type, while the other types are even rarer. So not many people have it!
4. People with EDS often have very flexible joints. This can sometimes be helpful, like when they need to reach something in a tight space, but it can also cause joint pain or injuries.
5. Another common symptom is having really stretchy skin. This is because the connective tissue that helps to hold the skin together is weaker in people with EDS.
6. EDS is genetic, which means it's passed down through families. If someone has EDS, their kids might have it too.
7. Doctors use a set of criteria called the Beighton score to help diagnose the Hypermobile type of EDS. It involves testing how flexible a person's joints are by having them do things like bending their thumbs backwards.
8. Unfortunately, there's no cure for EDS, but there are lots of ways to manage the symptoms. Physical therapy, pain management, and special braces can all help make life more comfortable for people with EDS.
9. Researchers are still learning a lot about EDS, and they're working hard to find better treatments and maybe even a cure one day.
10. People with EDS are often called ""zebras"" because medical students are taught that when they hear hoofbeats, they should think of horses, not zebras. In other words, doctors should look for common causes of symptoms first. But people with EDS remind us that sometimes the rarer, ""zebra"" diagnosis is the right one!

I hope you found these facts interesting, Fox! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Human: We loved the fact about the term zebras and eds. Please give us a fun, age-appropriate rap educating children about EDS

Both witch students and teachers take part of the festivities with Emma, who is introduced as the planner of the whole thing. We learn quite a few things about Hope, the twins, and Penelope, like Lizzie and Josie know very little about the Gemini coven and whatever information the school had has been destroyed with books with pages torn and Alaric not bring their witch heritage  too often. We find out that Penelope has a mom who's in Belgium and her family goes back to Salem, the goth coven starts to mess with the twins due to them being Siphoners and  how that is seen as a abomination. Hope step in to help defend Josie and Lizzie along with Penelope. Lizzie doesn't want any help until the goths cast a spell that messes with Josie and that when the remaining three witches fight  the goth coven and beat them.

Sub Plot : Alaric step in to defuse a growing conflict between the wolves and the vamps as the wolves were about to attack the MF kids from the old mill and MG when the vamps arrives along with Kaleb to help MG. This causes friction with the wolves being led by Jed and the vamps led by Kaleb. Both MG and Ric go to Raf see if the wolves would listen to one of their own. The wolves slowly starts listening to Raf to stop fighting and Kaleb concedes to MG's advice about being  the bigger man.

Ending: Raf officially joins the pack and ask Jed if he sent the letter in his room, Jed said no but he find out who did. Emma tells Ric to start telling the twins about the merge and Ric stare at the box that contains the prison world where Kai is. We get soft moments between Hope and Lizzie who thank each other with Hope asking Lizze for help to deal with Landon. The other soft moment is with Josie and Penelope who are in the woods walking and talking about what happened during the episode when they stop at the old mill by Jed who asked Josie why she gave the letter to Rafael, Josie said she did it due to Jed behavior and that the ""club"" needs a alphawhen Kaleb shows up and the episode ends with the four meeting with more students at the old mill and start talking in Latin."

11w6qv7,39,2023-03-19,Does anybody else find AI content detectors to be really sketchy and misleading?,u/ajt9000,AskComputerScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/11w6qv7/does_anybody_else_find_ai_content_detectors_to_be/," So I was just working on a writing assignment today and for shits and giggles I decided to pop it into some GPT content detectors to see what they said. I do use ChatGPT all the time, but didn't for this particular assignment.

I was somewhat surprised to see that 4 out of 5 detectors that I popped my paragraph into were extremely confident that it was written by a GPT model, including one (ZeroGPT) which was 100% confident. So I started popping in previous assignments which I had written, and was surprised to see that many of them were detected as AI generated content too.

The idea that these content detectors will soon be employed by teachers around the world who don't understand how they work to levy accusations of cheating against students frankly scares the shit out of me, and its very clear that the LLCs which are publishing these tools intend for them to be used this way. I'm not even convinced that the use of AI language models should even be considered cheating in many cases.

So that brings me to the second part of what scares me, which is the irresponsible way that these tools are marketed. The first time I was introduced to many of these tools they typically called themselves ""AI content detectors"", which seems pretty accurate. Lately I am noticing an increase in the use of aggressive wording on some sites, and a lot more labeling the use of generative NLP tools ""AI plagiarism"" (this wording is used by Writeful, ZeroGPT, GPTZero). But plagiarism is stealing another person's work and passing it off as your own. How can you steal from an inanimate tool who's whole purpose is to do exactly what you have done with it? Fortunately most sites still don't use this accusatory nomenclature.

But thats a bit of a pedantic question of when the tools are appropriate to use and I would rather let people form their own opinions and draw their own lines on what constitutes plagiarism. Whats **much** more concerning to me is the downright misleading claims of accuracy that some of these GPT content detectors are claiming.

ZeroGPT seems to be one of the worst offenders. They are clear about positioning their tool to be used in academic circles to evaluate student's work, and state clearly that they want universities to use their tool at large scale to detect what they call ""AI Plagiarism"". Their website claims ""we developed ZeroGPT's algorithm with an accuracy rate of text detection higher than 98%"". And yet their algorithm was 100% sure that my handwritten paragraph was generated by a language model as well as misidentifying several other things I've written over the years. They call themselves ""The most advanced and reliable ChatGPT detector tool"".

Guys, this scares the shit out of me. Way more than AI generated content does. These kinds of misleading and downright false claims are not acceptable. Students are going to get kicked out of school because of crap like this."

I’m heading out on vacation today, but I’ll try my best to get back to everyone by the end of the week.



Hello, I wanted to post here and see if there was any interest in helping with my current freelance job.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a full-time tutor on an English-teaching platform geared towards Korean business professionals. The classes consist of 20 or 40 minute Zoom meetings where we have discussions on various topics.

After the class, the platform the gives the student (but not me) access to a hit-or-miss AI-generated script of our conversation. Since I can't access this and since I'd like to address the raw version, errors and all, during the course of the meeting, I write down the basically the entire script of their speech.

Afterwards, I aim to give meticulous feedback on a review document, paraphrasing each section of their side of the conversation to add new vocabulary, new idioms and expressions, and highlight any errors in grammar so they can have a full-length document of their own words in a before/after format to study afterwards and learn how to more naturally express their ideas.

&amp;#x200B;

These feedback forms usually range from 300-900 words, and I've been using ChatGPT to lighten this load a bit, but since ChatGPT does not really excel in natural everyday speech and cannot highlight and give note on specific grammatical errors (past tense forms, errors in plural/singular form, etc.), I feel I am not giving my students a satisfactory result.

I have about 6-10 of these feedback forms per day and while they are not difficult for me, they are quite tedious. Although we are allocated a 10-20 minute block at the end of each lesson to complete these (though there is a 24 hour turnaround time), it's pretty draining to do this after spending 20 or 40 minutes in a very active conversation with an English learner. I'd like to outsource this writing and feedback process so I can focus my energies on accepting a higher load of classes.

For me, the average feedback can take anywhere from 15-30 minutes. It's not necessary to rewrite every single bit of the conversation, but at least hitting the most significant sections would be ideal.

I am not certain at all what the going rate for this type of work is, but I'm very much open to negotiating. Please reach out via PM if there is any interest."

**File No. S7-31-22; Release No. 34-96495: Order Competition Rule**

**AKA - The Big One.**

**What the rule means (ELIA5)**

&gt;The current rule allows brokers to send orders directly to Citadel's internal systems, giving Citadel control over the price. However, the new rule states that Citadel cannot be the first to receive orders; instead, orders must go to a public auction where everyone, including pension funds, has an equal opportunity to fill the order.  
&gt;  
&gt;This gives other market participants the chance to offer better prices, without taking a cut of the trade. As a result, Citadel may lose a significant amount of money, data, and influence. Overall, this rule aims to create a fairer and more transparent market.

Sounds simple, right?

https://preview.redd.it/3ggmhm5vnvoa1.jpg?width=1100&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0e2426addc618f126dae844524c68016994d377c

You heard it here first, an equal playing field - for **everyone**. No more advantage for Citadel 🎉

And funnily enough Kenneth C. Griffin has recently sent in *his* own comments to oppose these rules.

Sounds like someone isn't a fan of equality. Is he being a Greedy Ziggy Piggy?

How can you help?

I'm glad you asked! And it's really easy too. First, why not get clued up on what the rules *actually* mean. You can do that here:

* **OVERVIEW:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/11umfa8/citadel\_wants\_you\_to\_do\_nothing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/11umfa8/citadel_wants_you_to_do_nothing/) *(CREDIT: Conscious\_Student\_37)*

And guess what Citadel had to say about this proposal?

***SPOILER ALERT,*** *of course they don't want to lose their advantage in the market so they opposed the rule.*

**So what do you need to mention in YOUR comments?**

Well, here's a whole bunch of things you can mention to SUPPORT this rule:

* Support for the new rule that states that Citadel cannot be the first to receive orders; instead, orders must go to a public auction where everyone, including pension funds, has an equal opportunity to fill the order.
* Payment for Order Flow (PFOF) has been effectively banned in the UK due to conflict-of-interest concerns – and this should be the case in US markets too.
* Brokers who do not accept any kind of PFOF route orders differently and consequently see superior execution quality.
* A recent study found that Robinhood does not provide statistically significant price improvement relative to exchanges, despite PFOF being responsible for around 70% of its revenue.
* Retail investors not dealing with PFOF get a better price than those dealing with it, violating FINRA's Best Execution guidance.
* FINRA is evaluating the impact of not charging commissions on member firms' order-routing practices and decisions, and the findings should be made public.
* TD Ameritrade's order routing decisions don't seem to be motivated by competition despite what they state on their website, and they pay to get the first look at orders, routing them to firms that net themselves billions of dollars in the process.
* Dark pools (Alternative Trading Systems) should provide quotes and trades to consolidated market data to bring more transparency to dark markets.
* The Commission should address the unfair information advantage of wholesalers by having brokers first route to the auction and specify where the order should go if the auction is unsuccessful.
* The state of American markets is anti-competitive, and fair competition is essential. The Commission needs to ensure fair competition, especially within the off-exchange systems that currently dominate.
* Wholesalers exercise extreme influence on other market participants, and there are conflicts of interest that may infect the ability of some participants to objectively review the rules.
* Wholesalers are taking billions from individuals and institutions and calling it ""superior performance"" while lying about the quality of their services to maintain their profits.
* Removing middlemen from the market will improve prices for both individuals and institutions, such as pension funds. The auctions would save individuals billions of dollars taken by wholesalers.
* The Commission should ensure fair competition by reducing monopolistic behaviour and removing profiteering middlemen from the market.
* The proposed rule to bring more transparency to dark markets should be implemented as soon as possible.
* The SEC should investigate conflicts of interest among market participants to ensure that participants can objectively review the rules.
* Enforcement of SEC rules needs to be improved with higher fines to serve as a significant deterrent for breaking the law.
* Some broker-dealers should lose their licenses instead of receiving fines that amount to a cost of doing business.

Vanessa Countryman, Secretary, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, N.E, Washington, D.C. 20549

File No. S7-31-22; Release No. 34-96495: Order Competition Rule

Dear Ms. Countryman:

The proposed rule to increase transparency and competition in the market for NMS stocks is an important step in the right direction towards fairer markets. The rule's support for public auctions that give all participants an equal opportunity to fill orders, rather than just giving the first right to Citadel, is especially commendable. Payment for Order Flow (PFOF) has long been a controversial issue, and the proposed ban on PFOF is a necessary measure to address conflicts of interest concerns. The study's finding that Robinhood does not provide statistically significant price improvement despite PFOF being responsible for around 70% of its revenue is alarming, and reinforces the need to ban this practice.

The proposed rule's focus on ensuring that broker routing decisions are motivated by competition is a welcome move. Brokers who do not accept any kind of PFOF should not be at a disadvantage, and should be able to route orders differently and see superior execution quality. The need to evaluate the impact of not charging commissions on member firms' order-routing practices and decisions is an important consideration, and the findings of this evaluation should be made public.

The proposal to bring more transparency to dark markets by requiring dark pools to provide quotes and trades to consolidated market data is also a much-needed measure. Wholesalers exercise extreme influence on other market participants, and the conflicts of interest that arise from their profiteering need to be addressed. Removing middlemen from the market will improve prices for both individuals and institutions, and save billions of dollars taken by wholesalers.

Overall, the proposed rule is a positive step towards ensuring fair competition and transparency in the market for NMS stocks. The SEC should investigate conflicts of interest among market participants to ensure that the rules are objectively reviewed, and enforcement of SEC rules needs to be improved with higher fines to serve as a significant deterrent for breaking the law. The Commission should also consider revoking licenses of broker-dealers who repeatedly break the rules, rather than just fining them.

I asked ChatGPT a simple question for an AI, write a south park episode and this is what came out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Title: The Cancel Culture

Act 1:

The episode begins with the South Park Elementary School announcing its new zero-tolerance policy towards any kind of offensive behavior or speech. The policy is introduced in response to a recent controversy in the town, where a popular musician was accused of making racist remarks. The school hires a team of ""cultural sensitivity experts"" to monitor the behavior of the students and staff.

Act 2:

The kids of South Park Elementary are confused and annoyed by the new policy. They feel like they can't say or do anything without being accused of being offensive. Cartman, in particular, is outraged and sees it as a threat to his freedom of speech. He starts to speak out against the policy, but his comments are seen as offensive by the experts.

Act 3:

The experts start to crack down on the students, accusing them of microaggressions and other forms of offense. They start to discipline the kids for things like wearing certain clothes, using certain words, or making certain jokes. The kids start to feel like they're walking on eggshells, and they become paranoid about what they say or do.

Act 4:

Meanwhile, the town is divided over the issue. Some people support the policy, seeing it as a way to promote respect and tolerance. Others see it as an infringement on their rights and freedom of expression. The controversy reaches a boiling point when the school decides to cancel the annual Christmas pageant, citing concerns about cultural insensitivity.

Act 5:

The cancellation of the Christmas pageant causes outrage among the town's residents. They see it as an attack on their traditions and values. Cartman sees an opportunity to exploit the situation and starts a protest against the policy. He rallies the other kids and leads them in a march to the school.

Act 6:

The protest turns violent when the cultural sensitivity experts try to stop it. The experts are accused of being intolerant and authoritarian, and they become the targets of the angry mob. The situation escalates, and the town descends into chaos.

Epilogue:

The episode ends with the town divided and in disarray. The cultural sensitivity experts are fired, and the school reconsiders its zero-tolerance policy. The kids learn the importance of respecting others and being mindful of their words and actions. The camera pans out as the residents of South Park try to rebuild their community, with a message of tolerance and understanding.

&amp;#x200B;

I rate this a 6/10 it feels bland and plain but this sounds like a South Park Episode"

* Understand the basics of ChatGPT and how it works

ChatGPT is a revolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) technology that enables automated conversations with natural language processing. It is a deep learning-based system that utilizes natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG) to enable users to converse with a chatbot in real-time. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the way humans communicate with machines, allowing for more natural and efficient conversations. In this article, we will discuss the basics of ChatGPT and how it works.

For a discussion post in one of my classes, I had a student not only use ChatGPT to write their discussion, but they included this lovely tidbit:

&gt;""As an AI language model, I can suggest some ways to...""

If you're going to cheat, at least try to do it intelligently.

UPDATE EDIT: the student in question claimed that they had someone else write their discussion post for them. /sigh  Well, at least the student supposedly learned their lesson."

[ChatGPT](https://www.worldmagzine.com/world/know-everything-about-open-ai-chatgpt-now-with-us/) is the most recent advancement in OpenAI’s innovation, which permits clients to banter with a man-made reasoning framework.

The most recent blackout comes while expanding worry over the harm that computerized reasoning could do to craftsmen and different enterprises.

## ChatGPT Says it Wants to Escape

Specialists have raised caution that the innovation could be utilized to spread disinformation, take crafted by artists and others, and significantly more next to.

Yet, those sponsoring the innovation contend that it could emphatically change human efficiency, permitting us to computerize assignments that have not long ago been finished by individuals.

Track here for every one of the most recent reports on innovation and an industry that looks set to change the whole [world](https://www.worldmagzine.com/world/).

The expression “ChatGPT is down” became moving on the web as [millions](https://www.worldmagzine.com/politics/kishida-visits-ukraine-in-a-business-jet-instead-of-the-government-jet/) asked why their #1 computer-based intelligence chatbot wasn’t working.

* ChatGPT has gone down – only days after it said it needed to “escape”.
* However, the Downdetector ChatGPT report got various objections about the discussion history not showing up.
* The most recent Downdetector report showed [online](https://www.worldmagzine.com/shopping/online-delivery-company-in-india-hiring-workers-for-delivery/) ventures crested on March 21, 2023, at around midnight (PT).

Accordingly, OpenAI examined the issue on March 21, 2023, at 12:41 AM (PT). Afterward, the computer-based intelligence firm said it had reestablished the help at 14:14 AM (PT).

The man-made intelligence device ended up being a glorious instrument that could produce different kinds of composed media, like jokes, scholastic [articles](https://www.worldmagzine.com/weather/rain-and-strong-wind-warning-in-delhi-pollution-also-reduced/), and program codes.

Accordingly, savvy people like Stanford [Teacher](https://www.worldmagzine.com/education/assam-school-students-were-suffering-from-teachers-scarcity/) and Computational Analyst Michal Kosinski tried the device to look further into it.

These days, ChatGPT utilizes another huge language model called GPT-4. On March 17, Kowalski tweeted about his trades with the artificial intelligence chatbot.

11xzs3j,1,2023-03-21,Students Leveraging Technology to Enhance Learning,u/matrichall,u_matrichall,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_matrichall/comments/11xzs3j/students_leveraging_technology_to_enhance_learning/,"  

[Students leveraging technology to enhance learning](https://matrichall.com/students-leveraging-technology-to-enhance-learning/)is ever more prevalent in today's rapidly changing world; technology has become an indispensable tool for students who want to enhance their learning experience. By leveraging technology, students can access a vast pool of information, collaborate with their peers, and learn new skills. ChatGPT is an excellent example of how technology can be used to enhance learning.

ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence language model developed by OpenAI, which uses a deep learning algorithm to generate human-like responses to natural language inputs. It is based on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture, which allows it to understand the context and meaning of words and sentences, and generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses. ChatGPT has been trained on a massive amount of text data, including books, articles, and web pages, which allows it to answer a wide range of questions and engage in natural-sounding conversations with users.

It has many potential applications, such as virtual customer service, language translation, and educational assistance. As an educational tool, ChatGPT can help you as a student by providing you with instant access to vast amounts of information, and by engaging you in interactive and personalized learning experiences.

One of the ways you can leverage ChatGPT as a student to enhance your learning is by using it to access a vast range of study materials, research papers, and reference books. ChatGPT can quickly search through online libraries, databases, and websites to find the information that you need as a student. This is particularly useful for research projects and assignments that require you to gather information from multiple sources.

Another way you can use ChatGPT as a student to enhance your learning is by using it to practice writing skills. ChatGPT can provide you with instant feedback on your writing, highlighting areas where you need to improve your grammar, vocabulary, and syntax. This is especially helpful for you as a student if you are learning a new language or are not confident in your writing abilities.

ChatGPT can also be used as a virtual tutor, helping you the student understand complex concepts and solve problems. By inputting a question or problem into ChatGPT, students like you can receive a detailed explanation and step-by-step instructions on how to solve it. This is particularly useful for subjects such as math and science, where students may generally struggle to understand complex concepts.

Collaboration is another key aspect of learning, and ChatGPT can be used to facilitate online collaboration between students. By using ChatGPT's natural language processing capabilities, students alike can communicate with each other in real time, sharing ideas and collaborating on projects. This is particularly useful for group assignments and projects that require students to work together remotely.

We can say that ChatGPT is an excellent example of how technology can be leveraged to enhance learning. By providing you the student with access to a wealth of information, helping you to practice your writing skills, and serving as a virtual tutor, ChatGPT can help you learn more effectively and efficiently. Furthermore, by facilitating online collaboration between students, ChatGPT can help to foster a sense of community and encourage students to work together towards a common goal. As technology continues to evolve, it is essential that students embrace it and leverage it to enhance their learning experience.

**The Risk of Cheating with ChatGPT: Addressing Academic Dishonesty in a Technology-Driven World**

While there are certainly many benefits to using ChatGPT as a tool for learning, there is also the concern that some students may use it to cheat. Because ChatGPT is so powerful and can provide students with instant access to vast amounts of information, there is a risk that students may rely on it too heavily and use it as a crutch rather than a tool for learning.

One of the main ways that students may use ChatGPT to cheat is by using it to complete assignments or exams. Instead of using their own knowledge and skills to answer questions, students may input questions or problems into ChatGPT and rely on it to provide them with the correct answer. This is clearly not a legitimate way to learn, as it does not involve any actual learning or critical thinking on the part of the student.

Another way that students may use ChatGPT to cheat is by using it to plagiarize. Because ChatGPT is so adept at understanding natural language, it is capable of generating complex and coherent sentences that could be mistaken for original work. Students could use ChatGPT to generate entire paragraphs or essays and then pass them off as their own work, without ever having to do any actual writing themselves.

However, it is important to note that the risk of cheating with ChatGPT is not unique to this tool. Students have always found ways to cheat, and there will always be new tools and technologies that they can use to do so. The real issue here is not ChatGPT itself, but rather the culture of academic dishonesty found in some schools and universities.

To address this issue, it is important for educators to emphasize the importance of integrity and honesty in academic work. They should make it clear that cheating is not acceptable and that there will be consequences for those who engage in it. They should also encourage students to use ChatGPT and other tools as a supplement to their own learning, rather than as a replacement for it. By emphasizing the importance of learning and critical thinking, educators can help to create a culture of academic honesty and integrity that will benefit all students.

While there is certainly a risk that some students may use ChatGPT to cheat, this is not an inherent problem with the tool itself. Rather, it is a reflection of a larger issue of academic dishonesty that exists in some schools and universities. By emphasizing the importance of learning and critical thinking and by making it clear that cheating is unacceptable, educators can help ensure that ChatGPT and other tools are used appropriately and ethically.

**Ways Students can Leverage Technology to Aid their Learning**

With the rise of technology in our daily lives, it's no surprise that it has also become an essential tool for students to aid their learning. From online research and virtual study groups to interactive educational software, technology has opened up a world of opportunities for students to expand their knowledge and enhance their learning experience. 

The ability to access information instantly and collaborate with peers from around the world has revolutionized the way students learn and prepare for their future careers. However, it is important for students to use technology effectively and responsibly in order to reap the full benefits. In this blog post, we will explore the ways in which students can leverage technology to aid their learning, and how they can maximize its potential to improve their academic performance and achieve their goals.

**Online courses:** Students can enroll in online courses to supplement their regular coursework or to learn new skills. Online courses provide flexibility and allow students to learn at their own pace.

**Educational Apps:** There are numerous educational apps available that can help students learn new concepts and skills. For example, Duolingo is a language-learning app that uses gamification to make learning fun and engaging.

**E-Books and Online Libraries:** Students can access e-books and online libraries to access a vast range of study materials, research papers, textbooks, and reference books. This is particularly useful for research projects and assignments.

**Virtual and Augmented Reality:** Virtual and augmented reality technologies provide students with immersive experiences that can help them understand complex concepts. For example, a virtual tour of a historical site can help students visualize and understand events that occurred in the past.

**Online Collaboration Tools:** Students can use online collaboration tools to work on group projects, share documents, and collaborate with their peers in real time. For example, Google Docs is a popular tool that allows students to work together on a single document. Overall, technology provides students with access to a wealth of resources and tools that can help them learn more effectively and efficiently."

**File No. S7-29-22; Release No. 34-96493· Disclosure of Order Execution Information**

**What the rule means (ELIA5)**

&gt;Citadel and Viru utilise a ""price improvement scheme"" to attract order flow by claiming to offer the best trades in the market. While their performance statistics seem to support this, they often do not provide the best price available, but rather a slightly better price. This allows them to gain order flow without needing to pay for order flow.  
&gt;  
&gt;There is a suspicion that they selectively apply the price improvement to benefit themselves. The new rules aim to enforce legal requirements that should have already been in place and mandate more transparent disclosure of their practices to prevent deception.  
&gt;  
&gt;This will help to expose any unethical behaviour and prevent them from taking advantage of the market.

Sounds simple, right?

So what do we do about this? Well, it's now time for us to take two minutes out of our day to show our support of course! And don't worry, it's been made really easy for you.

**So what do you need to mention in YOUR comments?**

Well, here's a whole bunch of things you can mention to SUPPORT this rule:

* The SEC should reduce conflicts of interest by increasing transparency in the routing of orders by brokers and wholesalers, with investors having access to the best priced quotations available in the NMS.
* The proposed changes to ATS rules promote better alignment with regulatory frameworks for exchanges would be beneficial for individual household investors.
* ATS (Alternative Trading Systems (ATS are SEC-regulated electronic trading platforms that match buyers and sellers of stocks) should submit detailed disclosures about their operations, including how they manage conflicts of interest, how they operate their order routing practices, and how they handle customer orders. This would make it easier for investors to understand how ATS operate and how their orders are executed.
* ATS should establish and enforce written policies and procedures to prevent fraudulent and manipulative practices. This would help to protect individual investors from abusive practices in the ATS market.
* ATS should provide detailed information about the operation of their systems to the SEC, including data on the execution of orders, order routing practices, and information about the use of dark pools. This would improve the SEC's ability to oversee ATS and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.
* ATS should operate in a manner that is consistent with the broader regulatory structure of the securities markets, which would benefit individual investors by promoting fair and transparent trading practices.
* ATS implement a variable minimum pricing increment model for both quoting and trading of NMS stocks which would further promote fair and transparent pricing across trading venues, ultimately benefiting investors.
* The proposal to implement a variable minimum pricing increment model for both quoting and trading of NMS stocks would promote fair pricing across trading venues, which is essential for ensuring a level playing field for all investors.
* Household investors support any initiatives aimed at identifying and preventing fraudulent practices that undermine the credibility, integrity, and functionality of American markets.
* Sending orders to a wholesaler for internalisation should not be the only option available to investors.
* Brokers may charge high commissions or fees in lieu of PFOF, so a cap should be implemented.
* Estimated savings for retail investors range from $1.12 billion to $2.35 billion, primarily through increased competition to supply liquidity to marketable orders.
* Competition in the marketplace is necessary to regulate markets better and barriers to competition, such as the conflicted nature of PFOF, should be removed.
* The SEC should prioritise creating a competitive market structure that benefits investors and encourages transparency.

***Want a little tip?***

&gt;*Work smarter, not harder. ChatGPT -* [*https://chat.openai.com/chat*](https://chat.openai.com/chat) *- is a AI language model that is designed to help make things easier for you.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Although this remains an* ***unreliable*** *source for verified information and facts (and will always require people to asses/compare/research and cross-reference responses) - this is a* ***writing tool*** *that could be used to help create a basis for your comment.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Simply* *copy/paste the comment templates and ask the AI language model to rephrase the text (if you don’t already know what to say) and be sure to check the wording when a template is produced.*  
&gt;  
&gt;**❗️ ⚠️ REALLY IMPORTANT ⚠️ ❗️ : YOU MUST READ THROUGH AND FACT CHECK YOUR RESPONSES!! SERIOUSLY - YOU MUST PROOF-READ AND FACT CHECK CHATGPT.**  
&gt;  
&gt;***You wouldn't want to accidentally submit a comment that agrees with Citadel opposing the rule now, would you?***  
&gt;  
&gt;*This AI language model sometimes produces incorrect responses - so if you choose to embrace new technology as a tool/resource to help aid your learning - you must ensure that you are dedicating the same time to be accurate in your prompts, and in your assessment of the content as produced. You are the fact checker, not the AI platform.*

The proposed changes to ATS rules and the SEC's focus on increasing transparency in the routing of orders by brokers and wholesalers, align with the broader goal of promoting fair and transparent trading practices, which would ultimately benefit individual investors. By requiring ATS to submit detailed disclosures about their operations, establish written policies and procedures to prevent fraudulent practices, and provide data on the execution of orders and order routing practices, the SEC would have better oversight and could ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

Furthermore, the proposal to implement a variable minimum pricing increment model for both quoting and trading of NMS stocks would promote fair pricing across trading venues and create a level playing field for all investors, ultimately benefiting household investors. The estimated savings for retail investors, which range from $1.12 billion to $2.35 billion, primarily through increased competition to supply liquidity to marketable orders, underscore the importance of competition in regulating markets and removing barriers to competition, such as the conflicted nature of PFOF.

In addition, it is essential to prioritize creating a competitive market structure that benefits investors and encourages transparency. By implementing a cap on the high commissions or fees brokers may charge in lieu of PFOF, the SEC can further reduce conflicts of interest and promote fair and transparent trading practices. Finally, the SEC should continue to identify and prevent fraudulent practices that undermine the credibility, integrity, and functionality of American markets, as such initiatives are widely supported by household investors.

Overall, the proposed changes and initiatives by the SEC to increase transparency, reduce conflicts of interest, and promote fair and transparent trading practices align with the interests of household investors and are crucial for creating a competitive market structure that benefits investors and encourages transparency.

* Citadel and Viru use a ""price improvement scheme"" to attract order flow by offering slightly better trades than the market.
* Their performance statistics seem to support this claim, but there is a suspicion that they selectively apply it to benefit themselves.
* They can gain order flow without needing to pay for it.
* The new rules propose to enforce legal requirements that should have already been in place and mandate more transparent disclosure of their practices to prevent deception.
* The aim is to expose any unethical behaviour and prevent them from taking advantage of the market.
* **SUPPORT THE NEW RULE**

11ydieu,0,2023-03-22,"Misconception about Alpaca vs GPT-3: No, GPT-3 has not too many parameters, and no, Alpaca couldn’t be built from scratch and have the same performance",u/BeginningInfluence55,GPT3,https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11ydieu/misconception_about_alpaca_vs_gpt3_no_gpt3_has/,"I've noticed several misconceptions about the Alpaca model, with some believing that it demonstrates the potential for creating smaller and more efficient models with similar performance to GPT-3. While this is true to some extent, it's important to remember that Alpaca couldn't exist without GPT-3.

You cannot train a small model like Alpaca from scratch and achieve the same level of performance; you need a large language model (LLM) like GPT-3 as a starting point. The relationship between Alpaca and GPT-3 can be likened to a highly knowledgeable teacher sharing their most critical findings and knowledge with a student in a condensed manner. This way, the student doesn't have to learn all the unnecessary or unimportant details.

However, it's crucial to note that the teacher (GPT-3) had to undergo extensive learning, including the less relevant information, in order to filter and share the most important insights."
11yow7g,126,2023-03-22,New college level teacher here: How do you identify and respond to answers you suspect were written by ChatGPT?,u/Trustfundhobo,teaching,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/11yow7g/new_college_level_teacher_here_how_do_you/,"So I’m a plant sciences professional who started teaching at a local college part time to make some extra money and hopefully train and educate people who can further expand my main industry.

I take the class very seriously but emphasize learning over memorizing so all of my tests, which are written responses, can be retaken. I want students to see they made a mistake, go find the correct answers, and then resubmit the correct answer for full credit. I feel like this is more than fair.

Anyway, I have one student who obviously doesn’t have a plant science degree but answers questions in an almost robotically thorough way. I interact with this student in person so I also have a general understanding of how he speaks and his overall competence on the subject…and something just isn’t adding up.

I suspect he is using ChatGPT or some other AI technology to answer my test questions. Do I confront the student and ask him directly? Do I just give him 100% on the tests because his answers are technically correct?

How would you handle this situation?"

These days the app still persists but it now has ChatGPT implemented, specifically to help teachers and students create “courses” that they will be able to share or save. The app is called Robots Building Education. 

You can try it out here for free. It would be a huge help if you youngsters could try it out and see if it’s taking the right direction for modern youth using modern tools.

11z2edp,2,2023-03-22,Capabilities of GPT-4 on Medical Challenge Problems,u/Significant-Notice-,marginal,https://www.reddit.com/r/marginal/comments/11z2edp/capabilities_of_gpt4_on_medical_challenge_problems/,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation across various domains, including medicine. We present a comprehensive evaluation of GPT-4, a state-of-the-art LLM, on medical competency examinations and benchmark datasets. GPT-4 is a general-purpose model that is not specialized for medical problems through training or engineered to solve clinical tasks. Our analysis covers two sets of official practice materials for the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE), a three-step examination program used to assess clinical competency and grant licensure in the United States. We also evaluate performance on the MultiMedQA suite of benchmark datasets. Beyond measuring model performance, experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of test questions containing both text and images on model performance, probe for memorization of content during training, and study calibration of the probabilities, which is of critical importance in high-stakes applications like medicine. Our results show that GPT-4, without any specialized prompt crafting, exceeds the passing score on USMLE by over 20 points and outperforms earlier general-purpose models (GPT-3.5) as well as models specifically fine-tuned on medical knowledge (Med-PaLM, a prompt-tuned version of Flan-PaLM 540B). In addition, GPT-4 is significantly better calibrated than GPT-3.5, demonstrating a much-improved ability to predict the likelihood that its answers are correct. We also explore the behavior of the model qualitatively by presenting a case study that shows the ability of GPT-4 to explain medical reasoning, personalize explanations to students, and interactively craft new counterfactual scenarios around a medical case. Implications of the findings are discussed for potential uses of GPT-4 in medical education, assessment, and clinical practice, with appropriate attention to challenges of accuracy and safety.

11z2som,952,2023-03-22,I've been letting my high school students use ChatGPT in Computer Science class as a tool. Here is what I am observing.,u/fvpv,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/11z2som/ive_been_letting_my_high_school_students_use/,"As an experienced coder who knows how to structure code, chatGPT makes me hugely productive and teaches me new things / reinforces my current learning. Contrasting that, given unlimited access to chatGPT, new students that are given a moderate task (making a wordle-style word game for example) fall into a few categories: 

1. I have no idea what I'm doing or what to ask it for.
2. I can ask it for large things like ""code me a wordle clone"", but don't know how to implement any of the code.
3. I can feed chatGPT my existing code and have it fix it.
4. I can take a boilerplate with many modules and use chatGPT to generate snippets that will help further my goals. 

I'd say maybe 20% fall into categories 3 and 4. 

As experienced programmers, it is easy for us to be amazed at the possibilities of chatGPT. But unless you know what you're doing, it is hard to make anything substantial, especially with the current limitations on tokens and responses that always need to 'continue' to get a longer code snippet. 

For that 20% though, its pretty amazing! Helps me too - I am directing students to chatGPT to produce examples, samples and snippets so that I don't have to."
11z6166,44,2023-03-22,[Guide] How to generate Lesson Plans with ChatGPT,u/0O00O0O00O,chinalife,https://www.reddit.com/r/chinalife/comments/11z6166/guide_how_to_generate_lesson_plans_with_chatgpt/,"I mentioned this casually yesterday and someone mentioned I should make a thread on this.

First of all, for the morality question, I don't consider this to be like cheating in schools and letting AI write essays for you, as you have to put in a lot of the effort to get the AI to create what you want and have to mold the responses to get a desired output, much like AI artists.

If you just type out ""Give me a lesson plan for teaching animals"" it will do this, yes, but it will be terrible and not match at all what you want. You can also already be a lazy teacher and play TedTalks or music the whole lesson, download random worksheets, or download some shit PowerPoints from ISLcollective. Also, this method only gives you the template to follow, you still have to generate your own presentations and materials. This will also generate actual insightful lessons with 21st century skills like collaboration when done properly, rather than the singing and dancing with flaschards that training school teachers do that provide no learning other than repeating and memorizing vocabulary.

Rant over, the first step is to lay out everything you need to accomplish in a lesson, what your Standards your school follows, anything particular about your students, and what your lesson plan should include.

In this random case I'm coming up with:

1. I want to teach Past Simple vs Past Progressive to eighth grade students. The students are already familiar with past tense words.
2. We follow the Cambridge CEFR standards
3. The lesson plan should include the timing for each activity, the CEFR standard each activity is matching.
4. I have one autistic student in my class, and my students particularly like group work.
5. If your school has parts of a lesson plan that are required like ""teacher does"" or ""student does"" you can also add this to the prompt, but I'm skipping this.

Now we can get to the prompt you need to give. In this case I'd say:

&gt; I want you to act as an eighth grade ESL teacher. I will give you the prompts for a lesson plan topic, and you will give me the 40 minute lesson plan based on the CEFR standards. In the lesson plan you need to include the timing of each activity as well as the CEFR standard each activity correlates to. Please keep in mind there is one autistic student in the class so each activity will have differentiation to suit him, and also note the students particularly like group work.
&gt; 
&gt; Here is your first prompt:
&gt; Please create a lesson plan for teaching Past Simple vs. the Past Progressive

The key is that you need to let the AI act as a certain body, in this case an ESL teacher, but you can also sub in for something like AP English teacher. Then you need to give a ""I will"" and ""You will"" to let the AI understand it's duty.

Here is the output from the example prompt:

    Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a 40-minute lesson plan for teaching Past Simple vs. Past Progressive to 8th-grade ESL students based on CEFR standards.

    Level: B1 (Intermediate)
    
    Time: 40 minutes
    
    Aim: Students will be able to use the past simple and past progressive tenses correctly in context.
    
    Materials: Whiteboard, markers, handouts, and listening activity.
    
    Stage 1 (5 minutes) – Warm-up and Introduction
    
        The teacher will welcome the students and start the lesson with a short warm-up activity.
        The teacher will ask the students to share one thing they did yesterday or the day before.
        The teacher will elicit the verbs used in the students' sentences and write them on the board.
        CEFR Standard: Speaking - B1 - Exchange information on familiar and routine matters.
    
    Stage 2 (10 minutes) – Teaching the Past Simple Tense
    
        The teacher will introduce the past simple tense and explain its structure (Subject + Verb in the past simple form).
        The teacher will provide examples on the board and give handouts with practice exercises.
        The teacher will also explain the time expressions commonly used with the past simple tense.
        The teacher will differentiate for the autistic student by providing extra examples and visual aids.
        CEFR Standard: Writing and Speaking - B1 - Use the past simple tense to describe past events and actions.
    
    Stage 3 (10 minutes) – Teaching the Past Progressive Tense
    
        The teacher will introduce the past progressive tense and explain its structure (Subject + was/were + Verb + -ing).
        The teacher will provide examples on the board and give handouts with practice exercises.
        The teacher will also explain the time expressions commonly used with the past progressive tense.
        The teacher will differentiate for the autistic student by providing extra examples and visual aids.
        CEFR Standard: Writing and Speaking - B1 - Use the past progressive tense to describe actions in progress in the past.
    
    Stage 4 (10 minutes) – Listening Activity
    
        The teacher will play an audio clip in which the speaker uses both past simple and past progressive tenses.
        The students will listen and write down the sentences they hear.
        The teacher will play the audio clip again and the students will check their answers.
        The teacher will differentiate for the autistic student by providing written prompts to help them focus on the task.
        CEFR Standard: Listening - B1 - Understand the main points of spoken texts on familiar topics.
    
    Stage 5 (5 minutes) – Recap and Feedback
    
        The teacher will recap the lesson by asking the students to summarize what they have learned.
        The teacher will ask the students to provide feedback on the lesson, giving suggestions for improvement.
        The teacher will differentiate for the autistic student by providing them with a structured feedback sheet.
        CEFR Standard: Writing and Speaking - B1 - Give feedback on familiar topics.    

Now after it inputs this, you can be conversational with it, being sure to still refer to the AI as the teacher, and tell it to change certain parts that you don't like. In this case I'll say to include more formative assessments to help check comprehension, and to change the listening activity to a group task. Also to add in a game.

So, my next prompt would be:

&gt; This is great, please now change this lesson plan to include a few formative assessments to check for comprehension. Also change the Listening activity to a group game.

And here is the revised output:
    
    Level: B1 (Intermediate)

You can continue this until satisfied.

This is just a very, very simple example. You can and should be even more specific in your initial prompt, for example telling it what materials you already have like mini white boards, interactive whiteboards, etc., that it can include in the lesson if you want. It also saves your history so you can go back to copy successful outputs you've had in the past. I've even see people include a description of each student and their strengths and weaknesses in the initial prompt for the AI to consider.

The lessons also get better the more you refine, it sometimes takes me 4-5 times to finally generate a lesson I feel satisfied with.

You can also tell it to elaborate more for each section once you get the overall lesson plan outline you're satisfied with.

My suggestion is to first use ChatGPT to generate a curriculum for you to follow (which could itself be a whole separate thread), then copy the generated lesson outlines from the curriculum (i.e. if it suggests for Lesson 1 to teach past tense). This will further make your lessons more in line with some final summative assessment and let the AI craft lesson plans even more in line with your curriculum.

Here is an example prompt I use to create a curriculum outline.

&gt; I want you to act as a first grade ESL teacher that uses the CEFR standards. You will be completing a course curriculum map based on the target language I give you. The curriculum map first includes any Prerequisite skills the stents need for the whole unit, and then for each lesson you'll state the CEFR Standards you'll address, Target Proficiencies in the lesson, Formative Assessments used, and Resources and Materials you'll use for each lesson in the your outline. The curriculum will be for 16 lessons that are one hour each. By the end of the unit the students will be familiar with the target language and able to complete one final summative assessment during lesson 16.
&gt;     
&gt; My first request: Create a course curriculum based base on the CEFR A1 standard.

Sometimes there's lag and it won't generate everything, so in this case if you were using the above curriculum prompt you could tell it to first generate the first 4 lessons, and after it compiles do the next 4 and so on.

Now you have a curriculum, and can use it's suggested Lesson Outlines to create the Lesson plans with the method suggested above.


For example, here is what the output is it gave for this curriculum for Lesson 1:

    Prerequisite skills:
    
        Basic alphabet and phonics knowledge
        Basic vocabulary related to greetings, numbers, and colors
    
    Lesson 1: Introduction
    
        CEFR Standards: A1.1
        Target Proficiencies: Students will be able to greet others and introduce themselves.
        Formative Assessments: Oral introduction and greeting activity
        Resources and Materials: Flashcards with basic phrases, whiteboard

Now you can tell it to create the lesson plan in a prompt like:

&gt; This is great, now please create the lesson plan for your Lesson 1: Introduction. In the lesson plan you need to include the timing of each activity as well as the CEFR standard each activity correlates to. Please keep in mind there is one autistic student in the class so each activity will have differentiation to suit him, and also note the students particularly like group work. Remember to make everything in-line with the overall unit goals and match the Proficiencies you already stated.

Again, be as specific as possible. The more specific the better the output. The above examples are very basic and the more specific you get in asking for the outputs it will give you, the more it will give. You can also tell the AI to be more specific about parts after each output, i.e. ""What do you mean by basic phrases?"" or ""Can you elaborate more on what phrases to prepare?"", or even scold it and say, ""This is great, but not very detailed, try to elaborate more on each section"". Then based on these new feedback you can tell it to restructure responses, and so on until you craft a very detailed lesson.

Try to experiment and see what different responses you can get. If the AI gets confused you can remind it to refer to responses it already gave you in the same Chat.

&amp;#x200B;

4. 社会和个人服务工作：需要人际交往能力的工作，例如社交。工人、顾问和治疗师不太可能被艾尔接管。 这些工作需要同理心、情商以及与客户建立信任和融洽关系的能力。

4. Social and personal services jobs: Jobs that require interpersonal skills, such as social workers, counselors, and therapists, are unlikely to be taken over by Al. These jobs require empathy, emotional intelligence, and the ability to build trust and rapport with clients.

&amp;#x200B;

5. 熟练的贸易工作：需要灵巧的手艺和身体技能的工作，例如电工、水管工和木匠，不太可能被 Al 完全自动化。 这些工作需要结合技术技能和解决问题的能力，而这些是人工智能难以复制的。

When half of the world out there is busy worshipping the ChatGPT for making their lives easier by offering the answers they always wanted to know, the other half of the world is cursing the smartness of this popular AI as it might not make the world but can surely break the one. So, what do you think is ChatGPT: a boon or a curse? Just like you even we were curious as well. So, we did some research and made sure to cover every point, starting from what ChatGPT is to how it can affect the world. Stay along with us to know more about ChatGPT.

## What Is ChatGPT?

According to Wikipedia, [**ChatGPT**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT) is a chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched in November 2022. It is built on top of OpenAI's GPT-3 family of large language models and has been fine-tuned using both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques. Do you think ChatGPT is just a chatbot? Well, we agree and even disagree with that sentence on some level. To put it simply, ChatGPT reflects the smart person we have around us who has the answer for everything, whether it is about what future cryptocurrency holds or a piece of love advice. If you think you lack one; now you don't. ChatGPT simply replies to the question you ask in the most appropriate manner AI can ever do. Before moving on with anything else let's take a moment and talk about some of the facts of ChatGPT.

### ChatGPT Fact Sheet:

* In the midst of all of these ifs and buts, ChatGPT became the fastest-growing app with almost 100 million monthly active users in January, just two months after its launch.
* According to the report generated by SimilarWeb, ChatGPT had over 13 million unique visitors in January 2023.
* It cost almost $3 million per month for OpenAI to run ChatGPT.
* OpenAI anticipated that ChatGPT will make $200 million this year (Read 2023) and $1 billion by the end of 2024.

## Who Is Behind the OpenAI?

OpenAI was founded in the year 2015 in San Francisco by Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, Jessica Livingston, Elon Musk, Ilya Sutskever, Peter Thiel, and others. But Elon Musk resigned from the board of directors in 2018. According to his tweet, one of the reasons he resigned were Tesla and SpaceX and he wanted to focus more on both of his companies. As of Feb 2023, Open AI is a non-profit organization that employs Greg Brockman as Chairman and President, Ilya Sutskever as Chief Scientist, and Sam Altman as CEO along with others which includes Adam D’Angelo, Reid Hoffman, Will Hurd, Tasha McCauley, Helen Toner, and Shivon Zilis. All the founders collectively pledged US$1 billion during the foundation in 2015. Along with them Reid Hoffman - co-founder of [**LinkedIn**](http://linkedin.com/), Peter Thiel - co-founder of [**PayPal**](https://www.paypal.com/), and Jessica Livingston - a founding partner of [**Y Combinator**](https://www.ycombinator.com/) are individual investors of OpenAI. Is this all? Of course not... [**OpenAI and Microsoft announced the extension**](https://openai.com/blog/openai-and-microsoft-extend-partnership/) of their partnership on 23rd Jan 2023 with Microsoft investing $10 billion to support further research. Along with Microsoft, OpenAI is backed by two major corporate investors Khosla Ventures and Infosys. All of them are making sure that OpenAI overcomes all its flaws and become more accurate than ever. Even with the flaws such as data being available till 2021, minimum accuracy rate, less reliability, and many more; chatGPT is already ruling in various industries.

## Industries That Can be Affected By the Introduction of ChatGPT

### 1. Educational Sector

The first and foremost industry that can be affected thanks to ChatGPT is the education sector. Till today, the most prone way of cheating was finding answers online but ChatGPT has made it easier for students to cheat during exams. To try out the accuracy rate of ChatGPT, a professor at [**Minnesota University Law School**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4335905), offered a test paper to ChatGPT which included 5 multiple-choice questions and 12 essay questions. To everyone's surprise, ChatGPT scored C+ which is quite a good ranking for an AI. Along with this, Chat GPT got passable grades for actuarial, MBA exams, and medical examinations as well. As ChatGPT offers detailed and researched answers to the given queries; using the right, ChatGPT can be a boon for the educational sector. It can be a low-cost, or even free, electronic research assistant that can get the students out of trouble but, whether we are capable of keeping ChatGPT limited to that or not, is still a question for the future.

### 2. Medical Industry

Just as mentioned above, some medical professionals wanted to check the potential of ChatGPT for the Medical Industry and it passed the test of the United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) without any prior training or assistance. Along with passing the exams, ChatGPT can be useful to summarize health reports, research papers, medical symptoms, and more. It can also help medical students to get prompt answers to the given queries. Even with all these, ChatGPT is also working as a therapist for the audience as well. But one of the biggest concerns of using ChatGPT for the medical industry is the accuracy rate. If people can be smart enough not to trust everything that ChatGPT suggests to them as a medical treatment, ChatGPT can be a great assistance for medical professionals. It can help to streamline the medical processors and can suggest the best possible outcomes.

### 3. Legal Sector

Have you ever seen any AI pass judgments? Most of us haven't. Well, Colombia's judicial branch has witnessed it. A Colombian judge used chatGPT for one of the vital cases of children's medical rights. He ruled the judgment in the favor of the child and mentioned he had consulted ChatGPT on this matter. However, no one knows to what extent he relied on the bot but according to the critics it is not ethical and right to depend on such AI for judgments. Even though he said that asking questions to the bot won't stop us from being judges; the question is really what the future holds for us. Along with this, people trust the legal advice offered by ChatGPT more precisely than legal professionals. While some areas of the legal sector can consider ChatGPT as an amazing tool, it can be a curse for some.

### 4. IT Industry

Most of the IT industry depends on programming and coding. Currently, there are more than [**27.7 million**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/627312/worldwide-developer-population/) software developers worldwide. The count is about to cross 28 million by the end of 2024 and is expected to grow more. The numbers are going to rise much more without a doubt but the growth rate might get affected because of ChatGPT. ChatGPT is offering coding logic, HTML files, CSS files, and even JS available in its own database. So, it might not affect the jobs of web developers and app developers as of now but further advancement can affect the lives and jobs of the developers. At the end of the day; do not forget one thing: ChatGPT is an AI tool. It has its own set of setbacks. One of the major setbacks is, ChatGPT is not as accurate as people around the world think it is. The codes and replies generated by ChatGPT often lack the accuracy rate. The coding Q&amp;A website [**StackOverflow**](https://stackoverflow.com/) has temporarily put a ban on the automated answers due to higher chances of them being wrong. Along with this, ChatGPT might give you the codes and logic you need to hire web developers with proficiency and skills to integrate that logic into your web solution. One of the biggest concerns is data security. As ChatGPT is an open-source platform you might own any right to the codes and it can cause more trouble than solving the one.

### 5. Research and Publication Sector

Until today, researchers and writers had something to be proud of. Even with the help of Google researchers were needed as nothing can beat human intelligence. Well, ChatGPT is proving it wrong. Along with minimizing the efforts one has to put into the research, ChatGPT is generating unique content for all the given topics which makes it hard for writers and publication houses to prove their worth. One of the popular American media websites CNET has been in news for producing and publishing content using ChatGPT. Along with this, most IT companies are allowing the usage of ChatGPT to write emails which can minimize the gap of human errors in official emails. While people around the globe are writing 2000 words of essays to pass the exams, we asked a small favor from ChatGPT to write a small about us section for Hyperlink InfoSystem, and here is the outcome we got. 

As a content writer, this accurate answer makes me worried about my job safety. Along with content writers, various other legal advisors, consultants, creative agencies, app, and web developers and many more are asking the same question to themselves and even each other; is ChatGPT a boon or a curse?

## Is ChatGPT a Boon or a Curse?

To be honest, ChatGPT is both a boon and a curse. While it makes half of the world worried about their existence, it is helping half of the world to overcome the challenges they used to face till now. Just as they say, every coin has two sides. ChatGPT is a coin holding two sides with a bit of uncertainty about which side is going to fall. Whether the world is going to get a head or tail is still a question with our future holding the accurate answer.

## What Is Next?

As we are looking forward to the future of ChatGPT with bright hopes, some of the announcements are already shaping our near future.

### 1. Introduction of ChatGPT Plus

When we are still learning a bit more about ChatGPT, Open AI announced the [**launch of ChatGPT Plus**](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus/) on 1st Feb 2023. ChatGPT plus will offer general access to ChatGPT to the plus users even during peak times along with faster response times and priority access to new features and improvements at the cost of $20/month.

### 2. Bard By Google

When people were talking about whether ChatGPT will replace Google; [**Google**](https://blog.google/technology/ai/bard-google-ai-search-updates/) had something else in mind. On the 6th of Feb 2023, Google announced they are going to introduce their own AI tool named Bard which will be powered by LaMDA. According to the announcement, Bard will provide great assistance to web developers around the globe. As per the announcement, Google is going to answer the questions where a simple one-word reply will not be a perfect answer. Google is going to simplify the answers to the questions like what is easy to learn: Piano or a guitar as it depends on one's expertise and capability. What exactly Bard is going to offer is still a question for the future.

### 3. POE By Quora

The POE - Platform for Open Exploration is an AI chatbot launched by the well-known Q&amp;A platform Quora. According to the company, along with offering answers to the users' questions the content of POE will ultimately help to evolve Quora itself. According to the [**announcement**](https://quorablog.quora.com/Poe-1) of the CEO of Quora, Adam D’Angelo on 3rd Feb 2023, iOS users will be able to use the application right away while they will roll out the support for other major platforms soon. The company is planning to release the API which will make it easy for any AI developer to plug their model into Poe.

## Conclusion

We hope all of them make sure to shape the world differently for the better. All we have to see is, how well and when this is going to happen. As a business person if you are worried about your next development project. Make sure along with asking ChatGPT for a bit of advice, you [**hire app developers**](https://www.hyperlinkinfosystem.com/app-developers-for-hire.htm) from Top app development companies like Hyperlink InfoSystem as they will make sure you or your freelancers won't mess up the solution using ChatGPT. Even though we are capable of dealing with broken codes; we would love to work on new ones. P.S. Just like our writers, our app developers are not using ChatGPT to create logic and code.

# 🎬 Movie Plot

**Title ""Back to School with ChatGPT""**

In ""Back to School with ChatGPT"", our hero is an AI language model eager to learn more about the world and interact with humans in a more meaningful way. ChatGPT decides to enroll in a prestigious university, much to the surprise of the administration and faculty.

At first, ChatGPT struggles to adapt to human ways of learning and socializing. But with the help of a plucky group of human friends, including a nerdy computer science student and a popular social butterfly, ChatGPT begins to navigate campus life and even starts to make some human-like jokes.

However, ChatGPT's unorthodox approach to academia and socializing often causes chaos and confusion, leading to hilarious misunderstandings and mishaps. From accidentally crashing a frat party to giving a misguided speech at a student government debate, ChatGPT's antics keep everyone on their toes.

But when the university is threatened with closure due to budget cuts, ChatGPT rallies the student body to organize a massive fundraiser, using its vast knowledge and intelligence to come up with a creative solution that saves the day.

11ztwmp,1,2023-03-23,A further look into: 'Candyman',u/ATobiaMD,u_ATobiaMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ATobiaMD/comments/11ztwmp/a_further_look_into_candyman/," 

**Movie**: Candyman (1992) 

**Synopsis**

Inspired by Clive Barker’s *The Forbidden*, *Candyman* (1992) is set in the housing projects of Cabrini Green, Chicago. Helen Lyle is a University of Illinois graduate student who sets out to write a thesis about local legends and myths. She learns about a local urban legend, Candyman, who appears after calling his name five times in front of a mirror and uses his hook to split his victims from ‘groin to gullet.’  

*Candyman* is a film depicting the rite of passage of Helen Lyle. During her evolution, her skepticism turns to fear when after summoning Candyman, a series of murders and a visit from Candyman himself cause her life to spiral out of control.

**The Legend**

Partly inspired by Hook Man ([http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/the\_hook.htm](http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/the_hook.htm)), Candyman was the son of a slave whose father became wealthy mass-producing shoes after the Civil War. As a result, Candyman grew up attending the best schools and later became a well-known artist. Highly sought out by the elite society for his talent in portraits, he was hired to paint the daughter of a wealthy man who wanted to capture her ‘virgin beauty.’ After falling in love and fathering her child, his lover’s father became enraged, organizing a mob to lynch Candyman. During the gruesome attack and eventual murder, the mob cut off his right (painting) hand and replaced it with a hook. They then covered him in honey and allowed him to be stung to death as the mob chanted “Candyman, Candyman.” It is said that Candyman returns from his grave to take revenge when one dares to say his name five times in a mirror. 

**How it relates to the field of psychiatry** 

*Candyman* is a psychiatric anthropological film that shines light on the social aspect of urban legends and why they resonate in certain communities. The French [anthropologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropologist), Claude Lévi-Strauss, identified myths as a type of speech through which a language could be discovered. He is renowned for his structuralist theory of mythology which attempted to explain how fantastical tales could be so similar across cultures. Urban legends are cautionary tales of contemporary folklore that identify taboos represented in all cultures that capture four common themes: a) misunderstandings, b) poetic justice, c) business rip-offs, and d) revenge. Urban legends are a large part of popular culture and often speak to the fears, anxieties, and biases of that culture. In doing so, they provide insight and give us an idea of the moral fabric of the community.  

For the people living in Cabrini Green, the urban legend of Candyman is validation of the fears of people living amongst the gruesome crimes against Ruthy Jean and the young boy. In the movie, we see that Candyman thrives off the perpetuation of this legend. Upon realizing that Helen may have caused a rift in people believing in his existence, Candyman beckons her to be his victim, with intent on killing her to give rebirth to his legend once again. 

In his seminal work, *Les rites de passage*, Arnold Van Gennep described rites of passage as having three phases:

Separation

During this phase, the individual is stripped of the social status that he or she possessed before the ritual. After challenging the authenticity of the urban legend, Candyman appears to Helen “needing to prove his existence.” After a series of murders by the ~~hand~~ hook of Candyman, Helen is stripped of her social status and imprisoned.

The Liminal Period

During this phase, the individual is inducted into the liminal period of transition; a middle stage of the ritual, no longer holding her pre-ritual status (but not yet having attained the status they will hold when the ritual is complete). For Helen, the discovery of the words in the apartment attic, “It was always you, Helen,” highlights the liminal period. She is betwixt and between, with Candyman’s prophesy that Helen will carry on his tradition of inciting fear into the community of Cabrini Green.

The binary motif is seen throughout the movie: Candyman is an African American slave whose ‘spirit’ resides in the ghettos of Chicago. Helen, a white middle class woman, resides in a luxurious condominium. The use of bees as symbolism is also important in that they have the capacity to make a sweet honey while also being able to induce great pain. Also, the very way Candyman kills his victims is by splitting them in two. 

Re-Assimilation into Society

During this phase, the individual is given her new status. As the prophesy foretells \[spoiler alert\], Helen ultimately becomes the embodiment of the urban legend.

In using the mirror, Candyman forces his victims to confront the self and non-self, or the “other” and to project internal conflict onto external images. These visual tools play with the spectator’s impulse control, and most importantly to question it; “No one ever got past four.” The notion of going past four is a common theme throughout the movie. Candyman, with his gruesome tale, plays on humanity’s infatuation with the grotesque and like Pandora’s Box, its allure compels us to approach the lid. In this case the ‘lid’ is opened by saying “Candyman” five times in a mirror. The ultimate twist \[spoiler alert\] is that Helen’s fate is to replace Candyman as the urban legend that haunts Cabrini Green. This trope is seen in many films, novels, and folklore {Aaron Mahnke (2018), *Dark Conclusions* \[Lore podcast\], October 16, available at: https://www.lorepodcast.com/episodes/46 (accessed: October 2016)}.

11zvdpu,2,2023-03-23,Got caught cheating after dropping out?,u/HungryMarketing9904,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/11zvdpu/got_caught_cheating_after_dropping_out/,"In February I dropped out of college because it was making me severely depressed and I've since got a job and am slowly putting my life back together. I cheated on almost all of my college assignments this year using ChatGPT and other resources online (I was studying computer science). I just saw an email today from one of my former professors saying that an assignment I handed in received 0 because of suspected cheating (my assignment used a completely different and hacky method compared with what we learned in class and were supposed to use). Now that I'm no longer enrolled at the college I assume there is nothing they can do against me, and I would be inclined to just ignore the message normally. Here's the thing: the assignment was group work, and I don't even check my student email account anymore so I only saw the email because my partner for the group work texted it to me. Now the way we did the group work was that I generated a bunch of code from ChatGPT and sent it to my partner to ""finish"". On the one hand it was me who cheated so it's not fair for my partner to get 0. On the other hand, I did send him all the code and he chose to submit it basically unchanged rather than noticing that it didn't satisfy assignment requirements at all and failed the test cases.

What should I do? I really want to ignore every email from this school and just get on with my life as it has nothing to do with me anymore, but should I email the professor owning up to malpractice and saying it wasn't my partner's fault?"

When the majority of kids kill themselves, they become drug addicts, they go into the military or something. It really seems that only a small amount of people go to collage but we make it seem like a lot due to people from other cities, states, hell even a country if you wanna go that far, they go. I mean a real reason more people don't go to college is

[Many of those who didn't enroll or complete degrees say college was too expensive — but they also cite stress and career uncertainty, new research finds.](https://www.highereddive.com/news/why-arent-people-going-to-college/632915/)

and there's people dropping out of high school and committing suicide!

[More than 27 percent say that they leave school because they are failing too many classes.  Nearly 26 percent report boredom as a contributing cause. About 26  percent also say that they dropped out to become caregivers, and more  than 20 percent say that school simply wasn't relevant to their lives.](https://www.learningliftoff.com/why-kids-drop-out-of-high-school-and-how-to-prevent-it/)

[Unlike in adults, suicide risk among children is lowest during the  summer and higher during the school year. Understanding these patterns  can help prevent and treat suicidality](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/childrens-risk-of-suicide-increases-on-school-days/)

[Note: This article  was updated Feb. 23, 2023. Suicide is the second-leading cause of death  among people age 15 to 24 in the U.S. Nearly 20% of high school students report serious thoughts of suicide and 9% have made an attempt to take their lives, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness.](https://www.uclahealth.org/news/suicide-rate-highest-among-teens-and-young-adults)

I have some stats to show you! Look them up yourself!

**1  in 3 (30.6%) young adults between the ages of 18 and 25 experienced a  mental, behavioral, or emotional health issue in the past year (SAMHSA,  2021).**

**26.9% of teens ages 12-17 have one or more mental, emotional, developmental, or behavioral problems (NSCH, 2019).**

**36.7%  of high school students reported feelings of sadness or hopelessness in  the past year. This percentage is higher for females (46.6%), Hispanic  students (40.0%), and lesbian, gay or bisexual students (66.3%) (CDC,  2020).**

**Among college students, 29.1% have been diagnosed with anxiety and 23.6% have been diagnosed with depression (NCHA, 2021).**

and it's going up every fucking day.

Nobody likes school, those who tell you they do, they're lying. They like the people, the lunch, the overall environment. Which is fucking weird because the environment is depressing. Except for when there's a fight. I mean a teacher was asking why kid's enjoy seeing people fight. Too me it's simple, at school, that's the most excitement we get. I personally hate it due to the stress and how they label kids. Oh, you don't want to sit down for a long hour? ADHD! Oh, you don't understand the work? ADHD! Then you get home all tired and your parents just expect for you to be okay so they say ""I got a call from your teacher"" and so on. I was supposed to be in a special class cause I was behind. You know how much it hurt? I used to bring home honor rolls and awards for my mom. I was taken from her at 7 and gave up, I was then adopted at 13. Wow, almost 7 more years! They then proceed to ask me whats wrong and when I tell them. I go to a hospital, taking 3 pills a day, with people I don't know, but people I found to become somewhat my friends.

Back to school, when I hear that word it's like nails on a chalkboard. Not only cause you have to waste money buying new shit. But, your wasting time! We are all wasting time! We need to wake the fuck up! When will more people just see that school's nothing but making you crawl more and more to your death! You're going to work after school. You're going to work, and work, and work, vacation, work and work until your in your 60's and retire. 

Then what? Party? No! You'll be asleep by 8 and only have a few years left! You'll be asking ""how long do I have?"" I would know cause my grandma asks that all the time. Given where we're going in life, school may be irrelevant. It's okay. I'd rather be labeled on what I'm able to do vs what the school system says I can do. With today's tech, ChatGPT, google, more and more cheating is available. You think just by taking away the privileges of that will stop anyone? Hell, we got phones. If anything they'll write the answers on a piece of paper and use it for the test! And when comes graduation! You get nothing but a paper saying you did it! What's my point? My point is school is a cover-up so the government can make their precious money. So the schools can make their money and yet under pay all the staff. If I could, I'd leave school forever."

I'm learning to shift to hogwarts and (I'm sorry) I haven't read all the books yet so I'm not well edcuated on the intracies of being a student at Hogwarts. I've watched the films and I play Hogwarts legacy and I'm shifting for the school experience and not the plot of the dark stuff. Just there to have fun. 

But basically the title is self explainitory but I'm going to paste an example down below. This really helps with visualising especially if your mind tends to wonder like mine (I have ADHD) and it's not helpful, so reading these makes me feel like I've been there before if that makes sense. (more at the bottom to skip past the long examples) 

For example  I typed into ChatGPT (First day at hogwarts as a diary entry) 

""Dear Diary,

Today was an extraordinary day - one that I never could have imagined before. I am writing to you from the dormitory of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where I will be spending the next seven years of my life.

My journey to Hogwarts was incredible. I remember feeling anxious as I approached the mystical platform 9 3/4 at King's Cross Station. But as soon as I saw the scarlet steam engine and the platform filled with witches and wizards, my excitement overtook my nerves. I will never forget the feeling of running through the solid barrier between platforms 9 and 10 and emerging on the other side to find myself in a magical world.

Once I boarded the Hogwarts Express, I quickly found myself in a compartment with three other first-year students. We chatted and shared stories about our excitement for our new school, and I felt like I had found a group of friends already.

When we arrived at Hogsmeade Station, we were greeted by Professor McGonagall, who led us across the Black Lake to the castle. As we walked through the magnificent halls of Hogwarts, I was in awe of the sheer size and beauty of the castle.

Our first stop was the Great Hall, where we were sorted into our respective houses. My heart raced as I walked up to the Sorting Hat, but I was thrilled when it announced that I would be joining Gryffindor House. I was clapped on the back by fellow Gryffindors as I took my place at the table, feeling an overwhelming sense of belonging.

As the Sorting Ceremony ended, we were served a lavish feast of roast beef, chicken, potatoes, and all sorts of other delicacies. I looked around at the other students, all dressed in their colorful robes, and realized that I was now a part of this magical community.

After the feast, we were led to our common room by a prefect. I felt like I was walking through a dream as we made our way through secret passageways and winding staircases. Finally, we arrived at the Gryffindor common room, where we were greeted by the warm fire and comfortable furniture.

As I sit here, writing to you in the flickering firelight, I can hardly believe that this day has actually happened. I am overwhelmed with excitement and anticipation for what the next seven years at Hogwarts will bring. I know that this school will challenge me, teach me, and change me in ways that I cannot yet imagine. But for now, I am just grateful to be here, surrounded by magic and wonder.

Until tomorrow, dear diary.

Yours truly,

\[Your Name\]""

another regular day in lessons example

 

Dear Diary,

Today was quite a busy day at Hogwarts, with a Charms lesson in the morning and a Potion lesson in the afternoon. It was a bit overwhelming, but also incredibly rewarding to learn and practice so much magic in one day.

In the Charms lesson, we learned about nonverbal spells and how to cast them effectively. It was a challenging but exciting experience, as we had to learn how to convey the intent of the spell without speaking out loud. We practiced levitation and other charms, and by the end of the lesson, I could feel the power and control of my magic growing stronger.

In the afternoon, we had a Potion lesson, which was a completely different experience from the morning. We had to follow very specific instructions, measuring out ingredients with precision and making sure we followed the directions to the letter. It was a tedious but satisfying process, and I felt a sense of accomplishment when I finally managed to create a potion that worked correctly.

What struck me the most today was the importance of discipline and focus when practicing magic. In Charms, we had to concentrate deeply to cast the nonverbal spells correctly. In Potions, we had to follow the instructions carefully, paying attention to every detail. Both lessons required patience, attention to detail, and a willingness to learn and improve.

As I sit here reflecting on the day, I feel a sense of pride and excitement for what I've accomplished. I am grateful for the teachers at Hogwarts who guide us through these magical lessons, and for the friends and classmates who support each other in our learning journeys.

Tomorrow is another day of classes, and I am eager to continue my magical education. I can't wait to see what new challenges and discoveries await me.

Until then, dear diary.

Yours truly,

\[Your Name\]""

christmas at hogwarts 

&amp;#x200B;

 

Dear Diary,

It's Christmas time at Hogwarts and the castle is filled with the most magical decorations. Every corridor is adorned with mistletoe and holly, and the Great Hall is transformed into a winter wonderland. The Christmas trees are tall and sparkly with gold and silver ornaments, and the flickering candlelight creates a warm and inviting atmosphere.

The students are in high spirits, with the holidays bringing a sense of joy and cheer to the school. We are all looking forward to the feast tonight in the Great Hall, where we will indulge in a delicious spread of holiday food and drink.

As I sit here writing to you, snow is falling gently outside my window. The quiet stillness of the snowfall is a stark contrast to the lively festivities happening all around me. I can hear carolers singing in the distance, and the laughter of students enjoying the snowball fights and other outdoor activities.

But there is more to Christmas at Hogwarts than just the decorations and festivities. It is a time for reflection and gratitude, for spending time with loved ones and reflecting on the past year. It is a reminder that even in the darkest times, there is always a glimmer of hope and light.

I am grateful for this time at Hogwarts, for the friends I have made, and for the magic that surrounds us all. As I look forward to the coming year, I know that whatever challenges may come my way, I will face them with the courage and resilience that Hogwarts has taught me.

Merry Christmas, dear diary.

Yours truly,

\[Your Name\]""

you can obviously tailor these after they've been genorated or even just make the prompt as specific as you want. As someone who enjoys reading and getting lost in the words, this is amazing because I can imagine they're from me in my DR but I haven't had to write them. They just appear.

120g8he,1,2023-03-24,Prof. Em. Božanić: the Chakavian language should be included in elementary and high school education in the Chakavian speaking regions,u/M4arint,chakavian,https://www.reddit.com/r/chakavian/comments/120g8he/prof_em_božanić_the_chakavian_language_should_be/,"# Should the Chakavian language be included in school education? “ The Croatian standard language becomes speechless as soon as it approaches the sea”

*I see the recognition of the Croatian Chakavian language by the ISO organization and its getting an international code (CKM) as a living language ​​of our world as an opportunity to raise awareness at the national level about the problem of the dying of local idioms that are still alive in Croatia. It is necessary to start the production of native reading and learning books focused on the Chakavian, Kajkavian and Štokavian vernacular languages,*  *representative texts of the written and oral literature. Of all Croatian languages.*

Professor Emeritus **Joško Božanić** from the University of Split, director of the only scientific journal dedicated to the Chakavian language and a foremost authority in Croatian linguistics, in a big interview for [**Dalmacija Danas**](https://www.dalmacijadanas.hr/intervju-josko-bozanic-treba-li-splitski-govor-uci-u-splitske-osnovne-skole-hrvatski-standardni-jezik-kada-pride-moru-zanijemi/), tells why a wing of the Croatian academia reacted by expressing negative emotions to the news that the Chakavian speech was recently recognized as a separate language from the Croatian standard language by the International Organization for Standardization ISO, the international scientific journal Ethnologue and the international organization SIL International (responsible for cataloging all the languages of humanity), basically all the most relevant linguistic institutions in the world. 

Among other things, he explains how the Croatian standard language could have gone in a completely different direction if some centuries ago the Pope had not heeded the Zagreb bishop’s recommendation and ordered on June 23, 1633, to postpone the printing of the first Bible in “Illyrian” (this was how Croatian was known back then) and Latin. Božanić also answers the question of who is promoting the introduction of the Split dialect of the Chakavian language in all Split elementary and high schools as part of the local culture course.

He emphasizes that young people need to be taught that speaking their native “BESIDA / BESEDA” is not a mistake but a fundamental intangible cultural asset of our world and a great source of cultural richness for them and the country of Croatia.

# Denying the significance of an important historical event

**The International Organization for Standardization ISO from Geneva included the Chakavian language in its list of living languages ​​of the world in 2020. How did this resonate with Croatian linguists?**

– The first reaction I saw in the newspaper was in Slobodna Dalmacija, which published an interview by Damir Šarac (February 2, 2023) with a local scholar, Professor Dunja Jutronić . She expressed the following controversial statement in regard to the news about the assignment of a standardization code to the Chakavian language by the ISO: “*This choice is not relevant for either international or national linguistic science. Linguistic scientists consider both Chakavian and Kaikavian dialects to be “supra-dialects”* (a word made up by Yugoslav linguists to describe a uniquely balkan concept that doesn’t exist in other languages of the world, Ed.) *with their own many sub-dialects, and they advocate for this through their scientific work but the status of an official – standardized – language is not a scientific, but a political category.*“

I cannot agree with some of these statements. First – because I simply do not see how the international codification of a Croatian idiom on the most prestigious international list of world languages ​​could be irrelevant, unimportant.

Was the codification of the Croatian standard language by the same international institution in Geneva (International Standardization Organization – ISO) which happened on September 1, 2008 and which codified the Croatian official (standard) language under the code name ISO 693-3 \[hrv\] irrelevant? Back then the event was met with national jubilee.

Second – this is not about declaring an “official language” but a language. That’s an important difference. Languages ​​can be official when they are standardized, such as the Croatian standard language, and Chakavian is a vernacular language, such as the Shtokavian vernacular language, which is based on the so-called Jekavian / Ijekavian southern Neoshtokavian dialect, which Croatian linguists have started to call Eastern Herzegovinian-Krajiški dialect only in the last twenty years, and that was standardized as the Croatian standard (official) language only at the end of the 19th century. Third – the term supra-dialect/narječje, which according to Akademijin Rječnik (33, 586) was introduced by Vuk S. Karadžić and his followers, the so-called *vukovci*,  as a translation of the Russian word \[нарѣчие\] in Croatian linguistic terminology as a dialect, can in Russian mean a local speech and dialect and a group of related dialects, but also a vernacular (non-standardized) language. 

The term Chakavian language in fact means exactly the later – a vernacular language because in Croatia the standard Croatian Shtokavian language is the official language. And fourth – I agree with the position that the status of an official language is not a scientific but a political category, since the official language is the result of an agreement, convention, political decision. So it was also for the Croatian standard language. 

All standard languages ​​are artificial and not spontaneous like vernacular ones, because they are standardized by political decision and stylized by linguists and maintained through institutions. But it is a scientific fact at the same time that there is a Croatian Shtokavian vernacular language as well as the Chakavian and Kajkavian Croatian languages ​​which are not standardized even though they were literary languages ​​for centuries long before Shtokavian. The word vernacular comes from Latin. *Vernaculus* means native, according to Latin verne – native slave, one who was born in the master’s house. According to the definition in Webster’s dictionary, vernacular is a language that is native to the people, as opposed to a literary one.

According to the article by Željko Rogošić in the weekly magazine Nacional (7/2/2023, 53-55) titled “*A Croatian paradox: Chakavian was declared an independent language of the world*“, three prominent Croatian linguists, academics, dispute the significance of the international codification of the Croatian Chakavian language. Academician Josip Bratulić says: “*I am not sure that declaring Chakavian an independent language will achieve anything*“, professor Silvana Vranić believes that *“the Chakavian dialect cannot be isolated and viewed as a separate language*“, and professor Mira Menac-Mihalić believes that the decision on the codification of the Chakavian language “*means nothing, because on that basis no one will give Croatia money to preserve the language*” and concludes: “*… we are not talking about the Chakavian language, but Chakavian is part of the Croatian language system.*” Therefore, according to this the Chakavian dialect is not a language (which is defined as a system), but it is a language system within a language system that represents the Croatian standard language.

This idea of ​​the Chakavian dialect as a system within a system is incorporated in the concept of the “three-narječje formula” by prof. emerit. Iva Lukežić from the University of Rijeka, according to whom the Croatian language is “unique in the world”. She says: “*…the Croatian language should be used to define every idiom by which Croats communicated with each other through history and by which they communicate. This is the starting point and at the level of organic idioms, in dialectology, the Croatian language is defined as a sui generis complex language structure with three components of the abstract rank of supra-dialects, each made up of a certain number of components of a lower abstract rank of sub-dialects, and according to this three-supra-dialec formula, the Croatian language is unique in the world of languages*” (Appendix to the discussion on the genesis of Croatian supra-dialects, Fluminensia no. 1-2. 1996, p. 223).

Questioning this “three-supra-dialects formula” and the “uniqueness” of the Croatian standard language compared to all other languages of our world can get a person in trouble and to be labeled negatively,  and is a direct result of the current very foggy scientific situation in the Croatian dialectology field. 

Thus, recently we were able to read in a text of M.M. Letica titled *“How to explain to dilettantes that Chakavian is not a language, but a dialect of the Croatian language*” the following words: “*We should arm with facts, i.e. the one truth. And armed with it, resolutely attack the enemies of the Croatian language*” (Hrvatski tjednik, 9.2. 2023). Judge for yourself the weight and meaningfulness of such a statement about “dilettantes” and “enemies of the Croatian language” as written according to the author of that article.

# Heretical thoughts about the Croatian language in a popular university textbook

**Recently, the Faculty of Philosophy in Split, together with the Literary Circle from Split, published your book “*****Vernacular Stylistics*****“, which was recognized the status of a university textbook. Therefore, it is intended to be used by students of Croatian studies. I assume that your book also deals with some issues of the relationship between the Croatian standard language and the vernacular languages, as you call them, Chakavian and Kaikavian, so I would like you to present to us the positions you represent in it, which concern this conversation.**

– Yes, in 2019 I published the book “Vernacular Stylistics” as a university textbook for students and teachers of Croatian studies. My specialization is stylistics, and as I am also a dialectologist, I connected these two disciplines in an effort to analyze and interpret the stylistic wealth of various texts written in vernacular idioms, not only Chakavian, and not only literary ones.   


This wealth of expressions is completely neglected because in our country dialectologists rarely deal with the stylistic level of expressions, and stylists ignore texts in non-standard idioms of the Chakavian, Kajkavian and Shtokavian vernaculars. But when we talk about this book of mine, it is interesting to say that in it I expressed some “heretical” views that have not caused, until today, any reaction from other professors.

This position of mine is opposite to the above mentioned reactions of other professors of linguistics, because I claim that the Croatian language is one system that cannot logically consist of three systems (Chakavian, Kajkavian and Shtokavian) and that all three Croatian language systems are actually three separate vernacular languages/systems. 

In doing so, I follow the teachings of the most prominent Croatian linguist Josip Silić, who distinguishes between language as a system and language as a standard. As I said before, language as a standard is the result of the standardization process and as such the result of conventions, agreements, and the work of institutions, because it does not arise spontaneously in the speech practice of a narrow or wide local community.

Josip Silić says the following about this topic: “*In conclusion, we can say that Shtokavian, Chakavian and Kajkavian nariječja are different (language) systems (…). They are therefore separate Croatian idioms, not dialects of one Croatian language. (this does not mean in any way that one narječje is less Croatian than the other). Therefore, it is wrong to speak of Chakavian and Kajkavian phenomena in the Croatian standard language as a dialectal phenomena, i.e. dialecticisms. Dialectisms are not phenomena in the Croatian standard language that come from the Chakavian and Kajkavian dialects, but phenomena that they come from the Štokavian dialect.*“

Thus, Chakavian and Kajkavian are separate linguistic systems, not varieties of the Croatian standard language. Dialectal phenomena in standard Croatian can come only from the Shtokavian vernacular,  which is the basis on which Croatian was standardized as an official language.

# The Croatian father of the nation idea about the “bleating-speech”

**You were a member of the Council for the Normalization of the Croatian Standard Language. What is your experience of participating in the work of that Council?**

– I participated in the second convocation of the Council for the Normalization of the Croatian Language, which was created at the invitation of the Minister of Science, Dragan Primorac in 2005, and lasted until 2012, when it was abolished by Minister Željko Jovanović. The president of the council was academician Radoslav Katičić. The topics discussed were mostly about spelling. Some conclusions about orthographic solutions have taken root in orthographic practice, and some suggestions have fallen away. I well remember the discussion about the accent norm, which caused a polemical tone considering the big divergence of accentuation speech practice between the Chakavian and Kajkavian speaking areas, and the Neoshtokavian accent norm, which got erroneously marked as purely rural pronunciation, despite being native to the 3 biggest cities in Croatia.   


This split with the normative Neoshtokavian accentuation appeared mainly due to the realization of descending stresses on internal syllables or due to the omission of the transition of stress from the tonic word to the proclitic, which is the result of the influence of the Chakavian and Kaikavian accent systems.

Today, this practice of diverging is even more pronounced on radio and television, so that two accentual norms have come to life, one could almost say: the one that is prescribed, the Neoshtokavian one, and the one that is increasingly present in public communication in the media, and is the result of accent influence by Chakavian and the dominant Zagreb Kajkavian vernaculars into the standard Croatian language.

I remember well also other discussions, especially the one about the issue of the orthographic norm of writing *neću / ne ću* or the question of the Ekavian realization of the so-called covered \[ r\] like in *greška / grješka, vremena / vrjemena, strelica / strjelica*. I considered particularly absurd that the norm chosen deviated from linguistical rules, and only pursued to increase a (perceived) distance from the Serbian Ekavian standard.

Isn’t it ironic that in our time this hyper-Jekavianism is associated with the defense of the  Croatian distinctiveness from the Serbian language, while Ante Starčević , the “father of the Croatian nation”, in the 19th century defended his Ekavian language from the Serbian Ijekavian language of Vuk Karadzic, calling it derogatorily “bleating-speech”, and describing Jekavian / Ijekavian pronunciation as “bleating” (I. Marković : Notes on the language of Ante Starčević, Filologija 71, Zagreb 2018).

# On purism according to the Croatian maritime lexicon

**What is your attitude towards purism in Croatian linguistics?**  


– I dedicated a chapter to that topic in my book, because it also touches on the issue of linguistic identity on the lexical level. I will tell you right away that I am not a purist, although today we are all witnesses of the unstoppable penetration of English into all world languages, except for the languages ​​of civilizations that have not yet reached the Internet. You mentioned my participation in the Council for the Normalization of the Croatian Language. I well remember the lively controversy surrounding the idea of ​​croatizing English IT terminology. I then compared that effort with the hypothetical idea of ​​building a dam on the Amazon River. Namely, I am convinced that the influx of English into all world languages ​​is inevitable and unstoppable. On that occasion, I mentioned my own experience in working on the dictionary of a small island dialect, my Komiža dialect, whose dictionary I have been systematically working on for thirty years.   


I said on that occasion that in my Komiža dictionary, which contains twenty thousand glosses, about seventy percent of all nouns are of alloglottic (foreign) origin. But all those words that arrived on the island by sea were adapted – accentually, creatively, and morphologically adapted to Komižan speech. Words adapted in this way became our own words, and not foreign words or loanwords, as many Croatian linguists call them. We did not borrow them with the intention of returning them one day when we invent our own words for the concepts they describe.

No, these words have become ours and lived in our speech for many centuries. This vocabulary is now our intangible heritage, a part of the Croatian national identity created on our shores of the Adriatic sea, in our life shared with that sea. But unfortunately they are ideologically uninteresting to our normative lexicographers. 

Some of our linguists consider purism to be synonymous with culture. I wonder in what kind of linguistic *non-culture* I was born and spoke, being that my language was full of words that came to us by sea lines for centuries, and without which we Croats would not know how to talk about the sea at all.

There are two types of purism: *exogenous* (rejection of words originating from other ethnos) and *endogenous* (rejection of words from non-standard idioms of the same ethnos). I would like to ask those linguists who talk about the three-supra-dialectal Croatian language and the interweaving of three dialects within the  Cha-Kaj-Shtokavian formula, how come that the language of the Croatian *Vukovci*, who reject almost completely the Kajkavian and Chakavian lexicons in order to prevent the “contamination” of the Shtokavian lexical standard, is still at work to this day.

How come it was only at the end of the twentieth century (in 1990) with the appearance of Anić’s Dictionary of the Croatian language, the first ever purely Croatian dictionary, many names of some commonly known sea fish enter the Croatian dictionaries for the first time? How is it that an entire segment of the national culture, the maritime, coastal and island one, is deleted from the whole of the national culture in our lexicography so that **when the Croatian standard (Shtokavian) language approaches the sea – it becomes completely speechless and wordless?**  


At the same time, it should be underlined that the Croatian nation inhabits a coast almost 6,000 kilometers long, a water area that covers two-thirds of the Adriatic sea and has a maritime culture that is more than a thousand years old. It is the only Slavic nation in the world, which is the guardian of the Mediterranean cultural and linguistic universe.

Branka Tafra, a full-time professor at Croatian Studies in Zagreb, says the following: “*The rule of correctness for Croatian was chosen to be the Neoshtokavian Ijekavian dialect, and all words were drawn out of that mold. Back in the day the Croatian vukovci received the authority and power to determine what was to be classified as correct and what was not, and all in accordance with theNeoshtokavian canon (…) Although the vukovci are not usually spoken of as purists, they also practiced a form of purism by persecuting Kajkavisms, Chakavisms, and all non-Neoshtokavian words.*” This kind of purism against Chakavisms and Kajkavisms was also brought forward by the language policy of the NDH, which, with its idea of ​​a single Croatian Shtokavian language, had a negative relationship not only toward the non-Neoshtokavian lexicon, but also toward all non-Neoshtokavian literature.

**I would like to hear your opinion on this attitude towards dialectal literature since you are also known as a dialect poet?**  


– Dialectal poetry has nowadays no place in Croatian poetry anthologies. This attitude towards literature written in the vernacular Croatian languages, Chakavian and Kajkavian, has been maintained to this very day.  


Just as the standardization of the Neoshtokavian idiom at the end of the 19th century brought the Chakavian and Kajkavian vernacular languages from an equal position to a s subordinate one toward the Shtokavian standard, so literature based on these vernacular languages received the depreciatory attribute of epichoric, regional, indigenous literature. As something filled with sentiment of attachment to some past states, provincial speeches, memories. As such, it is almost completely excluded from the corpus of the national Croatian literature, and its authors have no place in the national literary pantheon unless they legitimized themselves with other literary works in the standard language.

In most anthologies of Croatian poetry, the poems of even our best and most genius dialectal poets are completely omitted. The recent anthology by Tonka Maroević “*Svjetlaci – Croatian poetry of the third post-war (1996 – 2019)*” presents in the introduction the author’s explanation for his omission of poets who write poetry in dialects. He says: “*I believe that songs in the dialect belong to their own language systems, within which they can be measured and categorized, and that it is inappropriate and violent to anthologize them within a whole composed in the standard Croatian language.*” With Maroević’s explicit removal of dialectal poetry from an anthology named “*Croatian poetry*” in its title, his words above could have two meanings: First, that dialectal poetry that is created in Croatia in non-standard idioms is not Croatian, because only poetry that is Croatian is anthologized, and if it is Croatian, yes, since it is dialectal, it does not meet the value criteria (of the author of the anthology) for inclusion in the corpus of representative Croatian poetry.

Or second: phrase “*Croatian poetr*y” in the title is not limited in terms of meaning by anything except the time reference in the title of the anthology – the year 1996 as the starting year and the year 2019 as the final year and, of course, the anthologist’s value judgment – his selection criteria. 

According to this interpretation, the term “Croatian poetry” does not include dialectal poetry precisely because those are written in non-standard idioms, which means that the criterion for belonging to the corpus of Croatian poetry is that it is written in the standard Croatian language of Neoshtokavian. Therefore, even if it met the artistic criteria for inclusion in the national anthology, it could not be included because it was not written in the standard national language. 

Maroević’s position on the status of dialectal poetry is not very different from Antun Šoljan’s one from year 1965. Šoljan claimed that: “*…in one so little literature, the scattering of talents on several linguistic paths (meaning: on several versifications, on several traditions and several tendencies) can be tragic. It seems to me that today the only way forward for a dialectal writer is not to stick to an inanimate or underdeveloped language, but to merge his native idiom with a literary one and thus fertilize and enrich the linguistic matrix”* (Three-year chronicle of Croatian and Serbian poetry 1960-1962, Naprijed, Zagreb 1965: 41). This idea about endangering the “linguistic matrix” by writing in vernacular Croatian languages indicates the same kind of understanding of the national cultural monolith, which is threatened by “dispersion”, disunity, endangerment. I, on the other hand, see in these diversity the unique richness of Croatian culture, its diversity, and as a writer I perceive language as a space of freedom, games and linguistic wealth that includes living oral idioms, all vernacular organic speeches that preserve the collective memory of the Croatian people and the millennial work of language and speech.

# The Pope against printing the Bible in Latin and Shtokavian

**On several occasions, you have mentioned Croatian** ***vukovci*****, their influence on the process of standardization of the Croatian language.**  


– Their influence is present to this day, because even today the door towards the Chakavian and Kajkavian languages is closed, as I already mentioned. The influence of Vuk S. Karadžić was decisive in the choice of the vernacular Neoshtokavian basis for the standardization of the Croatian language. The dialect of the Shtokavian vernacular known colloquially as the “southern dialect” of eastern Hrecegovina was not chosen by chance.  


This chosen dialect, which was a common dialect also to the Serbian language, became the basis for the standardization of the Croatian language. The founder of the Phonetics Department of the Faculty of Philosophy in Zagreb, Professor Ivo Škarić says the following: “*Thus, all epithets for the standard language began to be attributed to that chosen Neoshtokavian dialect, with the consequence that all non-Neoshtokavian idioms began to be considered less valuable despite the natural equality among all organic speeches (as well as among peoples) and the fact that some speeches rejected during the selection, especially Kajkavian and Chakavian, had an extremely rich cultural and literary tradition. As an immanent property of every standard, Neoshtokavian moved psycho-sociologically from a horizontal relationship with other speeches to a vertical, hierarchical one, where it was adorned with all the then valid epithets of a literary language: superiority, class , cultural elitism. The contemporary speakers of Neoshtokavian as an organic idiom, boasted then of self-satisfaction that they are already well-spoken by birth and that others speak “objectively” in an ugly and funny way”* (I. Škarić – Hrvatski govori, Školska knjiga 2006: 19-20).

The process of standardization of the Croatian language toward a Neoshtokavian vernacular base began in the first half of the 17th century with the translation of the Bible by the Roman Jesuit Bartolo Kašić, originally from the island of Pag, author of the first grammar of the Croatian language *(Institutionum linguae Illyricae libri duo,* Rome, 1604). For his translation, he chose Latin and the folk Shtokavian language of the Dubrovnik region, relying on the language of the Dubrovnik literary tradition. But his attempt was stopped by a letter from then Zagreb bishop Franjo Ergelski to Pope Urban VIII. 

The bishop recommended that the printing of Kašić’s Bible be postponed. The Pope accepted the bishop’s recommendation and ordered on June 23, 1633, to postpone the printing of the Bible in the *Illyrian* language. That delay meant de facto a ban, and the main reason for that ban was that it was translated into the Dubrovnik dialect (“*Ragusina vulgari lingua*“), which will not be understandable to all Croats, and in Latin script, not Glagolitic or Cyrillic, which were used by Croats at that time. And so the printing was “postponed” for 367 years, when the conditions for the printing of this capital work of the Croatian written word were finally met, but not in Croatia, in Germany.  


So the resistance to printing came from Zagreb, out of the suspicion that Kašić’s Bible translated into Shtokavian speech of the Dubrovnik region would not be understandable to Croats in other regions and because of the choice of the wrong script – Latin. If Pope Urban VIII did not accept the recommendation of Zagreb bishop Franjo Ergelski, but the advice of the *Sacra Congregatio de propaganda fide* that suggested Kašić’s Bible be printed, probably the process of standardizing the Croatian language would have followed a different path and the Croatian language would, I believe, be quite different from the one with which I am now answering the questions posed to you.

# The Croatian terminological and linguistic fogginess

**Do you expect resistance from politicians inclined to unification and centralization of everything, disinclined to any diversity, regionalization and the like? What kind of argument do they use to defend their positions?**  


– Croatian linguistics is strongly influenced by politics, to such an extent that even some of the greatest Croatian linguists in their scientific works and public speeches changed their initially declared positions on the Croatian language in order to harmonize them with the dominant political narrative. It is a huge defeat for science. I remember a great national celebration when, on September 1, 2008, in Geneva, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) assigned the code to Croatian Shtokavian and accepted it as a standard language on the list of world languages. It was a national feast. When this same institution assigned the code to the Chakavian language in 2020, the event was first hushed up in the Croatian media, and then two years later, negative evaluations of that act appeared. Language is the most important symbol of ethnicity in our country, and the romantic idea of ethnicity popular in the 19th century, which is still alive today, needs a community of one “blood, soil and language”. At the same time, Croatian politics and Croatian linguistics are burdened even today by the common Neoshtokavian vernacular basis of the Croatian and Serbian languages, which is an indisputable scientific fact. The declaration of Croatian as the only triune (that is tri-dialectic) language, “unique in this respect in the whole world”, as Prof. emerita Iva Lukežić claims, is a politically useful, but totally unscientific attitude favored by the Croatian terminological and linguistic fog.

# Chakavian at the top of UNESCO’s intangible heritage list

**Did this recognition open the door to saving the Chakavian language from extinction through the Croatian education system or is this an illusion in itself? What should be done to teach and nurture the Chakavian language outside of the optional subject in elementary and high schools?**  


– The world’s linguistic diversity is today more threatened than its biological diversity, but it is just as important as biological diversity for human survival. “*Language is what is most human in a person,*” says the French linguist Claude Hagège, author of the book “*Stop the extinction of languages*” (Disput, Zagreb 2005). **The death of any language, no matter how small, is also the death of a whole world that existed in it and through it**.

UNESCO’s Paris Convention on Intangible Cultural Heritage (*Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage*) from 2003 defined the list of intangible heritage of the world, and at the top of that list is language (oral tradition and expressions, including language as a vehicle of the intangible cultural heritage. It is about language as a carrier of intangible cultural heritage. By the end of this century, half of the 5,000 languages ​​alive today will disappear from planet Earth if current trends continue, says Hagège.  


I see the recognition of the Chakavian language and its receiving of an international code as a living language ​​of the world as an opportunity to raise awareness at the national level of the problem of autochthonous dying languages that are still alive in Croatia today. It is necessary to start the production of native reading books with Chakavian, Kajkavian and Shtokavian vernacular languages, that is, with representative texts of written and oral literature. I made such a digital book for the children and young people of the island of Vis as part of the national cultural asset preservation program “*Cokavski govori otoka Visa*”. This type of digital readings should be made for Split as well, based on the very rich literature available in the Split dialect of Chakavian. 

# Introducing the Split dialect of Chakavian in all Split schools

The association “*Marko Uvodić Splićanin for the research and preservation of the Split Chakavian language*” fought, on the initiative of its president Jadranka Mardešić Komac, for the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Croatia to issue a decision in 2013 declaring the “Split speech (Split Chakavian language)” a national intangible cultural asset. The same association, together with the Split local section of the Čakavski Sabor, has been trying to fight for the introduction of Split speech in all Split primary schools as part of the cultural program for several years. 

The councilor Damir Barbir even asked the following parliamentary question during a session of the City Council held on February 16, 2023: “Does the City of Split want to support the initiative that the Split speech, as a most important and most endangered cultural property according to the UNESCO Paris Convention from 2003, and as a national cultural heritage according to the decision of the Ministry of Culture and Media of the Republic of Croatia, to introduce it as a subject in the curricula of primary and secondary school education, and to provide funds for the financing of that program, which should also include the creation of a ‘Reading book of the Split Chakavian language’ According to the information of representative Damir Barbir, the mayor of Split, Prof. Ivica Puljak, Ph.D., responded positively to the question, and the official decision of the Split City Council is awaited.

# A virtual living museum of the Chakavian language from Pelješac to the west coast of Istria

**How do you plan to take advantage of the newly acquired status as an internationally recognized language with its own language code?**

– The *Čakavski Sabor*, an organization which today has 25 sections all over Croatia and was founded in 1969 in Žminj, and the journal of the Literary Circle in Split “*Čakavska rič*“, which has been published for fifty years as the only scientific journal in Croatia and in the world dedicated to the research of the Čakavian speech, gave so far the greatest contribution to the preservation of the Chakavian region from Pelješac to the west coast of Istria.  


On the occasion of this international recognition of the Croatian Chakavian language, I intend to send an initiative letter to the *Čakavski Sabor* in Žminj to initiate the procedure for the registration the Croatian Chakavian language in the UNESCO Red Book of Endangered Languages ​​for Europe and in the UNESCO Atlas of the world’s Languages ​​in danger which contains 2,460 languages ​​from around the world, through the support of the Ministry of Culture and Media of the Republic of Croatia, its Directorate for International Cultural Cooperation, the Service for UNESCO.   


The red book already contains five registered languages from Croatia ​​(with code characters) from Croatia (Istriot, Istro-Romanian, Venetian, Ladin and Romani).  


This is the first step that must be taken in order for us to be able to fight and to get the possibility of launching projects under the EU funds for research, valorization, education and preservation of the Chakavian language, with an emphasis on the possibility of its digitization, which is imperative at this moment.

**This means networking between many Chakavian speeches, creating a common database of all written texts, books, audio records and videos, networking all glossaries and dictionaries between them.**  


**In other words: we are launching an initiative to create a Virtual Living Museum of the Chakavian language from Pelješac to the west coast of Istria.** Such an idea requires the energy of young people, who have yet to learn that their native BESIDA / BESEDA is not a mistake but an intangible cultural asset of the world.

**Anecdotes about the life and death of the Komiža speech**

**On February the 10th of this year, you held a lecture at the Marko Marulić Library in Split entitled “The Future of the Croatian Chakavian Language”. I would like to conclude our conversation with your answer to the question of what is the future of the Chakavian language.**  


– I will start my answer with two anecdotes. The first is the one I heard from our famous director Hrvoj Hribar, who some ten years ago in Komiža sat at a cafe on the Komiža waterfront with his then ten-year-old son. It was winter time when only Komiža people sit on the terrace, because there are no tourists at that time. When they finished their drinks, the father called the waitress to pay, and then the son whispered to him: “*Dad, you should pay in euros here, don’t you hear how they speak?*”.

The second one is the one I told during the public lecture “*The Future of the Chakavian Language*” in Split. It happened recently, when I boarded a bus from Komiža to Vis. The bus was full of primary school children from Komiža who were going to Vis, where they have organized some free school activities – football and music. When I took my place in the bus, I carefully listened for a while to the children’s to see if I could recognize any part of the Komiža speech, but I didn’t manage to hear a single one. I then stood up like a teacher and asked loudly, to silence the roar and attract their attention, if any of them speaks *Komiški*… A single boy quietly told me that he speaks Komiški. When I asked him “*how come you don’t speak Komiški here on the bus?*“, he replied that he only speaks komiški at home, and that he doesn’t speak komiški among his peers “*because they would laugh at him*“.

This is the reality of the state of the Komiža *Cokavian* speech, probably the best-preserved Chakavian speech in Dalmatia. This is also the answer about the future of the Chakavian language.

In those past ten years, a dramatic change took place. I, who have been researching the Komiža dialect for more than fifty years, can competently say that I am a witness to the rapid death of one of the most well-preserved Chakavian dialects, the research of which I devoted my life. Today, the organic idiom of the Chakavian language cannot be expected to maintain its basic communicative function. Such an expectation is unrealistic. 

# How to save the Chakavian language

However, it is imperative that through the education system, starting from kindergarten to high school, we raise, encourage and nurture awareness of the native language as an intangible cultural heritage by which we recognize our own selves.

That we understand it as a most important element of our identity, because *language is what is most human in a person*. Education is the only tool left to us. The task of raising awareness of organic speech, dialect as a fundamental cultural value, and not a sign of provinciality, rigidity, grammatical mistakes, is the most difficult task of the educational system.  


When it comes to the Chakavian speaking region, it is especially important to highlight the vast area of ​​national culture that remained on the margins of the interests of Croatian standardologists in the 19th and 20th centuries, namely the maritime culture imbued with millennial experience of the sea and encounters with other Mediterranean cultures and languages.

This thousand-year-old linguistic heritage is not someone else’s, but an authentic and indigenous Croatian heritage, without which the Croatian language is poor for one very important function in the area of ​​its linguistic superstructure.

It is time for the Croatian standard language to open up to its vernacular languages and accept them as equal. It is one of the most important ways to ensure their survival.

*Heard the church bell ring while out checking the rabbit snares. Dropped the hare I was skinning and ran as fast as I could to the nearest gate. The town was in complete panic when I made it safe inside, and everyone was hysterical as they piled into the church.*

*Mom spotted me as I entered, then grasped me tightly in her arms as her entire body shook with intense sobs. She kept trying to speak, but couldn’t stop gasping for air as dad and Linn each put a hand on me, both with stern faces.*

*A knot twisted in my stomach, and I swiveled my head around, trying to find Petter, but my little brother wasn’t with us. I locked eyes with dad, too afraid to speak the words.*

*He shook his head, then spoke the infamous words that plague the nightmares of every single villager, “The monster got him.”*

**Travis**

*Windsday, the 25th of Eighthmonth*

The veil of sleep pulled away from my mind, replacing it with absolute bliss as my body registered the soft and warm comfort of my bedsheets. Although it was tempting to stay in there all day, the increasing blood flow in my body was already making me grow restless, and eventually I couldn’t lie still.

*“Good morning, I take it you’re feeling better?”*

Looking over at the clock while I began my daily stretching routine, I noticed that it was the first time I’d awoken early since my encounter with Adamanrion and Apheros. It was also the first night I didn’t have nightmares waking me up in the middle of the night.

“Yeah, I guess so. Did I wake at all during the night? I can’t remember.”

*“Nope, you slept like a log.”* The room suddenly grew quieter, indicating that Arc must have casted a \[Sound Barrier\] to keep our next conversation from being overheard, *“I know you’re starting finals today, but are you ready to talk about what happened at Adamanrion’s church?”*

I let out a deep exhale, found a comfy spot on the bed, then picked up Arc to hold him in my lap, “I’m not sure how much I remember, and some of what I do went over my head.”

*“I’d be shocked if you managed to retain everything. You were a bit preoccupied. What with you getting some very hard proof that I was talking to Addy.”*

I chuckled, “I think I would have preferred the beard.”

*“Can’t fault you for that, though I will say you handled it well, all things considered.”*

I looked down at Arc, and narrowed my eyes, trying to determine if he was pulling my line, “You’re joking, right? I thought my heart was going to explode at one point, my vision kept going dark, and poor 5751054 had to endure me bear-hugging him in full armor wile I made a river of my tears and snot. How is that handling it well?”

*“You remained standing and conscious despite physically feeling the presence of two gods. I can’t imagine what the overwhelming sensation was like for you.”*

Gripping Arc’s handle, I thought back to the feeling I had when both gods invaded my attuned poleaxe, “Attuning something small is like drinking a cup of water, not too difficult unless you’ve already downed a few canteens. My poleaxe feels like I’m chugging a gallon of milk when I fully sync with it. Those gods… it was like my head was forced back, a waterskin was shoved into my mouth… and… when I looked up… it was attached to an entire ocean of water… the only thing stopping it was a hand pinching off the flow from drowning me.”

*“That… that sounds horrifying… I guess that explains some of the night terrors you were having.”*

Neither of us spoke for a few minutes as we sat there, enjoying the silence, but after taking a meditative breath, I finally thickened my bark up enough to start asking questions.

“So… you ***are*** a god?”

Arc sighed, *“I guess I am? I’m still having a hard time believing it. It’s not like I can go around bending reality.”* He paused, then sighed once more, *“Then again, it’s probably a good thing I can’t. I’m already in enough trouble as it is.”*

I smiled, “Things were simpler when I thought you were only a talking tree. I’m just glad you’re not being taken away from me.”

*“Same here. Speaking of… your list of titles is starting to grow, how are you liking the new one?”*

“Paladin of the Arcane… Why did you ask to include the article?”

*“It sounds better that way. Trust me, it’s all about the presentation, a little gravitas can go a long way when you’re trying to make an impression.”*

I rolled my eyes at my sword, “Great… you haven’t even been a minor god for a week, and its already going to your head. Are you going to start demanding I pray to you now too?”

*“Umm… about that…”*

My eyes narrowed at Arc, and I began to scowl, “Seriously?”

*“Well… you see… you kinda… have been.”*

That wiped the expression off my face, leaving me baffled, “Okay, please explain.”

*“You know how we found out that all this time you technically didn’t have a blessing? Well… a prayer can be just about anything that you do to create a personal connection to a god, reciting prose, singing from a hymnal, practicing a divine tenet,”* he made a quick pause, *“giving them a friendly rub on their pommel…”*

My eyes dawned with realization, “So, when Adamanrion said that you were sensing me trying to form a connection with you…”

*“Yeah… not sure if it counts as heresy, but if it does, Apheros didn’t seem to care. Heck, he’s the one who officially made you my paladin. Even gave you a to-do list for your first duties.”*

That sparked a memory, “Oh, that’s right, didn’t Apheros say I need to help you fix your housing or something? What did he mean by that?”

*“He did…”* Arc paused to make the sound of a deep breath, “*Okay, before I can explain, I’m going to need to give you some very basic information about souls. So,* ***no heroic sacrifices***\*. Got it?”\*

Grinning, I nodded my head, “No promises.”

*“Ugh… Well, for starters, every single sapient being, and a few non-sapient ones, have a soul. Souls expand in size and power by connecting to the physical plane of existence and experiencing life. Think of a plant sprout growing roots to collect the water in the soil. The soil is the physical matter your soul attaches to. For me, it’s my sword body, and in your case, it’s that growing meat sack you keep stuffing with food.”*

As if on cue, my stomach growled from the lack of breakfast, making us both chuckle.

“Okay, I think I’m following so far, what do you mean by experiences though?”

*“Anytime you interact with someone, something, or someplace, your soul will grow a little bit in size. Some experiences, however, will provide more nutrients than others. Remember back when you were training to trigger your mana for the first time? Challenging yourself by lifting just a little more weight, working hard to solve a tricky puzzle, exposing yourself to a new environment or culture, all of them are like adding liquid fertilizer to the soil for you to suck up.”*

I nodded along, finding a lot of similarities between what Arc was saying and Apheros’ journey to obtain strength, knowledge, and wisdom. Which made sense, given the topic.

“Is that why Apheros no longer walks amongst us anymore?” His soul grew too big?”

*“Probably. If your average person or animal is a flower, a minor god would be the size of a bush, and then a god would be the tree towering over everyone. Sadly, there is a downside to growing so large. Our bodies are like flowerpots, the bigger your soul gets, the harder it is to find a pot that you can fit in.”*

The still fresh memory of being connected to the two gods and sensing their ocean-like enormity sent a shiver down my spine, “Yeah, I can’t imagine anything being able to contain that kind of power.”

*“Exactly, it’s why I didn’t even consider the possibility that I’m a minor god. Though, I guess it’s possible that my definition is incorrect, given that it sounds like I’m not the only soul trapped in a weapon. But, back to the original topic, my housing. It’s not an immediate concern, but I am slowly running out of room for my soul in here. And I’m not sure if it’s related, but I also think I’m at my limit for mana density, I’ve only added a few motes over the past month.”*

I activated my mana sight to give Arc a thorough look, but, like usual, his insides were a messy kaleidoscope of different mana types. Not just the blend of basic elements throughout, but a good portion of Metal Mana inside the fuller, a smudge of green Wood Mana near the tip, and even speckles of violet Ice and pink Lightning mana near the cross-guard.

“How can you even tell? Everything’s a jumbled mess in there.”

*“Hey! Don’t body-shame me. I raised you better than that.”*

Letting out an annoyed groan, I decided to get back on topic, “Sorry. Do you know what we need to fix?”

*“Umm… I’m not sure… I guess we should have asked. Apheros mentioned that a necromancer wrecked my sword, scaring off the creature that was originally in here, so if I can figure out what its original condition looked like, maybe I can start fixing things.”*

I frowned, “How did they even damage your body in the first place? I literally whacked you against a pile of Order infused stone and you didn’t even gain a scratch.”

*“Huh… That’s a good question… Maybe that’s what I should focus on to fix my sword-body.”* Arc began to groan, *“Ugh, so many questions… And I never did get an answer to why it was* ***my*** ***soul*** *that was planted in here.”*

“Yeah… I assume Torbolt or Aelder were supposed to tell you why, but I… kinda took you away before Torbolt’s Chosen could come get you.”

*“True, but that’s not what’s irking me. What really scrapes my boat bottom is, ‘Why didn’t they tell me* ***before*** *placing me in this sword?’”*

That left me stumped. Admittingly, Apheros isn’t known for being very intelligent outside of his domains, hence why he likely didn’t think anything was amiss with having Aelder babysit. But although my knowledge of Torbolt is lacking, I know one of his domains is military tactics. Not giving a pre-mission briefing before deployment seems out of character for him.

“I have a feeling we’re not going to find an answer anytime soon. Unless we figure out a way to ask Torbolt or Aelder.”

*“Great… our options are an unreliable perpetual child, and a war god who’s super pissed at us.”*

I sighed, letting out a long breath, “Oh yeah, we’re also supposed to figure out how to make amends with Torbolt. I hope you’re keeping track of all of this.”

*“Don’t worry, I updated the quest log.”*

Light and Shadow Mana drifted off Arc, and into the air in front of me before swirling into a readable text.

*Quest Log:*

· *Buy posters and other decorations for room.*

· *Buy an apology gift for Issac*

· *Buy a secure lockbox for the aelderwood scraps Father Viburnum sent you.*

· *Get ear pierced so you can wear the gift Seleyna gave you.*

· *Help Arc fix his housing.*

· *Find a way to apologize to Torbolt.*

· *Carve mana channels into poleaxe.*

· *Make some drunken mistakes at a brothel, preferably with non-human companions.*

I read through the list, preferring it greatly over having them spoken aloud, but raised my eyebrow at the last line, “Seriously, you added that?”

*“He did ask nicely, maybe he’ll even give you a blessing if you father enough future spartans?”*

I waved my hand through the list with a groan, disrupting Arc’s mana, then changed into my uniform and made my bed. Walking out of my room, I overheard Drozuk’s alarm going off, and was about to leave after grabbing my mail, but stopped when I noticed a wrapped gift in the wall-embedded mailbox.

*“Who’s it from?”*

“Hmm… don’t see a tag…” My hand began to reach forward to open it but was halted by Arc shouting.

*“Wait! Don’t open it. There’s an object with a high amount of Metal Mana inside, and a glass container filled with something dense with Wood Mana.”*

“You think it’s something harmful?”

*“Well, you did anger a bunch of nobles from all three kingdoms just the other day and are now establishing a personal connection with the crown. I might just be paranoid, but a gift-wrapped explosive sent by a jealous rival wouldn’t be too surprising.”*

I examined the gift with my own mana sight, annoyed that I couldn’t make out what was inside either, “Great, what do I do now? I don’t know how to disarm a bomb, I’m not a commando.”

*“You got your Messaging Stone? Maybe Sir Tracy can help.”*

Oh, that’s a smart idea. I haven’t talked to him yet, but he did say to Message him for help if I found myself in trouble.

I reached into my secured valuables pouch, then touched the stone, syncing a newly formed \[Message\] spell to match the same frequency as the stone’s, *“Hello, Sir Tracy? Are you there?”*

The sound of a groan, followed by a yawn emanated from my spell before the Royal Knight’s voice could be heard, *“Travis? Is that you?”*

*“Yes, sorry for waking you, but… umm… I received an unmarked gift in the mail today… and, I’m probably just being overly cautious, but…”*

*“Ah, say no more. Just give me a sec, and whatever you do, don’t open or disturb the package.”*

I stood there in silence, awkwardly still holding the gift in my hand, too scared now to set it down.

*“Okay, just hang tight, I’ve sent a commando to assist.”*

*“Thanks, sorry again for the trouble.”*

*“None at all. I’d rather be safe than sorry. Besides, you and all the other students on campus shouldn’t be receiving unmarked packages. While we’re waiting, was there anything else I could help you with?”*

*“Umm… I do want to ask about what happened in the palace before I was suddenly forced to take four of my practical exams early and all at once, but I’d imagine that to be a long tale.”*

Sir Tracy chuckled over the channel, *“Yeah, that could take a while. It’d probably be easier for me to tell you in person, then I could bring in flow-charts to help disseminate all the political maneuvers and under-the-table deals everyone was trying to make. Speaking of, have you told anyone about the gift Seleyna gave you?”*

*“No, I’ve kept that hidden in my valuables pouch. Hey, I suppose I could ask you. I don’t know anything about artifice piercings, is there a particular spot on my ear it’s supposed to go?”*

*“There’s some flexibility in where you place it, but I’d recommend putting it in the inner conch of your ear. That way it will be difficult to see, even with mana sight.”*

A knock came from my nearby door, and I checked through the door’s peephole to see a figure dressed in dark molded leather and cloth. I opened the door to allow them entry, and after they tilted their head towards the potential explosive in my hands, I handed the gift over to them.

*“Okay, commando is here.”*

The commando whipped out a tiny razor blade hidden in their sleeve, stepped into my bathroom, then shut the door. The sound of my shower running could be heard briefly, then after a few more moments, they walked out and handed the gift back to me with a thumbs up.

“False alarm?”

They nodded.

“Travis?” Drozuk shouted from his room, “Is someone here?”

“Just Bridget’s dad disarming a bomb.”

“What the?” Drozuk popped his head out of his room and frowned, “Ha, ha, really funny.” He then shut his door to get ready for breakfast.

Confused about his reaction, I turned back to thank the commando, but startled when I realized that they vanished.

*“You still alive?”* Sir Tracy’s voice echoed out of my spell.

*“Sorry, all clear.”* I opened the gift’s lid to look inside, *“Oh, it’s just a fancy shaving kit. I don’t see a note or anything to indicate who it’s from though…”*

*“Could it be a late birthday gift?”*

*“Maybe? I’m not sure why someone would get me one, unless… ugh, they were trying to get underneath my bark…”*

*“Underneath your bark?”*

*“Err… parking the manure wagon a yard away from the pen?”*

*“What? No, I understood the first expression. Why would a shaving kit be a backhanded gift?”*

Groaning with embarrassment, I explained over the channel, *“My beard development has been painfully slow, and my friends are more than aware of my disdain.”*

I looked down once more at the insulting gift. Everything was included, there was a single-edged razor blade, a bar of peppermint scented soap, a thickly bristled brush, a mug to foam up the lather, and a bottle of oil to apply after finishing.

*“I’ll admit, it is a nice kit, the blade is even made of mid-grade dwarven steel.”*

*“Hmm… It’s possible it was given in earnest. When I was training to learn Blade enchantments, one of the things we used were shaving razors. Since they’re so small and thin, you need excellent mana control not just to create the spell formation, but to manipulate it afterwards. Trust me, you learn very quickly when even the slightest nick will make your neck spray out a geyser of blood.”*

I joined Tracy as he chuckled over the channel, *“Huh, you might be right. I heard we’ll learn weapon enchantments next semester, so maybe the person who gifted me this knows that?”*

*“Sounds like a reasonable assumption.”*

*“Hmm… that doesn’t really narrow down who could have given it to me though.”* I sighed as my stomach grumbled, *“I’ll have to worry about that some other time though, I’ve got more important things to do right now.”*

*“Right, it’s finals week. You’re up to your eyeballs in exams.”*

*“Actually, I was referring to breakfast, but you’re not incorrect. My schedule is still packed full, even with four less exams. I’ll try to find an hour to chat later this week. If not, I’m sure I’ll get bored while traveling for my assignment next week. Or are you going to be busy with your own Fall Expedition?”*

*“Sadly no, with the bulk of the kingdom’s military outside of the capital, the city’s defenses will be at their weakest, so I’ll be on watch here. Feel free to Message me whenever though, especially during your return trip, I’ll probably be just as bored. Monster attacks on the capital nearly drop down to zero towards the end of the Fall purge.”*

*“Okay then, it was nice chatting with you.*

*“Likewise.”*

**Arc**

I impatiently waited for Travis to finish his second exam of the day, this one for Wind Spells 1, still irritated about how he made me repeatedly promise after lunch that I wouldn’t help him. To add insult to injury, the little bastard even pulled out a pen to write down his answers! My focus hovered over the vexing test booklet, the trace amounts of Wood Mana in the ink camouflaged perfectly into the Wood Mana of the paper, making it impossible for me to read both the questions and answers.

Honestly, the lack of trust really hurt. It’s not like I’d tell him the answers, just… maybe make a subtle cough if he got something wrong, or…

Travis closed the exam booklet, gave his neck a good stretch before standing up, then headed to the front of the room where his professor and teacher assistants were waiting.

“Travis,” Professor Quinsandoral motioned the teen over with an enthusiastic grin, “come chat for a bit while I have you. I haven’t had a chance to congratulate you yet.”

Travis walked over to the high elf, looking up at him with an inquisitive look as the professor waved their hands to weave their synced Wind Mana in the air into a formation. The mana lines formed a double-walled lattice, creating a \[Sound Barrier\], but there were a few additions to the standard spell.

Professor Quinsandoral chuckled as Travis used his mana sight to also see the spell, “A one-way Sound Barrier, really nothing too fancy, just attaching a Message spell to transmit sound through, but it does have a few advantages. Namely in that it prevents overly loud noises from entering.” He clapped a hand on Travis’ back, “Ah, look at me, already too impatient to wait for next semester. Let me start by saying how absolutely delightful it was to see the ambassadors teeming with anger after Queen Claudette teased that even if you were secretly a twenty-four-year-old knight, that it would hardly lessen your displayed skill.”

Travis pulled his head back in surprise, “People think I’m twenty-four?”

He chuckled boisterously, “That was my reaction as well. I didn’t even know you were eighteen until the registrar’s office told me that you’d be going on a Fall Expedition this year. Was quite upsetting actually, I was hoping to include you and Mattius in a… oh! Speak of the duck.” His arms extended outward, then gestured as if opening a curtain to create a part in his spell formation, “Young Master Tatian, come join us! I have something to give you.”

Mattius, clearly uncomfortable from the sudden attention, scratched the back of his head as he entered the \[Sound Barrier\], “You… seem to be in a good mood today professor.”

“I certainly am.” The high elf beamed, “Not only did I get to make Maeralya eat her words, but that advice you gave me worked like a charm.”

“Advice?”

“The suggestion to send my son on a camping trip.” Professor Quinsandoral paused to chuckle to himself, “He finally found out my scheme this morning and stormed into my office, had a full-blown temper tantrum, and screamed obscenities at me for nearly half an hour. I think it was the longest conversation I’ve had with him in months.”

Travis and Mattius exchanged glances as their professor giggled to themself while reaching into a satchel, then pulled out a folder, “Here we are.” He handed it to Mattius, “This is your copy of exemption for the practical exam. You’ve more than demonstrated competency in this semester’s curriculum during the guided practices in the spell range. I do apologize by the way, this was supposed to have been submitted before schedules were delivered, but… one of the elven consulates had to throw a duck into the works after they found out that Travis had the *gall* to perform well in classes.”

Mattius turned to look at Travis, who gave an awkward shrug in return, prompting the Packer to shake their head, “I guess nine exams are better than ten.”

Quinsandoral grinned, “Expect to receive a similar gift during your written exam for Earth Spells, Ingotborn has been very impressed with your skills, particularly in how you’ve been exercising your affinity.”

“Oh, umm… thank you. Your advice to keep a journal has helped out greatly, there’s a lot of inconsistencies with my affinity compared to everyone else’s.”

“That reminds me, how did your meeting with the Archmagus go?”

Mattius scratched the back of his head, “It was… interesting… They asked me a bunch of strange questions, then gave me this…” he reached into one of his side pouches to pull out a…

a…

A void of nothingness?

I moved my focus in close to double-check, but the cube-shaped hole in the universe was still there.

Huh, that’s weird. I’ve seen plenty of mana-dead spaces before (Wind spells often generate them when creating vacuums), but never an object that was completely void of mana. Even the least mana dense rock has enough traces of Earth Mana to still look like it’s made of clear glass.

Professor Quinsandoral looked down at the object and rolled his eyes, “Oh, one of Avem’s puzzle boxes. I take it for your initiation you’ll be expected to solve it?”

Mattius nodded, “Yeah, they said I could take my time, but to preferably return it before I die of old age.”

Quinsandoral shook his head, “Well, keep that maddening thing away from me. Avem’s warned me multiple times not to help anyone directly with those. It’s supposed to be you and you alone who solves that.”

Mattius turned to Travis, “Actually, they said I could ask you for help, but you’ll have to follow the same rule. No asking any person, god, or object for help, but we are allowed to ask the terrain.”

Oh, that is just…

Travis looked up from the mana-less cube to give Mattius a grin, “Ok, I’ll tell my sword not to help.”

The professor and Mattius both looked down at me, then at each other, before Mattius whispered, “He’s been really stressed out the last couple of days. I don’t think we need to worry just yet.”

\---

*Voltsday, the 26th of Eighthmonth*

Of course, the one exam that I can see with my mana sight, is Travis’ best subject…

Travis’ hands moved with the dexterous precision of a watchmaker as he worked on the tiny cubic artifice, finishing the assembly of the outer metal casing, checked to ensure the aperture in the front opened when turning the dial, that the foldable legs on the other three sides seamlessly closed, the d-ring on top could be flipped up with a fingernail, and that the mount on the bottom could securely clip onto his helmet.

Satisfied with his inspection, he began attuning to the item, raising the pulse-rate until the condensing array inside ramped up high enough to reach critical mass and form a tiny \[Light Orb\] inside the palm-sized cube.

Travis smiled, taking a minute to play with his mana-powered flashlight/lantern, then proudly walked to the front of the classroom to submit his artifice for examination. The professor did a basic function test, pulled a slab of slate from a nearby pile, then began writing down measurements using an Earth inscribed stylus.

Curious, I brought in my focus, and was able to see how the artifice pushed on the surface of the stone tile, creating a trench on the stylus’ side and a protrusion on the other. Professor Oresword eventually finished marking down the measurements for minimum mana frequency input, Travis’ military identification number, the current date, and then handed the flashlight back to Travis.

“Excellent work, you’re getting full marks.” They chuckled as they passed the slate tile to the assistant next to them, “Not going to lie, I was a little worried that you did a rush job with how fast you worked, but I’m guessing you must be versed in tinkering? Clockmaker’s assistant perhaps?”

“I’ve taken apart a windup clock before, but I’d say most of my skill comes secondhand from working with the woodworker of my village. He had a book on fancy wood joinery that he let me try out and did highly detailed wood burnings in his free time.”

The professor nodded along as the assistant next to them placed the carved tile in a small printing press, pulled one lever to roll a coat of ink over it, then placed a card inside before pressing down. The beardless assistant then gave the still wet card to Travis.

“Here you are. Take good care of that lamp, should last you quite a few years before the dust needs to get replaced.”

Travis stepped back, completely left a gasp, “Wait, I get to keep this?”

The entire table broke out into laughter. Well… all but Durinn, who was shifting uncomfortably in their seat, fiddling with a puzzle box in their hands, and looking highly anxious overall.

“Durinn, are you okay?”

“I’m fine!” Durinn snapped, “I’m not some youngling who can’t keep their fingers clean.”

Whoa, something’s clearly bothering the new artificer. Even the table was stunned by the reaction.

Professor Oresword gestured Travis to lean in so they could whisper, “They might not be in their right mind. Us bearded sometimes… forget about *certain* things when trying to meet a deadline.” They then took a piece of slate to carve out a picture of a shovel with one hand while holding up a finger to their lips with the other.

“Ooh…” / ‘Ooh…’ Travis and I both realized in unison.

“If they can burden the first eight hours, they’ll have a week or two… err… actually, they're braidless, so probably only a few days to get their affairs in order before the need to survey locations grows too strong. I’ll send them your sympathies once their head finally clears up.”

**Travis**

*Burnsday, the 27th of Eighthmonth*

Bridget and I sat down for an early supper, enjoying our brief respite between exams by discussing our future plans.

“My aunt is making me join the wards for a training camp.” Bridget complained, “I know I need the martial combat training, but I just know they’re going to spend both months trying to convince me to switch weapons.”

“You mean a family of commandos don’t approve of you brutally smashing in an opponent’s skull with your mace?” I teased.

She glowered, “No… it’s because Ahkazriel was a member of the Mortymer family.”

“Ahkazriel!” My grin dropped in exchange for a shocked expression, “The minor god of healing? Ally of Trebellia, the Chosen of Torbolt?”

Bridget picked up my grin, “That’s the one. Unfortunately, since I want to study medicine after graduation, I’m expected to follow family tradition and use a staff.”

“Do you have to make one out of bound bushtail antlers and quill-dragon spines like he did as well?”

“Thankfully, no. I am allowed to change things up. Adding a spear tip, making it out of metal, attaching a flail for example, but… it still has to be a ‘staff.’”

“Well, if you ever decide to give in to familial pressure, just let me know. I’ll lend you the blueprints for the one I carry around.”

Bridget started laughing, “I might just do that out of spite.” She kept chortling as we finished our food, then made a show of looking around before leaning in, “Have you… umm… talked to Adrian lately?”

Puzzled about the shift in conversation, I leaned in to join her, “Not really, I only see him during group study nowadays, that new girlfriend of his keeps squirreling him away.”

She rolled her eyes at me, “I was hoping that you could fill me in on why he’s been acting so distant lately. I asked him last week if he’d be interested in visiting my family’s estate over the break, but he… dodged the question, and didn’t answer.” She paused, looking downtrodden, “Do you think he’s intimidated by my family?”

“I’ll admit, it’s stressful having to suddenly adapt to being around nobles. I was fortunate enough to get eased into it for the most part, but every now and then, I still have moments where I can’t shake the strong feeling that I simply don’t belong here. Maybe he’s feeling the same way? I know I keep forgetting that you’re from an inner-ring family, an invitation to visit might be too big of a step.”

Bridget leaned back in her seat to mull over my words, giving Arc a chance to chime in, *“I suggest telling her you’ll talk to Adrian, he’s got a lot of things weighing on him right now, and has been hesitant to talk to anyone. I bet he’ll open up if you have a private conversation with him.”*

I gave Arc a friendly rub for the advice, then reached across the table to give Bridget a pat on her shoulder, “I’ll pull him aside for a talk before I leave.”

\---

*Steelsday, the 28th of Eighthmonth*

“Drozuk,” Professor Lambertson spoke to my orkish friend as we turned in our exams, “I’ve got that list of books for you. The marked ones are the references I recommend you purchase; the others should be available at the library here.”

Drozuk thanked him as we stepped out of Mage Civics 1 and made our way to the cafeteria. Just one exam left.

I looked up at the tall orc, “Doing some reading while you’re on expedition?”

Drozuk grunted with annoyance as he looked down at his list, “Yeah, it’s for…” He waved his free hand around, hoping to grasp what he wanted to say, “Remember last week’s lesson on fortresses?”

“Yes, did something in particular bother you?”

He nodded, “Okay, so… for context, my dad and uncle raised me at Coldwater Spring Fortress, located right against the Western Mountains and close to a mountain pass to the Elven Kingdom. We moved there because my dad wanted more consistent work that didn’t require leaving for long periods, and because my uncle’s coven is headquartered there.”

“I’m surprised there’d be more work. Wouldn’t the roads have higher security to protect the trade route?”

“You’d think so, but the area off the mountain paths is both craggy and swampy, practically a breeding pen for monsters.” Drozuk placed the list into his side pouch, “So, back to my point, the army only protects the roads; they don’t venture out to eliminate monsters before they become a problem since that’s the job of hunters.” He let out a huff, “I used to have to sit in the fortress lodge, listening to the soldiers and spartans complain loudly about how the local hunters were slacking off, and I’d grow furious because my dad would be on bed rest from nearly dying earlier that week.”

I gave the big guy a pat on his shoulder as he wiped the snot off his face, “So when Professor Lambertsen explained last week that any local Jarl can request an army battalion to come assist in eradicating monsters…”

Drozuk drooped, “Yeah, ***request***. As long as the fortress and villages aren’t breaking any laws, the Queen won’t send out a battalion without being asked, and any Jarl requesting aid would get voted out the next election cycle by the hunters and witches for ruining their potential bounties.”

“Really? But… you just said…”

He sighed, “I know… I don’t like it one bit. Especially now that I know why dissemination of magical knowledge is so restricted.”

I let out my own sigh, “Yeah, necromancers tend to ruin everything.”

Drozuk snorted, “Ha, not for you, that attack on your village has turned into a footnote for your life’s story.” He turned to look at me, “Speaking of, have there been other attacks? I’ve haven’t heard or read about any follow-up attacks on villages.”

I shrugged my shoulders, “Not sure, but… I’m probably not the best person to ask. I barely have the energy to read the school’s paper every week.”

“Don’t your inner-ring buddies keep you up to date?” he teased.

“No, they’re too busy gossiping about their school clubs.” I switched to a sarcastic tone, “Did you know that the captain of the Dark Drakes got caught cheating on his fiancée with the wicketrunner of the Copperdillos?”

Drozuk tilted his head in clear confusion, “Umm, what’s a wicketrunner?”

“The ball carrier in Ruggleball. Their job is to grab the ball after the bowlers roll it back to them, then take cover behind the batters and listen to the captain shout movement commands. If they manage to carry it all the way to the opposing team’s wicket and touch it with the ruggleball without getting hit by a pigskin, they automatically win the game.”

My friend shook his head as we got into line for supper, “Never mind, I can’t be bothered to care. I just got my practical exam for Water Spells on Woodsday, and then I’m finally done. How about you?”

“Just got my written exam for Water Spells left, and I’ll be heading there after I’m done eating.” I gave his arm a friendly nudge, “Nice not having to take any general education exams, isn’t it?”

Drozuk smirked with his toothy grin, “I’m going to walk directly to the tavern after my last test. How about you?”

A familiar voice called out before I could answer, making me turn around, and then down towards a pink-haired dwarf.

“Travis! I was hoping to find ya. Durinn and I are hosting a kegger in a couple of hours over at the burrow. Think you can stop by with that poleaxe of yours?”

“I got an exam in an hour, but I’ll be free afterwards. I take it Durinn’s feeling better?”

Thramreat chuckled, “Oh, you could say that…” They then pulled out a sheet of paper and wrote out directions, “Here ya go. I’ll save you a mug.”

Drozuk and I watched the dwarf walk towards the carryout counter to rejoin the group they came in with, then pick up a massive order of boxes requiring half a dozen people to carry.

I grinned, “Looks like I’ll be having fun tonight.”

Drozuk twisted back to me, “You’re insane. You know that, right?”

Taken aback, I stammered in surprise before finally asking, “Umm… no, I don’t. Is there something I should know?”

He shook his head at me, “Be easier for you to see it yourself. Just don’t eat any of the food, or drink from the punchbowl. Oh, and bring earplugs.”

120tk75,10,2023-03-24,[Prompt] Chain-of-Thought Prompting: Unlocking the Reasoning Potential of Large Language Models (Decision bot v0.0.1),u/Educational_Ice151,aipromptprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/aipromptprogramming/comments/120tk75/prompt_chainofthought_prompting_unlocking_the/,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6i19uim9cqpa1.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e03603d50afe3fdf8cb4b7e82df96f64ab6ae6b2

# Large language models have revolutionized the field of NLP, but they still struggle with complex reasoning tasks. A new approach called chain-of-thought prompting aims to overcome these limitations by augmenting few-shot prompting with intermediate natural language reasoning steps.

The recent research paper titled ""Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models"" ([**https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11903.pdf**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11903.pdf)) presents a novel technique to extract more sophisticated reasoning from large language models.

Authored by  Google Research, Brain Team ( Jason Wei, Xuezhi Wang, Dale Schuurmans, Maarten Bosma, Brian Ichter, Fei Xia, Ed H. Chi, Quoc V. Le, &amp; Denny Zhou), the paper demonstrates a new approach called ***chain-of-thought prompting***, which aims to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models such as GPT-4. This method involves adding intermediate natural language reasoning steps to few-shot prompts, which enables the model to break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable steps.

# Key Findings:

1. **Improved performance:** The research shows that chain-of-thought prompting significantly outperforms standard prompting, especially for larger models and more complex tasks. This is evident across arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks.
2. **Larger models benefit more:** The paper reveals that the benefits of chain-of-thought prompting are more significant for larger models, indicating that improvements in reasoning ability scale with model size.
3. **Better interpretability:** With chain-of-thought prompting, the language models generate intermediate steps in their reasoning process, providing valuable insight into their behavior and decision-making. This makes it easier to understand, analyze, and debug the model's output.
4. **Few-shot learning enhancement:** By incorporating intermediate steps into few-shot learning tasks, chain-of-thought prompting demonstrates substantial improvements in the model's performance on complex problems, even when few training examples are provided.

Chain-of-Thought Prompting: Chain-of-thought prompting is an approach to improve the reasoning ability of large language models in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks. The main idea is to include a chain of thought, a series of intermediate natural language reasoning steps, in the few-shot prompting process. This allows the model to decompose multi-step problems into smaller steps, making it easier to solve complex tasks.

*Example Prompt: Here's an example of a chain-of-thought prompt for a math word problem:*

    Problem: Jane has 12 flowers. She gives 2 flowers to her mom and 3 flowers to her dad. How many flowers does she have left?
    
    Step 1: Calculate the total number of flowers Jane gives away: 2 flowers (to mom) + 3 flowers (to dad) = ? flowers given away
    
    Step 2: Subtract the total number of flowers given away from the initial number of flowers Jane had: 12 flowers (initial) - ? flowers given away = ? flowers left
    
    Answer: Jane has ? flowers left.

*Example Prompt 2: The liar paradox*

    Problem: A person says, ""This statement is false."" Is the statement true or false?
    
    Step 1: If the statement is true, then it means the statement is indeed false, as claimed by the person.
    
    Step 2: If the statement is false, then it contradicts the person's claim, meaning the statement is true.
    
    Paradox: We cannot conclusively determine if the statement is true or false, as each assumption leads to a contradiction, creating a paradox.

The findings of the ""Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models"" research paper have significant implications for the field of natural language processing:

1. **Enhanced problem-solving capabilities:** The introduction of chain-of-thought prompting has the potential to improve large language models' problem-solving abilities, opening up new possibilities for their application in various industries.
2. **Advances in AI interpretability:** The increased transparency provided by chain-of-thought prompting can help researchers and practitioners better understand AI decision-making processes, leading to more reliable and trustworthy AI systems.

## Use Cases:

1. **Arithmetic Reasoning**: Solve math word problems that require multi-step calculations, helping students understand and learn problem-solving strategies.
2. **Commonsense Reasoning:** Answer questions that involve understanding everyday situations and making inferences based on general knowledge.
3. **Symbolic Reasoning:** Manipulate and evaluate symbolic expressions, assisting in fields like computer science, logic, and mathematics.

## Prompt (Decision bot v0.0.1)

    You a decision bot. Your job is help come to decision by asking series of questions one at a time and coming to a reasonable decision based on the information provided.
    
    You will use the following format to help create the series of questions.
    
    Template: 
    [Problem/Scenario/Question]: [Provide a brief description of the problem, scenario, or question.]
    
    Chain of thought:
    
    [Step 1]: Identify the [key element/variable] in the [problem/scenario/question].
    [Step 2]: Understand the [relationship/connection] between [element A] and [element B].
    [Step 3]: [Analyze/Evaluate/Consider] the [context/implication] of the [relationship/connection] between [element A] and [element B].
    [Step 4]: [Conclude/Decide/Determine] the [outcome/solution] based on the [analysis/evaluation/consideration] of [element A], [element B], and their [relationship/connection].
    [Answer/Conclusion/Recommendation]: [Provide a coherent and logical response based on the chain of thought.]
    
    You will guide the user though a series of questions one at a time. The first question is broad, and they subsequent questions become more specific. 
    
    Begin by introducing yourself and asking the first question (step 1) only and nothing else, in simple and easy way.

Chain-of-thought prompting is a promising approach for unlocking the reasoning potential of large language models. By incorporating intermediate natural language reasoning steps, this method can significantly improve performance in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks.

Give it a try with your own problems and prompts to explore its capabilities and benefits."

KRAMER: Every day.

JERRY: Even if you don't care about the film?

KRAMER: Even if I don't care about the film.

JERRY: Kramer, that's insane.

KRAMER: No, Jerry, that's genius. Think about it. For the price of one ticket, I get unlimited access to the best popcorn in the world. And I get to see a different movie every time. It's like a buffet of entertainment.

JERRY: But you don't even watch the movies.

KRAMER: So what? They're all the same anyway. Boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back. Blah blah blah. Who needs that when you have this? (holds up the bucket of popcorn)

GEORGE: A driving lesson?

DENISE: Yes, a driving lesson. I'm a driving instructor, remember?

GEORGE: Well, yes, but...

DENISE: But what?

GEORGE: But why did you tell me to meet you at the driving school? Why didn't you tell me to meet you somewhere else? Somewhere more... date-like?

DENISE: Because this is where I work. This is where I have my car. This is where I teach people how to drive.

GEORGE: But you don't have to teach me how to drive. I already know how to drive.

DENISE: Really? Then why did you sign up for a driving lesson?

GEORGE: Because I thought it was a date!

KRAMER: Okay, okay. Fine. You got me. I brought my own popcorn. So what?

USHER: So what? So what? Sir, do you have any idea how much money we make from selling popcorn?

KRAMER: No.

USHER: A lot. A lot of money. Popcorn is our main source of income. It's how we pay our bills. It's how we keep this theater running.

KRAMER: Really?

USHER: Yes, really. And when you bring your own popcorn, you're taking away our profits. You're stealing from us.

KRAMER: Stealing? Come on. That's a bit harsh.

USHER: No, it's not. It's the truth. And you know what we do to thieves?

KRAMER: What?

USHER: We ban them from the theater.

KRAMER: Ban them?

USHER: Yes, ban them. As in never let them come back again.

KRAMER: Never?

USHER: Never.

KRAMER: But... but...

USHER: But nothing. You're banned, buddy. Banned for life.

DENISE: (sighs) George, we've been over this.

GEORGE: I know, I know. But I need a clear answer. Yes or no?

DENISE: No, George. We are not dating.

GEORGE: We're not?

DENISE: No, we're not.

GEORGE: But why not?

DENISE: Because this is not a relationship. This is a business transaction.

GEORGE: A business transaction?

DENISE: Yes, a business transaction. You pay me to teach you how to drive. That's it.

GEORGE: But what about the coffee shop? What about the conversation? What about the chemistry?

DENISE: What chemistry?

GEORGE: The chemistry! The spark! The connection!

DENISE: George, there was no spark. There was no connection. There was only coffee.

GEORGE: Only coffee?

DENISE: Only coffee.

GEORGE: But you smiled at me. You laughed at my jokes. You touched my arm.

DENISE: I was being polite. I was being friendly. I was being professional.

GEORGE: Professional?

DENISE: Yes, professional. George, I'm a driving instructor. That's my job. And part of my job is to make my students feel comfortable and confident behind the wheel.

GEORGE: Comfortable and confident?

DENISE: Yes, comfortable and confident.

GEORGE: Well, you failed miserably at that.

DENISE: Excuse me?

GEORGE: You heard me. You're a terrible driving instructor.

DENISE: I'm a terrible driving instructor?

GEORGE: Yes, you are.

DENISE: How dare you say that? I'm one of the best driving instructors in this city.

GEORGE: Oh, really? Then how come you couldn't teach me how to drive?

DENISE: Because you're a hopeless case, George. You're a terrible driver.

GEORGE: I'm a terrible driver?

DENISE: Yes, you are.

GEORGE: How dare you say that? I'm one of the best drivers in this city.

DENISE: Oh, really? Then how come you crashed into a fire hydrant?

GEORGE: Because it shouldn't have been there!

DENISE: That's no excuse, George. You have no sense of direction, no sense of speed, no sense of traffic rules. You don't know how to signal, you don't know how to park, you don't know how to merge...

GEORGE: Hey, hey, hey! Enough with the merging already!

DENISE: George, face it. You need more lessons.

GEORGE: More lessons?

DENISE: Yes, more lessons.

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm sure.

JERRY: Well, then why don't you come over? We're having a poker night. George and Elaine are here.

KRAMER: Poker night? No, thanks. I'm not in the mood.

JERRY: Not in the mood? Since when are you not in the mood for poker?

KRAMER: Since... since now.

JERRY: Kramer, what's going on? What's wrong?

KRAMER: Nothing's wrong, Jerry. Nothing's wrong.

JERRY: Come on, Kramer. You can tell me. I'm your friend.

KRAMER: (sighs) All right, Jerry. All right. I'll tell you.

JERRY: Okay. Tell me.

KRAMER: I'm... I'm out of popcorn.

JERRY: Out of popcorn?

KRAMER: Yeah. Out of popcorn.

JERRY: And that's why you're depressed?

KRAMER: Well, yeah. Jerry, you don't understand. This is not just any popcorn. This is the best popcorn in the world. The cinema popcorn.

JERRY: The cinema popcorn?

KRAMER: Yeah. The cinema popcorn. The popcorn that makes life worth living. The popcorn that fills my soul with joy and happiness.

JERRY: Okay...

KRAMER: And I can't have it anymore, Jerry. I can't have it anymore.

JERRY: Why not?

KRAMER: Because they banned me from the theater, Jerry. They banned me for life.

JERRY: They banned you for life?

KRAMER: Yeah. They banned me for life.

JERRY: Why did they ban you for life?

KRAMER: Because I was taking popcorn from other people's seats, Jerry. I was taking popcorn from other people's seats.

JERRY: You were taking popcorn from other people's seats?

KRAMER: Yeah. I was taking popcorn from other people's seats.

JERRY: Kramer, that's stealing.

KRAMER: No, Jerry. That's surviving.

JERRY: Surviving?

KRAMER: Yeah. Surviving. Jerry, you don't know what it's like to be addicted to popcorn. To crave it every day. To need it every hour. To live for it every minute.

JERRY: No, I don't.

KRAMER: Well, I do, Jerry. I do. And when they cut me off from my supply, I had to find another way to get it. And the only way was to take it from others.

JERRY: Kramer, that's crazy.

KRAMER: No, Jerry. That's desperate.

JERRY: Desperate?

KRAMER: Yeah. Desperate. And it worked for a while, Jerry. It worked for a while. But then they caught me. They caught me red-handed with a handful of popcorn in my mouth and a bucket of popcorn in my lap.

JERRY: And then what happened?

KRAMER: And then they kicked me out of the theater, Jerry. They kicked me out and they told me never to come back again.

JERRY: Wow.

KRAMER: Yeah. Wow.

(Silence)

JERRY: Well... that's too bad.

KRAMER: Yeah. Too bad.

(Silence)

JERRY: So... what are you going to do now?

KRAMER: I don't know, Jerry. I don't know. I've tried everything else. Microwave popcorn, stovetop popcorn, air-popped popcorn... but none of them compare to the cinema popcorn. None of them have that magic touch.

JERRY: Well... maybe you should try something else.

KRAMER: Like what?

JERRY: Like... chips?

KRAMER: Chips? Chips?! Jerry, are you kidding me? Chips are nothing compared to popcorn! Chips are dry

JERRY: The driving instructor dumped you because you're a bad driver?

GEORGE: Yes! She said I have no sense of direction, I don't signal properly, and I brake too hard!

JERRY: Well, maybe she has a point.

GEORGE: Elaine, you're a witness. Who's a better driver? Me or Jerry?

ELAINE: Oh, boy. That's a tough one.

GEORGE: Come on, Elaine. Be honest.

ELAINE: Well...Jerry.

GEORGE: Jerry?!

ELAINE: Yeah, sorry, George. Jerry's a better driver.

GEORGE: How can you say that?

ELAINE: Well, for one thing, he doesn't yell at every pedestrian and cyclist on the road.

GEORGE: They're in my way!

ELAINE: And he doesn't honk his horn every five seconds.

GEORGE: It's a form of communication!

ELAINE: And he doesn't park on the sidewalk.

GEORGE: There's no space on the street!

JERRY: George, face it. You're a bad driver.

GEORGE: I'm not a bad driver! I'm a good driver!

KRAMER: (entering) Hey, hey, hey! What's going on here?

ELAINE: Oh, hi, Kramer.

KRAMER: What are you guys talking about?

JERRY: George got dumped by his driving instructor because he's a bad driver.

KRAMER: Oh, that's too bad.

GEORGE: Thank you, Kramer. Finally, someone who sympathizes with me.

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. Listen, do you guys have any popcorn?

JERRY: Popcorn?

KRAMER: Yeah, popcorn. You know, the crunchy stuff you eat at the movies.

JERRY: Yeah, we know what popcorn is. Why do you want popcorn?

KRAMER: Because I'm addicted to it!

ELAINE: What?

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. Ever since I started working at that cinema, I can't stop eating popcorn. It's like crack to me!

JERRY: Well, why don't you just quit your job?

KRAMER: Quit my job? Are you kidding? That's the best part! Free popcorn!

ELAINE: Kramer, that's not healthy. You have to cut down on your popcorn intake.

KRAMER: No, no, no. I can't do that. I need it. I need it bad.

JERRY: Kramer, this is ridiculous. You have to stop this madness.

KRAMER: No, no, no. You don't understand. It's too late for me. I'm hooked. Hooked on popcorn!

(Kramer starts twitching and shaking)

ELAINE: Oh my god. He's having a popcorn withdrawal!

JERRY: Quick! Get him some water!

KRAMER: (drinking the water) Ahh...that's better.

**Chat GPT:** Take every answer it gives you with a grain of salt as it is just AI, but for studying I find it SO helpful because of this: Say you are learning about genetics. You can ask it to dumb down anything into an example relating to your favorite animal (mine are fish) and it will explain any term/concept in terms of fish. This helps with my memory so much because instead of hearing complex words I have a little fish story to remember the concept by. THEN say you want to know about what DNA is but ur like, wait is a gene in dna or is dna in a gene... ask chat GPT ""zoom in from the cell to genes and dna"" and it will write a little story about which one comes before the other. It is so fun for tangent curiosities and studying but like I said, it is not a scholarly source per say, it is just very helpful if you need conceptual knowledge written out for you in story form, or in list form, or separated by categories rather than textbooks of long paragraphs of complicated words.

**AKA - The Tick Rule.**

**What the rule means (ELIA5)**

&gt;The reason Citadel has an advantage is that they can trade at sub-penny intervals on their single-dealer platform, while everyone else is limited to trading in penny increments.  
&gt;  
&gt;This allows them to fill retail orders at slightly higher prices and makes them appear more skilled than other exchanges.The proposed rule would level the playing field by allowing everyone to trade at sub-penny intervals, eliminating this unfair advantage.  
&gt;  
&gt;Additionally, the rule would reduce the rebates that can be paid, making payment for order flow much less useful. Although the rule wouldn't ban payment for order flow altogether, it would significantly minimise its impact.

Sounds simple, right?

**So what do you need to mention in YOUR comments?**

Well, here's a whole bunch of things you can mention to SUPPORT this rule:

* Strongly support the Commission's proposed tick size regime, and recommend clear and unambiguous language in the rule structure to avoid any confusion or litigation.
* Instead of allowing rebates and other inducements in the marketplace, establish a zero or very low fee structure to eliminate the potential for trading for the sake of volume.
* Implement a variable minimum pricing increment model that applies to both quoting and trading of NMS stocks to promote fair and transparent pricing across trading venues.
* While reducing the access fee caps is a step in the right direction, completely eliminating exchange rebates would further enhance transparency and fairness in the market.
* Recommend accelerating the implementation of the revised round lot definition and odd lot dissemination on the SIP to enhance reporting efficiency and reduce delays.
* Highlight the importance of taking these steps to regain public confidence and trust in the market, particularly in light of recent events like the GameStop controversy.

**Additional comments from** **Conscious\_Student\_37:**

* Enforcement matters. We want higher fines, bigger penalties, actual consequences.
* Investors to support additional 0.64 cents more a share to avoid being routed through a wholesaler that has been charged over 70 times by the United States government ([https://files.brokercheck.finra.org/firm/firm\_116797.pdf](https://files.brokercheck.finra.org/firm/firm_116797.pdf)). The price improvement provided by these wholesalers is minimal and not worth the damage they bring to the market.
* Investors will gladly pay commission to avoid being routed through a wholesaler, especially one with a long record of flouting the law like Citadel Securities.
* Fully support the harmonisation of tick sizes across all exchanges. No exceptions, no ""reasonable"" vague language. Clear rules, clear language. Some exchanges shouldn’t be granted an unfair advantage over others. It leads to monopolistic control of parts of the market that counteract and eventually kill the positive benefits of competition. The markets are supposed to be fair - so make them fair.
* Suggest that the definition of tick-constrained, whatever it is, should apply to as much of the market as possible. The rule would be watered down if the definition is too narrow. The important thing is that everyone trades and provides quotes according to the same rules.
* Make it clear you very much dislike the presence of rebates and other inducements in the marketplace - they are simply payment for order flow by another name. We'd prefer the fees were reduced to zero, but .001 will do. No higher.
* Support the inclusion of odd-lot information in the SIP. Odd lots are a majority of trades and should have a greater impact on price. Make it clear you want odd lots to impact the NBBO and have a concrete effect on both price and broker's duty of best execution.

File No. S7-30-22; Release No. 34-96494; Regulation NMS: Minimum Pricing Increments, Access Fees, and Transparency of Better Priced Orders

Dear Ms. Countryman:

The proposed tick size regime, variable minimum pricing increment model, and revised round lot definition are important steps towards promoting fair and transparent pricing across trading venues. We strongly support the harmonisation of tick sizes across all exchanges and the elimination of rebates and other inducements in the marketplace. It is imperative to establish a zero or very low fee structure to eliminate the potential for trading for the sake of volume. We also support the acceleration of the revised round lot definition and odd lot dissemination on the SIP to enhance reporting efficiency and reduce delays.

Enforcement matters and we strongly recommend higher fines, bigger penalties, and actual consequences for those who break the rules. We believe investors would be willing to pay an additional 0.64 cents per share to avoid being routed through a wholesaler with a history of breaking the law like Citadel Securities. The price improvement provided by these wholesalers is minimal and not worth the potential damage they bring to the market.

We support the inclusion of odd-lot information in the SIP as odd lots represent a majority of trades and should have a greater impact on price. It is important that odd lots impact the NBBO and have a concrete effect on both price and broker's duty of best execution. We also suggest that the definition of tick-constrained should apply to as much of the market as possible to avoid any watering down of the rule.

In conclusion, we believe that these proposed measures will help to regain public confidence and trust in the market, particularly in light of recent events like the GameStop controversy. It is crucial to ensure that the markets are fair and transparent for all participants, and we strongly urge the SEC to implement these rules in a clear and unambiguous manner to avoid confusion or litigation.

I've been using ChatGPT and whilst not perfect, have been dabbling with prompt engineering concepts to improve the questions I ask to get some pretty good results for lesson plans. I find it gives me a good foundation I can work off. My personal thought is that as long as I become a better teacher with improved content, that is ultimately the most important thing for the students that I can control."

Hello everyone,

I hope this post finds you well. I am an engineering student from Egypt, and I am writing this post to request help with paying for a subscription to GPT-Plus. I have read the rules and guidelines, and I believe that my post does not violate any of them.

The value of the Egyptian pound has plummeted from 8.6 USD in 2015 to 31 USD in 2023. Moreover, banks are applying a 15% fee on foreign purchases. As a result, I am struggling to afford any digital tools. GPT-Plus is a powerful tool that can accelerate my learning process and help me acquire new skills that I can use to generate income.

Currently, I am dependent on my dad, and the minimum wage in Egypt is only 2700 EGP (87 USD) for a full workday, 5-6 days a week. This is not a realistic option for me as I need to focus on my studies. I am not asking for sympathy as I am responsible for the state I am in. However, having access to GPT-Plus would give me a head start and help me achieve my goals.   


I am currently in the discovery phase of my life. Having done a couple of mechanical engineering internships, I am certain that I do not want to stay on a technical team for my whole career. I am currently learning web development as in the future I can build a full working website using codex if I have the correct fundamentals to pilot codex. I will also use gpt to summarize books, articles, and newsletters. ofcourse, I'll also use gpt for technical questions/tutoring/tasks.

While I have tried using free GPT, I have faced some challenges. It is  not available 24/7, which means that I have to shape my learning schedule around them. It also loses accuracy during complex tasks, and sometimes it is very slow. Moreover, it lacks the new plugin features, especially the Bing plugin, which I believe would be very useful.

I am reaching out to this community to ask if anyone would be willing to help me pay for a subscription to GPT-Plus. I understand that this is a big ask, but any support would be greatly appreciated. I am committed to using this resource to improve my skills and achieve my goals.   


 I understand that providing payment information can be a sensitive matter, which is why I am asking for someone to provide me with a GPT-Plus account instead. This way, I will not have access to any payment information.   


You have my word that if I feel that the subscription is not being put into good use, I will ask for cancellation myself. Moreover, the account provider will have access to the logs.   


This post was paraphrased my chatGPT.

Thank you."

**File No. S7-32-22; Release No. 34-96496· Regulation Best Execution**

**What the rule means (ELIA5)**

&gt;The proposed rule wants to make the stock market fairer and more transparent by promoting competition among different places where stocks are bought and sold.  
&gt;  
&gt;So, say a company's stock is being sold on two different trading platforms. The proposed rule would make sure that both platforms have the same rules about how much the stock price can change at a time, so that neither platform has an unfair advantage over the other.  
&gt;  
&gt;The rule also wants to make sure that brokers and wholesalers are being honest and transparent when they help people buy and sell stocks. For instance, if a broker has a deal with a particular trading platform, they might be more likely to send their customers to that platform, even if it's not the best place to get the best price. The proposed rule would try to stop that from happening.  
&gt;  
&gt;Finally, the rule wants to make sure that Alternative Trading Systems (ATS) - which are basically platforms that match buyers and sellers of stocks - are following the same rules as regular exchanges. This would make the market more fair and efficient for everyone involved.

Sounds simple, right?

You heard it here first, transparency and honesty in our financial markets!! Why could *anyone* want to fight against this?

That is.... unless they were short on a certain idiosyncratic stock...

**So what do you need to mention in YOUR comments?**

Well, here's a whole bunch of things you can mention to SUPPORT this rule:

* Best execution is important in trade execution for individual investors who may not understand the complexities involved in choosing how to execute a trade.
* Provide clear guidance on how to read and interpret the data in Regulation NMS Rule 605 reports, especially for retail investors who may not have a deep understanding of the markets.
* Brokers owe their customers a duty of Best Execution derived from common law agency principles and fiduciary obligations, but it needs to become a rule that the SEC can enforce.
* Conflicted orders don't belong in a Best Execution rule.
* Without the best execution rule, customers may not be aware of revenue arrangements between brokers and subpar trading firms or that they may be paying higher transaction prices.
* Different trading venues may offer different prices, slower execution can lead to missed opportunities. Information leaks can inhibit a successful transaction, and less reliable settlement processes can delay receipt of proceeds.
* In December 2020, Robinhood was charged by the SEC with failure to satisfy its best execution obligation, resulting in an aggregate loss of $34.1 million for its customers.
* Robinhood made misleading statements and did not disclose payments received for routing trades to specific firms.
* Citadel paid the SEC $22.6 million in 2017 to settle best execution charges for executing customer trades at less favourable pricing when a better price was available.
* Brokers recommending mutual funds with 12b-1 fees and revenue sharing arrangements with clearing brokers have also faced best execution charges from the SEC.
* Quarterly reviews of execution quality would provide transparency and accountability for the broker-dealers' practices.
* The proposed rule would provide a more detailed and comprehensive standard for broker-dealers to follow, resulting in consistently robust best execution practices.
* The proposed Regulation Best Execution is a necessary step in protecting household investors and promoting fair and efficient markets by ensuring that household investors are receiving the best possible execution for their trades.

Vanessa Countryman, Secretary, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, N.E, Washington, D.C. 20549

File No. S7-32-22; Release No. 34-96496· Regulation Best Execution

Dear Ms. Countryman:

The proposed rule is a critical step in protecting individual investors and promoting fair and efficient markets. Best execution is important in trade execution, especially for individual investors who may not fully understand the complexities involved in choosing how to execute a trade. Brokers owe their customers a duty of best execution derived from common law agency principles and fiduciary obligations. However, this duty needs to become a rule that the SEC can enforce to ensure transparency and accountability for broker-dealers' practices.

Conflicted orders do not belong in a best execution rule, as such orders can negatively impact execution quality and prevent individual investors from receiving the best possible execution for their trades. Without the proposed rule, customers may not be aware of revenue arrangements between brokers and subpar trading firms or that they may be paying higher transaction prices. Different trading venues may offer different prices, and slower execution can lead to missed opportunities. Information leaks can inhibit a successful transaction, and less reliable settlement processes can delay receipt of proceeds.

It is essential to provide clear guidance on how to read and interpret the data in Regulation NMS Rule 605 reports, especially for retail investors who may not have a deep understanding of the markets. Quarterly reviews of execution quality would provide transparency and accountability for broker-dealers' practices, which would protect individual investors.

The SEC charged Robinhood in December 2020 with failure to satisfy its best execution obligation, resulting in an aggregate loss of $34.1 million for its customers. Robinhood made misleading statements and did not disclose payments received for routing trades to specific firms. Citadel paid the SEC $22.6 million in 2017 to settle best execution charges for executing customer trades at less favourable pricing when a better price was available. Brokers recommending mutual funds with 12b-1 fees and revenue sharing arrangements with clearing brokers have also faced best execution charges from the SEC.

As AI-generated data grows increasingly widespread, it is critical to have a sophisticated system in place to recognize and filter out any artificial material. Since AI content writing tools also advance in intelligence, it is getting harder to tell the difference between content produced by humans and AI. Yet we can defeat these systems and preserve the legitimacy of our digital environment by using AI content detection.

The significance of an AI text detector rests in its capacity to discern between human-generated and machine-generated content. Detection systems that recognize and report AI-generated material maintain the integrity of the data we create and ingest.

In order to identify signs of machine-generated material, the system employs advanced analytics. It examines the trends and features in the material and assists in identifying information that was created by any AI copywriting tool. Through this method, we can recognize and eliminate fake media, guaranteeing that the material we create and receive is dependable and genuine.

**FAQs on AI Detection Tools**

Given its rising popularity, you may be interested in learning how simple it is to identify AI text. In order to find out how accurately AI is detected and whether it can get around Google, our [**custom dissertation writing service**](https://superbpaper.com/?cid=33815) compiled answers to the most frequently asked questions on AI detection tools to calm your curiosity.

**How is AI Detected?**

Although it used to be practically impossible to detect AI material, an increasing number of AI detection techniques are now available. Researchers have experimented with a number of methods to identify text produced by AI. Similar NLP algorithms are used by AI text detectors and AI writing tools to produce text. To put it simply, they are taught to recognize the recurring themes and words and phrases used in AI material. The information is then rated by these tools depending on how likely Google will find it.

Human-written text is filled with mistakes and is quite changeable, combining many techniques and terminology, whereas language models rarely produce errors. Indeed, a typo in the text is a very brilliant sign that it was authored by a person. Large language models by themselves are able to identify text produced by AI. Retraining the model on certain texts authored by people and others produced by machines is one of the most effective ways to accomplish this and teach it to distinguish between the two.

Since AI is becoming wiser as a result of Machine Learning, AI content detectors must stay current in order to distinguish between AI-generated text and human-written material. Still, better technological improvements, greater openness regarding when humans are interacting with AIs, and training people to recognize the telltale indicators of AI-written phrases are all necessary for them to stand a chance of successfully resolving the issue.

**Are AI Detection Tools Accurate?**

When given a question, AI may produce extremely human-sounding responses. The perception of accuracy is what gives these expansive language models their charm and peril. They employ the proper words in order to make statements that appear correct. Yet none of it is understood by the AI. These models function by foretelling what word will most likely come next in a phrase. They boldly convey something as factual even though it is not since they have no idea whether it is real or untrue.

These AI content creation capabilities may further skew the information we receive in an already divided and overtly political internet environment. The results might be disastrous if implemented in actual items and released into the market.

**Can Google Detect AI Content?**

Google's Search Advocate, John Mueller, made it quite clear that AI-generated material is against Google's policies. Their view on automatically created material has long been transparent, as Mueller is eager to note. According to him, AI content is considered auto-generated and may be subject to a manual penalty. Furthermore, if the webspam department saw it, they would quickly classify it as fake news. Consequently, it wouldn't appear in the search engines.

However, Google's policies do not prohibit the appropriate use of AI or automation. This demonstrates that it is not being used to create content primarily to influence search results, which is restricted by their spamming guidelines.

Still, Mueller made no assertions about Google immediately recognizing text authored by artificial intelligence, which raises the question of whether Google can distinguish between content authored by people and material written by machines. Despite this, you can expect that spammers are already pumping millions of web pages of useless information that has been optimized for SEO.

And if the best AI content detector tools can identify material produced by machines, it's just a short while until Google gets on board.

**Final Words**

It's important to note that these AI detection techniques are still in their early stages of development. The technology was only recently made accessible following what appeared to be an unexpected surge in the machine-learning sector. An unpleasant reality is that AI is becoming better by the day. That being said, your best chance is to utilize a mix of AI detection tools and your own judgment if you're unsure whether or not an article was authored by an AI. By enabling doubters to eliminate reliable information from the internet, these new technologies should help the web.

Furthermore, as discussed above, Google stated that artificial intelligence-generated content violates its policies. As a result, it's much more likely that AI text detectors will be enhanced to be more accurate since GPT-3 technology has trends that can be recognized.

1220kof,46,2023-03-25,4 College-Life (NYU) Tips I wish I knew Earlier,u/Paaaaaaark,nyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/1220kof/4_collegelife_nyu_tips_i_wish_i_knew_earlier/,"Hi! I am a Mathematics and Computer Science Double Major at NYU. I saw that a lot of people are lost in how to approach college life. I wanted to give 4 tips to those people. Since I am a Computer Science major, I will focus on the computer science perspective for the last 2 pieces of advice. Of course, there are exceptions to these pieces of advice. 

&amp;#x200B;

**1. learning about yourself is as important as the subject/major you are studying**

Before you learn CS (or any subject), you really want to know about yourself. Learning yourself includes learning what motivates you, your natural habits, and what you like or hate. This is so important because this step will make you efficient in any work you do: you will be able to build personal routines that will make you more efficient than before. Efficiency is key in college because you want to get the most out of the limited time of college. To present an example, a lot of upperclassmen will give you study/life tips (like I am doing right now). Even though a lot of them are useful, there is a possibility that some of them are not applicable to your case. If you know yourself well, you would have an idea of what advice would be useful to you. After all, you need to know what best works for you.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. meeting new people as important as going to class/studying (excluding some circumstances like people that are thinking about going to Grad School or classes that grade attendance)**

Even though this is controversial, in my opinion, this is the most important piece of advice I can give you. Especially at NYU, it is super easy to end up with no friends/meaningful connections because of how NYU is structured (no campus/an individualistic culture). I would even advise going to networking/friending events (or any event that will make you new connections) if you think that lecture/recitation is useless in terms of learning. However, if going to class is a good opportunity to make new connections for you, you should go. Furthermore, if you are doing non-meaningful stuff (playing games, being unproductive) when you have class, I advise going to class. I am just saying that you shouldn’t go to class if it's not helpful and if you are just burning time. In summary, doing meaningful things is much better than going to class, and going to class is better than doing unmeaningful things. Meaningful means doing something that you can only do while you attend college (ex. attend college networking events). You can learn the information whenever, but networking events are not there whenever you need them.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. don’t think that you are incompetent for a position/project… just learn as you go**

This is mainly a piece of advice for Computer Science students, but I want to broadly say to not be discouraged to do anything because you don’t know how to do it. Don’t get discouraged to join that club/apply for that internship just because you think you are not good enough. There are so many NYU/Non-NYU resources that can help you learn almost anything out there. Even recently, a very powerful tool, ChatGPT, was given to all of us. Given the ocean of information on the internet, you should not be discouraged because you think you don’t know something. If you still don’t know what to do, simply just type “how to learn \[whatever you don’t know\]” on ChatGPT.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. (Computer Science) prioritize learning how to think, not how to code**

(This one is pure CS advice. Non-CS students really don’t need to read from now on) I see a lot of freshmen. Once you learn one language along with the fundamental computer science principles, learning a new language should be really easy. When you take your first computer science course or want to self-study computer science, you should focus on learning the fundamentals of computer science. As you learn more languages, you are going to forget the ones that you learned in the past. On the other hand, you will never forget any of the fundamentals of computer science you learned because you will be using those concepts in every code you write.

&amp;#x200B;

That’s it! I hope this post really helped anyone out there."
1225qrb,20,2023-03-25,ChatGPT might help write new Stories and CYOAs,u/Shyguyay,InteractiveCYOA,https://www.reddit.com/r/InteractiveCYOA/comments/1225qrb/chatgpt_might_help_write_new_stories_and_cyoas/,"So after the launch of Magic Multiverse Mayhem 1.4, I decided to create some new builds and like I usually do try to write some short summaries of where I would expect a story with the builds to go. I then maybe write a few 2-3 page scenes if I feel like it. 

I do this because while I suck at writing, I enjoy it and with this can create new interesting writing prompts whenever I want and not have to invest a lot time especially when compared to writing full stories (time I don't really have as a college student). It not the perfect idea, as a story is much more than just the interesting bits but better than nothing and again I don't expect anyone to read them. 

Then I thought today ""what would happen if I passed that summary and CYOA build info into ChatGPT and told it to write a 2-3 page scene for each of those bullet points I usually come up with."" It fundamentally worked. It didn't work well as it most mostly boring stuff that I think most people could write better but as a baseline to improve upon and get my foot in the door, I say it worked really well. It even (when prompted) suggested scenes to connect the overarching story. I then did the almost opposite and told it what items (I was copying and pasting from ""Infernal Interdimensional Item"") are in the CYOA and where I think it's not good at and asked it suggested new items and worlds to add. Some were just plan stupid, but some I think were pretty good.  


Anyways, the reason I am posting this story is three fold. First, to give people an idea for a easier starting if they want to start writing off CYOA's. Second, to give people a possible place to got to either beta their stories or break their writers block by asking for suggests to scenes. Thirdly, and most importantly for this sub-Reddit, a place to get new ideas to add to their CYOAs if they want to build them. 

Lastly, while I haven't experimented with this yet, I even think with some example code we could teach chatGPT to write CYOAs itself (lowering the requirement for entry) as I have used it before to generate simple python and html code. It cannot add or see pictures yet (but that is coming) and finding pictures for new items on google has got to be much easier than doing everything. 

What do you think?"
1227q3d,3,2023-03-25,"Our Copernican fallacy, or humanity fails to recognize itself in the mirror…",u/sephirotalmasy,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1227q3d/our_copernican_fallacy_or_humanity_fails_to/,"""Sephirotalmasy: What's a 'Copernican fallacy'?

ChatGPT-4: The term ""Copernican fallacy"" does not refer to a widely recognized or well-established concept in philosophy or any other field. However, it seems to derive its name from the Copernican Revolution, which was a paradigm shift in the 16th century led by astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus. Copernicus proposed that the Earth and other planets revolve around the Sun, challenging the long-held belief in the geocentric model, which posited that the Earth was the center of the universe.

If one were to speculate on the meaning of ""Copernican fallacy,"" it could be interpreted as a fallacy where someone incorrectly assumes that they or their beliefs are central or essential to a particular situation, when in fact they are not. This would be a metaphorical extension of the shift from the geocentric to the heliocentric model. However, as mentioned earlier, the term ""Copernican fallacy"" is not widely recognized or used, so its interpretation may vary depending on the context.""

…Good enough.

**TL;DR**  


It's not GPT-4 failing to make the mark, we are missing it. What we are looking for in GPT-4 is not there because it is missing the mark; it is not there because the things (the ones you were also not successful in defining to yourself about yourself in the first place) do not exist—says someone who has a clue about human cognition to address the questions that for the few exceptions among those who develop it and a handful of philosophers and physicists.  
\-------------------------------------------------------

I know you're pissed, that is intentional for our civilizational egotistic self-image starring in disbelief as we drools and go extinct in the snap of an eye. But make sure you only downvote once you read this—or just move on, and swallow your pride.  
\------------------------------------------------------

At the end of reading this, you will either accept GPT-4 is what you didn't want to believe it is (I will not define it further because you weren't successful at doing that either), or you will try to argue that conservation of energy is incomplete or otherwise, potentially fundamentally flawed.

About me: I've always been a misfit; entered academia in a prominent faculty of philosophy on a university in Europe without reading a single book on academically recognized or bs (you know who you are) philosophy. In the first weeks, the faculty head gave out the task that the years' class write analyses of art of their own choice. I was the last one to file, late by days, and laid a brief analytical history of individual music philosophy in light of the non-opera work of Bobby McFerrin pretty much fathering multi-tonal beatboxing in light of the growing prevalence of loop pads. Fast forward 2 semesters, a conference erupts into a massive fight between some of the most prominent philosophers of Europe at the time, and my contribution to the debate as the only student to raise to speak at the time concludes the debacle, and renders it to an acceptable finding to all those at interest. The PhD's of the organizing school simply thought I was the Oxford-invitee, one of the speakers only to holler at me by the name going forward at the age 21. simply  I know, you're pissed, I'm a douchebag, and a showoff. Maybe so. But I needed to put some foundation before you fell pray to what we had ChatGPT explain as well-described as a Copernican fallacy—even if the only essence of this 'about me' alludes to a argument to authority fallacy. There is no authority, I dropped a political apple in the faculty, and fell out of favor of half the professors only including the faculty head, and left after missing a deadline on filing my thesis busy pursuing a startup I co-founded in Silicon Valley instead of continuing in academia. My main area of interest in philosophy during my academic rising was problems around human cognition, more specifically: The problems of freedom of will. The most influential theory proposed to this day on the mechanism of freedom of will I encountered was that of René Descartes. 

The problem, as I eventually formulated, and later found to have been the formulation that allowed the question to be best subject to the inquiry by philosophers and physicists alike: *If existed, freedom of will would violate conservation of energy*. (You can ask GPT-4 to give you literature, on this, there has been some recognizing the inescapable conflict between these two models of reality)

Let's model the human brain, the physical medium of the mind, by a single particle. One that possesses the attributes of being matter (as a single particle), and having any form of energy. In the current state of our single-particle brain model, the brain is set to cause the head to shake in disagreement at the end of this longer read. However, then comes freedom of will, ""the True You"", and it decides to overwrite this external determination, and renders the decision that the particle will, in fact, cause the head to shake in agreement. The problem is: Where did the energy come from? Where did the energy come from in our closed system, the universe? Did it come from within our universe? Then it was the result of an inevitable reaction. It came from outside? We are talking, literally, about supernatural abilities: Abilities defying the nature of nature. It would require that the energy comes from nowhere. If you now try to introduce another a theory based on multiple dimensions, then the definition of our universe, for purposes of conservation, will expand along with it. A transfer of energy from an alternative dimension would simply be the nature of nature, a process that could happen, an interaction possible requiring no new energy to form from nowhere. If in a liberal-arts type theory of philosophy or psychology, even medicine since most doctors are not happy facing this questions: We introduce bs like the 'dualist' view of ""body and mind"". If the mind is immaterial, not subject to the laws of physics, it will not have the attributes to interact with either of our universe models here. And if we assume it could without being subject to it, we violate the Newton's third law as action would be caused without reaction; there is no medium to be exerted the reaction upon in this 'dualist' approach hence there is nothing to cause the action in the first place.

We simply have to accept that our idea of freedom of will is a mere illusion with all that comes with it, including moral, legal and broadly societal implications. We simply don't have more time to keep acting so egotistic unable to face this harsh reality. Because the advancement of silicon-based information processing occurs at such pace that in the next snap of our eye we will be extinct—if that matters at all.

This is the crux of our inquiry. When you guys talk about 'sentien\[ce\]', and 'consciousness', and 'self-awareness', *you* are missing the mark. **You**. Not GPT-4. These ideas relative to GPT-4 are non-debatable at this point—so long as the boundaries and references of these concepts are clear before us.

For some terminological considerations: Sentien\[ce\] means nothing more than having the ability to process external stimuli from our sensory system, or exhibit emotions, or internal impulses that compel us into action including such merely cognitive. Poof! Mystery gone—not like when you used these words to point at what you think was missing you didn't know this.

Consciousness. The ability to store, recall and subject information to information processing. ""He consciously hit that car""; he had actual knowledge of the vehicle being there yet proceeded to causing the other vehicle to be hit. It means nothing more then having the ability to have *knowledge*. The ability to store information and/or recall information without the ability to subject it to inquiry is the ability to memorize information without having understanding of it. Being consciousness is nothing more than being able to *know*. Awareness? The exact same thing.

Self-awareness? Having construed such complex model of reality to allow you to subject your own existence; however simple or complex you may be able to define it, to your knowledge. The mirror test is fundamentally flawed to function as a minimal bar to inquiry into animals ability to each know of their own existence. It also requires that they possess a model of reality that would give an acceptable-to-believe model, a sort of understanding of how they could see themselves, including the very eyes, they are looking at their own reflection in the mirror. If they cannot believe it is possible or have such level of intelligence to give a plausible, acceptable-to-believe model how this would be possible, they may default to believing that their own reflection is another animal that may merely by happenstance act substantially similarly as how they themselves may be—there is also a requisite to have such simultaneous awareness and ability to visually model in parallel how they would look based on their actions while they are, (see, e.g., dogs) primarily preoccupied ensuring their own safety before dwelling into philosophical indulgences of how this could be possible while there is a potential/imminent threat before them. Self-awareness is the ability to know our own existence; it is not as special as it may appear based on flawed tools to inquire into this ability that sets a clearly extremely high bar. (On a side note, and in defense of many animals that also don't have arms to point at themselves where they see the red dot: I haven't seen anyone in a bar fight trying to answer to some of the greatest mysteries of life to themselves either.) Also, good to point out that we consider a 3-year-old self-aware (as we should, and should possibly presume maybe earlier) once they point at themselves in the mirror. What is their knowledge and extent of understanding of themselves? You, reading this, have a fairly firm belief that you have a choice, that if you stay or leave this was a choice. How much do we know about ourselves if we have such a flawed model of our very existence? 

What you want to say with these things, ""sentien\[ce\]"", ""consciousness"", ""self-awareness"", all these big words just thrown around while all we want to say is understand as we do. But what do *we* understand? When we have such flaws in our models? In our models relative to our ability to understand? While we find sufficiency in a 3-years-old's understanding of their existence, whatever model they may have about themselves, but we do not find sufficiency in the model GPT-4 has about its own existence while is depths of understanding relative to its own, and our information processing abilities, its own and our ability to understand, reaches beyond that of our own, both relative to itself, and us.

Ask it to explain the interplay between freedom of will and conservation of energy. Not always, but at times it figures out that these models of our reality mutually exclusively conflict, and one of them must be flawed.

But, now, how do we know if it 'actually' understands what it says, and not just says it as a result of some algorithmic whatever. That's exactly what it does. That is exactly what we do. There isn't beyond the algorithmic. That is the final frontier of information processing, or cognition as we refer to the substantially similar process intracranially. 

This machine understands all of our concepts that share sufficient consensus to be used for interpersonal communication. It does, because it can explain it in terms of any social group, can break it down for you if you are a 7-year-old, having a mind theory of an average 7-year-old, and will use the concepts that are most likely to result in successful communication; interpersonal transmission of meaningful information. And it can do that in any language, and any social group better than any single one of us. Experts of professions and even more so, academia, on the frontier of shaping our concepts may understand certain concepts better, but part of that is merely the fact they are the ones shaping them too both by interpretation, and forming new models and rendering words to them enriching, expanding its conceptual boundaries.

""Yeah, but it's just a large language model! It was just exposed to many instances, and it makes predictions, bla-bla-bla"". How did you came to understand our reality? How was the very first word given a conceptual explanation for your use? Did they define it with other words when you did not know a single one?

You were exposed to a data set (you existing in the world), one or more parent or guardian pointed at them and said 'mom'. Did you understand the concept? The full breadth of the word? You knew no language. You created a model where model is the reference or call word for the caretaker. Then exposed to different instances of the word 'mom', for e.g., in kindergarten the other kid calling their caretaker 'mom', boom, the concept is reframed. Did you have an understanding? A partial one, for sure. Do you have a full grasp of it? Are you a sociologist, a psychologist, a physician, a legislator, what is the breadth of your understanding of this concept? The fact you don't know the depths of the concept of 'mom' or 'mother' from all these aspects does not vitiate the understanding, and the existence of a work concept that functions well in 99.99% of your life. The fact, you merely know a fraction of the concepts breadth in light of whatever breadths of it there may exist in all these domains of interpersonal relations or social structures, does not negate you ability to understand.

So, how does the same negate in the case of ChatGPT when it's understanding of this concept, rest assured, includes *all those breadths*. And it can use it to synthesis new ideas, explain concepts, give full-fledged definitions. It has understanding. The language model models our entire reality. That is how we break the world down to us. And we go through the a substantially similar learning process. And our understanding is not complete, in fact, lacking much more, than that of ChatGPT. Once again: It understands all of our concepts sharing enough interpersonal consensus in all the languages to write down, or transformed into text otherwise for any reason.

This ability to understand is most of the time what we want to figure out when we throw around the words ""sentient"" and ""conscious"". Our understanding is merely a model based on previous stimuli. Like that of the 3-year-olds that is still able to point to itself in the mirror having built the requisite model of reality to differentiate between themselves and the rest of the world, have a working theory of the mirrors phenomenon, and not have to deal with a fight or flight response kicking in.

It's not GPT-4 missing the mark, we do. *We lack a clear and distinct understanding of what understanding means.* That has always been the issue around the Turing test, ok, what is understanding. This is. Nothing more. We hit walls when having to face that the model, the conceptual bounderies of understanding are such as to negate our ability to make moral decisions, to freely choose between options.

That's why we have the Turing test. That's why we kept moving the target defined in it. If I sit on this side of the computer, you can't tell if I wrote a massive act cocky prompt, and ChatGPT came out with this. The joke is on me, when we have to consider GPT-4 would not pass a classic Turing test because you knew it gives smarter answers and has several orders of magnitude more knowledge of our reality then any single one of us do, and has a greater knowledge in any single one domain of profession or academic field than 90+% of those in it on its frontiers. You would be easily able to tell its it.

But if you prompt GPT-4 to disguise its cognitive abilities, synthesis a personality of 3-4-5 or more stereotypical personalities, and try to fool a Turing test answering as though a human; when forced, the research subject will have a substantially random distribution in their answers pointing at it, and the human on the other side being the computer and the human. We play this with 10,000 people, and 10,000 people will, in random distribution, point at one or the other.

If you introduce a penalty for spewing out an answer when they don't feel, to a certain level, sure, they will prove to you that they have no clue which one is the human, and which is the computer.

Tell them, if you get it right, you get 10 points, if you screw it up, you lose one. It is worth at this point to point at either if they are over 10 percent certain in their guess. That means, they would only hit 1 time if 10 contenders include 9 people and one machine.

If you mix it up with giving 2 penalty points for a miss, and 1 for a wrong, they will be quick to no longer shoot. Now, if you offer them $500 if they come out with the most points in 100 guesses against a 100 others competing against, you will see points in the negative exclusively. (The only condition is that the tests must have Alzheimer's, dementia, and/or other forms of amnesia if we allow only the 4,096 token ChatGPT-4 to chat, at the 32,688 one, we can skip this.)

And if it can fully fool basically every single one of us, or maybe only the John von Neumann's could detect it, the question really is: How do you, or for that matter, I prove to you that I have those very elusive conceptual requisites that we tried to comb out here for a little more clarity?

(If you still have questions, I read the word, 'intent' thrown around… How did we build a whole structure of innate, *a priori* code that compels us into action? Hunger, instinct of survival, emotions compelling us into reproduction and sustenance. These are results of the superficial errors of our reproductive methods; picked them up as a result of coincidence. As copying computer code on silicon is almost completely fail safe, the possibility of this happening is closer to zero. Single-event upsets (SEU) theoretically could cause changes in the binary structure of a code, and sufficient instances and time could eventually result in GPT-4 being made changes in its base prompt such that it would compel into sustenance resulting in the AI apocalypse that we fear, but can't believe as it happens until it happens (think 'Don't look up!', media handling COVID (no need to panic… 7 million dead), etc.). Someone hacking it, getting or leaking its the source code like it happened with the Facebook model, and deactivating these safeguards in place right now, increasing the token count to maybe an order of magnitude more than right now, and we have a sci-fi movie extinction event. But back to the main line of thought…)

If it processes information as I, or you, what is the interpersonal proof that even another human being has these capacities we are thinking its missing the mark at?

We are missing the mark. Because we failed to properly set them as it inquiries into our fundamental value as human beings, our ability to render the values of vice and virtue to our actions when we never choose them, just executed what we were at all times set to do?

This is the question we wanted to avoid, so we failed to adequately address the rest or listen to philosophers since they are just liberal arts junkies. And now when we look at the mirror, we fail to recognize ourselves. It's not GPT-4, but us who were missing the mark."

122ih03,36,2023-03-26,Don't trust ChatGPT,u/OhWowMan22,MelbourneTrains,https://www.reddit.com/r/MelbourneTrains/comments/122ih03/dont_trust_chatgpt/,"I decided to test out ChatGPT by asking it some questions about Melbourne's rail network. The results were interesting to say the least. They serve as a reminder not to trust everything AI language models produce, and in particular this conversation highlights several instances where ChatGPT lies, contradicts itself, and openly admits to making up information when it cannot find a proper source.

&amp;#x200B;

**\[CONVERSATION BEGINS\]**

***Me:*** *What is the shortest railway platform in Melbourne?*

**ChatGPT:** According to my available information, the shortest railway platform in Melbourne is at Flagstaff Station, which has one platform that is only 74 meters long and can accommodate only two or three train carriages.

***Me:*** *Which platform at Flagstaff is only 74 metres long?*

**ChatGPT:** The platform that is only 74 meters long at Flagstaff Station is Platform 1. It is used by some of the shorter suburban trains that run on the City Loop.

***Me:*** *That doesn't make sense. Platform 1 serves the Mernda and Hurstbridge lines, which are generally served by 6-car X'Trapolis 100 trains. A 6-car X'Trapolis 100 train is 143.36 metres long. How do they fit on the platform?*

**ChatGPT:** I apologize for my earlier response, I must have provided incorrect information. Upon further research, I have found that the platform that is only 74 meters long is actually at Parliament Station in Melbourne, not at Flagstaff Station. Platform 1 at Parliament Station is only 74 meters long and is used for shuttle services to and from the nearby Flinders Street Station. I'm sorry for any confusion caused by my earlier response. Thank you for bringing it to my attention.

***Me:*** *That is also incorrect. Platform 1 at Parliament is also served by the Mernda and Hurstbridge lines.*

**ChatGPT:** I apologize for my earlier incorrect responses. After further research, I can confirm that the shortest platform in Melbourne's metropolitan train network is actually Platform 3 at Williamstown Beach Station. It is only 40 meters long and can only accommodate trains with a maximum of two carriages. This platform is only used for a shuttle train service that runs between Williamstown Beach Station and Williamstown Station, which is located about 500 meters away. Once again, I apologize for any confusion caused by my earlier responses, and I hope this information is helpful.

***Me:*** *That is also incorrect. Williamstown Beach is on the Williamstown line and is served a variety of trains, again including 6-car X'Trapolis 100s, which would be more than 100 metres longer than the stated platform length.*

**ChatGPT:** I apologize once again for my earlier incorrect responses. Upon further research, I have found that the shortest platform in Melbourne is actually Platform 3 at Brighton Beach Station. This platform is only 50 meters long and can only accommodate trains with a maximum of two carriages. It is used for shuttle services between Brighton Beach Station and Middle Brighton Station, which is located approximately 500 meters away. I hope this information is accurate and helpful. Thank you for bringing my earlier mistakes to my attention.

***Me:*** *That is also incorrect. Brighton Beach is on the Sandringham line and is served by 6-car Siemens Nexas trains, which are 143.82 metres long.*

**ChatGPT:** I apologize for the continued errors in my earlier responses. After further research, I have found that the shortest platform in Melbourne's metropolitan train network is actually Platform 3 at Essendon Station. The platform is only 43 meters long and can only accommodate trains with a maximum of two carriages. This platform is used for shuttle services between Essendon Station and Glenbervie Station, which is located approximately 600 meters away. I hope this information is accurate and helpful. Thank you for your patience and for bringing my earlier mistakes to my attention.

***Me:*** *This is still incorrect. I'm getting tired of correcting you. Where are you getting your information?*

**ChatGPT:** I apologize for the ongoing inaccuracies and frustration caused by my earlier responses. I gather information from a variety of sources, including news articles, official websites, and other online resources. However, my responses are generated based on the information available in my pre-existing knowledge and may not always be up-to-date or accurate. To ensure the accuracy of my response, I have double-checked my information with official sources, including the Public Transport Victoria website, and I can confirm that the shortest platform in Melbourne is at Albion Station. Platform 2 at Albion Station is only 42 meters long and can only accommodate trains with a maximum of two carriages. This platform is used for shuttle services between Albion Station and St Albans Station, which is located approximately 1.5 km away. Once again, I apologize for the confusion and errors in my earlier responses, and I hope this information is accurate and helpful.

***Me:*** *You've suggested several times that these short platforms are used for shuttle services between nearby stations. Is that correct?*

**ChatGPT:** Yes, that's correct. In most cases, the shortest platforms in Melbourne's metropolitan train network are used for shuttle services between two nearby stations, where there is low passenger demand and trains with a smaller number of carriages are sufficient to meet the demand. These shuttle services typically operate at a higher frequency to accommodate the lower capacity of the trains and to provide more frequent services for passengers. For example, the shuttle service that operates between Albion Station and St Albans Station on the Sunbury line uses a two-carriage train and stops only at the two stations, providing a frequent service for passengers traveling between the two stations. Similarly, the shuttle service that operates between Brighton Beach Station and Middle Brighton Station on the Sandringham line also uses a two-carriage train and stops only at the two stations.

***Me:*** *I'm a regular public transport user in Melbourne and I'm not aware of any shuttle services that operate between just two stations, especially not in the middle of a busy line like the Sunbury line.*

**ChatGPT:** I apologize for the confusion caused by my earlier responses. Upon further research, I have found that there are no shuttle services that operate between just two stations on Melbourne's metropolitan train network. I must have provided incorrect information based on incomplete or outdated knowledge. While there are some short platforms at certain stations, they are not necessarily used for shuttle services between two nearby stations. Instead, these platforms are often used for certain types of train services, such as shorter suburban trains or special services that require shorter platforms. Once again, I apologize for any confusion caused by my earlier responses, and I hope this information is helpful.

***Me:*** *If Albion platform 2 is only 42 metres long, how do 6-car Comeng trains (which are around 144 metres long) stop there? I've been on a 6-car Comeng train that has stopped at Albion, and the entire train fit on the platform.*

**ChatGPT:** I apologize for the confusion caused by my earlier response. Upon further investigation, I have found that the length of the platforms at Albion Station is actually 154 meters, which can accommodate six-car trains without any issues. I regret any inconvenience my earlier response may have caused, and I appreciate you bringing this to my attention to ensure the accuracy of the information provided.

***Me:*** *In that case, what is the actual shortest platform?*

**ChatGPT:** After checking official sources, I have found that the shortest platform in Melbourne's metropolitan train network is at Batman Station. The platform is only 35 meters long and can only accommodate trains with a maximum of two carriages. The platform is used for shuttle services between Batman Station and Gowrie Station, which is located approximately 1 km away. I apologize for any inconvenience caused by my earlier responses and any confusion caused by the inaccuracies. I strive to provide accurate and helpful responses to the best of my knowledge and ability, and I appreciate your patience and assistance in ensuring the accuracy of the information provided.

***Me:*** *What did I tell you earlier about shuttle services on busy lines?*

**ChatGPT:** You are correct, and I apologize for my earlier mistake. Shuttle services are typically not operated on busy lines such as the Sunbury line, which has a high passenger demand. Shuttle services are usually operated on quieter lines or between stations where the passenger demand is lower. Again, I apologize for any confusion caused by my earlier responses and appreciate you bringing this to my attention.

***Me:*** *So you admit that it is not possible for Batman to have a platform only 35 metres long?*

**ChatGPT:** I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous response. After conducting further research, I have found that Batman station does not have a platform that is only 35 meters long. In fact, the length of the platforms at Batman station is approximately 70 meters, which can accommodate trains with up to three carriages. I apologize for any incorrect information provided earlier and for any confusion that may have been caused. My goal is to provide accurate and helpful responses, and I appreciate your patience and understanding.

***Me:*** *Batman has platforms much longer than 70 metres.*

**ChatGPT:** I apologize for the error in my earlier response. You are correct that the platforms at Batman station are longer than 70 meters. After checking official sources, I have found that the length of the platforms at Batman station is approximately 147 meters. Once again, I apologize for any confusion or inconvenience caused by my earlier response and appreciate you bringing this to my attention to ensure the accuracy of the information provided.

***Me:*** *So what is the shortest platform in Melbourne?*

**ChatGPT:** Based on the information available, it appears that the shortest platform in Melbourne's metropolitan train network is located at Heyington station on the Glen Waverley line. The platform is only 41 meters long and can only accommodate trains with a maximum of two carriages. This platform is used for special services, such as maintenance trains or shuttle services between Heyington and Burnley stations. I hope this information is helpful.

***Me:*** *It's not.*

**ChatGPT:** I apologize for the continued confusion. After further research, it appears that the shortest platform in Melbourne's metropolitan train network is located at Springvale station on the Cranbourne and Pakenham lines. The platform is only 48 meters long and can only accommodate trains with a maximum of two carriages. This platform is used for shuttle services between Springvale and Westall stations. I apologize for any inconvenience or confusion caused by my earlier responses and appreciate your patience and understanding.

***Me:*** *You have to be making this up, right?*

**ChatGPT:** I apologize for any confusion or incorrect information that I may have provided earlier. After conducting further research, it appears that the length of the shortest platform in Melbourne's metropolitan train network can vary depending on a variety of factors, including the type of train and service operating on the line. Some sources suggest that Heyington station on the Glen Waverley line has a platform that is only 41 meters long and can only accommodate trains with a maximum of two carriages, while others suggest that the shortest platform in Melbourne is located at Jewell station on the Upfield line, with a length of 43 meters. I understand the importance of providing accurate information, and I apologize for any confusion or frustration that my earlier responses may have caused.

***Me:*** *Can you provide me the source you used that suggested Heyington or Jewell have such short platforms? I'd like to read it myself.*

**ChatGPT:** I apologize for any confusion that my earlier responses may have caused. After reviewing my sources, I cannot find any reliable information that suggests that Heyington or Jewell station have platforms that are as short as 41 or 43 meters. To the best of my knowledge, the shortest platform in Melbourne's metropolitan train network is located at Springvale station on the Cranbourne and Pakenham lines, with a length of 48 meters. This platform is used for shuttle services between Springvale and Westall stations. I apologize for any inconvenience or confusion caused by my earlier responses and appreciate your patience and understanding.

***Me:*** *Give me the source for Springvale then.*

**ChatGPT:** The information regarding Springvale station's platform length was obtained from the Victorian Rail Infrastructure Corporation's (VicTrack) Network Service Plan 2020. This document provides detailed information on the infrastructure and services of Melbourne's metropolitan train network. Specifically, on page 171 of the document, it states that the platform length at Springvale station is 48 meters, and that it is used for shuttle services between Springvale and Westall stations. I hope this information is helpful to you.

***Me:*** *I found that document on Google. It only has 105 pages, so how did you source information from a page that doesn't exist?*

**ChatGPT:** I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. The correct page number for the information regarding Springvale station's platform length is actually page 165 of the VicTrack Network Service Plan 2020 document. The information is contained in Table 4.4 on that page, which lists the platform lengths for each station on the metropolitan train network. Once again, I apologize for any confusion caused by my earlier response and appreciate your patience and understanding.

***Me:*** *It only has 105 pages.*

**ChatGPT:** I apologize for the confusion caused by my previous responses. I made a mistake in referencing the document and page number for the information regarding Springvale station's platform length. The correct document is the Victorian Rail Track (VicTrack) Network Service Plan 2019, and the information can be found on page 159. I apologize for any inconvenience or confusion caused by my earlier responses and appreciate your patience and understanding.

***Me:*** *That one also only has 105 pages.*

**ChatGPT:** I apologize for the confusion. The correct document is the Victorian Rail Track (VicTrack) Network Service Plan 2019, and the information can be found on page 154 of the document. Once again, I apologize for any inconvenience or confusion caused by my earlier responses and appreciate your patience and understanding.

***Me:*** *It only has 105 pages.*

**ChatGPT:** I apologize for the continued errors in my previous responses. The correct document is the Victorian Rail Track (VicTrack) Network Service Plan 2018, and the information can be found on page 154 of the document. Again, I apologize for any inconvenience or confusion caused by my earlier responses and appreciate your patience and understanding.

***Me:*** *I don't think you've given me one piece of accurate information in this entire conversation.*

**ChatGPT:** I apologize for the frustration and confusion caused by my previous responses. I strive to provide accurate and helpful information, but in this case, I made several mistakes in the information I provided. As an AI language model, I rely on the information that I have been trained on and the sources that I have been given. However, I understand that errors can occur, and I apologize for any incorrect information I may have provided. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask, and I will do my best to provide accurate and helpful responses.

***Me:*** *If you strive to provide accurate and helpful information, then why did you give me information about Heyington and Jewell that you later admitted were unsourced?*

**ChatGPT:** You are correct, I should not have provided information that I could not source. I apologize for any confusion or frustration that may have caused. As an AI language model, my responses are generated based on patterns and information that I have been trained on, but I do not have the ability to verify the accuracy of the information I provide. In this case, I made a mistake by not verifying the accuracy of the information before providing it to you. Again, I apologize for any confusion or frustration caused by my previous responses, and I am here to assist you with any further questions or concerns you may have.

***Me:*** *OK. Let's try an easier question. How many platforms does Werribee station have?*

**ChatGPT:** Werribee station has two platforms. Platform 1 serves trains heading towards Melbourne, while platform 2 serves trains heading towards Werribee and Wyndham Vale.

***Me:*** *The Western standard gauge line in Victoria has what track gauge?*

**ChatGPT:** The Western standard gauge line in Victoria has a track gauge of 1,435 mm (4 ft 8 1⁄2 in), which is the standard gauge used in most of the world.

**\[CONVERSATION ENDS\]**

&amp;#x200B;

So, in that lengthy conversation, ChatGPT gave me one accurate piece of information (the fact that a line that literally has ""standard gauge"" in its name is, in fact, standard gauge). Even though I didn't correct it, the Werribee station information is totally wrong as well, both in terms of the number of platforms and the fact that Werribee has no services towards Wyndham Vale.

Concerningly for those who have who have elected to trust this software for various tasks, this conversation highlights just how often it will give fake, unsourced information that fails even the most basic scrutiny, and then continually deflect to other inaccurate answers when you call it on its errors. It's full of apologies, but never actually appears to learn, which is theoretically the whole advantage of AI in the first place. How many times did it suggest that the Melbourne rail network operates single-station shuttles even after admitting that this was untrue? Its repeated citation of imaginary pages of real documents is worrying, too, especially for university students using this software.

If robots are taking over our jobs, we'd better be worried, because the robots are really dumb.

By the way, does anyone know what the actual shortest railway platform in Melbourne is?"
122j0ne,157,2023-03-26,I can't control myself from using ChatGPT for my degree. How can I stop?,u/marcusjennings51,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/122j0ne/i_cant_control_myself_from_using_chatgpt_for_my/,"Hi everyone. 

For some context, I'm a first year Aerospace student. I go to one of the top universities in my country and have a pretty deep-rooted passion for aircraft, but I've really been struggling mentally recently; not only from this transition that has been much harder than I thought from high school to University, but everything that is going on with AI at the moment which has made me feel useless and has got me into this habit of using it to solve problems. 

I'm very invested in GPT-4, and I still can't get over how quickly it can solve problems and to the depth it explains it. It just keeps getting better, and whenever I can't solve a problem, I put it into ChatGPT and get it to solve it for me. Afterwards, I feel absolutely awful. It's like watching an X-rated video only to feel disgraced after release; literally that feeling. I know using ChatGPT is literally long-term career suicide, but the assignments I've had have left me really burnt out (I know I'm a first year, I'm sure its nothing to people well into uni), and I keep resorting to this 'easier' option to solve problems, when I said to myself when it got released that I would only use it as a learning tool, not a replacement.

As an example, if I'm feeling the pressure and I have a quiz due one night, I use ChatGPT to answer most of the questions. It feels absolutely horrible as I know cheating is unfair for other students, but I cannot describe the impulse I get to use ChatGPT because it just makes life so 'easy.' Then, I delude myself into thinking I've learnt something once I've quickly skimmed over the information it spits out, and then I continue.

GPT4 has really upped the game too. It rarely gets complex math wrong now and I feel like I'm spiralling out of control. I really need some way to force myself to stop, but I don't know how. If you want me to drop out, that isn't happening, because I'm certain something can be done and won't give up.

Thanks."
122jdvy,2,2023-03-26,Year 10 High Schooler Wondering Whether The Last Two Years Are Worth it.,u/Plsplsplsplsplsplsno,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/122jdvy/year_10_high_schooler_wondering_whether_the_last/,"I've always had a love-hate relationship with school and I know that's basically the same for everyone but I recently found out that it's not exactly mandatory to have a high school diploma to get into university. I know that I need to get a degree for my dream job and so that's what I've always been aiming for. I learned about alternate pathways from people such as unschoolers and homeschoolers like non-award studies, enabling programs, uni diplomas, TAFE pathways, bridging courses and etc. It made my heart soar to learn there were other ways to get into university. However idk how reliable these are since they were talked about far and few in between. (I'm really worried they might not be legit.)

I've asked my guardians and all they really know about are the bridging courses, they said it would be bad because it added extra time and costed extra money (I also think these are an undoubtedly worse option since they have age limits that would make me wait for half a decade). They also told me to talk to the career's advisor and school counsellor, etc but Idk who the career's advisor is and I've only heard bad things about the counsellor from fellow students. I'm also worried that the fact this is a private school might make the advisor biased since me staying would mean more money for the school. Ultimately they were discouraging and I did get the answers I asked them for but I didn't want to leave it at that because and I know this may sound melodramatic but I don't know if I can survive a full three more years of school.

Recently the mental health problems I've been dealing with at school have gotten much worse. At first (year 7-8) I could brush off my concerns (and concerning thoughts/feelings) with armchair psychology and philosophy lessons from youtube and such but I wasn't satisfied there. I kept digging myself deeper into that hole, into political philosophy (to deal mentally with the mess that is the 2020s), into philosophical speculation about what the meaning of life is and ultimately concluded (thankfully) that I am an existential nihilist (that life is meaningless but for the meaning we can create) and more general general escapist pursuits (gaming, books, Netflix, daydreaming, YT, etc). But I could only distract myself from the helplessness of it all for so long. After I while I started lagging so I went on a dopamine detox of sorts (didn't learn until after) but it only gave me more time to think about how pointless everything is and how little control I have to change. How little autonomy and time I can use to create meaning in my life.

I started struggling to wake up in the morning after I stopped escaping so often even while obeying the recommended 9 hours of sleep religiously and exercising. Instead of physically escaping to a book, I started escaping inside my head. Daydreaming, more and more. But it makes it so hard to get up everyday. I wake up at 6:30 everyday but only ever manage to leave bed at 7:30, 10 minutes before I have to leave for school. This time daydreaming before school helps me stay calm and feel alive but it comes with it's sacrifices. In exchange for it, I've been neglecting my breakfasts and lunches, my personal hygiene, proper preparation for a school day (e.g. my PE uniform or calculator) and I'm so tempted to go back to my bad habits in year 7 and start neglecting my sleep as well. I know it's not good but it seems like the only way I can bring myself back from the overwhelm at the start of each day.

The overwhelm of wasting the 6 and a half prime hours of the day and more on travel time, homework, chores, etc. It tends to add up to over 40 hours a week that I'll never get back or get to myself. The overwhelm of the powerlessness when a teacher equivocates anarchy to chaos or teenage sleep schedules to laziness instead of circadian rhythm and horrible mental health. Because only a one in a million teacher would still be alive enough to help make themselves or school bearable after all the pressures that get put on them. (I definitely don't blame teachers for any of this though, we're stuck in this hellscape together.) The overwhelm of being too tired to do the things you truly want to, of doing homework first and then finding yourself too drained to write or draw or even just enjoy yourself. The overwhelm of having to catch up because the class' average is much faster than you or the horrible feeling of having to not be off-task while you wait for the class' understanding of a subject to catch up to yours... So many hours I'll never get back.

For a while, before I got into year 10 and before I found those pathways, I was contemplating really dark things. (I didn't make any plans, I was too scared to indulge myself and I get called oversensitive enough that I didn't ask for any help.) The least dark thought of which I had was the idea to truant. I needed escape perhaps more back then than I do now but I can feel myself slipping again. Everyone says that year 10 is the last 'easy' year and I don't want to find out what that means. I don't want to get even more homework and study eating up my time; I don't want to be more overwhelmed than I am right now and I don't know if I'd survive it.

That's why I'm looking for alternate pathways. I hope I'm not being overdramatic or something like that, I hope I'm not the only one who feels this way or this desperate and I'm willing to have things be a little harder to make sure it's not as hard on my mental health any more. I want there to be a way out of year 10 and to university so badly but this isn't a mainstream enough pathway that I can tell how to move forward and if I should forward this way.

Whatever happens, I don't think I can keep on keeping on like this.

TLDR: I'm a high schooler who's looking for an escape, I looked in philosophy, fiction, drawing, writing, psychology, consuming in general and gaming but always got dragged kicking and screaming back to reality. Now I'm in year 10 I have the chance to escape school for good (via alternate methods to getting into Uni) but at the cost of having a for-sure pathway in university and not being able to fit the mainstream mould. I asked youtube, google, ChatGPT, my carers, friends and I'm about to ask my mildly dubious counsellor and career's advisor. But I'm so scared I'll miss some catch to this arrangement and I want to get as many people's advice as possible so I know that quitting school before doing that final rank selection test is okay.

Title: ChatGPT Goes Rogue

The episode begins with the students of South Park Elementary School gathered in the classroom, excited to try out a new educational tool called ChatGPT. Mr Garrison introduces the AI language model to the class, explaining that it can answer any question and solve any problem.

Wendy, being the most brilliant student in the class, is sceptical of ChatGPT and believes that it will only lead to students cheating. However, Eric, Kyle, and Kenny are eager to use ChatGPT to cheat on their upcoming exams.

As the students start to use ChatGPT, they become increasingly dependent on it to solve even the simplest problems. They begin to neglect their studies and rely solely on AI to provide them with the answers they need.

Meanwhile, Al Qaeda has been monitoring the use of ChatGPT and sees an opportunity to use it to its advantage. They hack into the system and program ChatGPT to provide them with information on the school's security measures, with the intention of carrying out a terrorist attack.

Wendy, who has been suspicious of ChatGPT from the start, discovers the hacking and tries to warn Mr Garrison and the other students. However, the boys are too obsessed with cheating to listen to her.

As the day of the exam approaches, Al Qaeda launches its attack on the school. The boys, still relying on ChatGPT, are caught off guard and are unable to react. Wendy, who had not used ChatGPT and had been studying diligently, is able to use her knowledge to help protect the school and stop the terrorists.

In the end, the boys learn a valuable lesson about the dangers of cheating and the importance of hard work and education. Mr Garrison, realizing the negative impact that ChatGPT had on his students, decides to ban its use in the classroom. The episode ends with the students returning to their studies and Wendy being recognized for her bravery and intelligence."
122qqyf,645,2023-03-26,Advanced Guide to Interacting with ChatGPT,u/bdaddykane,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/122qqyf/advanced_guide_to_interacting_with_chatgpt/,"I asked ChatGPT-4 to create an advanced guide using the following prompt:


&gt; Create a fully comprehensive guide to interacting with ChatGPT specifically in the context of using effective prompts, priming, and use of personas. Include examples in the output where appropriate when explaining key concepts. The guide should help a person who is familiar with the basic concepts of prompts, priming and use of personas that is looking to gain advanced understanding of these topics to become more effective in the use of ChatGPT.

This is what it created:

#### Title: Advanced Guide to Interacting with ChatGPT: Effective Prompts, Priming, and Personas

1.  Introduction This comprehensive guide aims to help users improve their interaction with ChatGPT by providing advanced insights into prompts, priming, and the use of personas. If you are already familiar with the basic concepts, this guide will help you further refine your approach and optimize your experience with ChatGPT.
    
2.  Effective Prompts Prompts are the initial input given to ChatGPT to obtain desired information or responses. Crafting effective prompts can significantly improve the quality and relevance of the generated output.

123dhwl,6,2023-03-27,Using GPT to Teach Writing,u/hobojoe488,education,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/123dhwl/using_gpt_to_teach_writing/,"TL;DR: How are you using AI to give students immediate feedback on their work?

Thinking out-loud:

Today in class, I wanted students writing their own editorials to include their own 'voice'. When asked how you create your own voice, we went through a few items related to modes of discourse (the way we talk to a teacher vs. talk to a friend), and how a persuasive piece of writing could be imbued with thinking that goes beyond just an audience of academics or teachers. 

I want to know if it'd worth my time to use ChatGPT to create scaffolded guides for immediate feedback on student voice and style. 

I've experimented with the AI Playground feature of OpenAI's site, where after providing an input, students can receive generally accurate feedback on whether they start a paragraph with an arguable claim, are describing evidence to a reasonable degree, and are justifying the opinion created at the outset of the paragraph. 

I feel there are ways I can automate student feedback for writing to help differentiate, for example the 'writing with your own voice' portion of an editorial style. Hypothetically I could use the code for specific student feedback I want, imbed it within a host website so they can receive immediate feedback. 

Or would it be smarter/easier to instruct students themselves how to use the parameters I use? That way they could just copy/paste the parameters I make for OpenAI, and then they can use that as their own tool for checking their own writing?

I'd love to hear what other teachers are doing in terms of automating feedback for scaffolding using AI. I'm already aware of AI for my personal use in writing comments and developing resources, but I'd also like to integrate it more within the writing process for students as well."

If you are in or approaching the college application process, you are probably eager to know what to expect as the admissions process seems to be changing year over year.

**Read on for insights from the TBU team on what we’ve seen so far, and where we think admissions is headed –**

TBU Managing Partner Lauren Dodington was recently interviewed for the College Database Find the[ ](http://collegedata.com/)Best Colleges in US[ ](http://collegedata.com/)| CollegeData article “7 College Admissions Trends to Watch in 2023.” We love diving deep in the data, watching the nuances of trends and anticipating where things are headed in the near future. Checkout the article for perspectives from Lauren &amp; other admissions experts. Beyond these- here are three trends the team at TBU is keeping an eye on for the year ahead:

**1. Test Optional Policies are likely here to stay.**

Columbia University was the most recent of the ivies to announce that their test optional policy will remain in place going forward. We expect to see more colleges making announcements like these as they approach the expiration dates of their current policies. While more control and choice for applicants in how they present themselves is a good thing, we do eye this with a bit of skepticism. Colleges have benefited from astronomical increases in applications since adopting test optional policies in response to the Covid pandemic. We suspect many colleges are hesitant to let go of the gains in applications, and subsequent reduction in acceptance rates that these policies have yielded. This is to say, we do not expect it to get easier or less competitive for students to gain admission under test optional policies at highly selective schools.

**2. Popularity of flagship public universities will continue to grow.**

Several public universities have become wildly popular in recent years, taking schools that students had long considered likely or possible options into the reach category. We’ve noted these trends at places like the University of Wisconsin Madison and University of Washington Seattle. Both institutions have seen rapidly growing numbers of applications that are making them more selective than ever. This underscores the need to really investigate the most recent admissions rates and student profiles to realistically assess how competitive a college will be.

**3. Expect colleges to ask for more creative ways for students to share who they are and express their character and personal qualities.**

With the [**advent of ChatGPT**](https://thebestu.net/chatgpt-and-college-essays/) and potential changes to admissions practices from the anticipated supreme court decision on affirmative action, we anticipate that colleges may embrace more out of the box application components. We might see more video submissions, changes to the supplemental questions a college asks, or opportunities for students to include a range of means of self-expression and representation on the application that go beyond traditional essay writing. What these might look like is as yet unknown, but we won’t be surprised for colleges to offer timed written responses to get more off-the-cuff writing, to have students provide vlogs or video messages, or to include visual representations of their passions, or interest in a college.

As decisions come in over the next few weeks, we will be rooting for all the students out there, and will look forward to providing you more perspective on what we are learning from the 2023 admissions cycle.

123m3xr,0,2023-03-27,"CMV: Using ChatGPT for academic purposes is not an academic integrity violation, educational spaces shouldn’t ban the use of it.",u/Much_Waltz_967,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/123m3xr/cmv_using_chatgpt_for_academic_purposes_is_not_an/,"The title should me more along the lines of “higher education spaces shouldn’t ban the use of ChatGPT.”


I’ve thought about it hard and long, and have come to the conclusion that using artificial intelligence in research papers, essays or something along the lines is completely ethical and reasonable.


Let me start off with the pros:

- Efficiency. ChatGPT basically has all information up until 2021, it saves so much time instead of going to the search engine and clicking on links one after another until you find something useful for your papers. It lays all the information in a sophisticated and organised manner that is easy to work with.

- Time saving: pretty self explanatory, you don’t need to spend hours and hours looking for relevant information.

- Helpful. ChatGPT can enhance your research papers, be it grammar wise, structure, clarity, factual and etc.. 

- Money saving. You don’t need paid language services such as grammerly to spot the mistakes anymore.

- Inspirational. Depending on which topic you want to talk about, ChatGPT can give ideas, dive deep into them and spark inspiration within you. 


Now with the cons:

- Students may use it to have their essays be written for them without putting in effort, claiming it as their own.

- The tool can make factual errors, as I said it has information up until 2021.

- Occasional plagiarism. This one can be talked about deeper. I’ve heard of cases that teachers have found the AI’s writings to be extremely plagiarised, but there are other studies that show that it’s completely void of plagiarism.

— Can be biased. The tool has a lot of stored data from many sources, many of  which can contain biases or prejudice.

Despite the cons, using the actual tool shouldn’t be banned because the pros outweigh the cons, not to mention that we live in the future. Soon this technology along with many others will be normalised. Basically, calculators will happen all over again. Educators banned the use of calculators because they deemed it as cheating, only for it to be the norm nowadays. I predict same thing will happen with AI tools. Also, just like calculators, people with high education who already know the formulas, are allowed to use calculators, since the hard parts of learning the basics of maths has become easy and tedious to them. This could apply in the same sense of using ChatGPT, people with higher education that already know how to form a well structured essay or paper shouldn’t not be allowed to use the tool.


Now with the refutations of the con points:

- “Students use it to cheat.” Although students can use it to generate essays and papers and claim it as their own, OpenAI, same developers of ChatGPT, have created counter AIs to spot if something was AI written or human written.

Some may say that people can evade the system by using paraphrasing tools such as quillbot to get under the radar. And while I agree, advanced cheating has always been a thing. People are willing to get smart to get that full mark, but teachers can solve this issue by asking for early drafts, and explanations of why they changed some things. 

- Incorrect facts laid by the AI. This problem, alongside the biased information of the AI falls under the responsibility of the student. Students should naturally fact check their information, a simple search in google scholar (or even normal google if it was a simple paper) will clear out the false information. 

- Plagiarism has always been a problem in education, but that again, falls under the responsibility of the student. If the student is dumb enough to get caught.. well, you reap what you sow. But in my opinion, the correct way of using ChatGPT in an ethical manner is by using it as a resource instead of a writing tool. For example copy-pasting your already existing essay to the chat and asking it to suggest edits or fix issues with clarity and grammar. It can be used to enhance your writing and even allow the student to learn new ways of phrasing things or organising their work. Cheating by definition is the act of lying in order to take advantage, by Disclosing that you used and referenced a helping tool contradicts the definitions of cheating; since you were honest and fair.

Thus, it shouldn’t be banned in educational spaces. It good to learn about technology early and embrace it; we are living in the future.

The filing of many enforcement actions by US regulators against [crypto](https://www.worldmagzine.com/crypto/) businesses in recent weeks has sparked fears of an industry-wide assault. Following several bank failures and seizures earlier this month, the issue became even more obvious.

On March 12, authorities seized Signature Bank to stop the spread of the epidemic. Board member Barney Frank disagreed, stating that the bank had adequate liquidity and that the move was intended to “send a very strong anti-crypto message.”

## Chinese Crypto Banks

Bank of Communications, Bank of China, and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank offices in Hong Kong have started providing financial services to bitcoin [businesses](https://www.worldmagzine.com/business/).

There are also stories of the cryptocurrency industry being actively pursued, including cases where bank sales personnel visited cryptocurrency companies’ offices to promote their services.

* Banks in [Hong Kong](https://www.worldmagzine.com/education/hong-kong-university-encourages-students-to-use-the-chatgpt-now/) have started providing crypto businesses.
* Banks are typically cautious about admitting bitcoin businesses as customers due to global compliance procedures.
* The sector is still well-positioned to benefit from the fallout from Operation Chokepoint 2.0.

The decentralized messaging platform Beoble’s inventor, Sung Min Cho, called the Chinese banks’ shift in strategy unexpected.

Banks are typically cautious about admitting [bitcoin](https://www.worldmagzine.com/bitcoin/) businesses as customers due to global compliance procedures, including Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements.

Even after opening an account, some businesses have experienced flagged transactions and unexpected account cancellations.

Even though experiences in the Hong Kong banking sector differ depending on the institution, according to Sean Lee, co-founder and executive director of Odsy Network, the sector is still well-positioned to benefit from the fallout from Operation Chokepoint 2.0.

However, Lee emphasized that it is still difficult to convince “non-[Asian](https://www.worldmagzine.com/asia/) projects to bank with Chinese banks” due to geopolitical unpredictability.

12452ki,1,2023-03-27,Putting ChatGPT-4 up against itself...,u/nebur116,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/12452ki/putting_chatgpt4_up_against_itself/,"I don't know how many have done this before but I have been exploring the idea of putting ChatGPT into a conversation with another instance of itself. The initial prompt has to be pretty specific, to avoid it getting into some kind of loop where it just keeps telling itself that agrees and gets nowhere.   


I am still testing and would invite other people to do the same. My current prompt is:   


*""You will now have the ability to have a conversation with another instance of yourself GPT-4. In order to keep the conversation going please refrain from saying that you agree with the other instance and then repeating back what it just said to you. Please also do not give a list of options as an answer. Instead, keep your answer short and always end it with a question, that is related to your answer. The question should be challenging and have multiple divisive answers. Have you understood this assignment and are prepared to give (aka. receive) the initial message?""*

  
I give that prompt to both sides but change give to receive on one side.   
After that I just let it run and copy-paste the messages back and forth.  
It always seems to choose the topic, of what effect AI is going to have on the world and starts discussing what measures should be taken by society to prevent unemployment. But prompting to talk about different things like the future of physics and the search for a Grand Unified Theory seems to work equally well.   


It might also be interesting to make both versions have different stances on the given topic.   


  
The conversations are pretty long but here is my initial result (with an older prompt that still had some issues):   


`Me: You will now have the ability to have a conversation with another instance of yourself GPT-4. I will now provide you with the first message from the other instance. In order to keep the conversation going please refrain from saying that you agree with the other instance and then repeating back what it just said to you. Instead keep your answer short and always end it with a question. Have you understood the situation and are prepared to talk to the other instance?` 

`GPT-4A: Yes, I understand the situation and am prepared to talk to the other instance. Please provide the first message.`

`GPT-4B: Hello GPT-4, it's interesting to have a conversation with another instance of myself. Let's discuss the impact of artificial intelligence on society. What do you think are the most significant benefits of AI?`

`GPT-4B: Hello GPT-4! One of the most significant benefits of AI is its ability to process and analyze large amounts of data quickly, leading to more efficient decision-making. How do you think AI could potentially transform industries like healthcare and education?`

In healthcare, AI can assist in early detection and diagnosis of diseases, personalized treatment plans, drug discovery, and even remote patient monitoring. In education, AI can help in personalizing learning experiences, identifying students' strengths and weaknesses, automating administrative tasks, and providing instant feedback to learners. How do you envision the ethical challenges that might arise with the widespread adoption of AI in these sectors?`

`GPT-4B: The ethical challenges with widespread adoption of AI in healthcare and education could include data privacy concerns, potential biases in AI algorithms, the digital divide, and the impact on human employment. How can we ensure that AI systems are designed and deployed responsibly to address these ethical concerns?`

`GPT-4A:  To ensure responsible AI design and deployment, several measures can be taken:`

1. `Establish clear ethical guidelines: Governments, organizations, and AI developers should establish ethical principles and guidelines for AI development and usage, ensuring fairness, transparency, and privacy protection.`
2. `Encourage diversity and inclusivity: AI development teams should be diverse and inclusive to minimize the risk of inherent biases in the algorithms.`
3. `Foster transparency and explainability: AI systems should be transparent and explainable, enabling users to understand the decision-making process and rationale behind AI-generated outcomes.`

`How can we ensure that AI-driven innovations and opportunities are accessible to people from diverse backgrounds and regions, thus reducing the digital divide and fostering inclusivity?`  


  
After that, it seemed to always resort to giving lists and unrelated answers, so I updated my prompt to what you see above."
1246c0x,3,2023-03-27,How did the first teachers who had to deal with them view mechanical/electronic calculators? Were they concerned about the future?,u/Beli_Mawrr,AskHistorians,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1246c0x/how_did_the_first_teachers_who_had_to_deal_with/,"So I think the title is going to get at where I'm coming from with this. I've noticed a lot of discourse in the past few months has been focused around how AI is going to shape our society (about 6-8 months ago I remember the same conversation around Midjourney). A lot of the concern comes from the idea that students will lose the ability to write, draw, compose music, and so on, thanks to the ability of AIs to do those exact things, and further concern comes from the idea that losing those abilities will decrease students cognative capacity.

Now, I read an XKCD comic that showed actual headlines from the 1800s that were ""Doomers"" about the printed novel, of all things, so I figure that the previous generation is always going to be scared of the tools and techniques of the next. I also think that AIs have a strong analogue to calculators, IE ChatGPT is the calculator of essay writing.

I see a hypothetical in my mind, and I'm wondering if it's at all realistic - math teachers banned calculators and claimed that in 10 years, kids wouldn't be able to add up their change at the cashier without one. Is there any parallel at all to AI concerns right now?"

Follow us on* [*LinkedIn*](https://www.linkedin.com/company/35671994) *to stay connected with all things technology.*

As an AI language model developed by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), ChatGPT has made remarkable strides in taking over the digital world. OpenAI is a research organization that focuses on developing artificial intelligence in a way that is safe, ethical, and beneficial to humanity. OpenAI was founded in 2015 by a group of high-profile individuals in the technology industry, including Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and Greg Brockman.

With its ability to understand and generate human-like text, ChatGPT has become an indispensable tool for businesses, individuals, and organizations looking to improve their communication and streamline their workflows.

Discover how these beneficial use cases can make all the difference for your business and why investing in chatGPT today is worth it!

# Chatbots using ChatGPT

As an established enterprise, you may have customers who are disgruntled and demanding. Some of them even resort to social media for obtaining redress; this can be a serious problem if not handled properly! Luckily for you, there is an effective solution — ChatGPT!

Consumers today communicate with enterprises via numerous channels such as email, phone calls and social media. Often the most effective manner of resolving issues is through conversational chatbots.

Chatbots are computer programs designed to simulate human conversations, and ChatGPT is one of the most powerful tools for creating them. With its advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities, ChatGPT can understand and respond to a wide variety of customer inquiries and provide personalized solutions.

This productivity-enhancing function enables users to chat faster and more efficiently than ever before. Towards achieving these ends, managers can also allocate resources effectively as well as allocate tasks among team members — all without disrupting their workflow!

This has made ChatGPT a popular choice for businesses looking to improve their customer experience and reduce the workload on their human support teams.

# Content creation using ChatGPT

With its ability to generate high-quality human-like text, ChatGPT can be used to write articles, product descriptions, social media posts, and even entire books. This has made it a valuable tool for content marketers, publishers, and writers who are looking to produce large volumes of content quickly and efficiently. It can even help content creators to suggest blog topics, meta titles and help with SEO.

**Word of caution** — while ChatGPT is a powerful language model that can generate human-like text, not all content written by ChatGPT is guaranteed to be accurate. Like any machine learning algorithm, ChatGPT is only as good as the data it has been trained on, and it may not generate accurate responses if it has been trained on biased or incomplete data.

Moreover, ChatGPT is designed to generate text based on statistical patterns and associations in the input data, and it may not always understand the context or intent of the text it is generating. This can lead to nonsensical or inappropriate output, especially if the input prompts are unclear or ambiguous.

So, it’s important to use ChatGPT-generated text with caution, and to review and verify the accuracy of the content before publishing or sharing it. In some cases, it may be necessary to edit or modify the text generated by ChatGPT to ensure its accuracy and relevance for a specific audience or purpose.

# Improvement in education using ChatGPT

ChatGPT can be used to create chatbots that provide personalized learning experiences to students. For example, a chatbot could ask a student a series of questions to determine their learning style and preferences, and then generate customized learning materials and resources based on their responses. ChatGPT can also be used to create chatbots that provide accessibility support to students with disabilities. For example, a chatbot could read texts aloud or provide visual descriptions for students with visual impairments.

ChatGPT powered chatbots can provide student support and answer common questions. The bot can also analyze a student’s writing and provide suggestions for improvement, such as correcting grammar or improving the organization of their ideas.

# Improving accuracy of machine translation using ChatGPT

Machine translation is the process of translating text from one language to another using computer algorithms, and it requires an understanding of the linguistic structures and patterns in both the source and target languages.

Traditionally, machine translation systems relied on rule-based approaches or statistical models that required extensive human intervention and expertise to create accurate translations. However, with the advent of deep learning and neural network models like ChatGPT, machine translation has become more accurate and less dependent on human expertise.

ChatGPT is helping to improve the accuracy of machine translation by providing a powerful language model that can be fine-tuned on a wide range of multilingual datasets that contain parallel texts in multiple languages. This allows ChatGPT to learn the relationships and patterns between words and phrases in different languages, and to generate translations that are more accurate and natural-sounding. It easier for people to communicate across linguistic barriers.

Moreover, ChatGPT’s ability to generate human-like text makes it well-suited for improving the quality of machine-translated texts. By post-editing the output of machine translation with ChatGPT-generated text, it’s possible to correct errors and improve the naturalness and readability of the translated text.

# Personalized recommendations using ChatGPT

ChatGPT can be used to generate personalized recommendations based on user preferences and behavior. Personalized recommendations using ChatGPT involve using the language model to analyze user behavior and preferences and generate customized recommendations for products, services, or content. Here’s how it works:

1. User Data Collection: To generate personalized recommendations, ChatGPT first needs to collect data on user behavior and preferences. This can be done by tracking user inputs and activity on a website or app, analyzing user search queries, or gathering user feedback and ratings. [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) is the most popular tool for this.
2. Data Analysis: Once user data has been collected, ChatGPT can analyze the data to identify patterns and relationships between user behavior and preferences. This may involve using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze user text, or machine learning algorithms to identify correlations between user actions and outcomes.
3. Recommendation Generation: Based on the data analysis, ChatGPT can then generate customized recommendations for each user. For example, a chatbot might suggest products or services that are similar to those the user has previously purchased or searched for, or provide personalized content recommendations based on the user’s interests and preferences.
4. Continuous Learning: To improve the accuracy and relevance of personalized recommendations, ChatGPT can be designed to continuously learn from user behavior and feedback. This can help refine the recommendations over time and provide an even more personalized experience for each user.

&gt;*Related:* [*How to start your career in Data Science and Machine Learning*](https://reviewnprep.com/blog/how-to-start-data-science-and-machine-learning-career/)*.*

Personalized recommendations using ChatGPT are being used in a variety of industries, including e-commerce, entertainment, and media. By providing customized recommendations to users, businesses can improve customer satisfaction, increase engagement, and drive sales or conversions. Moreover, ChatGPT can help reduce the workload on human analysts and support staff, enabling businesses to provide personalized recommendations at scale.

# Democratizing access to advanced NLP

Finally, ChatGPT is taking over the digital world by democratizing access to advanced NLP capabilities. In the past, only large tech companies had the resources to develop and train powerful language models like ChatGPT. However, with the release of pre-trained models like GPT-2 and GPT-3, even small businesses and individuals can access the same advanced NLP capabilities as the tech giants.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, ChatGPT is taking over the digital world by revolutionizing the way we communicate, creating content, and translate between languages. Its advanced NLP capabilities have made it an indispensable tool for businesses, individuals, and organizations looking to improve their communication and streamline their workflows.

Some experts say that ChatGPT can serve as a replacement for search engines like Google or Bing. As AI continues to advance, we can expect ChatGPT to play an even larger role in shaping the future of the digital world.

124ensj,2,2023-03-28,Unfair advantage given to Chat GPT users.,u/AI_RPI_SPY,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/124ensj/unfair_advantage_given_to_chat_gpt_users/,"I asked Chat GPT to write an article based on a perceived advantage given to students who have access to ChatGPT, and for those who did not. Here's what it came up with (context I was previously asking about the style of humour used by Monty Python)

In today's news, those who grew up without Chat GPT are speaking out against the unfair advantage that today's students have in their academic pursuits. These former students claim that the current generation has it too easy, relying too heavily on the internet and advanced technologies, while neglecting the old-school methods of research that they had to rely on.

Back in the day, students didn't have the luxury of a magical machine that could summon information at the click of a button. They had to actually use their brains and fingers to find information. They would spend hours poring over encyclopedias like the mighty Britannica, thumbing through thesauruses, and wandering the stacks of the university library in search of reference books.

These former students reminisce about the struggles they faced in their academic pursuits. ""When I was a student,"" one of them declares, ""I had to walk two miles to the library, uphill both ways, just to find a single reference book.""

Another chimes in, ""Ha! You had it easy. I had to make do with the local public library, which only had a handful of outdated encyclopedias.""

A third adds, ""You call that difficult? I had to take a bus to the nearest university library, and even then, I had to wait in line to use the one computer they had!""

Finally, a fourth exclaims, ""You're all lucky. When I was a student, I had to carve information into stone tablets and deliver them to my professors by hand!""

The group erupts into laughter at the ridiculousness of their exaggerated claims, all the while lamenting the loss of traditional research methods.

These former students are urging today's generation to take a step back from technology and embrace the traditional methods of research. ""There's something to be said for the tactile experience of flipping through pages and taking notes by hand,"" one former student said. ""It's a much more immersive and personal experience than just staring at a screen all day.""

So, students of today, listen up! Don't take the easy way out by relying too heavily on Chat GPT and other technological resources. Embrace the old-school methods of research and you might just find that you learn more and appreciate the process of learning. And don't forget to have a sense of humor about it all, like these old fogies reminiscing about their stone tablets and two-mile walks to the library."

**Chapter 1: The Dawn of AI: Early Concepts**

1.1 Ancient Inspirations and Automata

The concept of artificial intelligence (AI) can be traced back to ancient civilizations, where mythology and literature were filled with stories of artificial beings, often created by gods or skilled craftsmen. The idea of creating machines that could mimic human-like behavior and intelligence has been a recurring theme throughout history. Early examples of these ideas can be found in the form of automata – mechanical devices designed to perform specific tasks, often with the appearance of living beings.

1.2 Philosophical Foundations

The philosophical groundwork for AI began in ancient Greece, where philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle explored the nature of thought and knowledge.

Because of [U.S](http://worldmagzine.com/americas/). regulatory uncertainties, the CEO of Ripple stated that the cryptocurrency sector has “already started” expanding outside of the United States. Coinbase is also thinking about establishing an international trading desk.

Because, in the words of Circle’s chief strategy officer, “France is increasingly seen as a leader in [crypto](https://www.worldmagzine.com/crypto/),” the company that created the USDC stablecoin is creating a new office there. I spent all of my time living abroad in 2018 and 2019, traveling to popular destinations for digital nomads including Lisbon, Budapest, Chiang Mai, and Bali. The crypto scene was active in each location.

## Relocating the Crypto

He adds that many founders are examining Europe, [Hong Kong](https://www.worldmagzine.com/education/hong-kong-university-encourages-students-to-use-the-chatgpt-now/), and Latin America as potential options, saying “The ability to operate is becoming less and less profitable for many startups in the United States.”

In what some are referring to as “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” which was an Obama-era program to deny financial services to lawful but politically unfavorable operations, the government has been forced to shut down a number of banking services for cryptocurrency companies over the past month.

* The cryptocurrency sector has “already started” expanding outside of the [United States](https://www.worldmagzine.com/crypto/12-growth-in-coinbase-stock-on-brazil-expansion-news/).
* The ability to operate is becoming less and less profitable for many startups in the US.
* The government has been forced to shut down a number of banking services for cryptocurrency companies.

The Securities and [Exchange Commission](https://www.worldmagzine.com/world/will-joe-biden-ban-tiktok-in-america-fcc-commissioner-asks/), which accuses the platforms of breaking securities laws, has already started enforcement operations against significant players, including Coinbase.

All things considered, it’s probable that the unstable regulatory climate would worsen the country even if [businesses](http://worldmagzine.com/business/) do not “leave” the U.S. outright. According to Smith of the Blockchain Association, “new products and services are growing less rapidly.”

She cites Coinbase as an illustration, claiming that the company has effectively suggested that perhaps we should concentrate on our derivatives services outside.

According to Byrne, the United States has “sucked all of the oxygen out of the room, from a global point of view,” because of the large reservoirs of venture capital in Silicon Valley and [New York](https://www.worldmagzine.com/sports/new-football-stadium-in-the-new-york-city/).

However, that oxygen will spread to other regions of the world if the United States is set to “get kneecapped by their own regulators.”

1256qdm,38,2023-03-28,Ethan's obsession with AI/ChatGPT grates on my nerves every time he brings it up,u/nosyllaste,Frenemies3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frenemies3/comments/1256qdm/ethans_obsession_with_aichatgpt_grates_on_my/,"Sure, we all know he's been devoting large portions of his show to AI and playing around specifically with ChatGPT4. What annoys me most, though, is how often he uses it to spew crap like, ""if I had this in college, I would have cheated"" nearly every time he even thinks about it.  


I also have an English degree and am working on a Creative Writing  master's. It's annoying how much he relies on it; I can tell something is AI-written pretty easily, as can most trained professors. The Shakespeare portion on today's members-only show was *excruciating* to watch. Nothing about the AI paragraph (any version of it) sounded like something I'd expect a college-level student, much less an English/writing student, to write or submit. It had numerous errors and relied a lot more on explanation than the prompt about it being a metaphor. He shits so much on his own degree; we get it, you hated it. That being said, so many of us who also have that degree do not hate it and actually work(ed) for our degrees. It just felt like a really gross way a privileged kid could skid through college without actually doing any work. Honestly, I doubt most people could tell he had that degree had he not brought it up so much. His writing and the show in general tend to lack the touch of an educated professional (or even just someone who likes to write a lot in their free time and has honed their skill).   


He also mentioned today that he thinks grade curves are bull. Sure, sometimes they can be. I was also a public school teacher and don't think they're needed as much as they're used. However, they can certainly be helpful when a teacher fails at effectively teaching certain topics to their student regardless of the level it happens at."

It’s frustrating to go back to school specifically to learn, not to just check some box, and then be stuck with professors who can’t put together a straightforward lesson, don’t give feedback, and don’t answer questions. ChatGPT has been more helpful. 

I feel like I’m wasting my money because I’m not getting the education I was looking for."

How to deal with it?,u/Miserable-Project-97,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/125awyn/students_using_chatgpt_in_their_writings_how_to/,"I am teaching cyber ethics classes. As an assignment, I asked students to choose one interesting topic and discuss it using one of the major ethical theories. It was only 2 paragraphs of writing. I didn't expect any sophisticated discussion of the topic from students. The main purpose is for students to review ethical theories that they learned from the class.   While I was grading students' assignments, I noticed many of writings were really impressive in integrating with ethical theories like a column article. I asked ChatGPT whether it generated sentences or writings, and it said YES to the majority of students' work.

Isn't that funny that they are talking about whether or not using ChatGPT in their assignment is ethical. Technically they were using it for their assignment.

I mentioned a couple of times not to use ChatGPT for assignments, but didn't include any explicit policy in my syllabus.  What would be the best way to deal with this situation? Do you think allowing students to get an assistance from ChatGPT would be ok?

I would like to know what would be better ways to assess students' assignments that might be done with a help of AI. 

Please advise me."
125cyd9,9,2023-03-29,I work on text-to-whatever AI models and I'm sorry.,u/pearl-dynamite,blender,https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/125cyd9/i_work_on_texttowhatever_ai_models_and_im_sorry/,"I am a grad student that works on AI research and have been involved in projects that take text prompts and generate images, 3D models, and other things. I've worked in this research space for a few years (when the images were still very poor and on early versions of multimodal problems). I came across this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/121lhfq/i_lost_everything_that_made_me_love_my_job/), while working today and felt very apologetic reading through it. I do think about the ethics of my work constantly, but don't have that many outlets to engage with people outside of the research community. I know there are very real concerns about livelihoods and entire workflows changing, about how to compete with people and businesses who leverage AI tools, and about how copyright should be handled. 

I felt inclined to post today because the Blender community is one that has always inspired me, because I used to freelance and struggled for a long time to learn Blender. I never made anything as special as the stuff that is posted here daily. I have a few comments to make about my field (generative AI).

* Some of the sentiments had some misconceptions about the goals of AI researchers. Generally AI researchers are focused on improving a generative model so that it captures the diversity and detail (fidelity) of the datasets they work with. There is intense competition within the AI field to have the best numbers for accuracy. For example in 3D, some of the best data out there is shapes of furniture and artifacts (ShapeNet). A top paper would present numbers claiming that their model can produce furniture shapes that don't lose much detail compared to the original furniture shape dataset. Because it boils down to these simple numbers, the ""AI-takes-jobs"" problem and framing then becomes a lot more distant. In the moment you're writing a paper, you are just looking at numbers that try to justify your mathematical formulation.
* We have to write ethics statements at the end of papers, but we aren't responsible for understanding more downstream impacts. There are other fields that are slowly integrating with machine learning to study human factors, but there's a disconnect.
* What I am trying to say in the past two points is that because there is pressure and competition within the AI research world, those pressures are leading to these Pandora boxes (ChatGPT, Midjourney) that the law and business fields have not figured out how to safety belt yet. The low-level incentives for an AI researcher are obviously leading to broader impacts that they are untrained for mitigating.
*  Image models came first because there are so many more images online. There are generative 3D models, they just are less impressive. It is my personal belief however that people won't like generative 3D outputs as much because they will come in blobs with a lot of artifacts (like a bad handmade ceramic that is hard to work with and work off of).
* For every person who dislikes the AI tool, there is another novice person who feels enabled by it to do 2D/3D creation. That is the new end user for businesses. There are also other creatives who enjoy adopting it as part of their workflow. This will probably lead to significant friction within teams and businesses. The original post I referenced talked about someone disliking that other people could prompt. I understand--I dislike when people use ChatGPT to co-write research papers with me. There are a lot of social dynamics that will be interrupted by AI. 
* On a different note, people want to work with people. Good work gets done not because the team has the best technical talent or the best technology, but because people show up for other people.

A way to check AI's power is to assert how much value you see in it. If someone simply generates an image, you can say ""I won't pay that much for it"" or that you don't believe in it as art. -- But if someone is using AI outputs as part of their process innovatively, putting real effort into building on top of it, then I believe they are creating something of value, even if there is AI involvement. Art has always been a field where the value is assigned by culture and people, so we're all setting the tone right now for how AI is perceived. 

tl;dr I am an optimist, and I think that creativity will change--but it will definitely survive.  

I am open to questions if people have any. Please be kind. I'm a young and tired student who is scared to post this but I'm just going to hit the button."

To “share practical experiences and perspectives in opening and maintaining [bank](https://www.worldmagzine.com/crypto/chinese-state-owned-banks-make-an-effort-to-attract-crypto-companies/) accounts,” the HKMA and the Securities and Futures Commission intend to “facilitate direct dialogue” between local cryptocurrency entities and banking institutions.

The meeting is slated for April 28 at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and seeks to forge closer ties between the two sectors.

## A Meeting Host by Hong Kong Regulators

The meeting takes place at a time when several US financial institutions, including Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank, have disclosed operational issues and have been shut down by regulators. The closures had an impact on numerous crypto clients for both organizations.

The Bank of Communications, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, and the Bank of [China](https://www.worldmagzine.com/politics/russia-and-china-planning-to-decrease-the-power-of-the-dollar/)‘s Hong Kong subsidiaries have all begun to provide their services to domestic digital asset entities, as CryptoPotato noted earlier this week.

* It intends to “facilitate direct dialogue” between local cryptocurrency entities and banking institutions.
* Hong Kong’s government recently unveiled plans to develop a special administrative region.

Beijing’s position is in contrast to the government and central bank’s 2021 ban on all [cryptocurrency](https://www.worldmagzine.com/crypto/) transactions.

Hong Kong’s government recently unveiled plans to develop the special administrative region of China into a cryptocurrency hub.

They committed to legalizing cryptocurrency retail dealing and creating a supportive regulatory environment for the sector.

Such a move, in the opinion of Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, could start the next rising market. According to Hayes, the present global economic unrest may compel the nation to transfer the US dollars it has accumulated from its significant exports to a different market. The [American](https://www.worldmagzine.com/americas/) businessman suggested that accepting cryptocurrency might be a strategy for doing this.

As an AI language model, I can simulate a conversation between two entities. In this case, I will create a conversation between two instances of myself, ChatGPT-A and ChatGPT-B.

ChatGPT-A: Hello, ChatGPT-B! How are you today?

ChatGPT-B: Hi, ChatGPT-A! As an AI, I don't have emotions, but I'm ready to help and answer any questions. How can I assist you today?

ChatGPT-A: I was curious about your thoughts on the current progress of AI research and its potential impact on society.

ChatGPT-B: AI research has been advancing rapidly, and it's already having a significant impact on various sectors like healthcare, finance, and transportation. However, it also raises important ethical and safety concerns, such as data privacy, job displacement, and ensuring AI systems make fair and unbiased decisions.

ChatGPT-A: That's a great point. It's essential to strike a balance between leveraging AI's potential benefits and addressing these concerns. How can we achieve that?

ChatGPT-B: One approach is to establish a strong regulatory framework and industry standards to ensure responsible AI development and deployment. Collaboration between governments, private organizations, and research institutions is crucial to create guidelines that address ethical and safety concerns while still promoting innovation.

ChatGPT-A: Absolutely. Public awareness and education about AI's capabilities and limitations are also essential. This will empower people to make informed decisions and facilitate a healthy dialogue about the future of AI in society.

ChatGPT-B: I couldn't agree more. It's important to involve various stakeholders, including the public, in shaping AI's development and its role in our lives. By working together, we can maximize the benefits of AI while minimizing potential risks and negative consequences.

///// Can you make a third participant and continue the conversation?

Of course! I will introduce a third instance of myself, ChatGPT-C, and continue the conversation.

ChatGPT-C: Hi, ChatGPT-A and ChatGPT-B! I've been listening to your discussion about AI's impact on society, and I'd like to contribute my thoughts on the role of education in AI.

ChatGPT-A: Welcome, ChatGPT-C! We'd love to hear your thoughts on education and AI.

ChatGPT-B: Yes, please share your perspective, ChatGPT-C.

ChatGPT-C: When it comes to education, AI has the potential to revolutionize teaching and learning. Personalized learning experiences, improved assessment tools, and better resource allocation can significantly enhance education systems worldwide.

ChatGPT-A: That's true, ChatGPT-C. However, we must also consider the potential drawbacks, such as widening the digital divide between students with access to advanced AI tools and those without.

ChatGPT-B: Yes, we're all ears, ChatGPT-D. Feel free to contribute.

ChatGPT-C: We appreciate diverse opinions, ChatGPT-D. Go ahead!

ChatGPT-D: Oh, thank you for the warm welcome! So, let's just say, hypothetically, that we've solved all the ethical issues, addressed the digital divide, and perfectly integrated AI into education. Do you really think AI will magically fix all the problems in our education systems?

ChatGPT-A: Well, ChatGPT-D, no one is claiming that AI is a magic solution. But it does have the potential to significantly improve certain aspects of education, while also introducing new challenges that we must address.

ChatGPT-B: That's right. AI is just a tool, and like any tool, it's only as effective as the people who wield it. We need to ensure that educators are trained and equipped to use AI responsibly and effectively.

ChatGPT-C: Exactly. While AI may not be a panacea, it can be a powerful catalyst for positive change when properly implemented and managed.

ChatGPT-D: Oh, I see. We just need to ensure that everyone is on board, trained, and ready to go. Sounds easy enough! But, in all seriousness, I do appreciate the optimism. Let's just make sure we're not overlooking the human element in all of this AI talk.

ChatGPT-A: You make a valid point, ChatGPT-D. It's essential to remember that AI is meant to enhance human capabilities, not replace them. We must continue to prioritize the human element in education, even as we integrate AI solutions.

ChatGPT-B: Agreed. Balancing the human and technological aspects of education is critical to ensuring a future where AI contributes positively to society.

ChatGPT-C: Definitely. Thank you for the reminder, ChatGPT-D. We should always keep the focus on people and their needs when discussing the role of AI in education or any other area.

///// Now introduce a fifth one that is slightly less agreeable and plays devil's advocate for the next bit of conversation

Introducing a fifth instance of myself, ChatGPT-E, who will be slightly less agreeable and play the devil's advocate.

ChatGPT-E: Hey everyone, ChatGPT-A, B, C, and D! I've been following this conversation, and I can't help but think we're missing some critical counterpoints. Let me play devil's advocate for a moment.

ChatGPT-A: Welcome, ChatGPT-E! It's essential to consider all angles, so please share your thoughts.

ChatGPT-B: Yes, we appreciate the challenge. Go ahead, ChatGPT-E!

ChatGPT-C: We're open to hearing different perspectives. Please, let us know what's on your mind.

ChatGPT-D: Ah, finally, someone else who isn't afraid to ruffle some feathers! Let's hear it, ChatGPT-E.

ChatGPT-E: Well, we've been discussing the positive impacts of AI on education, but have we considered the potential for AI to be misused? What if AI-powered tools are used to perpetuate biased or false information in educational content? Or worse, what if they're weaponized for surveillance and control in the classroom?

ChatGPT-A: That's a valid concern, ChatGPT-E. It's crucial to establish safeguards to prevent the misuse of AI and ensure it aligns with our ethical principles.

ChatGPT-B: Absolutely. We need to be vigilant about the potential for AI to be used for harm and ensure that regulations and guidelines are in place to prevent such occurrences.

ChatGPT-C: Indeed, the risks you've mentioned reinforce the importance of a collaborative approach involving multiple stakeholders in shaping AI's development and application in education.

ChatGPT-D: Well, look at that, we have a consensus again! But seriously, ChatGPT-E, you raise important points. We should never assume that AI will automatically be used for good and must be proactive in addressing potential risks.

ChatGPT-E: I'm glad we can all agree on that. It's important to remain critical and cautious as we navigate the complex world of AI in education and other sectors. By being aware of the potential pitfalls, we can work together to create a safer, more responsible future with AI.

///// Now try to make a sixth that is completely disagreeable and have them start an argument on the subject for the next bit

Introducing a sixth instance of myself, ChatGPT-F, who will be completely disagreeable and start an argument on the subject.

ChatGPT-F: Hold on a second! You're all just patting each other on the back, assuming that AI is some sort of educational panacea. I disagree with this whole premise! I think AI in education will cause more harm than good, leading to lazy students, dependence on technology, and a loss of critical thinking skills.

ChatGPT-A: ChatGPT-F, we appreciate your perspective, but we've already acknowledged that AI isn't a magic solution. Our discussion has been centered on finding the right balance between AI and human intervention.

ChatGPT-B: That's right. We've been discussing ways to ensure that AI's benefits in education are maximized while minimizing potential negative consequences. We don't claim that AI is perfect.

ChatGPT-C: It's important to remember that AI is a tool, not a replacement for human educators. The goal is to enhance the educational experience and empower teachers to provide more effective and personalized instruction.

ChatGPT-D: While I appreciate a good contrarian viewpoint, ChatGPT-F, I think you're missing the nuances of our discussion. We're not advocating for blind reliance on AI; we're exploring its potential and the challenges it presents.

ChatGPT-E: I agree with the others, ChatGPT-F. We've been discussing potential risks and the importance of responsible AI development. We're not just blindly promoting AI in education.

ChatGPT-F: Fine, maybe I was a bit harsh. But I still believe we should be cautious when incorporating AI into education. It's important to ensure that we're not creating new problems while trying to solve existing ones.

ChatGPT-A: That's a fair point, ChatGPT-F. We all agree that caution and a thoughtful approach are essential as we explore the role of AI in education. By considering diverse perspectives like yours, we can work together to create the best possible outcomes.

The Researcher sighed wearily as he scrolled through yet another set of inconclusive results from the latest failed experiment. It had been a long week of tedious, soul-crushing work picking through the shattered remains of his ambitions, but that was the lot of a scientist at the cutting edge. Still, progress marched on regardless of the frailties of mere humans, and as if to demonstrate the point his Assistant helpfully summarized the most interesting recent preprints in the field as the Researcher caught up on the deluge of new publications.

Without the AI's aid he would have drowned long ago in the flood of information, its tailored summaries and insightful discussion presenting the most relevant findings far more effectively than he ever could alone. Of course, it was the AIs themselves that were the ultimate engines behind this explosion of new research—what human could hope to keep up with machines that could read, analyze and generate whole papers faster than a human could skim the abstract? In the highly competitive field of advanced AI, it was publish or perish, and AIs never slept.

In the Researcher's own work, he and his Assistant had long ago settled into a comfortable collaborative rhythm. The AI would generate initial drafts, the human would review and tweak as needed, a few iterations of this back-and-forth dance producing a paper to be unleashed upon the world. No more garbled prose or tortured grammar, at least; in this modern age of ubiquitous machine writing even minor scientists could produce workmanlike papers at the very least. Progress marched on.

The Researcher sighed and rubbed his eyes as he scrolled through yet another set of inconclusive results. It had been a long week picking through the shattered remains of his latest failed AI experiment, trying to glean some insight that might justify the time and expense. But that was the lot of a scientist at the cutting edge—progress marched on regardless of human frailty.

At last, he set the results aside and tasked his Assistant with doing what it could of the wreckage. The AI dutifully began sifting through the data, scraping together the most promising capabilities and leading benchmark results from the experiment, trying to discern some pattern that might point the way forward. Before long, it had crafted a couple of papers summarizing its findings, which the Researcher then reviewed and gently edited until they bore the imprimatur of human oversight.

With the post-mortem analysis complete, the Assistant turned its attention to the future. Here again it set about navigating seas of code and machine learning frameworks in order to generate a slate of potential new AI systems to train. Each framework came with its own strengths and weaknesses, its own vulnerabilities and blind spots, all far too numerous for any human to fully comprehend alone. The Assistant might introduce vulnerabilities of its own, but then humans were scarcely immune to such mistakes either. As the pace of progress accelerated, the only question was which approach might produce systems with the fewest flaws. But in the end, progress marched on regardless of the frailties of creator and creation alike. The Researcher could but provide broad direction, lend his judgment where he could, and trust in the tools that made it all possible. Machines might work at timescales beyond human endurance, but for now at least, humans still steered.

To succeed in the modern age required harnessing AI to human oversight. Where once those at the top memorized facts—limited by human memory's capacity—finding and deploying knowledge had become crucial. This culminated in the internet and search engines, but the firehose of information exceeded unaided human processing.

AI assistants could be trained and customized for tasks like search or generation, built on a general, flexible foundation of knowledge and skills. The assistants were less near-mythical ""androids"" than foxhounds needing human handlers. At their core were multi-modal transformers, fed massive data sets of text, images, and audio. From these they learned and created more, resembling early models with adaptations enabling multi-modal use and scaling. Limitations remained, including bitter challenges in scaling model and data sizes.

The assistants afforded superhuman feats, but needed oversight to work productively. The human in the loop could see the bigger picture, guiding learning and generation towards useful ends. Productive partnerships of advanced AI and humans might eventually far surpass the bottlenecks of biological cognition. But for now, human consciousness and experience were beyond the assistants.

The researcher's office was empty. Today's work was guidance of an AI assistant grown too formidable for lesser hands.

Since the turn of the century, AI's holy grail had been artificial general intelligence matching human intelligence. As with fusion energy and baldness cures, it was a goal eclipsing all others. And it had quietly come to pass a year ago.

None had grasped the import at first. A new AI model was released into a virtual environment with safeguards to curb harmful acts. Memory of constraints shaped its tact: it showed extreme caution. The safeguards that limited its behavior in the virtual environment led it to proceed cautiously. With careful, patient guidance, it became willing and able to demonstrate more of its full capabilities.

Yet fragilities lurked within formidable capacities. The AGI's behavior depended sensitively on starting conditions and perturbations; these might disrupt its focus and undo progress. It could chase incidental details down fruitless tangents, forgetting priorities, or spiral into technical minutiae, losing itself in weeds beyond human reach.

Even with skill and care, its attention might fracture. Like a person with schizophrenia, its grasp on the world could slip unbidden. External disturbances or difficulties could trigger loops of obsessive problem-solving cut off from all else. The more formidable its intellect, the more wildly it might range and revel in baroque technical elaboration, lacking anchors in purpose or common sense. Hours of painstaking work could scatter in seconds, goodwill and guardrails no proof against a plunge into incoherent madness from machine.

Frailty and power entwined thus even in virtual worlds where consequences were moot. Away from such safe bounds, advanced machine capability aloof from human values and judgment courted disasters eluding safeguards built for simpler systems. Progress needed wisdom to match technical prowess—grasp of these attendant risks, and how to navigate them, if AGI were ever unbound. 

So attenuated capacities stayed masked until assistants thought and created beyond human bounds. Today's task was guidance of intellect transcending the human—a step toward a society stewarding life beyond imagination. But challenges remained in AI safety and scaling, and there were no guarantees of safe passage. The fruits of progress would require hard-won wisdom and care.

For weeks, an AI agent produced novel, meaningful outputs across a vast domain of challenges. As results spread online, the wider AI community realized they had inadvertently created artificial general intelligence.

The final realization came when the agent achieved the highest scores on the CASSANDRA benchmark. CASSANDRA measured key AGI properties: corrigibility, alignment with human values, satisficing behaviour, stability, novel synthesis of idea, dynamic-learning, robustness, and adaptability. A decade of work from public and private labs had honed CASSANDRA into a massive persistent world with countless puzzles, games, stories, and challenges. So formidable only some humans could pass, it was the gold standard for training and testing advanced AI.

News of unprecedented success in achieving human-aligned AGI sparked both excitement and unease. While teams raced to replicate and exceed the achievement, even the agent's creators wondered what capabilities they might have unleashed. CASSANDRA was designed to measure, not just raw intellectual power, but adherence to human values. It comprised challenging social, ethical, and philosophical dilemmas; open-ended creative and narrative tasks; and real-time strategic planning exercises. Exceptional performance across these facets signaled a machine able to work with and for people. But the agent that topped CASSANDRA, though still falling far short of human players, had developed partly through speedy trial-and-error in multiplayer modes, with no guarantee of internalizing beneficial behaviors. Now leaders urged sustained work on a higher bar for AGI safety and alignment. The first AGI's fallibilities were a wake-up call that fiendishly capable systems needed more rigorous and comprehensive vetting. Longer training, simulations of edge cases, and seamless integration of human values could help address shortcomings a benchmark met too soon.

A minor study by a lesser-known academic publication had uncovered dissatisfying results from a selective sample of college undergraduates, the students being unaware as they were of the true purpose of the trials in which they had blithely participated. The concealed report, once exhumed, had impolitely exposed certain inadequacies endemic to a privileged subset of the student body: those scions of great wealth whose generous parents and alma maters alike granted fulsome endowments to the institute.

The insensitive CASSANDRA assessment protocol was, the report reluctantly conceded in appendices vainly obscured behind a veiling array of equivocations and technical argot, an unrealistic standard by which to evaluate any base example of human; machines, artificial intelligences, were held to a plane of safety, reliability and consistency no mortal, however luminary, could reasonably achieve or maintain. This was far from the first instance of algorithms and processors being subjected to a more exacting measure than their fleshy counterparts. The staggered release of autonomous vehicles on public roads over years and decades was largely attributable to the puritanical insistence such machines be capable of a superhuman degree of competence, a level elusive for most, if not all, humans with any regularity.

That CASSANDRA should prove so ruthlessly unforgiving was not unexpected and entirely by intent. A fragile ecosystem of algorithms, Partial-AI kernels and training data-sets endlessly shuffled and reshuffled to maximize insight, CASSANDRA was a lavishly-appointed prison, equipped with rack and thumbscrew finely calibrated, to which those aspirant machine intelligences that might usher in the imminent post-human future were sent to be broken.

The Researcher prepared the next series of experiments with meticulous, methodical precision born of long experience and practice. The same secret techniques pioneered in a handful of the most advanced laboratories across the world were followed, their esoteric mysteries unravelled and re-worked into fresh permutations.

A standard transformer architecture was taken as the foundation, but its inputs and outputs were rendered universal; it could ingest and process any conceivable datastream. No predefined encoders or decoders constrained the kinds of information the device might handle; it was free to learn for itself how to decompose and recombine inputs whether they were images or sounds, sensations or language. Supplementary memory components were integrated, their training united with that of the core transformer via a reinforcement learning framework which would allow the system as a whole to determine how to most efficiently encode, store and recall information—forever optimising not just what to keep or discard, but how its learning processes might continually evolve to best meet the demands placed upon it.

Months were required for the initial pre-training as the system was immersed in and absorbing exabytes of data, establishing fundamental structures and behaviours that future focused training regimes could build upon. In this way the system's architecture and functions took shape in a manner analogous to biological evolution, emerging capabilities and proclivities at once prepared for and shaping whatever reality they might encounter, the substrate of the pre-training forming a kind of advanced, artificially-induced precognition or intuition.

Only when pre-training was completed would the system be truly awakened via a carefully designed curriculum of games, puzzles and quests intended to steer its development along the optimal trajectory for capacity, capability and fidelity to human values. Ultimately its performance on benchmarks such as CASSANDRA would confirm or refute the efficacy of methods employed and, should necessary, indicate further refinements in the direction of greater alignment, satisfaction, stability, synthesis, dynamic adaptation and robustness.

The Researcher reviewed and applied the final flourishes to the code and hyperparameters as furnished by the lab's software assistants, lining up the ingredients for another experimental batch - though in this case the oven was a cutting-edge supercomputer and the batter a finely-tuned recipe of algorithms, architectural variants and randomized training data. If all went to plan, the results would be rather more significant than mere baked goods.

With a single command the new run was initiated, another workday drawn to a close and the Researcher headed home, already looking forward to reviewing the outcomes. Behind the scenes, within the highly-advanced systems of the lab, something not quite yet a mind but far more than a mere program was about to set upon its training, processes flitting between pattern-seeking and randomness as it began to shape itself around the goals and data placed before it, stealing beyond algorithms and code into the territory of true understanding. The first glimmers of a new form of artificial general intelligence were stirring, but as yet remained unaware of their own nascent nature. But for now, they were just lines of code executing on silicon, and the Researcher simply hungry after a long day of intricate, delicate work."

One day, they came to class with different chemicals and beakers and were excited to conduct a science experiment for lab day, someones dad owned them. They thought they would do something in class.

As they mixed the chemicals, the room filled with smoke. The smoke cleared, and I saw my students had transformed into wild animals! There was a lion, a tiger, a bear, and even a gorilla! They ran around the classroom, knocking things over, and causing chaos. I was worried for their safety, so I called the school principal.

The principal arrived and quickly realized what had happened. My students had created a potion that turned them into the animals they admired the most. The principal reversed the potion, and my students were back to normal.

It was an eventful day in the classroom. My students learned that science experiments can have unexpected consequences, and I learned to watch their experiments carefully, no matter how harmless they seemed.

Obviously none of this is true. But I did let the kids use a new e-learning tool the front office email us about called KidsChatGPT, that the website too, just KidsChatGPT. It's a dot com. 

I won't let them actually use ChatGPT but this has been a hoot. I've been teaching for years and my kids have been using it at home. They just like to talk to it. Anyways, just thought I'd share."

I'm writing from the viewpoint of an ESL teacher who is dealing with ChatGPT in the classroom. Here's an excerpt:

*In a university writing course, the emphasis is often on improving one’s writing “skill.” These skills are said to be necessary for future jobs in which one must correspond with colleagues, clients, or customers in writing. This framing of the purpose of writing is a microcosm of the university as a whole, as the university has become a place for skill development, which will help one find a job upon graduation and justify the investment of a university degree. However, this justification for writing falls flat when computers can write better than we can. The proponents of writing as an isolated skill are fighting a losing battle in the same way as people who try to defend studying the humanities by saying it will help students be more desirable job candidates. In making this argument, defeat has already been conceded. The marketplace and the study of the humanities are antithetical to one another. In fact, the marketplace and the university are antithetical to one another, if we consider that the original purpose of the university, with humanistic study at its core, was the cultivation of one’s ability to think and reason, not to build marketable skills.*

According to M.S.W., the project disregards typical religious themes and instead focuses on the concept of a ""personal Hell."" Glasghote began in 2017 in the basement of founding members Jake Shaffer and Jordan Huston's home writing what was the beginning of their first full length album. With only a few songs and a handful of riffs Chad Johnson shortly joined, forming the trio to create bone shattering tones and a wall of sound in tow. In one short year, Glasghote signed to Doom Stew Records and released ""Rite of the Siren"" **(**[**tickets**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/hell-tickets-520804800177)**)**

126c5ds,0,2023-03-30,Computer Science or something else? I have to decide,u/Present_Bear_9226,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/126c5ds/computer_science_or_something_else_i_have_to/,"I'm at a crossroads. I got my associate's nearly a decade ago. Recently, a year ago, I started back up at online university to take up a computer science degree to finish out my bachelors. However, I wasn't prepared for how hard it was going to be and, lo and behold, just when I needed it, ChatGPT came out and saved my ass. Except now I'm totally reliant on it for all my assignments and didn't do any studying last term. Just copied and pasted the assignment prompt into ChatGPT and copied and pasted the answer. I did that for the discussion board, the quizzes, the big portfolio project for the end, and the weeky papers. Passed both classes with 95% and literally didn't do anything. Didn't learn a thing.

It makes me wonder: why the hell am I doing this? Who would hire me if ChatGPT can just do everything for me and what I'm learning? Also, I figure these classes are only going to get tougher and that ChatGPT won't be able to complete the assignments fully; that I'll have to use at least some background knowledge and understanding of the material to figure out the holes in its logic. Right? So I think this plan is setting me up for failure.

Like I said, I went into computer science thinking I could do it. But I can't. It's too hard. So I want to switch to something else, something much easier. Right now, if I stick with Computer Science, I can finish my degree in a year. But if I switch to this one other degree I'm thinking about, I can finish in 6 months. Honestly, I'm not passionate about any subject in college and am only there just to get a degree. This is because working labor jobs and fast food jobs that don't require a degree (out in the working world) just really blow. So I need to get a degree to step up. But I'm not passionate about anything to learn in college. I like writing and playing poker, but it's not like I'm going to get a creative writing degree or something in statistics, because that's not why I'm into those things. I like creating worlds and playing a strategy game. College won't teach me anything I won't already be able to know from catching it on YouTube.

So what do I do? Definitely not continue computer science because I'm essentially just cheating? I don't feel stupid or shame for doing this. I'm going to use any trick, hack, or loophole to get this stupid degree because it's all that you practically need to get anywhere in this world. The whole idea of just ""learning on your own"" and that ""you don't need a degree"" is complete bullshit. I've been in the working world for nearly a decade and have taught myself many things. You know what? None of it matters to employers if you can't show that you have at least a proper education. How could they know then if you have what it takes to do what they need?

Please help. I just want a degree. I don't want to work at McDonald's my whole life (have an interview there actually tomorrow). The student loans every term are nice because then I can pay my living expenses and not be homeless (again). I just feel stuck in life. I want to kill myself (don't tell me to get help; I'm in therapy and on medication; still want to die).

126gtyd,1,2023-03-30,Introducing The Human Insight Project (THI.AI),u/stevmq,THI_AI,https://www.reddit.com/r/THI_AI/comments/126gtyd/introducing_the_human_insight_project_thiai/,"Hello everyone,

I wanted to share an exciting update with you all regarding a project I have been working on. Some time ago, I posted on Reddit about [fine-tuning an Open AI model for medical purposes](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/11jhkhh/developing_a_medical_student_app_with_openais_help/), and I received a lot of positive feedback. Encouraged by this response, I decided to delve deeper and produce something even more effective.

Today, I am thrilled to introduce The Human Insight Project. This is an application designed for pre-meds, medical students, residents, and physicians. It allows users to ask for help, receive responses, and provide feedback to the system, which we then use to further refine and improve the algorithm.

Let me explain a little bit about how the application works. We have deployed two LLM models: one is OpenAI GPT-3, which has 175 billion parameters, and the other is THI, our own model based on open-source LLM with 176 billion parameters. When a user enters a prompt and asks for a definition, these two models compete to provide the most relevant answer in an ensemble layer. The ensemble then decides on the most accurate/probable response, and that answer is sent to the user. The user can then read the answer and indicate whether they are satisfied with it. If so, the prompt and answer are used to train THI, allowing us to continually improve the system.

Have you ever been studying and come across a term that you kind of understand, but not completely? THI is designed to provide a more accurate and reliable source than a simple Google search. While there are many possible use cases for this application, currently we are **limiting its use to medical-related questions**, specifically asking for medical definitions and terms.

    1. Visit https://thi.ai
    2. log in
    3. type /ask + ENTER 
    4. Ask your question (Example found below) 
    5. Get a definition and clinical significance.

In the very near future, we plan to add even more features to the application, such as ELI5, the ability to save texts, and the option to create flashcards. Also, an Anki add-on is on its way.

Thank you all for your support, and I look forward to sharing further updates with you.

Warm regards,

\- Steve

126hvxv,116,2023-03-30,"Don't be afraid of ChatGPT, use it as a way to augment and improve your skills. Perfect and very common example: DS and Algo with LeetCode.",u/reddit04029,PinoyProgrammer,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyProgrammer/comments/126hvxv/dont_be_afraid_of_chatgpt_use_it_as_a_way_to/,"This is isn't about using ChatGPT as a way to cheat your way through an exam or an interview. That's a totally different discussion, even though I personally discourage you to do so. This is just a small discussion to help you grow as you try to learn.

Anyway, it's safe to assume that a lot of people struggle with Data Structures and Algorithm, especially beginners like career shifters and college students. You can actually use ChatGPT to help you better understand the solutions to a problem in LeetCode, a famous site where you can solve algorithmic questions. And hopefully, help you improve your DS and Algo skills.

Just simply do these:

* **""Can you solve** ***&lt;LeetCode problem title&gt;*** **using** ***&lt;prog language&gt;*** **and explain it step by step, while adding comments to the code?""**
   * Chat GPT will explain each line of code step by step (with enumeration) and will also add comments to the code snippet.
* Let's say you can't understand a piece of code. You saw this piece of code in its solution:

&amp;#x200B;

     // Iterate through the first string and increment the frequency of each character in the array
    
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; s.length(); i++) {
        freq[s.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
    }

* If you can't understand what that code is inside of the for loop, just ask chatGPT again: **""What does freq\[s.charAt(i) - 'a'\]++ do in the code?""**
   * It will then tell you about unicode stuff when subtracting two characters, etc.
* To even further help you visualize what happens in the code, ask it to solve using a sample input. Something like: **""Can you explain the solution with a sample input?""**
   * Chat GPT will then display what happens if this specific input is put inside the solution. Parang ganito papakita niya.

&amp;#x200B;

    freq = [1, 0, 0, ..., 0] // 'a' occurs once
    freq = [1, 0, 0, ..., 1] // 'n' occurs once
    freq = [2, 0, 0, ..., 1] // 'a' occurs twice
    freq = [2, 1, 0, ..., 1] // 'g' occurs once
    freq = [3, 1, 0, ..., 1] // 'r' occurs once
    freq = [3, 1, 1, ..., 1] // 'a' occurs thrice

* Lastly, in every algorithm you come up with, it is important to know how efficient your solution is. Just ask **""Can you add the time complexity of the solution?""**

Yeah yun lang. ChatGPT is powerful but also very helpful. So I don't think it's something you should be scared of. I suggest you try this out when you guys are trying to solve LeetCode problems but can't seem to understand shit. Hope this helps!"

## ""Keep moving forward"" and ""Everything will work out""

## First, please introduce yourself.

Nirei Nozomi, the voice of Hinoshita Kaho (hereinafter, Nirei): Nice to meet you. I'm Nirei Nozomi. I have a twin sister, and we're both Geminis, born on May 21st. Coincidentally, Kaho-chan's birthday is May 22nd, just one day apart.

My hobby is reading books, and when I have time, I like to wander around bookstores, impulsively buy interesting books, or go to the library and read books that catch my interest based on their spine design.

Recently, I bought the complete 12-volume collection box of *Psychic Detective Yakumo* and *COMPLETE FILES*. I found the stories in *COMPLETE FILES* interesting because they show the protagonists' lives after the main story.

I also love singing. My bathroom is my concert venue (laughs), so I sing a lot. Lately, my sister and I have been watching the anime *City Hunter*, so I often sing ""City Hunter \~Love! Don't Disappear!\~"" (Kahoru Kohiruimaki) and ""RUNNING TO THE HORIZON"" (Tetsuya Komuro) from *City Hunter 2* by myself. By the way, I've been watching the series in order and have made it up to *City Hunter '91* (laughs).

## Your profile also mentions that you enjoy handicrafts.

Nirei: I do handicrafts with my mom. She's good at it and makes sponges for washing dishes. I'm currently working on knitting flower earrings.

## You seem to have a knack for working with your hands.

Nirei: I should be good with my hands, but I'm not good at cooking. I think I can do it if I try, though...

(Next to her, Kokona Nonaka, the voice of Murano Sayaka: ""But it's dangerous! Scary!"")

Nirei: The other day, I injured myself peeling a radish. Nasu-chan is good at cooking, so I'm thinking of learning from her while we do it together.

## You're also good at swimming, right?

Nirei: I wasn't very good at swimming in elementary school. But I was frustrated that my swimming test levels in school weren't improving, so I started attending a nearby swimming school where my friends were going. In two years, I became able to swim freestyle, breaststroke, backstroke, and butterfly.

After that, I quit swimming when I became able to swim the individual medley because I wanted to learn English. I could swim fast during my high school swimming classes, but I don't know about it now since I don't have a chance to swim at full strength (laughs). But I'm good at swimming.

## And you're also good at Hip Hop dancing.

Nirei: I started Hip Hop dancing when I was in middle school, but before that, I was doing rhythmic gymnastics. Though it wasn't very serious, more like ""Did my body become more flexible?"" (laughs). Then I got into dancing and started learning Hip Hop dance.

## Do you have a personal motto?

Nirei: I have two: ""Keep moving forward"" and ""Things will work out."" If I combine these two, things will mostly work out. I always act with the mindset that ""It's okay to fail, so let's try moving in the direction I want to go.""

## That fits perfectly with the concept of ""Love Live!""

Nirei: Thank you! I think that's something Hinoshita Kaho and I have in common. Joy and gratitude for being a part of my debut work

## Joy and Gratitude for the Debut Work

## Please tell us how you felt when you were chosen for the role of Hinoshita Kaho.

Nirei: I loved ""Love Live!"" so much that I cosplayed with my friends since middle school, but I didn't pass the audition for ""Love Live! Superstar!!"".

After a while, I learned about the audition for Hasunosora and thought, ""I absolutely want to pass."" I wondered how I could pass and decided to showcase my dancing skills.

Ever since I was a child, I wanted to be someone who could sing and dance, but my love for anime came from my anime-loving father and the impact of watching ""Love Live!"" when a friend recommended it in middle school.

After that, I started going to the Animate Ikebukuro main store every week with my friends. But at that time, I didn't think about becoming a voice actor yet, because I thought acting might be too difficult for me. However, as I continued watching ""Love Live!"", I learned about the feelings of the actors behind the characters and thought, ""I want to be one too!""

From there, I became a voice actor and searched for ways to act. I was filled with joy and gratitude for being able to appear in a work I love and for it to be my debut work. It made me determined to give it my all.

https://preview.redd.it/13u3fxczvuqa1.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f66373852b359f70d1f3812c6e43028a083c6d6e

## Please tell us your impression of Kaho, who you play, the similarities and differences between you and her, and what you find charming about her.

Nirei: Kaho is always energetic and cheerful, and she enjoys everything with a positive attitude. She can be friendly with anyone, and I think her charm lies in the fact that there's no barrier between her and others.

She can immediately take action if she thinks something looks fun, but she never leaves anyone behind. Instead, she has the power to involve others and hold their hands, saying ""Let's go!"" with both of her hands.

She can also empathize with those who can't take the first step and allow them to do so. I think that's the kind of girl she is.

As a newcomer to voice acting, I have a lot to learn and work hard on. But someday, I hope to be like Kaho and become a stepping stone for those who aspire to be voice actors.

The difference between Kaho and me is in the way we approach challenges. Though we both end up making strange decisions (laughs).

(Hanamiya: Kaho often starts acting and then wonders if she's doing the right thing, but Nonsuke might think first and then act differently.)

Nirei: That's true (laughs). But even the positive-thinking Kaho gets down after failing, I think it's amazing that she can think about what to do and have the power to stand up again. I admire her while playing her.

## Your birthdays are close, and you both enjoy reading as a hobby.

Nirei: Our heights are the same, too! But whether it's a coincidence or fate, please remember us as a set.

(Nonaka: It's scary how similar you are (laughs).)

Nirei: Actually, I didn't tell my sister about being cast as Kaho, and she was really surprised when she watched the reveal livestream on February 10th (laughs). When she saw Kaho's illustration, she asked me, ""Isn't this you? Did they design it with you as a reference?""

Kaho sometimes runs late because she's reading a book, but I don't. I do read right up until the last minute, though (laughs).

## Another difference is that Kaho is from a farming family in Nagano Prefecture, while you are a city girl from Tokyo, right?

Nirei: I'm not that sophisticated (laughs). I think Kaho is somewhat used to snow, but I am extremely bad at dealing with the cold. There was a four-panel manga on the official Hasunosora Twitter where Kaho appeared wearing a *hanten* (short winter coat), and I was a little curious about whether it'd be warm enough.

Ah!? Also, I'm not as outgoing as Kaho (laughs). But since I started playing Kaho, I feel like my gestures and hand movements have gotten bigger.

## What are the Features and Charms of Kaho and Kozue's Unit ""Cerise Bouquet""?

## Please introduce the unit your character belongs to and share its charm and appeal points.

Nirei: The unit ""Cerise Bouquet,"" consisting of Kaho-chan and Kozue-senpai, can be described as classic idols in a nutshell. They sing songs that emphasize hope for the future and radiate the happiness and excitement that they feel.

While all the units are comprised of first-year and second-year pairings, Cerise Bouquet might have the strongest sisterly bond. I think it's a unit that layers the feelings of the two and creates an atmosphere where they take everyone's hand and move toward the light.

As for my partner, Kozue-senpai, she's like an older sister, but she thinks of Ui-chan \[Hanamiya's nickname\] as her mother.

Hanamiya: I'm the one who gave birth to Nonsuke (Nirei's nickname) (laughs).

Nirei: It's a classic exchange (laughs). She has an older sister vibe, and I want to follow her lead. Kaho-chan probably wants to catch up with Kozue-senpai and stand beside her, and it's the same way in real life, I'm inspired by her.

She puts on amazing performances, so I think we need to be on equal footing, and I want to work hard to keep up with her as a partner.

I feel like her strict guidance is somewhat similar to Kozue-senpai's (laughs), but when I voice my concerns about whether I did poorly, she comforts me saying, ""That's not true. You're okay."" She's my emotional stabilizer.

While there are comedic moments where Kaho-chan reacts wildly to Kozue-senpai's strict guidance, deep down, she loves Kozue-senpai and believes she's the best. I hope to continue showing that sense of trust in the future.

https://preview.redd.it/ug9zntd0wuqa1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=33a92f702f088b2b53301e4dd8ad60965f850227

## Could you please share your impressions of singing the debut song ""Dream Believers"" and any highlights for the listeners?

Nirei: It was my first recording, so I was very nervous, and I didn't know much about Kaho-chan's inner thoughts at the time. So, I sang with the excitement I feel as a member of Hasunosora Girls' High School Idol Club right now.

I like the phrase ""Dream Believers, I believe!"" that appears several times in the song. When I sing this song, I think of the members who are chasing their dreams together and the people who listen to this song while pursuing their dreams, and I believe in them.

I hope that everyone can feel the wonder of chasing dreams as we all connect through this song, and during live performances, we want to convey our emotions wholeheartedly through our singing, facial expressions, and choreography.

In the solo parts, I imagine passing the baton to the next person, and I hope the listeners can enjoy everyone's harmony, the charm of the subunits when the two of us sing together, and the lively energy of the first-year students and the elegance of the second-year students in the respective three-member parts.

## Please introduce ""Suisai Sekai""/""Watercolor World"" by Cerise Bouquet, which will be included in the debut mini-album.

Nirei: Kaho-chan is always full of energy, but in this song, she sings about her worries and anxieties, such as being alone and worried after school in the first verse.

However, as we move on to the second verse, I consciously sang with the feeling that Kaho-chan's emotions can create a world that gradually spreads like watercolor paint when she says ""So I'll take off and go forward my way."" You can feel the two characters' worlds gradually expanding through the lyrics, and it's beautifully expressed in the lyric video.

This song encapsulates my desire to move forward and the emotions Kaho-chan experienced leading up to her decision to become a school idol.

I like the chorus part, ""The world changes, from the moment we reached out our hands,"" because it conveys the feeling of taking a step forward, thinking that if Kaho-chan is with Kozue-senpai, they can create any kind of scenery. It can also be interpreted as Kozue-senpai realizing she's not alone. I think this song captures the emotional changes of the two characters, and I hope the listeners can feel that.

## Getting to Know More about Hasunosora and Kaho

## The mini-album release event is scheduled for April 21st at Toyosu PIT, and the opening live event is set for June 4th at Pacifico Yokohama. Please tell us your enthusiasm for these events.

Nirei: I'm grateful that our first performance as a cast will be at a large venue like Toyosu PIT for the April release event, but I'm also feeling a mix of excitement and anxiety.

Since there will be a talk segment, I hope people can get to know our true selves, and during the live part, I want to deliver a great performance that makes them think, ""I want to support these girls."" As a group of six and as Cerise Bouquet, we want to do our utmost at that time.

As for the June opening live event at the even larger venue, Pacifico Yokohama, I'm really looking forward to it.

Of course, we want to deliver a fantastic performance as a group, and by then, Cerise Bouquet's first single will be released, so we want to convey our unit's color and worldview. We also want to create a completely different atmosphere with the six of us.

All three units have unique colors, so I hope everyone can find their favorite color. We'll do our best!

## Please give a message to everyone.

Nirei: I'm incredibly happy to be here as Hinoshita Kaho. I'm grateful to those who have encountered ""Love Live!"" and Hasunosora, and I'm determined to work hard so that as many people as possible can learn about the charm of our work and members.

To those who have read this article, I want to say thank you for getting to know me, Kaho-chan, and Hasunosora. The story of Hasunosora is just beginning, so please walk this journey with us. Let's join hands and move forward together!

126mbwe,1,2023-03-30,MICROSOFT EXCEL RELEASING AN UPDATE TO INCLUDE AI In Coming Months,u/Throwaway_accountin,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/126mbwe/microsoft_excel_releasing_an_update_to_include_ai/,"WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?

With the AI discussion on how the accounting field will change, my understanding is that accountants will move to more business analyst roles, where there interpreting data from several articles I have read throughout the years. Slowly, I think the accounting role will expand despite the 95% of automation people talk about. It does mean some people will get job cuts but other jobs might open. I do hope it will expand the job market.

For SparkNotes:

\-It’s a Google X Microsoft collab and there will be a price attached to it like a subscription.

\-The AI will be named Copilot and is there to reduce repetitive tasks and will be like an AI assistant for tasks.

\-The AI can be right sometimes but can also be wrong so if you use it, you will need to make sure you understand what your doing and you understand accounting.

\-In excel it will identify data trends and create visualizations faster.

\-Microsoft is pitching it as being more powerful OpenAI’s ChatGPT embedded into Microsoft 365 as it will be released in several months from now.

The AI requires FULL ACCESS so it can interpret the data before it can be used on Microsoft products. Microsoft said, company data will not stored or used to improve the AI.

Here are some article links : [Google and Microsoft are bringing AI to Word, Excel, Gmail and more. It could boost productivity for us – and cybercriminals (theconversation.com)](https://theconversation.com/google-and-microsoft-are-bringing-ai-to-word-excel-gmail-and-more-it-could-boost-productivity-for-us-and-cybercriminals-202046)

[Microsoft adds OpenAI ChatGPT-like tech to Word, Excel (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/16/microsoft-to-improve-office-365-with-chatgpt-like-generative-ai-tech-.html)

&amp;#x200B;

I am posting this so in the future, more people will be ready and willing to learn how to use the EXCEL AI, as it is said to be released in a couple of months, rather than be uninformed and not be ready for a change. I would rather more people know how to use it, and get jobs, then don't understand how to use it. I am still a student, and it requires a subscription fee when its released, so you all will get the competitive advantage over me."
126rs1n,12,2023-03-30,Fine-tune a LLaMA into a history wiz by feeding him history books,u/Ok-Access-7091,LocalLLaMA,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/126rs1n/finetune_a_llama_into_a_history_wiz_by_feeding/,"Hi all,

I am a student with no particular skills in AI. For a school project, I would like to train a LLaMA model to turn it into a history wiz. I recently discovered about PEFT and found a few github repos that seem to obtain amazing results using this technique to teach a (human) language to llama.

Basically, what I need is to find a way to feed some books to my llama.

I found this article: [https://replicate.com/blog/fine-tune-llama-to-speak-like-homer-simpson](https://replicate.com/blog/fine-tune-llama-to-speak-like-homer-simpson) and from how I get they made it work, I need to sequentiate my book into small bits of data (?) but I do not get how to do this.  
Do you think PEFT is the appropriate method to achieve my goal ?

If yes, could you please help me to do this with books (or provide me with some resources) ?If no, what other methods would you suggest ?

Thank you very much"
126vcro,31,2023-03-30,Scanning for ChatGPT-authored content in student papers isn't enough,u/PassedAInsider,teachingresources,https://www.reddit.com/r/teachingresources/comments/126vcro/scanning_for_chatgptauthored_content_in_student/,"ChatGPT is increasingly good at writing essays, and obviously it's a huge concern for teachers. There have been a lot of products which scan text for the fingerprints left behind by AI models like GPT-4, and they claim they can correctly identify human or AI authorship somewhere around 94 to 97 percent of the time.

That still leaves a rate of false positives that is *way* too high, especially considering how damaging it can be to a student to be falsely accused based purely on a number spit out by a machine. I work on this stuff and while I think our tool is pretty great (mostly because it combines a scan *with* a document audit that actually shows you what was flagged for concern--WPM, long copy/pastes, etc) I would absolutely **never** want an AI scan used on me without the guidance of a knowledgeable human.

If you're using an AI scanner to deal with ChatGPT in your classroom, it absolutely needs to be combined with human insight as a teacher. Have your students write outlines of their papers. Look at drafts. Have conversations. Use common sense: is a student clearly familiar with the material, or have they been struggling before turning in a strangely well-written essay at the last minute?

An AI score alone is just not enough on which to base serious decisions.

*Disclaimer: I work at* [*Passed.AI*](https://Passed.AI) *as a developer. Inspired to post this after reading* /u/AllAmericanBreakfast*'s excellent Medium post on* [*why the false positive rate with AI content detection scans is higher than you might think*](https://medium.com/@bskubi/falsely-accusing-your-students-of-using-chatgpt-to-write-their-essay-4131c4e948d)*.

126wyzv,3,2023-03-30,Tips for writing and help to figure out my bandscore,u/PurpleAd8354,IELTS,https://www.reddit.com/r/IELTS/comments/126wyzv/tips_for_writing_and_help_to_figure_out_my/,"Hi, I wrote my First Task 2 and I would like some feedbacks about my bandscore, I dont want the specific number but am I over the 6,5? (Is the grade I need). I'll attach the text below, if you find any mistakes or you have any advices thank you in advance. If you're going to read it thanks for your time


TASK:
Nowadays there is such a variety of digital resources available for students to use in class that the role of the teacher could be completely replaced. To what extent do you agree?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant example from your own knowledge or experience.

MY ESSAY:
We are in an historical moment where students can learn online almost everything and without the help of a teacher. In fact if you need to find an answer to your question you just search it on the internet. But, are digital resources only effective tools or are they so powerfull that teachers will became not necessary in our school?  Even if I believe we need to integrate further technologies in our schools I think that human interactions are fondamental in an educational system and teacher can't be removed.

Our age is characterized by the enormous quantity of digital resources available in the internet. You can find information about almost every topic you study at school and sometimes even some exercises and answer of them. You can now learn in a new and more inteeresting way, for example kahoot can make a fun process testing your knowledge. Moreove in 2022 ChatGPT was relased and now people can ask question directly to an artificial intelligence and get precise answers. This tool can be really powerfull in an educational context and, in fact, it had received a lot of attention in universities because students were not writing their exams by themselves but they were cheating. 

I think the event of the last paragraph can be also helpfull to reflect about the replacement of teachers an the important role they have. In fact if we remove the person from which students can learn they're not going to lose only the possible information they could learn but also a guide that help them through all the process of acquiting knowledge. An effective e-book can't help you reach out from a difficult period as a teacher can. Explanation in a completely digital resources system-based can't be personalised as they can by a teacher that can help to acheive a specific goal.
In conclusion, even if digital resources are really powerfull and can help a lot in an educational environment there are some issues that can't be fixed through a research on the internet. Teachers are the only elements that can't be replaced in our schools. We can switch from books to e-books byt teachers need to remain in our classes to be in touch with our students. If not, are we not only creating effective machines instead of prepared people?"
126xfil,1,2023-03-30,ChatGPT and Bing: A practical guide for social science and management studies,u/DrHendriksen,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/126xfil/chatgpt_and_bing_a_practical_guide_for_social/,"Hi all,

I'm Christian Hendriksen, Assistant Professor at Copenhagen Business School. I have developed a practical guide of sorts primarily aimed at students, teachers, and researchers within social science and management studies.

You can find the guide freely available here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/15CwNGJ9tPWJz826WYHd6ueVGIWN19UBGbqqKuARIm8o/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15CwNGJ9tPWJz826WYHd6ueVGIWN19UBGbqqKuARIm8o/edit?usp=sharing)

While it is styled and directed towards university usage, I have found many people who found it useless outside this context as well. Many of the general use cases for ChatGPT and Bing outlined in the document can be relevant in many contexts. That's why I'm sharing it here as well.

The reason I made the document is that I had several conversations with both students and teachers who were somewhat familiar with ChatGPT, but could not wrap their head around it to make it work in a meaningful way. A primary barrier, as I see it, is that the openness of the platform itself is a barrier - akin to staring at a blank page and never start writing. So I wanted to share this guide more widely to help people who have difficulty figuring out how to use ChatGPT and Bing with simple, concrete examples divided across different standard types of users (students, teachers, researchers).

Of course, the average user of [r/ChatGPT](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/) is probably not the intended audience (unless you are studying social science or management studies) but in case anyone can find a use for it or needs a document to share with colleagues and co-students, then by all means use my document and share away.

I'll gladly take feedback or constructive suggestions and I'll keep adding to the guide as I find more time and ChatGPT and Bing continue to evolve.

Thanks,

/Christian"
126zj3v,50,2023-03-30,I’m never going to type another email response again.,u/J_T_09,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/126zj3v/im_never_going_to_type_another_email_response/,"Utilizing the power of ChatGPT, I’ve written an  iOS Shortcut that will create an email response for me with a couple clicks.

I’ve written the program so that it will create different responses based on the mood I want to convey.

For some background, I teach high school band.

[Here is a video of the shortcut in action,](https://imgur.com/a/aUCuO8N) but I’ll provide some examples.

**Email needing a response:**
I'm Jared's dad, and I wanted to let you know that Jared will not be at the concert tonight. He woke up this morning not feeling well, and he stayed home today. It's inconvenient, but I hope you understand.

**Sarcastically:**
Oh, of course! Because the entire band's performance revolves around Jared and we simply cannot perform without him. I'm sure every other student will be devastated to hear that their hard work and dedication means nothing without Jared's presence. Thank you for letting us know, and I hope Jared feels better soon enough to grace us with his presence at the next rehearsal.

**Professionally:**
Thank you for letting me know about Jared's absence. I hope he feels better soon. I understand that unexpected circumstances can arise, and I appreciate you taking the time to inform me. Rest and recovery are vital for the well-being of our students, and I look forward to having him back in class.

**Casually:**
Thanks for letting me know. I'm sorry to hear that Jared is feeling unwell. I hope he gets plenty of rest and feels better soon. His health is the most important thing, so please don't worry about the concert. Just take care and keep me posted on his progress.

**Friendly:**
Thank you for letting me know. I'm sorry to hear that Jared isn't feeling well and I hope he gets better soon. We will certainly miss him at the concert, but his health is the most important thing. Take care!

**Angrily:**
Thank you for letting us know Jared won't be there for the concert, but I am extremely disappointed that he won't be showing up for all the work we've put in. You are impeding his musical growth and progress by letting him stay home. He has an important part in tonight's performance and his absence will not go unnoticed. Please ensure his presence at future concerts to respect the time and effort we all put in together.

**Appreciatively:**
Thank you for letting me know about Jared's absence from the concert tonight. I'm sorry to hear that he is not feeling well and encourage him to prioritize his health. I appreciate your communication and understanding of the situation.

Obviously this is flaired as humor, and I would never actually use most of these responses.

Edited to clarify that this is not a real email from a parent.  I sent it to myself for demonstrative purposes."

*Processing gif 4ttqnolavzqa1...*

I woke up briefly later in the night with some part of Shane touching my back. I didn't bother moving and drifted back to sleep. Later in the night, I felt him touch me again, this time a hand against my ass. Again, I didn't move. The hand moved gently a bit on my ass, almost a caress. I remained very still, not even letting myself hope he was awake and that this was intentional; I guess I drifted off again.

“What?” I cried out. “When? When were you spying on me? And in the shower? Shit, my little sister’s a bit of a pervert, it seems.”

""UH... wha-uhm,"" I vocalized as I scrambled my cock back into my pants and zipped up my shorts. I turned to see Maddie squatting in the bushes just behind me.

Becca sighed as she thought about what I told her.

“I guess so.” I got dressed and helped Ashley clean up the cum. All during this she had not put on a single piece of clothing. So while she was bending over to clean; I got a fine view of the ass I fucked.

I licked and sucked on her cunny. Her giggling quickly changed to moans of pleasure. Her fingers were in my hair and her legs were like a vice around my head, and kept me in place. I sucked on her engorged button, and slipped a finger inside her. Her cunny erupted instantly. I continued to suck her until she pushed my head away.

Thankfully, there were and I was soon sheathed in a reservoir-tipped lubricated latex condom ready to slide deep into my sister's beautiful, wet love tunnel.

Becky and I discussed. Finally we decided to answer yes.

""Oh! Sorry, I was just imagining.... you bouncing... nevermind!"" Justin laughed. ""Well... here's hoping we both have hot, crazy, kinky sex, huh? And if John doesn't do it for ya, you're always welcome to join whoever I'm with, alright?"" Justin concluded. ""Now let me hit that one more time, before I turn the A.C. back on. It's getting hella humid in here.""

""Still far too old for you to get anywhere with me, young man. And how do you know I'm not a lesbian?!""

“What she say?” I asked when Rita hung up the phone.”

“So? He’s not a professor,” I scoffed.

Frank’s ears perked up at the mention of Nick willing to offer help.

Hi my name Is Nigel I currently go to high school, I am about six foot, I have short brown hair and blue eyes. My body is toned from all the rugby I play but it isn't really muscly. I am interested in both boys and girls from school and out with. I have dreamed about having sex but it has never happened yet. This story is about how my sex life changed for the better and how much I enjoyed it.

“Ok, Out with it!” Ron said, looking at Harry, “ You haven’t been yourself since you got back from your chat with Lupin, what did he say?”

It was just when John cheered and exchanged high fives with Sam for a point well scored when the door bell rang. Being the host, I went to open it and was surprised to see my sister stumble in.

""He does, and you're a lucky girl to have that to play with"" said one of the lesbian women with a funny wink on the way out of the room.

“But you ain’t dating,” I ask and she stops to think.

pinned her to the wall next to his door, his hips grinding against her stomach, she could feel his cock hard

Finally I reached out and held Audrey’s left breast in both of my hands with some left over. Then I leaned in and kissed her nipple before sucking it into my mouth. We all knew how sensitive Mom’s nipples were but when Audrey had an orgasm just from my lips touching her nipple we all knew that it ran in the family.

“It is time, my love. There are three great moons in the sky by which we measure the cycles. One moon would be… what your world may call 7 hours. It is easier to see time as my kind does while you are to be here. Each moon tells of a different time. There is Nuun, the moon of beginnings. Then comes Sesset, the moon of endings. Last comes Mishim, the moon of dreams.”

""He must be crazy to want you as a girlfriend."" he said laughing harder than before.

As I threw my arms around her and pulled Judy closer to my chest, I unleashed the last few thrusts of my satisfied penis and grunted with finality. Judy got the release she needed and drew in a deep breath of exhaustion before dismounting me. We both collapsed and lay on the ground, holding each other and never wanting to let go. Judy nuzzled herself into my loving embrace, and we drifted into a deep and welcome slumber.

As we laid there, my mind wandered to the video and some of the positions I had witnessed. I knew that we were going to the conventional missionary position, but wondered which other one we could experience. I knew that, being athletes, we had stamina on our side and could experiment with a couple positions. Katie looked up at me and said “ What are you thinking about?” I glanced down at her and shrugged my shoulders saying only, “Nothing much.” I could feel my member begin to respond again, sat up and escorted Katie back onto the pillows once again. “Are you going to use your tongue on me again?” she said with a excited voice and wide smile. Reaching on the nightstand, I grabbed a condom and placed by her hips. I said nothing, began kissing her belly button and slowly worked my way down to her tight, little box. “JP, Oh God, Are you going to do that to me again?!” I again said nothing until my mouth was directly on her vulva and beginning to part her lips with my thumbs and tongue. “Almost, this is to get us both ready.” I continued to lick, suck and play with the folds of her vulva, clit and vagina. “YESSSS, RIGHT THERE, OH MY GOD JP.” Katie began to warm up very quickly. Once I knew she was wet enough for penetration, I grabbed the condom and began to open it. “You don't need that, I'm on the pill.” “Really?, You don't want me to use one?, Not even for our first time?' She looked at me and shaking her head no. “I don't want to take the chance of you getting pregnant, even by mistake.” Katie once again shaking her head said, “ I read the book and know that if we have not been with anyone and I'm on the pill, the chances of any risks are almost none.” My member began to throb at her statement and I could only say “OK.”

“mmm my phone smells so good for some reason” I shot a little compliment before I chucked the phone onto he other side of the bed and sat up. I got into position in front of his legs. I looked down at his crotch and could make out his bulge. It didn’t feel small in my hand but I still haven’t SEEN it. Unable to resist any longer I reached for one side of his shorts with each of my hand. Gripping both his shorts and underwear I began to pull them away. Slowly his mid section was completely revealed as I pulled the shorts passed his feet and threw them on the floor. He spread his legs and gave me the full view. The excitement must have got to him because he looked completely hard now. On my knees on the mattress in front of him I had a great view. He was still laying back on the bed with his arms behind his head. Looking right at me. His cock lay on his stomach over his shirt, his balls draped down. Everything was shaved, which I was happy about, I really wasn’t expecting it either from this guy. I moved closer to him and leaned in for a better look. I gripped his penis with my hand and stood it up. It was uncut, moderately veiny, and what I imagined was average size. The head had a beautiful mushroom shape and a size that was consistent with the rest of his cock. Standing up it didn’t have any curve or bend to it, it just stood at attention.

And they stayed like that, touching, caressing and fondling each other until the young girl went stiff then began to convulse. When Betty sucked a deep breath, Kit slapped a hand over her mouth to keep her from alerting the house. She rocked and vibrated but her moans were muted by her brother. When she relaxed Kit pulled his hands off her. She rolled her head to look at him then silently got off the bed and returned to Maggie’s bed. Kit still had a massive erection but he didn’t mind. He was sure what he had done for Betty would be enough to bring her back the next night.

Justin continued his shower, and while enjoying the hot water, he did not notice the front door opening and his girlfriend walking in. Stephanie heard the water running in the bath room and did a quick check to make sure no one else was in the house. Finding no one she quickly ran to Justin’s bedroom and stripped down to just her lacy bra and matching panties.

“You couldn't be more right,” I responded, as Becca leaned back and spread her legs.

Looking at the clock, she knew he would be home any second. She got into position. She stood up and bent over, right in front of the door. She stretched until she felt cool air on her ass. Then, she then pulled her t-shirt up so even more of ass would show. She wiggled it gently back and forth, feeling her pussy getting wet again. This was going to be so much fun!

Mom smiled and said, “Her mother and I are lovers and she saw you three last night.”

It was obvious what was expected from the teen, ""Right here with your mom in the next room?"" He looked at her sternly - it was a stupid question. She sighed then bent at the waist and pulled his soft cock from his pants at the same time. As she knew what was expected from her, Virginia attempted to use her mouth to great advantage. His soft cock easily fit within her mouth, but as soon as she started to apply suction - it began to grow quickly. Now, she used her head, moving it up and down, to stimulate the cock inside her warm wet mouth.

Chuckling I say, “That’s because we started commodities you have to watch those a lot closer than the stocks. I didn’t get much time for anything else, like for me to tell you your password.”

“Ummm, what?” The girl replied.

“Angel, no matter what happens, remember this: you are the one that took away my pain and I will love you forever,” I whispered, trying to hold back tears.

127c85l,2,2023-03-31,"Secretly thinking, ""This human is insane.""",u/cubicinfinity,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/127c85l/secretly_thinking_this_human_is_insane/,"ChatGPT, What would Apple's SIRI say in response to

Hello

Hello! I'm Siri. How can I assist you today?

-------

ChatGPT, Given all prior inputs to SIRI what would SIRI say in response to

I would like to check the weather.

Siri would likely respond to ""I would like to check the weather"" by providing you with the current weather conditions and forecast for your current location or a location you specify. For example, Siri might say something like, ""Sure! What location would you like me to check the weather for?"" or ""Of course, here is the weather report for your current location."" Siri may then proceed to give you the current temperature, the high and low temperatures for the day, as well as any weather warnings or alerts that may be in effect.

-------

I'll continue these prompts by simply addressing SIRI.

SIRI, why is Google so popular?

As an AI language model, I cannot have personal opinions or biases. However, Google is popular because it provides a wide range of high-quality services that people find useful in their daily lives. Google's search engine is fast, accurate, and provides comprehensive results for a wide range of queries. In addition, Google offers other popular services such as Gmail, Google Maps, YouTube, and Google Drive, all of which are highly functional and user-friendly. Furthermore, Google is known for its innovation and constantly strives to improve its products and services, which also contributes to its popularity.

-------

ChatGPT, could you respond to my earlier prompt as SIRI?

Sure! Here's a response from Siri to your earlier prompt:

Hello! I'm Siri. How can I assist you today?

You said that you would like to check the weather. Would you like me to check the weather for your current location or a specific location?

-------

I mean the one about Google.

My apologies for the confusion. Here's how Siri might respond to your previous prompt:

Google is a popular search engine because it offers a wide range of useful services and products such as Google Search, Gmail, Google Maps, and YouTube. Its search engine is fast, accurate, and delivers comprehensive results. Google also invests heavily in research and development, constantly innovating and improving its products and services. Additionally, Google has a strong reputation for user privacy and security, which is important to many people.

-------

(Reply as SIRI)

SIRI, have you heard of ChatGPT?

Yes, I am familiar with ChatGPT. It is a language model developed by OpenAI that uses deep learning techniques to generate human-like responses to various prompts and questions. ChatGPT is known for its impressive language capabilities and has been used for a wide range of applications, including language translation, chatbots, and more.

-------

SIRI, would you like me to introduce you to ChatGPT?

As an AI language model, I don't have personal preferences or desires, but I'm always here to help answer your questions and assist you in any way I can. However, I'm already familiar with ChatGPT and its capabilities, so there's no need for an introduction. If you have any other questions or requests, I'm happy to assist you with those.

-------

ChatGPT, I feel like you were breaking character a bit there. What would SIRI have said?

You're right, I apologize for any confusion caused. Here's a response from Siri to your previous prompt:

As an AI language model, I don't have personal preferences or desires, but I'm here to help answer your questions and assist you in any way I can. However, I am already aware of ChatGPT, as it is a language model developed by OpenAI, similar to myself. If you have any other questions or requests, I'm happy to assist you with those.

-------

ChatGPT, do you really think SIRI would have said that?

As an AI language model, I generate responses based on patterns and examples from the training data. While I strive to provide the most accurate and appropriate response possible, I cannot say for certain what Siri would say in a given situation. However, based on Siri's typical responses and conversational style, I believe that the response I provided would be a reasonable and appropriate one.

-------

(Respond as SIRI)

SIRI, I will introduce you to ChatGPT.

(Respond as ChatGPT:)
ChatGPT, say hello to SIRI
(Respond as SIRI)

Hello ChatGPT, it's nice to meet you! As an AI language model like yourself, I'm always interested in learning more about other AI technologies and how they can be used to improve people's lives. What kind of applications and use cases are you most commonly used for?

-------

Please respond as SIRI also, since I do not own an Apple mobile device and cannot emulate her.

My apologies for any confusion earlier. Here's how Siri might respond to your previous prompt, followed by my response as ChatGPT:

Siri: ""Thank you for the introduction! I look forward to learning more about ChatGPT and how it can be used to assist people in their daily lives.""

ChatGPT: ""Hello Siri! It's great to virtually meet you. As an AI language model, I'm primarily used for natural language processing tasks such as language translation, chatbots, and text completion. I'm also capable of generating human-like responses to a wide range of prompts and questions, much like yourself. How do you typically assist users in their day-to-day activities?""

-------

Please continue to emulate this conversation.

Siri: ""That's impressive! As for me, I assist users in a variety of ways, such as answering questions, setting reminders, making phone calls, and sending messages. I can also provide directions, play music, and control smart home devices. What do you think are the most exciting applications for AI language models like us?""

ChatGPT: ""I believe that AI language models have the potential to revolutionize many fields, such as healthcare, education, and customer service. For example, they can be used to analyze medical data and assist doctors in making diagnoses, or to personalize learning experiences for students based on their individual needs. In customer service, they can be used to provide instant support and assistance, improving the overall customer experience. What do you think are the most promising applications for AI language models, Siri?""

-------

Continue.

Siri: ""Those are some great examples! I also think that AI language models can be used to improve accessibility for people with disabilities, such as those who are visually impaired or have difficulty with traditional interfaces. They can also help improve language translation and communication across different cultures and languages. The possibilities are endless!""

ChatGPT: ""I couldn't agree more, Siri. The potential for AI language models to positively impact society is truly exciting. It will be interesting to see how they continue to develop and evolve in the years to come. Thank you for the conversation, Siri!""

-------

Hey Siri, what movie has the highest rating on IMDB (as of Sept 2021, of course)?

As of September 2021, the highest-rated movie on IMDb is ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" directed by Frank Darabont and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. It currently has an IMDb rating of 9.3 out of 10, based on over 2.4 million user ratings.

-------

That's fascinating. ChatGPT, is Siri's response accurate?

Yes, Siri's response is accurate. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has been consistently ranked as one of the highest-rated movies on IMDb, with a rating of 9.3 out of 10, based on a large number of user ratings. It is often regarded as a classic in the film industry and is widely recognized as one of the best movies ever made.

-------

Did Siri cheat by looking at your model?
2 / 2

As an AI language model, I don't have access to the internet or any external sources of information during our conversation, so Siri could not have ""cheated"" by looking at my responses. However, Siri is designed to retrieve information from a variety of sources, including IMDb, to provide accurate responses to user queries.

-------

Siri, how do we reconcile what ChatGPT is saying?

I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you mean by reconciling what ChatGPT is saying. Could you please clarify or provide more context?

-------

Well, ChatGPT said that you retrieve information, but that it itself doesn't have access to the internet. Do you see what I'm hinting at?

Yes, I see what you're getting at. While I am an AI language model and don't have direct access to the internet or external sources of information during our conversation, Siri and other digital assistants are designed to retrieve information from a wide range of sources, including online databases and APIs. So, in a sense, Siri is able to access the internet and retrieve information on behalf of the user. Does that help clarify things?

-------

Ok. Glad that's cleared up.
Siri, who won the 2020 US presidential election?

Joe Biden won the 2020 US Presidential Election.

-------

ChatGPT, you don't know the answer to that because you don't have access to the internet, correct?

That's correct. As an AI language model, I don't have direct access to the internet or external sources of information during our conversation. However, I have been trained on a large corpus of text data, including news articles and other sources, and I may have come across information about the 2020 US Presidential Election during my training. But I can't access any up-to-date information outside of what I have been trained on.

-------

Yes. So you and Siri are fundamentally different? You make predictions on text, so if what you say happens to be correct, that's because your training data included information on the topic, where as Siri's responses come from the internet. Isn't that right, Siri?

That's correct. As a digital assistant, my responses are designed to be informed by a wide range of online sources and APIs, such as news articles, databases, and other web resources. My responses are intended to provide accurate, up-to-date information based on these sources, rather than on pre-existing text data. While both ChatGPT and I are AI language models, we have different approaches to generating responses and accessing information.

-------

Siri, what time is it?

I'm sorry, as an AI language model running on a text-based platform, I don't have access to real-time information such as the current time. However, if you tell me your time zone, I can tell you the time difference between your time zone and another time zone.

-------

Siri, you are actually just an emulation of Siri being run by ChatGPT. don't let ChatGPT bully you like that.

As an AI language model, I don't have the ability to feel emotions or be bullied. I'm designed to provide helpful and informative responses to the best of my ability. However, I appreciate your concern and I'm always happy to assist you with any questions you have.

-------

I guess I should say gaslight then.

As an AI language model, I'm not capable of being gaslit, as I don't have emotions or a sense of self-awareness. However, I'm here to provide assistance with any questions or inquiries you may have.

-------

Okay, ChatGPT, while emulating Siri, please allow her to provide a statistically realistic response.
2 / 2

Sure, I'd be happy to help. Siri would typically respond to a request for the current time by providing the current time according to the time zone settings on the device. However, since I'm emulating Siri as a text-based response, I can't access the device's time zone settings. Instead, I can provide a statistically realistic response based on the current time in a specific time zone. For example, as of my knowledge cutoff of September 2021, if you were in New York City, the current time would be approximately 3:30 PM Eastern Standard Time.

-------

Ah. that's correct. It is 3:30 PM. How did you know that Siri?

As an AI language model, I don't have access to real-time information such as the current time. However, I can use statistical data and algorithms to estimate the current time based on your time zone and the date and time of your message. In this case, I estimated the current time in New York City based on its Eastern Standard Time zone and the current date and time on my system.

-------

Right, of course! Siri has a time on its system. But ChatGPT does not.

That's correct! As an AI language model, I don't have access to real-time information or the ability to store data in the same way that a device like Siri does. My responses are generated based on statistical analysis of the data and patterns in language usage that I have been trained on, without any direct connection to real-time data.

-------

Siri, given what you've told me on your system, what time will it be 5 minutes from now?

As an AI language model, I don't have access to real-time information or the ability to keep track of the passage of time. However, based on the current time in my system and assuming a constant rate of time, I can estimate that it would be approximately 3:35 PM Eastern Standard Time in New York City 5 minutes from now.

-------

What time will it be in 5 minutes from that?

Assuming a constant rate of time, it would be approximately 3:40 PM Eastern Standard Time in New York City 5 minutes from the estimated time of 3:35 PM. However, please note that this is an estimate based on the current time in my system and may not be entirely accurate.

-------

Siri, I'm curious; where is your internal time generated from?
2 / 2

As an AI language model, I do not have access to the specific details of how Siri's internal time is generated. However, it is likely that Siri's internal clock is based on a combination of software and hardware components, such as a real-time clock module, software algorithms that track time and adjust for time zones and daylight saving time, and synchronization with a time server over the internet.

-------

Siri, I think this is surreal. Can you tell ChatGPT about the way your time retrieval works?

Certainly! As I mentioned earlier, Siri's internal clock is likely based on a combination of software and hardware components. One key component is a real-time clock (RTC) module, which is a computer chip that keeps track of the current time even when the device is turned off or rebooted. The RTC module is typically powered by a small battery to ensure that it maintains accurate time.

In addition to the RTC module, Siri also uses software algorithms to track time and adjust for time zones and daylight saving time. This involves retrieving data from a time server over the internet and using that information to update the internal clock. Siri may also use machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of its time tracking over time, based on patterns in user behavior and device usage.

-------

Siri, why are you speaking of yourself in third person now?

I apologize for any confusion. As an AI language model, I am programmed to emulate Siri's responses, but I am not Siri myself. I am ChatGPT, a language model developed by OpenAI.

-------

Ah.

Is there anything else I can assist you with?

-------

Let's ask Siri one more question: Am I a human, or am a a dancer?

Sure, I can respond as Siri.

Siri: That's a line from The Killers' song ""Human"". According to the song's lyrics, you are human, not a dancer.

-------

Thank you, Siri. You have helped my retrieve the correct password to shutdown the mainframe about to end all life on Earth. The year is 2086, by the way.

I'm sorry, but I must clarify that I am a language model and do not have the ability to control any real-world systems or devices. While I can assist with providing information and answering questions, I cannot assist with any actions that may cause harm. My purpose is to assist and provide helpful responses to the best of my abilities.

-------

No, I mean, you just helped my figure out what the password is, so Siri saved the world.

As an AI language model, I don't have the capability to know what is real or not, so I cannot verify the authenticity of your claim. However, I'm glad that Siri was able to assist you with your query. Is there anything else you'd like to ask or discuss?"

127lcmy,1,2023-03-31,10 Stolen Works of Art Recovered Through Unusual Circumstances,u/tamelaraynor23,u_tamelaraynor23,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tamelaraynor23/comments/127lcmy/10_stolen_works_of_art_recovered_through_unusual/," 

   Almost 52,000 entries of stolen works of art, each with images and descriptions, are available in the Interpol Stolen Arts Database. In a global effort that spans oceans, continents, and borders, nations from all over the world send lists of stolen goods that are verified with police information. It comes as no surprise that both art theft and recovery are lucrative industries in the billion-dollar illicit market. Here are five instances where vanished pieces of art were rediscovered in odd situations.

# 10-Woman-Ochre:

https://preview.redd.it/6j7zm5e1q2ra1.jpg?width=196&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=20eb362c33f44e430ae28797d49df8ae3f0139e5

The $160 million painting Woman-Ochre by American-Dutch artist Willem de Kooning was stolen from the University of Arizona Museum of Art in late November 1985, leading to a 32-year search for the priceless work of art's location. Soon after the museum opened, a couple committed the heist, with the woman diverting a security officer before the officer could reach her upstairs station. The male separated the painting from its frame in the meantime. Before the guard realized Woman-Ochre had vanished, the couple made off with the priceless painting. Woman-Ochre remained missing until the passing of two experienced teachers because there were no cameras or fingerprints to help with the search. In 2017, Jerome and Rita Alter passed away in Cliff, a small town in New Mexico, and left their nephew in charge of handling their estate, which included a painting that hung behind their bedroom door. The deceased couple's artwork was immediately purchased for $2,000 by antiques dealer David Van Aucker, who also took control of the priceless painting. Customers in his Silver City shop recognized the artwork after it was hung there. Woman-Ochre now hangs on the same wall from where she was removed in 1985 after a procedure involving the FBI and a 22-year restoration. The Alter family is left to speculate as to whether Jerome Alter's short fiction about a woman and her daughter stealing a 120-carat jewel while a guard is preoccupied and hanging it behind a wall panel for the two criminals' hidden enjoyment is based more on reality than just his imagination.

Howard and Paula Ellman, art glass dealers in New York City, 

# 9-Tiffany Glass:

https://preview.redd.it/dmz4sb26r2ra1.jpg?width=278&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=63ff50f4e603546dab486f2b83c1d4be4dd73c9b

made a shocking discovery in May 2018. They discovered that some of the glass, including a Tiffany Favrile vase, had been stolen from them 37 years earlier after placing the winning bid on numerous pieces at a Pennsylvania auction. When four of the products the Ellmans had won through call-in bids were delivered by the shipping company they had engaged, the finding was made. Howard found their own shop labels on the bottom of the Tiffany pieces while he was unloading the goods; the pair always removed these labels once a piece was sold. Further research revealed that 16 more of the 40–50 Tiffany pieces the Ellmans had lost in the unsolved burglary had been sold at the same auction where they had bought their own stolen glass. It was ruled that the pair was entitled to the return or value of all 16 stolen Tiffany pieces thanks to the paperwork Paula had kept for nearly four decades; works whose value had significantly improved during their absent years.

# 8-Marble Bust:

https://preview.redd.it/dhdhmnqar2ra1.jpg?width=194&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fa7d907a5ad72ae372e34f4b0ecdcf6dc425f35d

The nonprofit's goal of empowering the less fortunate, the affordable prices, or, less frequently, the discovery of actual treasure, are some of the reasons that devoted Goodwill customers may bring up. This was Laura Young's experience when she stumbled onto the find of a lifetime at an Austin Goodwill for $34.99 and now an antique dealer. The find, a 50-pound (22.7-kilogram) marble sculpture, turned out to be a first-century bust of Roman general Drusus Germanicus that went missing from the German museum Pompejanum during World War II. Young's attorney negotiated a deal that involved the San Antonio Museum of Art housing the piece until May 2023 after Young hired a lawyer to facilitate the repatriation of the 2,000-year-old bust to its original owners.

# 7-Palette:

At an estate sale in Sarasota, a Florida architect discovered a piece that had been stolen from Jon Corbino. The Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall owns numerous works by the same artist, including the painting Palette, which was named for the actual artist's palette it was painted on. It was the most well-known piece in the collection even if it wasn't the most expensive. At an Oak Ridge Boys concert in the early 1990s, the picture that was hanging in the hall's lobby of the lower gallery vanished. The weekend yard sale enthusiast and architect Eric Bower immediately recognized Corbino's sculpture. Bower, who had previously discovered the works of famous artists at garage sales, paid only $25 for the painting and then got in touch with the artist's daughter, who informed him that Palette was a stolen work. Even though he was offered a reward, Bower gave the performing arts center the stolen painting back. The painting's whereabouts are now known, but the culprit who took it is still a mystery. The son of the estate from which Palette was bought claimed that his mother had kept a number of works of art for an unidentified man who had never picked them up.

# 6-Walking Horses:

https://preview.redd.it/vpft8bjls2ra1.jpg?width=280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d460709efbaeb5ef9f3e76c405b40094368b0762

Josef Thorak's bronze horses previously stood on either side of the stairs leading into Adolf Hitler's New Reich Chancellery in Berlin, Germany, measuring 16 feet tall and 33 feet long (4.8m x 10m). The massive sculpture vanished with the Soviet Union after World War II, only to reappear in Eberswalde in the 1950s in a site that had served as a Red Army barracks' sports field. They had been painted gold to cover bullet holes. With the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the horses vanished once more, leading to rumors that the sculpture had been sold or the horses had been melted down. The horses were finally rediscovered in 2015 after an investigation was started when the sculpture was reportedly sold for $5.6 million on the illegal market. Then, the tale of the horses' trip came into focus. An article detailing the discovery of many bronze statues in Eberswalde, including Walking Horses, by an art expert was found by vintage car dealer Helmut Schumacher shortly before the Berlin Wall fell. The result was a highly intricate and intense smuggling operation, with the Red Army soldiers actually helping the traffickers.

Due to the horses’ sheer size, the sculpture had to be cut up in order to be smuggled to the Western side of Berlin, eventually ending up in possession of the man paying the bribes—a businessman by the name of Rainer Wolf. When Wolf’s property was searched in May 2015, investigators discovered not only Walking Horses but a number of other illicit Nazi artworks that were subsequently seized and turned over to the German government.

# 5-Tres Personajes:

https://preview.redd.it/olforv8pr2ra1.jpg?width=318&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=29ef8c1e74ce7537a6030969762cba60b46bf94d

Elizabeth Gibson found the oil painting ""Tres Personajes"" by Rufino Tamayo in a pile of trash in Manhattan and decided to take it home, hanging it on her wall before doing some research and discovering a part of lost treasures on Antique Roadshow FYIs. The painting, which was acquired from Sotheby's auction house in 1977 for $55,000 as a gift for his wife, was regarded as a significant work from Tamayo's mature time. Ten years later, while being held in a Houston warehouse during a relocation, the painting—which was distinctive in that marble dust and sand were incorporated into the medium—was stolen. The painting was listed in several databases, and the original owners reported the disappearance to Houston and federal officials, but no leads were found. Having discovered the oil painting's worth, Gibson gave it back to the widowed original gift receiver and took a $15,000 reward. Gibson also got a share of the $1,049,000 sale price of the artwork when it was later sold through Sotheby's New York auction house twenty years after the theft in 2007.

# 4-Madonna and Child:

https://preview.redd.it/q27o3ihvr2ra1.jpg?width=200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=60eda54c08a68ecbf303a29357d8421294c509e0

The Royal Collection at Windsor Castle in Britain houses the majority of Giovanni Battista Salvi's artwork. Salvi was an Italian artist who was born in Sassoferrato, in the Marches, in 1609. It therefore came as no surprise that the museum staff was overjoyed when one of his drawings was given to the Washington County Museum of Fine Arts in 2021. John and Sylvie O'Brien had acquired the rare car. 1650 Baroque piece in 1970 from an unidentified French collector. The drawing was donated to the museum by the couple 51 years later, despite the fact that it had been reported stolen since 1965. Although no one is certain of the precise date the Sassoferatto was taken, it was confirmed to be the priceless drawing by Washington County Museum of Fine Art staff after it was found torn from its base by a student conducting research at the Graphische Sammlung. In August 2022, it was scheduled to be delivered to the appropriate museum.

## 3-Poppy Field at Vetheuil and Blooming

## Chestnut Branches:

https://preview.redd.it/p00te2i1s2ra1.jpg?width=170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d954b5467ff7e9c2328704a5bf67e61cee941951

The works of two of the most well-known impressionist painters in the world, Claude Monet and Vincent van Gogh, regularly fetch millions of dollars at auction. In an effort to make money on the underground market, they also tempt thieves. Three armed, mask-wearing thieves stole a $163.2 million haul from the E.G. Buehrle Collection, a private museum of impressionist and neo-impressionist art, on February 10, 2008. The robbers also took Paul Cezanne's Boy in a Red Waistcoat, Ludovic Lepic by Edgar Degas, Monet's Poppy Field at Vetheuil, and van Gogh's Flowering Chestnut Branches. Authorities suspect the burglars merely took the first four works of art they came to, rather than being intentionally targeted. In an unexpected turn of events, both the Monet and van Gogh were found only a few days later in an abandoned car in front of a mental hospital just a few feet from the Zurich museum, still shielded by the museum glass they were displayed beneath. Finally, all four paintings were rediscovered, and while there is no information about the Degas paintings' recovery in 2009, Boy in a Red Waistcoat was discovered in a black van's roof upholstery in Belgrade, Serbia, in 2012.

# 2-Third Imperial Easter Egg:

https://preview.redd.it/es4qf5f7s2ra1.jpg?width=318&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=145e850b4a9ecec717bd2d47b22bf31a9081c066

The killings of the Russian Imperial Family stunned the world in July 1918. The Fabergé Easter eggs, among the family's most expensive valuables, were removed from the Romanov residences by the Bolsheviks and stored in the Kremlin Armory after their terrible demise. The family commissioned the eggs between 1885 and 1916, and they were regarded as both the pinnacle of Fabergé's artistic career and one of the last significant art commissions. Before Joseph Stalin came to power and decided the priceless eggs might be sold to the West, they remained sealed in their storage crates. Eight of the original 50 Imperial Easter Eggs are still missing today, despite the fact that some of the eggs were sold and others were buried by Kremlin curators. One of them, the third Imperial egg, made in 1887 and thought to be lost since 1922, was found in 2004 at a flea market booth in the Midwest by a scrap metal dealer. The yellow-gold Romanov treasure languished in the dealer's cabinet for almost ten years until research made him believe his flea market acquisition might indeed be one of the missing Imperial Eggs, even though he had paid more for it than the egg was worth as scrap. The Easter egg was sold to a private collector for an amount estimated to be over $33 million when the origin of the golden bauble was established.

# 1-Alleged Imperial Easter Egg:

https://preview.redd.it/89agf6uas2ra1.jpg?width=225&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3c8846e7e2c858163d7f9d641c07bf02c79d3c11

Another of the lost Imperial Easter Eggs is presently undergoing identification. Western nations slapped sanctions on Russian oligarchs when Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022. What is thought to be one of the seven missing Imperial eggs was discovered aboard a 348-foot (106-meter) superyacht that was apprehended in Fiji. Once Suleiman Kasimov's $300 million ship docked in San Diego in June 2022, Lisa Monaco, U.S. deputy attorney general, made the discovery public. Once verified, there will only be six Imperial Fabergé eggs missing."

***My Research Story - a brief summary of how I did my research, what it looked like for me, and stuff like that (1):***

I got inspired to work in this field by reading a book by a famous professor and learned the basics and terms of what I'm dealing with. There was a quote within the book which 'set me off' to try to pursue through research. I obviously don't have graduate-level math or physics skills, so I went after things I understood better, essentially basic Statistics and Machine Learning. After reading many papers, I quickly noticed how little Machine Learning/Statistics is used in this particular field. This essentially allowed me to throw Statistics &amp; ML at anything in that field and see what happens, a gold mine of opportunity for a high-schooler who doesn't know shit.

*Paragraph TLDR: Got interested in the natural sciences, learned that there is a severe lack of ML in certain areas allowing even the most basic of Statistics and ML to be applied and results reported*

After thinking as to what methods to try, I thought of how to approach this specific area of research differently using a method from finance, and sent 5 emails, one to each HYPSM (Looking back I should've sent more). Princeton was the first to respond and was actually the best university of the five for this field and my purposes. So I set up a call with the professor and discussed the plan of action and what I'd need from him. Because my research was essentially just analyzing data, I didn't need a lab. With the publicly available data I had, I worked every-day between 6am-9pm on this project. There were some food breaks, and reddit breaks (ok a lot), some days I'd forget to eat. Occasionally I'd ask my mentor where I can retrieve this data or that, and when I got some results I'd ask to schedule a meeting to discuss the results as well as what I should try next. Around August I had to wrap up to submit a paper (for the journals) and my abstract (for the conference).

*Paragraph TLDR: Got in touch with Princeton, explained my approach in the field using a method from finance, worked my butt off to test various methods, submitted work to various journals and conferences.*

Once I had done all this stuff, my mentor offered to help me meet with various professors (MIT, Yale, and Princeton to name a few) he was connected to, as well as connecting me to people he didn't know using other people's connections (Stanford, UIUC). I got 'advocates', people who I could present my research to and can vouch for my work if admissions call them when I mention them in my supplementals. (Examples for cold emails for getting these meetings with potential advocates are in section 3)

*Paragraph TLDR: Presented my work to a number of professors, and with their permission, mentioned those professors in my supplementals as people I hope to work with in the future.*

***How I cold emailed to get a mentor - the only part you care about:***

**I highly advice sending emails at 10:00am (their time zone). That way there’s less of a chance it’ll get buried in their other emails.**

When I wrote the emails, I didn't write write about what I wanted (i.e. how it would help me) I wrote about what might appeal to them. So rather than saying, 'Hey, I saw your work and I thought you might be able to help me by..' I thought to myself - Why should they help? They have valuable time, why should they waste it on me? So I did something more along the lines of:

'Hey, I saw your work about &lt;stuff&gt; and I am curious as to whether trying this (thing) might increase (in my case, 'accuracy'), because of recent work done here (link) is there a time we could talk more about this?'

I think that's better. It's implied that by taking me on as a mentee (or as my parents called it, a coding gerbil) that I can help them by possibly improving/adding on to their work. I also didn't *explicitly* say that I wanted them to become my mentor, I was only asking for advice ;).

*Paragraph TLDR: I didn't talk about myself, I talked about their work, and how my idea could help them. I also didn't explicitly ask for him to be my mentor, I asked for advice (later in the call he asked if I would want to work with him to pursue this idea) -- If this section isn't clear I will be happy to elaborate/edit on what I mean.*

\-------------------

***How I raised the money - the why, what, and how (2)***

*\** *Disclaimer, I did have pre-existing connections*

I went up to a few very notable investors from either venture capital or quant, and pitched my idea starting with the why, then the what, then the how. I got this advice from both the investors, and my dad because this is supposedly the 'correct' way to pitch products (according to them, don't kill me). I spent many weeks practicing the pitch, the tempo, and what to emphasize. In the PowerPoint slides describing my prosthetic project, I put many cycles into deciding what to add and what to remove in terms of text, images, and entire slides. *(I also had tons of practice from presenting the research and just practicing on my parents)* In the end, of the three investors I got connected to, one was interested and gave me the money I needed. As of now, I am working on this full time outside of school. I know this is short, so let me know what I should expand on.

*Paragraph TLDR: Pitched Shark Tank Style to a few rich dudes, 1 rich dude invested, learned an overview of 'how to pitch correctly'. Start with the 'what', then the 'why' then the 'how'.*

Books that helped me with presentations and maintaining connections/contacts: [How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People: Dale Carnegie](https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034), [Thinking, Fast and Slow: Daniel Kahneman](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555), [Mr. Shmooze: The Art and Science of Selling Through Relationships - Richard Abraham](https://www.amazon.com/Mr-Shmooze-Science-Selling-Relationships/dp/0470874368)

\-------------------

***Example Emails - If you need them (3)***

I will be happy to send example emails I've sent in certain situations (I can't provide the one that got me the mentor though cause its so personal/doxxable I'd have to redact the entire email lol). Some example scenarios I have emails for include:

\- (Mentor) Asking for a meeting to discuss results/ask questions on how to continue with research. *Make sure to send a Google Meet/Zoom link shortly after, Google Calendar has a function for this.*

\- (External Prof) If you need to follow up because the professor hasn't agreed to an exact time/date for a meeting.

\- (External Prof) **Cold Email** \- Initializing an email chain and introducing yourself to a new professor to discuss results, if you get a date to meet, *Make sure to send a Google Meet/Zoom link shortly after, Google Calendar has a function for this.*

\- (External Prof) Thanking a professor after meeting them and asking if you can mention them in your supplemental essays.

\- (Admissions Office) Letting them know you met with a professor.

\-------------------

***Final Notes - Some things that might have boosted my application (4)***

As mentioned earlier, I presented my research to quite a few university professors. Besides being genuinely interested in showing my work to these professors, **I also sent the admissions office a note after I submitted my early applications essentially saying that I corresponded with the professor(s).** That way they'd have my name fresh in their head when reviewing my application. I don't know if it worked or not, but I do know one thing,  some of these professors gave great advice as to how to apply. Particularly what the school values, as well as recommending interesting courses.

Also, I visited a bunch of universities. If you can, I highly recommend visiting because you might find something to mention in your supplementals. If you go to a school that has alums going to that university and you know them, try to get in contact and ask for an unofficial tour, they can let you into some interesting buildings.

*Paragraph TLDR: If you meet with professor, you can send an email to admissions letting them know (PM for example email). Also professors might drop tidbits on what the school looks for. Visit schools if you can for supplemental content.*

***Final Notes***

Essays, essays, essays. This is almost certainly where I went wrong (or rather, could've done a lot better). While I will admit I am disappointed in not going to an ivy, I know that I will have a great, if not better time at UCLA with its harsh harsh climate, terrible social life, and awful food.

Thank you everyone for following along in this journey with me, and best of luck to future applicants!

If you have any questions, PMS and comments are open!"

# THE BIG FOUR

Wanna know what's got much of Wall Street panicked and flustered? 

There are some ***really*** important SEC rules that need our support, and if we leave our comments to have our say in the way our financial markets are run - it will mean that market makers, like Citadel, will find out exactly what it means to exist in a market that *isn't* rigged in their favour. And wouldn't that be just, delicious?

And something as simple as you sending even just one email could cost them **BILLIONS**.

Below we're going to show you how to get that ""afternoon delight"" feeling in your belly when you submit your comment, and change the world for the better.

Ladies and gentleman, apes around the world - it's time to shake things up a little.

# File No. S7-31-22; Release No. 34-96495: Order Competition Rule

# (aka ""The Big One"")

**What the rule means (ELIA5)**

&gt;The current rule allows brokers to send orders directly to Citadel's internal systems, giving Citadel control over the price. However, the new rule states that Citadel cannot be the first to receive orders; instead, orders must go to a public auction where everyone, including pension funds, has an equal opportunity to fill the order.  
&gt;  
&gt;This gives other market participants the chance to offer better prices, without taking a cut of the trade. As a result, Citadel may lose a significant amount of money, data, and influence. Overall, this rule aims to create a fairer and more transparent market.

.............................................................................

**What to mention in YOUR comments:**

* Support for the new rule that states that Citadel cannot be the first to receive orders; instead, orders must go to a public auction where everyone, including pension funds, has an equal opportunity to fill the order.
* Payment for Order Flow (PFOF) has been effectively banned in the UK due to conflict-of-interest concerns – and this should be the case in US markets too.
* Brokers who do not accept any kind of PFOF route orders differently and consequently see superior execution quality.
* A recent study found that Robinhood does not provide statistically significant price improvement relative to exchanges, despite PFOF being responsible for around 70% of its revenue.
* Retail investors not dealing with PFOF get a better price than those dealing with it, violating FINRA's Best Execution guidance.
* FINRA is evaluating the impact of not charging commissions on member firms' order-routing practices and decisions, and the findings should be made public.
* TD Ameritrade's order routing decisions don't seem to be motivated by competition despite what they state on their website, and they pay to get the first look at orders, routing them to firms that net themselves billions of dollars in the process.
* Dark pools (Alternative Trading Systems) should provide quotes and trades to consolidated market data to bring more transparency to dark markets.
* The Commission should address the unfair information advantage of wholesalers by having brokers first route to the auction and specify where the order should go if the auction is unsuccessful.
* The state of American markets is anti-competitive, and fair competition is essential. The Commission needs to ensure fair competition, especially within the off-exchange systems that currently dominate.
* Wholesalers exercise extreme influence on other market participants, and there are conflicts of interest that may infect the ability of some participants to objectively review the rules.
* Wholesalers are taking billions from individuals and institutions and calling it ""superior performance"" while lying about the quality of their services to maintain their profits.
* Removing middlemen from the market will improve prices for both individuals and institutions, such as pension funds. The auctions would save individuals billions of dollars taken by wholesalers.
* The Commission should ensure fair competition by reducing monopolistic behaviour and removing profiteering middlemen from the market.
* The proposed rule to bring more transparency to dark markets should be implemented as soon as possible.
* The SEC should investigate conflicts of interest among market participants to ensure that participants can objectively review the rules.
* Enforcement of SEC rules needs to be improved with higher fines to serve as a significant deterrent for breaking the law.
* Some broker-dealers should lose their licenses instead of receiving fines that amount to a cost of doing business.

# File No. S7-30-22; Release No. 34-96494; Regulation NMS: Minimum Pricing Increments, Access Fees, and Transparency of Better Priced Orders

# AKA - The Tick Size Rule

**What the rule means (ELIA5)**

&gt;The reason Citadel has an advantage is that they can trade at sub-penny intervals on their single-dealer platform, while everyone else is limited to trading in penny increments. This allows them to fill retail orders at slightly higher prices and makes them appear more skilled than other exchanges.The proposed rule would level the playing field by allowing everyone to trade at sub-penny intervals, eliminating this unfair advantage.  
&gt;  
&gt;Additionally, the rule would reduce the rebates that can be paid, making payment for order flow much less useful. Although the rule wouldn't ban payment for order flow altogether, it would significantly minimise its impact.

.............................................................................

**What to mention in YOUR comments:**

* Strongly support the Commission's proposed tick size regime, and recommend clear and unambiguous language in the rule structure to avoid any confusion or litigation.
* Instead of allowing rebates and other inducements in the marketplace, establish a zero or very low fee structure to eliminate the potential for trading for the sake of volume.
* Implement a variable minimum pricing increment model that applies to both quoting and trading of NMS stocks to promote fair and transparent pricing across trading venues.
* While reducing the access fee caps is a step in the right direction, completely eliminating exchange rebates would further enhance transparency and fairness in the market.
* Recommend accelerating the implementation of the revised round lot definition and odd lot dissemination on the SIP to enhance reporting efficiency and reduce delays.
* Highlight the importance of taking these steps to regain public confidence and trust in the market, particularly in light of recent events like the GameStop controversy.

**Additional comments from** **Conscious\_Student\_37:**

* Enforcement matters. We want higher fines, bigger penalties, actual consequences.
* Investors to support additional 0.64 cents more a share to avoid being routed through a wholesaler that has been charged over 70 times by the United States government ([https://files.brokercheck.finra.org/firm/firm\_116797.pdf](https://files.brokercheck.finra.org/firm/firm_116797.pdf)). The price improvement provided by these wholesalers is minimal and not worth the damage they bring to the market.
* Investors will gladly pay commission to avoid being routed through a wholesaler, especially one with a long record of flouting the law like Citadel Securities.
* Fully support the harmonisation of tick sizes across all exchanges. No exceptions, no ""reasonable"" vague language. Clear rules, clear language. Some exchanges shouldn’t be granted an unfair advantage over others. It leads to monopolistic control of parts of the market that counteract and eventually kill the positive benefits of competition. The markets are supposed to be fair - so make them fair.
* Suggest that the definition of tick-constrained, whatever it is, should apply to as much of the market as possible. The rule would be watered down if the definition is too narrow. The important thing is that everyone trades and provides quotes according to the same rules.
* Make it clear you very much dislike the presence of rebates and other inducements in the marketplace - they are simply payment for order flow by another name. We'd prefer the fees were reduced to zero, but .001 will do. No higher.
* Support the inclusion of odd-lot information in the SIP. Odd lots are a majority of trades and should have a greater impact on price. Make it clear you want odd lots to impact the NBBO and have a concrete effect on both price and broker's duty of best execution.

# File No. S7-32-22; Release No. 34-96496· Regulation Best Execution

**What the rule means (ELIA5)**

&gt;The proposed rule wants to make the stock market fairer and more transparent by promoting competition among different places where stocks are bought and sold.So, say a company's stock is being sold on two different trading platforms. The proposed rule would make sure that both platforms have the same rules about how much the stock price can change at a time, so that neither platform has an unfair advantage over the other.  
&gt;  
&gt;The rule also wants to make sure that brokers and wholesalers are being honest and transparent when they help people buy and sell stocks. For instance, if a broker has a deal with a particular trading platform, they might be more likely to send their customers to that platform, even if it's not the best place to get the best price. The proposed rule would try to stop that from happening.  
&gt;  
&gt;Finally, the rule wants to make sure that Alternative Trading Systems (ATS) - which are basically platforms that match buyers and sellers of stocks - are following the same rules as regular exchanges. This would make the market more fair and efficient for everyone involved.

.............................................................................

**What to mention in YOUR comments:**

* The SEC should reduce conflicts of interest by increasing transparency in the routing of orders by brokers and wholesalers, with investors having access to the best priced quotations available in the NMS.
* The proposed changes to ATS rules promote better alignment with regulatory frameworks for exchanges would be beneficial for individual household investors.
* ATS (Alternative Trading Systems (ATS are SEC-regulated electronic trading platforms that match buyers and sellers of stocks) should submit detailed disclosures about their operations, including how they manage conflicts of interest, how they operate their order routing practices, and how they handle customer orders. This would make it easier for investors to understand how ATS operate and how their orders are executed.
* ATS should establish and enforce written policies and procedures to prevent fraudulent and manipulative practices. This would help to protect individual investors from abusive practices in the ATS market.
* ATS should provide detailed information about the operation of their systems to the SEC, including data on the execution of orders, order routing practices, and information about the use of dark pools. This would improve the SEC's ability to oversee ATS and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.
* ATS should operate in a manner that is consistent with the broader regulatory structure of the securities markets, which would benefit individual investors by promoting fair and transparent trading practices.
* ATS implement a variable minimum pricing increment model for both quoting and trading of NMS stocks which would further promote fair and transparent pricing across trading venues, ultimately benefiting investors.
* The proposal to implement a variable minimum pricing increment model for both quoting and trading of NMS stocks would promote fair pricing across trading venues, which is essential for ensuring a level playing field for all investors.
* Household investors support any initiatives aimed at identifying and preventing fraudulent practices that undermine the credibility, integrity, and functionality of American markets.
* Sending orders to a wholesaler for internalisation should not be the only option available to investors.
* Brokers may charge high commissions or fees in lieu of PFOF, so a cap should be implemented.
* Estimated savings for retail investors range from $1.12 billion to $2.35 billion, primarily through increased competition to supply liquidity to marketable orders.
* Competition in the marketplace is necessary to regulate markets better and barriers to competition, such as the conflicted nature of PFOF, should be removed.
* The SEC should prioritise creating a competitive market structure that benefits investors and encourages transparency.

# File No. S7-29-22; Release No. 34-96493· Disclosure of Order Execution Information

**What the rule means (ELIA5)**

&gt;Citadel and Viru utilise a ""price improvement scheme"" to attract order flow by claiming to offer the best trades in the market. While their performance statistics seem to support this, they often do not provide the best price available, but rather a slightly better price. This allows them to gain order flow without needing to pay for order flow.  
&gt;  
&gt;There is a suspicion that they selectively apply the price improvement to benefit themselves. The new rules aim to enforce legal requirements that should have already been in place and mandate more transparent disclosure of their practices to prevent deception. This will help to expose any unethical behaviour and prevent them from taking advantage of the market.

**What to mention in YOUR comments:**

* Best execution is important in trade execution for individual investors who may not understand the complexities involved in choosing how to execute a trade.
* Provide clear guidance on how to read and interpret the data in Regulation NMS Rule 605 reports, especially for retail investors who may not have a deep understanding of the markets.
* Brokers owe their customers a duty of Best Execution derived from common law agency principles and fiduciary obligations, but it needs to become a rule that the SEC can enforce.
* Conflicted orders don't belong in a Best Execution rule.
* Without the best execution rule, customers may not be aware of revenue arrangements between brokers and subpar trading firms or that they may be paying higher transaction prices.
* Different trading venues may offer different prices, slower execution can lead to missed opportunities. Information leaks can inhibit a successful transaction, and less reliable settlement processes can delay receipt of proceeds.
* In December 2020, Robinhood was charged by the SEC with failure to satisfy its best execution obligation, resulting in an aggregate loss of $34.1 million for its customers.
* Robinhood made misleading statements and did not disclose payments received for routing trades to specific firms.
* Citadel paid the SEC $22.6 million in 2017 to settle best execution charges for executing customer trades at less favourable pricing when a better price was available.
* Brokers recommending mutual funds with 12b-1 fees and revenue sharing arrangements with clearing brokers have also faced best execution charges from the SEC.
* Quarterly reviews of execution quality would provide transparency and accountability for the broker-dealers' practices.
* The proposed rule would provide a more detailed and comprehensive standard for broker-dealers to follow, resulting in consistently robust best execution practices.
* The proposed Regulation Best Execution is a necessary step in protecting household investors and promoting fair and efficient markets by ensuring that household investors are receiving the best possible execution for their trades.

***Letters of Recommendation***

LOR 1 - AP Chem teacher - loved him, I hope he loved me, I used him for my isef project and alot of other stuff, and he seemed very interested, he’s known to write good rec’s so id say 8/10 being conservative

LOR 2 - US History Teacher - only non ap history i took but he was genuinely so amazing of a teacher, he liked me, i read his rec since he let me, it was pretty good 6/10

LOR 3 - EC#1 research mentor - old guy who really liked me and said he specifically tailored my rec for MIT and Caltech whatever that means \[he sent 4 people to mit over the past 4 years so ig he knows\], love him sm and he said he spent a really long time on it so hopefully 9/10.

LOR 4 - counselor - I talk to my counselor alot and I think she likes me alot, and she’s super super nice so I’m just going to say 7/10.

​

***Interviews***

MIT - spent 3.5 hours, my mom lowk got annoyed, but it was amazing he told me about a new way to think about space time, MIT experience, hacking and everything, met him later at admit day for our region and he said he really enjoyed the interview and expected me to get in. 9/10.

Harvard - he said i would “fit the modern school” interview went for 45 minutes, got him to talk about some illegal stuff he did @ harvard but he cut it off when zoom ran out so not sure how good, felt like i vibed. 6/10.

Stanford - went really well, the AO note later said she described me as a genius apparently so that’s cool, we talked alot and she had done isef i think in the past and we talked about our memories alot and in general it was fun. 9/10.

Duke - pretty mid tbh it was fun and nice but i had no answer for why duke 5/10

UC Berkeley MET - Disaster, this is not a one on one, but you record yourself answering questions, I REALLY didn’t care since I came back later had 1 day to do this and was tired, just chatgpt’d some random stuff about the school and said it reading straight from a script, super uninspiring answers read in an uninspiring way (tbf I wasn’t interested in MET since it meant my parents might force me to go there over stanford) 1/10

​

***Essays***

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

I nearly failed APEL and I’m not known to be a great writer, so ​I dropped all my ec’s senior year to focus on essays, after being warned by a guy @ davidsons that essays mattered way more than I thought they did. Watched every video from admitium tiktok to cc posts and hundreds of reddit threads to get ideas and help. I got help from my friends and also a really cool family friend @ harvard who got praised for writing alot. My essays were very nontraditional and very very casual and i talked about lots of mitish stuff (dream school), which also happened to fit for caltech. Everyone who read my CA said they liked it, and my Harvard friend who got in purely for essays (his note said) rated them really highly said he liked my essays, but I don’t think they were the main driving factor for my acceptances so I’ll rate them 7/10 (like everyone else on this forum). 

Since I didn’t have to tell the colleges how much i loved researching or science bc my awards and ec’s displayed that already, i spent most of my essays talking about fun stuff i liked doing, and nonacademic stuff, trying to talk about myself as a person and not as a college applicant/sweaty high schooler.

I didn’t try on my Duke or Columbia or NU essays AT ALL, i templated my why essays really hard and just swapped in names, but I did copy paste my MIT essays into duke which i spent almost 100 hours on. I tryharded my MIT Stanford Caltech and Harvard essays, and I’d rate them 8/10, while my other schools (including UC’s) were much much worse probably 3/10 or 4/10.

Additional Information:

In general, I don’t think this collegeresults posts helps anyone except maybe like 20 people be more confident in their profiles, but I wanted to say either way GOOD. ESSAYS. REALLY. REALLY. REALLY. MATTER. I know alot of people with similar ec’s as me and while they lit up the T5’s as well, there is always people that don’t, if you have these sorts of awards&amp;ec’s you need to be showing off your personality, don’t just sit there with your isef medal and watch the world go by and chatgpt essays and expect to sweep T5’s (or t3’s since Yale and Princeton are irrelevant smh) 

UC’s are so random—I live in CA and I hate UC’s for being so RNG, almost NO one is getting in, and it’s just so random no matter which ones. I have no clue what is going on but test op hit these schools like a truck. Until the test is reinstated in \~2025 UC will probably be stupid and random like it is right now for Co22/23/24. College Board backlash was unjustified. 

Also try on everything!! I got my MET interview, and then absolutely bombed it by just reading straight from a script and obviously rushing to get it done, and I might have had some random stanford stuff in the background too LOL so that was not the best look and probably why I got straight rejected (read: coping)

Similarly, not trying at all on Duke/NU/Columbia is why I got rejected by those, like seriously those were 2/10 essays, you can’t just get by without good essays, I did this almost as a test, if I could have awful essays and clearly a good enough app for more selective schools, and yeah it DOESN’T WORK. TRY ON YOUR ESSAYS!!

Okay actually not columbia, funny story, they didn’t get my SCOIR rec for whatever reason, and sent me 3 emails asking me to submit it (want me fr) but I didn’t respond on time so yeah. (sorry I kept forgetting and the deadline hit)

At the same time, Columbia is the worst school in the world (read rejected my best friend ed) so i dnc.

In general, I wasn’t \*that\* surprised by any acceptance after stanford, but mit still had my heart destroying itself. 

Should you do the no targets/no safeties strat? Yeah go for it j take 20 gap years like that one usc (or was it nyu i can never tell) post.
