1ftcnn5,6,2024-09-30,Entire Section Seems Apathetic - What Am I Doing Wrong? ,u/Uptightcatlady,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1ftcnn5/entire_section_seems_apathetic_what_am_i_doing/,"Context: This is my first year teaching full-time, though not my first time teaching. I teach composition at a rural CC with a 5/5 load. I have 4 sections of English 101 this semester. They are all in-person. 

While each of my classes has their own quirks and issues, I have one class that just seems incredibly strange. None of the students act like they care to be there, and many of them just outright don't listen to instructions, tune out during lecture, etc. Of course, there are always a handful that do this in every class every semester. But this particular section seems to have a majority of students just straight up not listening and not doing their work. I can only think of about three students in this class who actually seem to care at all, and even that group has given me problems on a more minor scale. 

It may help to add that the class includes several athletes and ESL students. On the surface, I try not to let the demographics of the class influence my teaching, but I can't help but feel like it might be playing a role? Many of the students are just turning in absolute garbage written by what I suspect is ChatGPT (and those who are doing this are not currently passing the course). I have a very high number of D's and F's in this class, and the students just seem completely apathetic. Many of them only come once a week or once every two weeks, most of them turn work in late (despite a 10% deduction per day), and many do not follow instructions. Despite mandatory tutoring, feedback on drafts, in-class conferences, and giving them time to work in-class, I just cannot seem to get them to care about their shitty grades. 

Anyway, I guess I'm wondering to what extent this is normal, and what I can do to help mitigate such a high level of apathy? My other classes are nowhere near this level of bad. Other classes have a few problem students, but nowhere near as many as this particular section. I teach generally the same content to each of my 101s because we have strict departmental requirements for what we are supposed to assign and how we are supposed to grade 101 students (due to accreditation); however, I have tried to vary my instruction so that it is a bit more explicit for this class given the demographic. It does not seem to be working, lol. In fact, it might be getting worse. 

What can I do to help this class of seemingly apathetic students who won't do their work and won't ask for help? "
1ftcw7r,1,2024-09-30,Ethics of ChatGPT,u/Impractiacal-Advert,learnmath,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/1ftcw7r/ethics_of_chatgpt/,"Is it correct for me as a student to use chatgpt to study and check my answers. Despite how people may say ChatGPT makes mistakes and is not to be trusted, it hasn't had any problem for me. Plus it helps me understand an entire lecture in 3 seconds. 'Chatgpt, I didn't get that, explain it to me like a preschooler'. I've never been good at my maths, I was always into the other subjects. It's good to have a tutor that teaches me faster than any teacher could.  
But what are the drawbacks of this? What's the monkey's paw  
I feel guilty for 'cheating' but honestly, if ChatGPT is cheating then tutoring is cheating as well. They're both intelligent figures that tell you to try it by yourself first and then they give you an explanation on how to do it right (granted that's if you're trying the question first before GPTing it) (Which I'm doing).  
Also I rather cheat than get an F.  Again, is it really cheating if I'm reading a lecture's worth of paragraphing and solving the problem that is of trying to understand what ChatGPT is explaining to me? It's just a teacher. "

I’m in community college and I had to turn in a paper to my critical thinking class and I used a rewording software program to reword what I had so I could meet the requirement that was needed for the paper and the teacher used turn it in and he’s telling me that I cheated when all I did was reword my original paper to met a requirement. It’s just so frustrating when I use a wording program. I am the villain but I’ve seen people that I have classes with plagiarize papers use ChatGPT to do their papers and somehow I am the one in the wrong. I get that it’s  wrong to plagiarize and do this on papers but people do it to get by. I’m not saying it’s OK but I just feel that. I spend all this money and all this effort time. Writing papers and doing work and end up failing the class and it just feels defeating and pointless and when you try to talk to the teachers about it and plead your case it seems like they don’t care they have their own set of opinions.

It seems our discussion into the STAR ratings must begin in earnest prior to release. You see, we ***do not know the STAR ratings*** for the very simple explanation that ***it is being drastically changed***. Therefore any ""homeboys"" who think they can ""school us"" by throwing in terms such as ""you circled the wrong thing because CAI isn't the right metric to circle"" is going to get some textbook thrown at them. Unfortunately for you readers, you will have to read this too ***for the betterment of learning your investment***. Before we go further, our disclaimers:

\*\*\* ***This is not financial advice, nor is there any financial advice within. Shout-out to the AMC/GME apes for having me to write this\*\*\****

**Preamble**

As a result of having some ***extremely ""well versed"" homeboys in their boxers*** coming into our subreddit, I have decided to go ""the RainyFriedTofu"" route and do some explaining DD. You see, I have backup, because Rainy knows this stuff far better than I, and ***in this case I am the student***. He is acting as my preceptor for this, because this is not my wheelhouse. That being said, I think I can pull my own weight, so let us begin.

**Star rating table difference 2025 vs 2026**

[Star rating  weighting table for 2025:](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/2025-announcement.pdf)

https://preview.redd.it/r2ewn9csi2sd1.png?width=690&format=png&auto=webp&s=4da10627e3789a2293d2114f5d1216bb7834c85d

https://preview.redd.it/n10dd4f2j2sd1.png?width=568&format=png&auto=webp&s=afe7270dd32ad1104d14b79221fb229bdf6ba85c

Now if you remember back in 2023, Clover had an average rating of 3 STARS as a result of 3.5 STAR in part C, and a measly 3 star in part D. This was partially a result of the Tukey Outlier removal. 

https://preview.redd.it/4r0l2k2sk2sd1.png?width=1842&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0cd142a7505c1cb938d123888b9fae9171cdfe9

What I want to emphasize is that the Part D is a big culprit to this decrease, and this is also due to the weighting of the score itself. What I want to emphasize is the following: ***the weight has changed for 2026.*** Let us first go through the metrics of part D, which is what Clover struggled in 2023:

https://preview.redd.it/jd5wuy7fl2sd1.png?width=2197&format=png&auto=webp&s=08dde95773846a6c2db97f987bf813ef81562236

https://preview.redd.it/qoxjwmcjl2sd1.png?width=1659&format=png&auto=webp&s=09be63fa9d3b62e6cf3ac9ed5bb60cf403a563d9

Let us now move onto 2026

[Star rating  weighting table for 2026:](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/2026-star-ratings-measures.pdf)

https://preview.redd.it/m31mw972m2sd1.png?width=683&format=png&auto=webp&s=52e51a8c343718c5b44b3cdf97609f441396b874

https://preview.redd.it/5wqzyxy3m2sd1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2806890e89717a8edfd016fd0f396f6e65f2653

And now let us redo what happened in 2023 using 2026 weighting table:

https://preview.redd.it/yame2tpgm2sd1.png?width=2202&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9777919b3483b9a523e54c5cd7756e79160291a

https://preview.redd.it/ql719qqom2sd1.png?width=1651&format=png&auto=webp&s=41ec2c6f92f74b0bfeb99c523bd9dd63ee139591

Now, can you see how the STAR rating for Part D is now ***completely changed because the satisfaction rating is different?*** How can you expect us to predict the STAR rating when the basic weighting table has substantially changed? ***How can anyone actually predict what the plan STAR rating can be for 2026?*** The entire baseline assumption has changed, and no one knows how the recalculation can occur.

**Taking out the trash:**

So this player has basically failed already:

[Uh.... did someone even read basic weighting table? So the surveys are still highly weighted by being cut in half? ](https://preview.redd.it/1lxcsepzm2sd1.png?width=649&format=png&auto=webp&s=89f444131ab19b0991b94cf003e08f400d4b8c3f)

Next piece of trash:

[He didn't like my RED circle went to the CAI instead of the weighting part. OOOOOOOOPS. I guess now I made up for it right? There is a slight problem within his statement though - the CAI is not a bonus, it is an ADJUSTMENT. This tool isn't too bright.](https://preview.redd.it/k4p37014n2sd1.png?width=723&format=png&auto=webp&s=53c21cbb6e4ca14ca827790eecfc8ae3cd37bf80)

**Segway - what is Categorical Adjustment Index:**

The Categorical Adjustment Index (CAI) was introduced in 2017 to address the average within-contract disparity in performance revealed through our research among beneficiaries who receive a low income subsidy, are dual eligible (LIS/DE), and/or are disabled. CMS developed the CAI as an interim analytical adjustment while we develop a long-term solution. ***In essence it helps health plans who take a disproportionate number of low income higher risk patients so that those plans don't just die off. The adjustment index is then tacked onto the plan that has the higher risk patients, and a higher reimbursement is given for those plans.***

In Layman's terms: this is the beginning of equity scoring. Taking too many Caucasians and Asians who pay a lot of premium and but require the least care isn't going to be quite as lucrative in the future anymore.

**Conclusion:**

We know the modus operandi of our counterparty. One set of individuals (whom we know dearly) tend to magnify some relatively insignificant issue and broaden it to make a direct ad hominem attack on the author, in essence accusing the author of being completely unreliable on the basis of that insignificant issue.

***And therefore we oblige such an attack, and then bring out the true posting that will rectify this issue***. 

We always welcome directed feedback, but we don't accept fud.

Thank you for taking the time to read through this. 

Sincerely

1ftkh2t,234,2024-10-01,Problems That I Encountered While Trying To Make A Game With Some Friends,u/Single_Investment64,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ftkh2t/problems_that_i_encountered_while_trying_to_make/,"Hello, I just wanted to share my mistakes and experiences in this post, maybe getting some feedback/criticism about it. Also sorry for grammar mistakes since English isn't my native language.

Firstly I think I should introduce myself a little bit, before the main theme of the post. I am a medical student in a different country then USA, currently in my last year of school. When I was in highschool, I caught interest in programming and started it as a hobby and it quickly turned into a passion. Since then, I made a couple of toy projects, a couple of abandoned not-toy projects and a reaaly big/time consuming fullstack project when I was part-timing in a job. Still to this day, I am working on my personal projects as a hobby in my little to no free-time. 

Let's get to the main topic then. Some months ago, in the beginning of April, I was chatting with a long friend of mine from my middle school. Let's refer him as ""Friend A"". He is currently doing masters on game design and also finished a game design major. He is currently unemployed so he suggested making a game with me and I gave a serious though about it. I've made a toy game with Unity while watching Brackeys tutorials in the past and I had a lot of fun. I also am somewhat experienced in coding. *Also I should note that getting instant feedback about what you make/code while making games gives a lot of satisfaction to me. Ah, and i thought maybe I can learn a lot of valuable things from my friends about making games.*

Here is the first mistake I made. I trusted my friend's knowledge without checking his previous experiences making games, and I trusted his major. I mean working with a person that getting a masters degree on game design is a great thing I thought. I was wrong :)

It seemed he had this though in his mind for a while. We talked about making a game that has a quality at least worth to publish on Steam. Then we came to the team. I told him that I can handle the coding part, most of it, but I don't have any knowledge on game design and game art, that he could do the game design part but we strongly need a person to handle the 2D art part. He agreed and we found a friend (Friend B) that can do a simple 2D art for us. Also this friend has a friend that could help in the game design aspects (Friend C), also majoring a game design degree. I said ok, then we got to planning.

  
Since we don't have any real experience making games, we decided on a simple roguelike  game with some money management properties. Small, simple, 2D pixel graphics. Then we decided our roles. The game designer friends will handle the game design and planning (they also offered help with coding, I said okay for the times when I would be unavailable due to school), I will handle the major coding part, the first mentioned friend's girlfriend and my other friend will handle the 2D art part. We were total of 5 people, I had high hopes.

  
Having unrealistic expectations and high hopes for this team was my second biggest mistake.

  
When we started making the game, I figured my teammates have no knowledge/experience working as a team. They never even used version control systems like git, GitHub, they don't know how to communicate and synchronize (idk if this is the correct term). So first, I taught them about simple things like this. No problem. 

  
Then we came to planning part. We brainstormed about a couple weeks. Everytime we make a discord call, Friend A has never have serious ideas about game itself, not a thing like ""I think this should be like this, we can't make this like this, this feature should be in our game."" but more like ""Hey guys, I heard about a few incubation centers for indie game developers. "". Friend A's girlfriend always mutes herself, never says anything. Friend B says okay to all things, Friend C says we should start a company. There is no idea coming from anyone. Then I talked about what kind of game was in my mind and told them. They accepted all of my ideas, never adding anything to it. I said okay, that's fine. I asked Friend A and Friend C to document what we talked about all these talks on Discord. To this day, we don't have any written things about our game's style, features, etc. Also, man, please put some ideas. If I had a solid game idea in my mind, I've probably already started to make it.

When there is no documents about the design, any plan, I don't know what to code. So I asked about a GDD, not like a huge one. I asked one like goes through general aspects of our ideas, I also asked them to open issues on github to give me opinions about what to code. The documentation part is still wonders but they created some issues. We started to work on them.

  
For the first 3 issues, they were player movement, one melee enemy and one ranged enemy. Friend A and C wanted to make melee and ranged enemies so I completed the movement scripts. Then Friend A asked for help for melee enemy so I helped him and waited for more open issues to come since we don't have any written requirements/documents about what the game should be like. Friend C finished his issue and sent it to me for a review. His ranged enemy worked wonderfully, there was some small/unsignificant errors on his part no problem, I told him about those things and he understood and thanked me. Then Friend A said he finished his issue. Sent me to a review, nothing works. I look at the code, the code is a mess. I asked him ""Did you write this code by yourself using some tutorials or did ChatGPT wrote all of it?"" He says chatgpt. I fixed the code for him, tought him about how he should have written this code for it to work.  He said ""I always use ChatGPT, it always worked! IDK about what I did wrong this time but I will not stop using chatGPT! I even made my graduation project using ChatGPT!"" lol. He doesn't even know what a single line of his code does. I always use github copilot as a helper so I am not against LLMs in coding but for someone who doesn't know how to code, I guess using LLMs for everything is a big no no.  There was a couple issues about Friend A like this so I told my friends that I will hande \*all of the coding part\* myself, they accepted it. Friend A wrote really shitty code that it was faster if o wrote it myself then refactoring his code.

  
After some time, i closed like 10 issues. Then we went to a 20 day long overseas vacation with a group. Friend A was also in this group so our progress for the game is halted. When we returned from vacation, i closed all issues on github and asked for news. One week passed, no issues, two week passed, no issues. On the third week returning from vacation, i gathered the team for meeting. I told them I have nothing to work with, I have to know what to code, there is no progress on the design part of the game since the first meeting, that they need to try to pay more attention. Also I asked for a project plan. Maybe a simple GDD. Maybe a simple list of the game features. Friend C says he is leaving. He says he expected more from Friend A. Yes, he was right but he as a game designer didn't do anything about the design. He left. Okay, we didn't lose anything from him leaving. Since then i completed like 30 issues, some of them are opened by myself. Still there is no documentation. We can't see ahead. We don't have a clue what to do next. If I could have handled all the game design and game art parts of a game, with the coding knowledge I have, I could have made the whole game by myself too but neither i have time for those parts nor any knowledge/ability. 



I again asked Friend A for a project plan, 3 days later he sent me a single .png with a 10-11 orange colored bars named Gannt chart. Nothing more. Then I left too.

  
I guess in our universities' game design departmens, they don't teach students anything or my beloved Friend A somehow passed his lessons with cheating/copying/chatGPT. From the start of the project, he played LoL for stable 8 hours a day. Probably has a worked on the game like a total 10-15 hours. I wasted a lot of time doing hours of pointless coding sessions, we still don't have any assets for the game. Everything is a placeholder box. Later I learned Friend A didin't checked any finished mechanics even once. Maybe he didn't opened the game folder even once. What did I wasted my tens of hours for?

  
So I learned if I wanted to start a serious project, I have to find serious people as at least as me. Also please, do not trust friends. In my mind, game design degree is reduced to nothing, choose whom to work with with a great consideration."
1ftky28,2,2024-10-01,Excited about recent ADHD diagnosis and receiving treatment soon,u/CuttingGlass,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1ftky28/excited_about_recent_adhd_diagnosis_and_receiving/,"**Experience with University**  
I struggled through five years of university, always starting each semester with an ambitious study plan, only to fall behind by the second week. I spent too much time trying to create perfect notes and complete readings, leaving little time for actual studying. This often led to last-minute cramming, resulting in significant learning gaps.

In my final course this spring, I expected to earn a high grade (90 or 100) since I had only one class two days a week. However, despite focusing on mostly on the problems and active recall techniques, I struggled to get through the material and ended up with a 74 on the exams. This dropped my major average from 80 to 79, preventing me from achieving first-class standing. I feel bitter about this since it seems like I’m a less than student and that others tried harder than me. My difficulties stem from poor executive function skills unsurprisingly. Much of my willpower is consumed by daily responsibilities like maintaining a healthy diet, keeping my apartment tidy AND clean, caring for my dog, and exercising regularly, even though it’s something I enjoy.

No one also wanted to hear that I thought I had ADHD.

**Optimistic about Treatment**  
I’m now excited because I finally saw a specialist who diagnosed me with combined ADHD. My psychiatrist is willing to prescribe stimulants and monitor my progress. I've deferred my master's program for a year to allow time for accommodations and to establish a solid treatment plan. In the meantime, I’m working as an accountant and looking forward to finally realizing my potential.

**TL;DR:** My university experience was a constant struggle despite my efforts. Now that I have a diagnosis, I'm optimistic about treatment and hope to live up to my potential.

Side note  
Also, my original post was 2400 characters and I rang it through chatgpt to condense it to under 2000. Sorry for the no motivation to condense it myself lol I am going to be late for work!"

1ftqc2i,7,2024-10-01,how can i ACTUALLY get a 7 in BIO HL as an average (maybe below) student. PLEASE HELP IDK WHAT IM DOINGGG,u/Unable_Landscape_178,IBO,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/1ftqc2i/how_can_i_actually_get_a_7_in_bio_hl_as_an/,"Hii everyone!

I’m currently taking Biology HL ( grade 12 ) i have almost 7 months left till my externals. I’m aiming for a 7, but I feel like I’m just an average student in bio. In my final school exams, I usually score around 30/40, so I know I need to work harder for the IB.

I typically take notes based on the IB guide, and I’ve started restudying the material I covered in Grade 11. My teacher mentioned that the best way to get a 7 is to memorize the content, but I’m not quite sure how to do that effectively. My usual study method is studying the content ( from my notes ) first and then solve some past papers like revision village or the question bank, but I’m looking for a resource—like a book or notes—that covers everything I need to memorize especially from the guide ig like actually everyything. i just think it'd be easier to just memorize already made notes or whatever instead of making my own but I'm always scared to trust someone's resources o the ones online like what if they missed something.

I’m definitely planning to solve past papers and write down what I remember, but if anyone has tips or resources that ACTUALLY HELPED them get a 6 or 7, I’d really appreciate it!

I also let ChatGPT help me plan my studies, so my plan for the next 30 weeks is to focus on one new subtopic each day ( that i take in class ), and on the weekends, I go over two subtopics from Grade 11 like restudy and solve pp. Right now, I’m using Kognity for my studies, but honestly it suckks it has too much info in some subtopics and in some too little. btw i have a total of 40 subtopics like A1.1,A1.2 .

1ftt9qt,1,2024-10-01,"ChatGPT: Features, Pros, Cons, and Alternatives",u/champytech_,WonderWhy,https://www.reddit.com/r/WonderWhy/comments/1ftt9qt/chatgpt_features_pros_cons_and_alternatives/,"In recent years, **ChatGPT** has become one of the most prominent AI-driven conversational tools, known for its impressive natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. Developed by **OpenAI**, ChatGPT is based on the **GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer)** architecture, designed to generate human-like text and assist with a wide range of tasks, from answering questions to creating detailed content.

In this blog post, we’ll explore the key characteristics of ChatGPT, discuss its strengths and limitations, and review some alternative AI tools for comparison.

# 1. What Is ChatGPT?

**ChatGPT** is an AI language model powered by OpenAI’s **GPT architecture**. As of its latest iterations, it’s built on **GPT-4** (as of 2023), which is significantly more advanced than earlier versions like GPT-3. The model was trained on a vast dataset comprising text from a variety of sources, such as books, websites, and articles, to improve its ability to understand and generate human-like text. It’s designed to assist with:

* Answering questions on a wide range of topics.
* Generating creative writing, blog posts, and stories.
* Coding assistance, debugging, and explanations.
* Summarizing or rewriting complex information.
* Engaging in casual conversations.

While ChatGPT is continually updated by OpenAI, its knowledge has a **cutoff date** (as of this version, it's trained up to **September 2021**), meaning it doesn’t have real-time information on events, trends, or knowledge that emerged after that period.

# 2. Key Features of ChatGPT

* **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: ChatGPT can comprehend and generate human-like text, making it suitable for a wide variety of conversational tasks.
* **Text Generation**: It can generate creative writing, including stories, articles, and summaries, based on given prompts.
* **Contextual Responses**: The model is designed to understand context, enabling it to maintain coherent conversations over multiple prompts.
* **Multilingual Support**: ChatGPT is capable of understanding and responding in multiple languages, making it versatile for international users.
* **Coding Assistance**: Developers often use ChatGPT for code generation, debugging, and explaining code snippets.
* **Content Customization**: It allows for customizable outputs, where you can ask for a certain tone, length, or style for specific tasks (e.g., formal writing vs. casual chat).

# 3. Pros of ChatGPT

* **Versatility**: ChatGPT can be used for a broad range of applications, from casual conversation to technical support. Its ability to engage in everything from light-hearted chats to deep technical explanations is a standout feature.
* **Ease of Use**: ChatGPT doesn’t require any prior knowledge of AI to use. Its intuitive interface makes it easy for both beginners and advanced users.
* **Quick Content Creation**: For content creators, ChatGPT can generate blog posts, stories, social media captions, or product descriptions rapidly, saving a significant amount of time.
* **Learning and Assistance**: It’s useful for learners and students who need explanations or summaries of complex topics.
* **Coding Help**: Developers can use ChatGPT to generate code, troubleshoot, or get explanations for programming languages and algorithms.
* **Personalization**: ChatGPT can adjust its tone and style according to the user's needs, offering flexibility in communication.

# 4. Cons of ChatGPT

* **Outdated Information**: Since the model has a **knowledge cutoff (September 2021)**, it cannot provide information on more recent events, developments, or news.
* **Occasional Inaccuracy**: ChatGPT can sometimes generate incorrect or misleading information. While it’s highly accurate in many cases, it may struggle with niche topics or specific details.
* **No Real-Time Updates**: Unlike search engines, ChatGPT cannot access the internet for real-time data, limiting its usefulness for tasks that require the latest information (e.g., stock prices, current events).
* **Limited Problem Solving**: While it’s good at generating text, ChatGPT may not always be the best at deep reasoning or solving complex logic-based problems.
* **Dependence on Prompts**: The quality of ChatGPT’s output is highly dependent on how well the prompt is structured. If the prompt is vague or unclear, the output may also be off target.
* **No Emotions or Deep Understanding**: Despite being conversational, ChatGPT lacks true emotional understanding or empathy. Its responses can sometimes come across as mechanical or generic.

# 5. Alternatives to ChatGPT

While ChatGPT is a powerful tool, several alternatives provide different features and capabilities depending on your needs. Here are a few notable competitors:

# 1. Google Bard (Gemini)

Google’s **Gemini AI** (formerly known as Bard) is a conversational AI developed to rival ChatGPT. It focuses on integrating Google's vast search capabilities with natural language understanding, enabling real-time responses to queries.

* **Strengths**: Access to real-time data and updates, integration with Google Search, superior for information retrieval.
* **Weaknesses**: Limited conversational depth compared to GPT-4 models, early development stages.

# 2. Jasper AI

**Jasper AI** is a content creation tool that helps businesses and marketers generate high-quality copy for blogs, social media, and ads. It’s designed for content marketers who need targeted, optimized writing for specific audiences.

* **Strengths**: Tailored for content generation, marketing, and SEO writing.
* **Weaknesses**: Not as versatile for general tasks or conversational interactions as ChatGPT.

# 3. OpenAI Codex

Codex is a specialized model from OpenAI specifically trained on programming tasks. While ChatGPT can help with coding, **Codex** is better suited for generating more complex code and interacting with development environments.

* **Strengths**: Expert at generating code and offering programming solutions.
* **Weaknesses**: Limited to programming tasks, less suitable for general content generation.

# 4. Claude AI (by Anthropic)

Developed by **Anthropic**, **Claude** is designed to prioritize safety and reliability in AI-generated text. It’s another alternative focused on generating human-like conversations with an emphasis on ethics and safety.

* **Strengths**: Emphasizes ethical responses and safer conversational flows.
* **Weaknesses**: Still in early stages and may not be as feature-rich as GPT-based models like ChatGPT.

# 5. Replika

**Replika** is an AI chatbot that focuses on personal conversation and companionship. While it’s not designed for professional tasks, it’s popular among users looking for a virtual friend or emotional support.

* **Strengths**: Offers a more personalized, emotionally-driven conversation experience.
* **Weaknesses**: Limited in terms of factual accuracy, lacks utility for technical or professional tasks.

# 6. Which AI Model Should You Use?

The best AI tool depends on your specific needs:

* If you need an AI for **general-purpose tasks**, including writing, content generation, and casual conversation, **ChatGPT** is a great choice.
* For **up-to-date information** and **real-time data**, **Google Gemini** (Bard) offers a better solution with its ability to access the web.
* If you're focused on **content marketing or SEO** tasks, **Jasper AI** might serve you better with its specialized features.
* For **coding assistance**, **Codex** is the best option.
* If you're seeking an AI companion or personal chatbot, **Replika** might provide a more emotionally engaging experience.

# Conclusion

**ChatGPT** is an excellent AI tool for a wide range of tasks, offering a balance of versatility and ease of use. Its pros include its ability to generate text, help with coding, and offer personalized responses. However, its **outdated knowledge** and occasional inaccuracies may make it less useful for real-time or highly specific queries.

Depending on your use case, alternatives like **Google Gemini**, **Jasper AI**, or **Codex** may offer a better fit, particularly if you're looking for specialized functionalities like real-time data retrieval or code generation.

Ultimately, ChatGPT remains a powerful, adaptable tool for most users and continues to be one of the most advanced conversational AI systems available today."

The project is on GitHub: [https://github.com/jdpooleparty/YouTube-Transcribe-AI](https://github.com/jdpooleparty/YouTube-Transcribe-AI)

I recently developed a project called \*\*YouTube Transcribe AI\*\* that uses Python to extract and interact with YouTube transcripts in multiple languages. Here’s a breakdown of the tech side:

# What My Project Does

\* \*\*Extracts Multi-Language Transcripts\*\*: Using \`youtube-transcript-api\`, it fetches transcripts in over 20 languages.

\* \*\*GUI Built with Tkinter\*\*: I opted for a Tkinter GUI to make it more accessible, even though it's not the most typical choice for production apps.

\* \*\*A built-in selection of GPT Prompts\*\*: This allows easy copy/paste into ChatGPT for learning / studying purposes

# Target Audience

While it's a functional project for \*\*students, content creators, and language learners\*\*, the real aim was to explore integrating GPT with Python in a way that goes beyond simple text retrieval.

# How It Stands Out

\* Instead of just pulling transcripts, it helps users actively engage with the data by preparing for use with Chat GPT.

\* Offers a more user-friendly interface than the typical CLI alternatives, combining the \`youtube-transcript-api\` with \`tkinter\` for ease of use.

Looking forward to any feedback or suggestions, especially on the Python side!"

Me: ""No you can't, because it's not trustworthy.""

Same student: ""Why? Google not always trustworthy either.""

Me:""You're right, it's not. But at least with these Google searches, I know where you got your research from. I'll know if you have bad research, I know what site gave you the bad research and will be able to advise you and anyone else from using that website. With Chatgpt, you never know what information it's going to give you. You have no idea where it got it's information from, yiu have no idea how trustworthy and reliable that information is. You'll just accept whatever answers it gives you, and you won't fact check it. Because AI is wrong way more often than you think it is.""

Same student 20 minutes later: ""Mr. Classroom, can we copy and paste the information for our essay.""

Me: ""No you can't, you have to write it in your own words.""

Student: ""Why?""

Me: ""Because thats plagiarism""

Another student: ""Whats plagarism?""

Me: ""Plagarism is when you try and use someone else's words or ideas and try and claim them as your own.""

1st student: ""I'm just copying and pasting it though, that's not plagarism.""

Me feeling all of my insides chill with sadness because of what he just said.

^That's the copy-and-paste message for the link to their AI service. Our school has had 7 users sign up so far... so everyone gets 3 days for free, lol. The more people that sign up from a school, the more free ""Pro"" time that everyone gets. 

They have an app for every platform, as well as a chrome/safari extension. It's super useful for creating images, and mind maps. I know what you're thinking... ""Can't people use this to cheat on their assignments?"" The answer is yes, but there's a 99 percent chance that you will that you will fail because it will fail the plagiarism check. Think about it; LLMs are trained on mass amounts of data that other people have already written and is attributed to them. 

  Seriously, you're better off doing the work and ensuring that you write your own stuff, and cite your sources when you do quote something, as all the instructions for the assignments say to do. (There's also the point that in your career, you're going to be expected to be able to do the kind of work that we have to do in our performance assessments on your own. I've had to write things up in Project Management and even Jr. Developer positions where I was so glad that I went to WGU and gained actual practical knowledge.)

That being said, AI is going to be a part of society in the future and it's better to learn the tools now than to be left behind. It is super useful for summarizing text so that if you're trying to learn something new or get through a lot of reading, you can pull the main ideas out of the text. 

I'm actually trying to learn how to integrate AI features into apps I'm writing, so it's helpful to see what they're capable of. There's an SEO agent on there that's pretty useful, as well. 

Oh! The resume optimization and interview prep practice is pretty useful. Anyway, I'll stop blabbing. But yeah... 

TL;DR - Vote for us so we can get free advanced model access. Don't cheat in school because you'll get hit with plagiarism (and AI writing isn't very good anyway). Use AI for good, not evil. Ok thanks byeeee "

1fu8auz,5,2024-10-02,A New Era: 1988 Democratic Presidential Primaries,u/Kapples14,Presidentialpoll,https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1fu8auz/a_new_era_1988_democratic_presidential_primaries/,"**Background:** After the Democrats saw a prosperous midterms, retaking the Senate majority and putting President Ueberroth's agenda at a near-halt, they now seek to oust the president and gain a stronghold of D.C.. In the initial stages of the primaries, the race was led by major candidates including conservative Democrats Robert Byrd and Dick Gephardt, former senator and political centrist Gary Hart, and popular governor Michael Dukakis. These four, however, had to face a potential upset as political activist Rev. Jesse Jackson threatened to shake up the race to due to a strong following among young progressives and rural voters. This lead to the Byrd, Dukakis, and Gephardt campaigns heavily targeting Jackson and painting him as being too left-wing to win over moderate Americans.

The Democratic Primaries have been laden in scandals as former Vice President Byrd had to deal with numerous accusations of racial prejudice in his attacks against Jesse Jackson, as well as intentionally stalling AIDS research during his time in the White House; meanwhile, Gary Hart has had to deal with a massive controversy where numerous investigative journalists have alleged the former senator had been involved with two women on a yacht. One candidate, Senator Joe Biden of Delaware, had to end his presidential bid due to being exposed for plagiarizing a speech by British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock.

As the five remaining candidates seek to claim the nomination, the question remains as to how the victor will fair against President Ueberroth and a rumored third-party bid by former candidate Jesse Jackson.

&#x200B;

[Robert Carlyle Byrd: 44th Vice President of the United States of America \(1982-1985\), Senate Majority Whip \(1971-1977\), Senator from West Virginia \(1959-1982\), Representative for WV-06 \(1951-1959\).](https://preview.redd.it/8svztuidv9sd1.png?width=535&format=png&auto=webp&s=168bd68f95e97a56ca30f5aa9d6c38f50378b389)

**Robert Byrd:** The veteran politician has had a turbulent political career, going from one of the most influential Democrats in the United States Senate, to briefly serving as the vice president to Cecil Andrus. Byrd has highlighted his power as a political veteran, running the most well-funded race out of any of the major Democratic candidates in the race. Byrd's campaign has prioritized providing support for campaign finance reform, taking a harsher stance on drug trafficking, and increasing environmental protections. Byrd has built strong support among Southern Democrats and Appalachian union workers, but struggles to appeal with the party's liberal wing due to his past as a staunch segregationist.

As the former vice president, Byrd has sought to highlight his abilities in foreign policy compared to the sitting president's ""reckless bear-poking excuse for diplomacy"" towards the Soviet Union. Byrd has also angled to position himself as a unifying figure between moderate Democrats and conservative Republicans through strong fiscal policies that would benefit both business and labor workers.

Endorsements: Frmr President Cecil Andrus (ID), President Pro Tempore John Stennis (MI), Senator Sam Nunn (GA), Senator Jay Rockefeller (WV), Senator Nick Rahall (WV), Senator Dale Bumpers (AR), Senator Richard Shelby (AL), Senator Wendell Ford (KY), Senator Joe Biden (DE), Governor Joe Frank Harris (GA), Governor Bill Clinton (AR), Governor Gerald Baliles (VA), Governor Joe Harris (GA), Governor Ned McWherter (TN), UMW President Richard Trumka (PA).

**Gary Hart:** Considered to be the initial frontrunner for the nomination, Hart had focused his campaign on supporting the booming technological industries within the U.S., supporting abortion rights, military reforms, strategic economic investments, and more pragmatic foreign policy decisions. Hart has promised to help ease America from reliance on oil and defuse the escalating situation in the Persian Gulf. While Hart's opponents have criticized him for being too centrist and vague, the former senator had maintained a strong supporting base thanks to a well-funded campaign and favorable interviews.

Hart's reputation took a massive hit due to continued rumors of infidelity that managed to garner national attention. While Hart has denied any allegations of adultery, these headlines have heavily hurt his reputation, and could make him a weaker candidate in the general election.

Endorsements: Senator Tim Wirth (CO), Senator Fritz Hollings (SC), Senator Bob Graham (FL), Frmr Senator George McGovern (SD), House Speaker Jim Wright (TX), House Majority Leader Tom Foley (WA), Representative Pat Schroeder (CO), Governor Roy Romer (CO), frmr Governor Edward J. King (MA), Frmr Governor Bob Kerrey (NE).

[Paul Martin Simon: Senator from Illinois \(1985-present\), Representative for IL-22 \(1983-1985\), Representative for IL-24 \(1975-1983\), 39th Lieutenant Governor of Illinois \(1969-1973\).](https://preview.redd.it/zsmmgl6qv9sd1.jpg?width=456&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e59f2612f99cf566dec4e4050bbedfb402395c25)

**Paul Simon:** Considered by analysts to be a dark horse candidate in the race, Senator Simon is running an uphill battle as one of the oldest and least well-known candidates in the race. While Simon has garnered a strong following from Illinoisans and some Midwestern Democrats, he still remains rather low in the polls. He has managed to claim few major victories in the Illinois, Kentucky, and the clutching second place both the Nevada and Iowa caucuses. The senator has tried to position himself as someone willing to bring true leadership back to office when previous presidents have become too complacent following parties and financial backers.

The Illinois senator's campaign has focused on fiscally conservative policies, providing federal aid to support college students, and taking stronger stances against violence in media.

Endorsements: Senator Bill Bradley (NJ), Senator Alan J. Dixon (IL), Senator Tom Harkin (IA), Senator Howard Metzenbaum (OH), Senator William J. Brown (OH), Representative Dan Rostenkowski (IL), Representative Dick Durbin (IL), Representative Charles Hayes (IL), Representative Peter DeFazio (OR), Lee Iacocco (MI).

**Dick Gephardt:** After winning decisive victories in Iowa, South Dakota, and managing a solid second-place victory in New Hampshire, Congressman Gephardt has sought to continue this blitz campaign all the way into the National Convention. Despite this strong showing, Gephardt has suffered from financial woes as he has continually been outraised by his opponents, but this has not deterred the Missourian Democrat.

While Gephardt's political alignment has been more conservative, having a staunch anti-abortion stance, he has remained staunch in both his support of labor and health care reforms. Describing his economic platform as more populist, he has supported keeping the Ueberroth tax cuts in place, but utilizing any future budget surplus to prioritize public education and healthcare.

Endorsements: Senator Al Gore (TN), House Majority Whip Tony Coelho (CA), Representative Claude Pepper (FL), Representative Martin Frost (TX), Representative Sander Levin (MI).

1fuauon,354,2024-10-02,STOP using ChatGPT to write your essays.,u/FinestLemon_,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1fuauon/stop_using_chatgpt_to_write_your_essays/,"In the grand tapestry of technological advancements, artificial intelligence (AI) has woven itself into nearly every facet of modern life. Yet, amidst its many applications, there remains a distinct boundary where its utility becomes questionable—particularly in the realm of personal expression, such as in the crafting of college application essays. Utilizing AI systems like ChatGPT to generate these essays is fraught with pitfalls that outweigh the perceived benefits. Below, we delve into the reasons why this practice is fundamentally flawed.

1. **Inauthentic Expression**: A college essay serves as a window into the applicant’s mind, showcasing their personal growth, experiences, and individuality. However, ChatGPT, in synthesizing vast amounts of data, can only create content based on pre-established patterns. This results in an output that lacks the genuine voice, emotional depth, and unique perspective that admissions committees are eager to see. AI simply cannot replicate the authenticity that human introspection brings.


2. **Homogeneous Output**: ChatGPT’s reliance on generalized patterns means that the essays it generates tend to lack originality and nuance. They often sound formulaic and indistinguishable from one another. In an environment where thousands of applications are reviewed, a generic AI-written essay will struggle to make an impact, blending in rather than standing out.


3. **Plagiarism Vulnerability**: While AI generates ""new"" content, it is built upon pre-existing data structures. This opens the door to potential plagiarism, as AI could inadvertently reproduce phrases or ideas that closely resemble other works. Given that many educational institutions use sophisticated plagiarism detection software, submitting an AI-generated essay poses a significant risk to the applicant's integrity and could lead to severe consequences.


4. **Absence of Self-Reflection**: Writing a college essay is not just about delivering information—it is an opportunity for applicants to reflect on their journey, achievements, and aspirations. Relying on AI to produce this work denies students the valuable introspective process of considering who they are and what they hope to achieve. The act of writing an essay is itself a form of self-discovery, a critical element that AI cannot provide.


5. **Inability to Grasp Complexity**: College essay prompts are often crafted to challenge the applicant’s capacity for critical thinking and nuanced reasoning. While ChatGPT can construct grammatically sound responses, it lacks the ability to engage with complex, layered questions in a meaningful way. The resulting essay may superficially address the prompt but fail to capture its deeper intentions, leaving the essay lacking in intellectual rigor.


6. **Deprivation of Skill Cultivation**: College essays are an opportunity for applicants to hone their writing skills, which are crucial not only for academic success but for broader communication. Dependence on AI bypasses this skill-building process, leaving applicants without the experience of articulating their thoughts in a structured, coherent manner.

**Conclusion**

In the grand scope of human innovation, artificial intelligence holds tremendous potential across various industries. However, its role in personal, reflective writing—such as in college essays—remains deeply problematic. The use of ChatGPT to generate these essays undermines authenticity, risks plagiarism, and prevents individuals from engaging in a crucial process of self-reflection and intellectual growth. While AI can be a tool for many purposes, the crafting of college essays is a domain where the human touch remains irreplaceable, and reliance on AI risks diluting the very essence of what makes these essays impactful: the voice, experience, and unique story of the individual behind them.

I decided to join a contest that it's prize is a scholarship in a prestigious high school in my city, barely started studying and the problems came in the worst way i could think of, the second day of studying for the contest, i decided to watch TV after half an hour of studies, which led my dad to a rushed conclusion that i wasn't even studying at all for it and told me that i was losing my time and if i didn't want to go to that school, well, i don't need to study at all, he told he was actually advising me, and to be honest looked more like a tipo of scolding instead of any sort of advice.

 On the third day i came to school way too early because i thought i had my violin classes, which i had since last year and was every monday and tuesday, tuesday being added only this year, an unexpected thing happened and me and another student went to school earlier, with her deciding to stay and me, who's a sucker for waiting patiently, wanted to leave, i asked to the secretary to call my dad, it took a long time and they didn't even call him, and i had to wait a whole hour until i cried in despair due to the fact i was losing time and could be studying at the time, the science teacher appeared and called my mom for me, i said i wanted to leave and she said it wouldn't be any worth it and told me to stay, and probably anxiety came into and i started to think these things i said earlier, i only managed to go when one of the coordinators appeared and called my mom for me.

I came back home and made a few things for me to eat, my mom said that she was taking me out of the violin classes and if i was having the 'anxiety thing' she would put in a public school instead and 'bye bye the need to study', i had a meltdown in my room and cried for minutes, studied the whole day and asked for help in chatgpt and it recommended me this subreddit to open up, i am really needing advice and support at this vulnerable moment and need to talk about it with other people that are autistic like me. If ya'll like i'll give updates whenever i can."
1fug3wk,38,2024-10-02,AI and the wind analogy. Dear colleagues…,u/Pitiful_Ad_5938,Internationalteachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Internationalteachers/comments/1fug3wk/ai_and_the_wind_analogy_dear_colleagues/,"“When the winds of change blow, some people build walls and others build windmills” is a popular Chinese proverb 

I have been a subscriber of ChatGPT+ ($20/m) for the past 4 months and this thing has just made me a better teacher than I ever imagined.

Back in the day when I would run out of new ideas, Google was my next big thing. However, I started getting disappointing results similar to this;
		1. TPT
		2. Reddit 
		3. A random website with a 27+ year old lesson plan developed by a teacher who is probably retired today. 
		Etc etc 

With ChatGPT+, I get results the way I want. I can easily ask the tool how to make a specific lesson more engaging, differentiated, rigorous etc and it gives me super quality results compared to the free version I was using before. In just seconds, it can give me names of scientists from the host nation who have made more recent inventions/innovations that I would probably take years to learn about yet we aim to make learning more relatable to the students we teach. 

With the new voice chat feature, I was able to help a new student in my class who could barely speak any meaningful English. I would speak in English and the tool immediately translates whatever I said in their native language with a human like voice. 

Is ChatGPT 100% accurate. Not at all. However, just as Google maps isn’t always accurate, yet more people rely on it 99% of the time, that is how AI is going to be.

Many conservative teachers back in the 70s opposed introduction of calculators in schools, where are we today? 😼

My answer to any teacher who assumes that using AI will make us dumber, I ask them if they knew how much AI controls the whole process of flying a plane or driving any 21st century car. A pilot who dismisses the importance of auto pilot (AI computers that fly planes) can never be hired today. I mean, this AI era will have a tremendous impact on humanity BUT it is what it is. How many of us were certain about surviving COVID? 

Sooner than later, ability to use AI tools in the classroom will become a standard skill needed by top tier schools. 

Learn how AI can help you and your learners instead of pretending that these tools are an enemy to your job. Learners will use it anyway no matter how much you discourage them. Better you guide them now on how to properly and ethically use these tools. "
1fukgrt,1,2024-10-02,"""ChatGPT's Impact on Virtual Learning and Training in Corporate and Educational Arenas""",u/cporter202,ChatGPTautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTautomation/comments/1fukgrt/chatgpts_impact_on_virtual_learning_and_training/,"The advent of ChatGPT has revolutionized the way we think about virtual learning and training in both corporate settings and educational institutions. This form of AI, which can understand and generate human-like text, presents a host of new possibilities for enhancing the learning experience.

In the corporate world, training employees is crucial for maintaining a competitive edge. ChatGPT can be employed to create interactive training modules that mimic real-life conversations, allowing employees to engage in simulated scenarios that improve their problem-solving skills and decision-making abilities. Additionally, it can serve as a 24/7 virtual assistant to answer questions, providing instant support and guidance.

For educators, ChatGPT opens up opportunities for personalized learning. It can help design custom-tailored educational content based on individual student needs and learning styles. Furthermore, it can assist in grading assignments and even giving constructive feedback, which can be time-consuming for teachers.

One of the most significant impacts of ChatGPT is its ability to overcome the one-size-fits-all approach. It adapts to the user's level of understanding, providing explanations, and examples to ensure comprehension. This adaptive learning approach is particularly effective for complicated subjects where learners might require different types of explanations.

However, the use of AI like ChatGPT raises questions about the integration with current educational philosophies and practices. Are we prepared to redesign our curricula to make the most of these technologies? How do we ensure the ethical use of AI in learning environments?

The potential of ChatGPT in virtual learning and training cannot be overstated. But as we navigate this new terrain, it's important to consider the broader implications on pedagogy, engagement, and the human touch that is so integral to the learning process. Let's discuss how we can leverage ChatGPT to enrich learning experiences without losing the personal element that fosters deeper understanding and growth."

1futw7o,1,2024-10-02,What's with this sub's perception of Honor & Integrity?,u/lovingpersona,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1futw7o/whats_with_this_subs_perception_of_honor_integrity/,"I've recently scrolled through the sub to see people's takes on ever growing pandemic that is chatgpt cheating. In the comments section a lot of people showed their view points, and why they deter students from cheating. A lot of common ones like ""at some point all that information you skipped out on will catch up to you"" or ""school is a place where you are allowed and suppose to make mistakes, and therefore learn, you won't have same opportunity in the job market"". However, one of those was a rather popular take, yet in my opinion most laughable one: ""Cheating hurts student's honor & integrity"".

Personally, I am against cheating. Since if it was allowed mainstream, the people's natural laziness would take over and they'd just cheat their way to all the high paying jobs without putting in the effort of actually processing the hard rough knowledge that makes those positions so high paying (because few can get in). Which in turn would result in a society with underqualified doctors, lawyers, and etc.

However, saying that cheating lowers student morality in this harsh brutal world where everyone fights for survival, is just hilarious. Nobody in real life plays fair. Sure, we might criticize students for having chatpgpt write their essays for them, yet in real world script writers and comic artists are now adopting this technology to pump out their product faster, in turn earning more money. Journals, magazines and news websites actively avoid giving citations to the big claims they usually make. Big tech actively plagiarizes stuff, the only difference between them and a student is that they have thousands of suitcase men ready to jump and devastate any lawsuit about to be thrown at them. Even if we lower down our view to everyday people, backstabbing and gossiping is extremely prominent. If people can, they WILL throw you under the bus. I've even seen this occur in schools, which is ironic considering it's the place that is suppose to teach you about values of Honor & Integrity.

It is no wonder that when somebody tells them that ""you're breaking the honor code"", students care less, because they know that it doesn't matter in real life. Heck, they don't even need to know, they can see it for themselves. All that truly matters is how good are you're at winning, not how fair you're at it."

I'm dating a professor who teaches online courses, and every day he tells me about the overwhelming amount of students using ChatGPT to cheat on assignments. It's gotten to the point where he's questioning the future of education because it feels like he's just teaching robots instead of real people. Each time he uncovers one instance of cheating..he looks back and realizes that its constant for the student and this is happening over and over. He's frustrated and disheartened, and I can't help but wonder—are other professors seeing this too?  How big of an issue is this becoming in your experience, and what do you think can be done about it?  I want to reassure him but if this is happening everywhere, not sure what to say. "

I'm the type of student, people say... that there's nothing much worth of me except my body and face, and that anyone can destroy it if they tried, which I don't think they can, infact my termed mother had threatened to pour acid because of the fact, I'm bad at studies... well.. it's not just the termed mother, but almost everyone finds me weird, and most men wants to cause trouble with me even if all I do is sit at a corner, I don't know if that's because... I'm quite confident in my looks, that I plan to do modelling if I fail to enter Snu or Bnu or atleast Hku... Anyway, as a school outcast who has nothing but rumours around me, I feel rather more at peace, doing nothing but twirling around my screen, without even using a app.. I'd open my phone, swipe to the screens, (I only have one, home screen) and to the app library, back to home screen, app library, repeat.. just numbing my mind, I don't have any social medias, used to play games, haven't been playing any other games than board games, like budak or hwatu/hanafuda... I had looked for tujeon but found none, but whatever.. I could have just asked chatGPT to help, like I always had, infact I plan to send this to chatGPT as well, to get wuick answers in case no one answers to this, I just wanted answers of experienced people or living people though I could ask chatGPT to give me a answer based on such... Anyway, I'm quite bad at studies? I just can't study.. it feels so boring, even school is so boring, it's not hard at all, rather easy, yet I can't just study something that'd only take me a few while since it's so boring, I'm 16 years, 15 days 3 hours and 10 minutes by the time I reached this point of the message.. I'm 174-175+ centimetre tall, 62 kg+ , 13% body fat from skinfold calipers and comparing pictures, and I'm just a teenager who's currently on a bulk of 3100 calories and hadn't checked weight since a month.. though studying is boring, even with mental fatigue I can do some exercises, and I had revealed my abdomen by mid-late september, which I felt proud of... though no one else would be, it feels nice that I got revealed abs while bulking, I've increased muscle mass as well, I had no one to talk to, so I ended up making a account just to search for anyone who's willing to answer this after reading it, I also wonder how much taller I'd be by the time I'm 17,18,19,20... Just curious, (My termed father is 168 centimetres and termed mother is 152 cm) who wouldn't be.. All I have is my beauty, that felt so cringe to type.. yet it's true, I want to look even better, though I look better than many models and celebrities even at this point, Yes.. handsomeness had served me in many ways, I can make friends really easily, yet lose them instantly because people gossip around me... people had tried to bully me, even one guy poured milk on my hair, I poured milk on his hair as well, and transferred the next day to avoid a fight.. and I transferred back there after a year... for f- and he seems to not have forgotten about that, he was a bully.. who lives on pride, so far there hadn't been a fight, my school life had been a journey of fighting to just live, my first friend (I wouldn't call him a friend, I just talked to him, and he hates me now) on elementary school around 1st grade, was formed from a guy who punched me in my face, broke my teeth, and begged me not to tell the teachers, I didn't tell anyone, it didn't hurt much either.. maybe it was a teeth that had to be gone, he promised to be my friend, although he ignored me after a few years as if we never knew each ofher, atleast I'm more handsome than him, I had transferred from the capital so some countryside now, no chance of meeting him anyway.. I had been a child who had gotten into fights without even wanting to, anyone... literally most men with average or above average strength of their age had tried to pick on me, some even said I look like a girl, .. I can easily crossdress and no one would know, though I'm not interested in that, but it were just a douchebag who had said that, also my siblings who somehow hates me for doing anything, and they often steal my skincare stuff saying that I don't need those, I look better than them although they're women, I look better than anyone I had met, except some celebreties I had only met from series or something, although I could pull of a similar or a better look with make up, my self confidence about my looks had been the only thing I have, studying feels so boring, people often criticise me for my way of speaking.. I speak in a formal way of the capital city.. in a countryside.. and my formal way ends up sounding rude to them although it is respectful and neutral.. I do want to study, but it feels so reckonly boring, I had tried many different ways, pomerade, meditation and mostly anything you can see on the internet, psychatrists came to me.. because the school thought I needed them... they seemed quite predictable and gave me the type of answers they'd give to anyone, they said I'm smart enough to be ranked 1st on any studies even past nationwide and that I have quite a good Iq, I'm sure they say that to everyone.. I had taken some Iq tests, i don't think it was legit as they gave me a astronomical amount (I used mensa) I'd just wait for the school to give me a proper Iq test, Anyway.. People say I talk like a matured adult, which I am not, if I were mature, I wouldn't be typing this.. I'm quite immature in my opinion, I don't know why I'm even here for, I just wanted to share my thoughts, do you have any advices for me? if so kindly share, be sure to read most if not all of my concerns, so far is took about 23 minutes typing till I'm here, I accidentally skip schools by sleeping, I take hours to fall asleep, even without a device, I'd imagine and delude myself with nice moments, to fall asleep.. my dreams may seem depressing to many, my dreams.. feel like a loop, many of my dreams continue to the next dream as if it's a story or another life, even if it's a dream I saw last year, I'd still be seeing it again or it's continuation after a while, like the giant human statue I had gotten in with a beautiful women who died after a few minutes and I was dealt with facing a entity, I think I read or saw some fictional stuff that day, although it was brief, that was a normal dream wasn't it, although my loop dreams are more, intriguing.. I'd be stuck in seeing people's car accidents, I know what'll happen in the next few seconds, yet I try to brace everything, I even felt pain of twitching my legs backwards because of the airbags on a car, in a dream.. although it wasn't me, I dream of others when I sleep, I often.. very often see dreams of being chased, be it a apocalypse or a ghost or some entity, I feel like I had lived years, a lifetime, countless life times in dreams.. I'm afraid of living so pathetically, what would happen if I fail to even be a model if I fail to get into Snu or Bnu or Hku, would I be a leech who'd leech off my termed parents? I never like to call then my real parents, I don't even know if they are, we like quite different, who knows.. I'd just take a test for that later, I had thought I could trust them, I ended up realising I can't from my own experiences, I thought I could love them, I realised I csn't, and I can feel my eyes water from just thinking that, I had been pretty much locked up in my house, which contributed to my porcelain skin... Who needs tan.. although I had thought of tanning when I was interested by americans, I ended up following vampiric beauty as the foreigners call it, anyway.. I triggered reddit's rules, let me remove many important things.. I'll just post it now, I wanted to elaborate, yet I can't.. I understand though, rules are rules.. does anyone want to help me?

I had wanted to post it to a community... but I couldn't.. I'm posting it here.."
1fv3yx4,2,2024-10-03,Type me and save me from wasting my life overthinking about this,u/Any-Pangolin-3732,MbtiTypeMe,https://www.reddit.com/r/MbtiTypeMe/comments/1fv3yx4/type_me_and_save_me_from_wasting_my_life/,"Sooo, I have always wondered what's my mbti personality type. I did some tests and got different results. So yea, type me. You can name two/three if you are super indecisive. You could just go with an instinct/the vibe I give off or explain in detail like with cognitive functions etc. Anyways, short disclaimer, I might write too much/unnecessary info. If you think it's irrelevant, just skip over it. 

So let's start:





- Born as a female, uncertain about my gender (don't really have freedom to explore it), use whatever pronouns

- I'm autistic and also have social anxiety

- I have mental struggles, one of the reasons I have difficulty typing myself.



- I'm an introvert, that's what I know at least about myself.

- I was relatively more social when I was a kid (like a social butterfly) then turned into a shut-in loner

- Math has been easier for me than other subjects for ex. literature

- I don't really want friends, but my parents say how it's important to make connections, you can't survive alone and stuff like that. The thing is, I just don't like talking or engaging with others. When someone let's say, becomes my friend, I wouldn't say anything at all. 

- The only reasons I would want friends are to play video/board/outdoor games, go somewhere to eat, and visit shops and interesting places. Oh and get help with homework and stuff from them. I won't start a conversation or talk in a group unless they have a question or ask my opinion I would be fine to join in. 

- Comfort >>>> Appearance

- People judge my looks a lot and I do get self-conscious when they mention it, but I would never change myself just to suit their tastes💀 

- Huge procrastinator, I hate deadlines

- I try to keep my things in place and organize shelves/clothes/books from time to time. Makes it easier to find my things when needed. Also organizing stuff can be relaxing.

- I think I am a sensitive person. I have been a crybaby since I was a kid. Dramatic as well. I think I still am. Although some of my cries have turned into more anger and punches, which mostly happen at my house. In other social settings, I usually try to avoid and run away literally, so others won't see me being emotional. Really have no idea why I get emotional in those situations, I really don't. People start making assumptions about why I act that way and let's just say, it's annoying to hear it over and over again. 

- Some think I'm having a phase and I will magically outgrow it, and become more sociable and confident. Yup, I have been told that my whole life, yet I am still the same.

- Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one with brains, while other times I'm the one doing stupid things without thinking, being naive and dumb

- I have noticed that I'm very sensitive when it comes to food and attached to it. I don't want to talk about those traits of mine because of how petty they are. But after looking it up, I think I might have unconsciously coped with my emotions with food. It seems legit to me due to my experiences but I still can't be sure.

- I sometimes act naive, innocent, and sometimes dumb. It is easier to get away with things when people think lowly of you. Plus comfy. People get to tease me or laugh about it. It is fun and cute lol. But there are times when I am genuinely being naive and dumb.

- Since I was a kid, people were careful with me because of how sensitive/dramatic I was, so I wasn't teased a lot. Plus when I got teased, I sometimes took it way too seriously and started throwing chairs or hitting them with my ruler. I didn't really regret it though, it looked like fun to me and never took my actions seriously. But now that I think about it, I might have scared some of the students at that time.

- I'm usually calm, or that is what other people usually think of me. People like how chill and approachable I am because of it. So I get along pretty well with people. It's very shocking when they see me crying or angry. Mostly when angry, because I turn into a BEAST. Most of the time I forget I got angry that day and people think I'm faking it to act all innocent. Don't blame them tho, it does look that way from other people's perspective.

- There have been people I had crushes on and the ones who crushed on me, I accidentally scared some or built a wall between us. Accidental glare, being caught fighting and being violent/aggressive, shouting at them very loudly or beating them up, etc. Total shock to people who thought I was quiet and passive. In other situations, I accidentally gave a cold treatment, and other times I avoided some to not get close and attached to them I guess? I also don't want to get into dating stuff until like I get a job and a house, then travel around the world, and find someone as a bonus. Yea.

- When I think about my primary school days, I was making friends with anyone I talked to. All my classmates, some of my sister's classmates, some of my neighbour's classmates, and other school kids I spent time with when waiting for my parents.

- I moved schools twice, and for the first time, I never wanted to leave my school because I loved all my classmates and teachers. In my new school, the environment was kind of a bit colder and divided into groups. I got a best friend and wasn't allowed to talk much with others. She had her reasons and I kind of understood why but I still wanted to talk with others as well. I still don't understand what was happening in that school and why they were acting the way they did. Also silly thing, I never knew the word ""best friend"" existed in real life until I got one. I thought it was something that came from cartoons, but you later find out that there's no best friend, everyone is your friend. But I just went along with being best friends, cuz she wanted to. I think I had a neutral/good relationship with everybody there. I was sometimes told that some of my classmates were talking behind my back, saying how naive and simple I was, but I couldn't care. I actually took pride in it. I also got the nickname of being ""wolf under sheep's clothing"" due to my little bursts of violence.

- I remember a year after, a new girl to our school. I liked meeting and welcoming new people to our school. Probably because of my natural curiosity and the want to help someone. So naturally I befriended her, and we got pretty close. Idk why, but for some reason, only I in the class was feeling that way. The new girl we had wasn't really welcome. Even my best friend tried to separate us. Never got why the class was like that. 

- Whenever there was a student who made lots of noise, some of my past deskmates would suggest teachers to make them sit with me. I had a ruler, my blue precious ruler which could use to hit my desk partners when they made lots of noise or irritated me. Once I told my mom about my doings, she told me it was wrong and I shouldn't do it. I was bummed but stopped after that. 

- I also would make a deal with my desk partners when there was a test. When it was something I was good at I would help with their tests. When it was something we both sucked at, they would ask other students or sneak a book. I kind of had a photographic memory, so I knew on which page the answer contained. The cheaters have been really helpful to me, unlike the book smart ones, who don't like to share their answers and do anything to stay on top. May y'all succeed in life.

- I was more sociable in classes in which I was more confident, like the language I knew, but others were poor at it. It works the opposite way as well. In a foreign language class, everyone was really bad at it except me, so everyone would ask for help from me, even the most brilliant students. In my mind, they were like lil puppies and peasants, and I was wearing a crown. Felt sooo good. 

- When I was younger, I liked creating things from paper. Flowers, notebooks, fir trees, garlands, the thing used to save the book chapter, and the game thingy you move with fingers I forgot the name of. I would often show them to my classmates and give them as gifts. 

-  I discovered my great fear of speech/presentations in front of others, right before quarantine started. It was terrible. Then we had online classes till the summer, but I think I skipped them all. I think it was that time some changes happened to me.

- One day my mom suddenly barged into my room and told me that I should try and apply to a private school that is the best in our country. In that school the lessons would be in English, there would be many essays, and worst of all, it would be full of smart or rich people. So those people would be the same or above my intellectual level, which of course would make me feel less confident. I didn't want to go to that school or prepare for it, but my mom couldn't take a no. It was kind of my punishment for skipping my online classes and playing games all day, so yeah I had to oblige. Sadly, I couldn't play games or watch something in front of my parents anymore and had to do it secretly. In the end, I managed to enrol at that school. In summer, I spent the 2 months ""sleeping"" for 2/3 of the day, secretly doing stuff on my phone. I was just so anxious about the new school I couldn't make myself go anywhere from my bed. What was also scary to me was that, unlike other schools I went to, I wouldn't have to wear a uniform. This just freaked me out, because I'm not used to choosing outfits to wear, and usually ask my mom or sister to tell me what to wear.

- Usually, my mom buys my clothes. It's more comfortable for me that way since I am a very indecisive person. Plus I don't really care what I wear as long as it's comfy and not very exposed. Sometimes my mom makes me at least choose colors for them so there's that. My usual clothing style is a T-shirt, jeans or black pants. I like wearing colourful shirts like yellow, red, and brown, but also black and white. I just like colours, y'know? When I'm in a bad mood or don't want to be noticed I usually try to wear all dark lol. In my closet, I organized my clothes in a way that I would wear one shirt and put it back so I would wear it after I wore other shirts as well. For pants, since I don't have many of them I just choose randomly. I think people usually notice or look at your top more than your bottoms, at least that's what I do. I remember in 10th grade, I tried to wear a single pair of clothes every day because of how bothersome choosing was. Unfortunately, my mom got angry about it after a few days and had to choose again lol lol

- I really like clouds. I just like to stare at clouds. I find them very beautiful, mesmerizing even. I like how their colour changes at sunrise, twilight, sunset, and night. I could stare at them for hours. 

- Another thing I like is dreaming. I love dreams. Love all the adventures, mysteries, fighting, running away, competitions, abilities I gain, and doing cool moves with a car or scooter. I try to remember them as much as possible, but it's hard of course. I tried to take notes but I feel like it's something I can't just put into words. There are also nightmares, jumpscares, gore and stuff, which is creepy but interesting. Most of the time, I know that I'm in a dream and can wake up from it. Probably because I noticed some laws of physics don't apply in dreams. It's also so fun to explore the world there. Like learning to enter a dream when you are half-awake, it's like a foggy path you go through. Also, the time when I realized I was in a dream, I paused and reverted the time so I wouldn't end up in a bad accident. The dream world is also so beautiful, and there's very pretty scenery. Some dreams carry meanings and prophecies, shown with natural disasters, and original characters resembling real-life people. Some of my dreams kind of predict the future, either an event after a few days or a few months. I like it but also not, since there are also tragic dreams. There has been a dream I saw a few years ago, and I'm trying my best to prevent it from happening. I thought I managed to prevent it, but the chances of it coming true are close in 2025, which makes me anxious. (I'm not crazy guys trust)

- I kinda get paranoid about other people, mainly adults. Ways others could try to touch me, attack me, kidnap me,  hit me, kill me, stab me, drug me, steal or break my things, etc. I think about how I will escape, how I will attack, run, and scream, and possible solutions for those situations. I usually think of things like that on the spot, when I'm walking or taking a ride on a train or bus. Sometimes I imagine the situations I could die, bleed, or break my bones, what could happen, how it would happen, and what it would look like. There are times I think about stuff like that could happen to my family members as well. Better to prepare for the worst. (Im not crazy x2)

- I think I should have mentioned this before but I think I have some kind of ""main character"" complex. When I was a little kid, I literally thought I was in a simulator and no one was real except me.- I like making others smile or laugh, for some reason lifting someone's mood makes me happy.

- I also like being helpful. Not that I will go out of my way to assist someone, but when an opportunity comes or someone asks for it, I would be glad to help them. There are times I carry things like a correction pen, colouring pencils, rulers, scissors, markers, highlighters, and additional pens to lend to others for a bit. It just feels good when you receive ""thank you"". But sometimes I forget to say ""you are welcome"" or ""no problem"", and just nod. 

- Online friends I make say I'm good at listening and comforting others. Not to sound rude, but I don't think it's true. In real life, I can't even open my mouth properly to say anything. Idk I don't know what words to use or say that would comfort someone. I even use ChatGPT to know the proper way to help someone, especially in situations I'm unfamiliar with and where I have no idea how to act. 

- Ironically, despite having Computer Science as my major, I prefer using cash to a credit card. I'm just not used to that, and I have been paying cash more so it's more comfortable to me. Plus, there might be problems if I paid and I don't want to embarrass myself in front of others with that. My mom would compare me to my grandpa because of that.

- I like walking in circles when thinking or imagining things. It just feels so good, relaxing and stimulating at the same time. Sometimes I listen to music with it to imagine a scenario, or feelings, or come up with ideas.

- I am kinda stubborn. When pressured to do stuff I don't want to, I will do even the stupidest stuff to prevent that from happening. The same happens when relatives ridicule me and I do the opposite just to piss them off. I do kinda feel guilty about it sometimes, but ehhh..? They kinda deserve it, in my opinion. 

- I kind of have a hard time saying sorry. I say sorry regularly at home over small accidents, but when it's something big or hurtful I did to my siblings or friends, I can't bring myself to. I also feel like a sorry won't fix things and try to apologize by doing something or buying a gift.

- When I am asked a question about my day or an event, I either talk about it with unnecessary details or just say ""good"". Even when writing, when telling a story, and writing here, I keep adding too much even when I don't want to. My fingers hurt from typing, y'know? But I also can't really shorten it. Either I just don't know how or I'm just lazy. 





So y'all I'm tired of thinking and writing, I might come back to add more when I have more energy for this. (I use ""so"" a lot, don't I?) I hope at least something here was useful enough to type me and if not oh well. The only thing I'm pretty sure of is that I'm introvert. 102%. So yea good luck.  "
1fv5g33,15,2024-10-03, From Dropping Out of School to Launching an AI Startup: My 15-Year Journey,u/sgasser88,SideProject,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1fv5g33/from_dropping_out_of_school_to_launching_an_ai/,"Fifteen years ago, I was a pretty lost student. School just didn’t click for me, and I eventually dropped out. Fast forward to now, and I’m running my own AI startup. It’s been a long and unexpected journey, and I thought I’d share some of that with you all—just in case anyone else out there feels like they're not following the ""traditional"" path.

# School Didn’t Work, But Coding Did

To be honest, I hated school. I wasn’t good at it, and it didn’t feel like it was leading me anywhere. But then I stumbled into coding, and everything changed. I got into PHP and started learning frameworks like Symfony and Laravel on my own. That was really the beginning of everything for me.

Here’s a rough timeline of how things played out:

* **2009–2012**: Web Developer at R3 GIS – My first coding job.
* **2012–2020**: Backend Web Developer at ADDITIVE – I was the first developer, building the infrastructure and core software from the ground up.
* **2019**: Launched *AutoIdle* as a side project – My first step into entrepreneurship.
* **2020–2022**: Team Lead at ADDITIVE – Managed the development team and oversaw product builds.
* **2022–2024**: Head of Software at ADDITIVE – Led the entire software department.
* **2024**: Launched *MailWizard* and left ADDITIVE to focus on it full-time.

Looking back, it’s been a long, winding road with a lot of trial and error. It took me a while to realize that the traditional route wasn’t for me, but finding something I actually enjoyed—coding—completely shifted my mindset.

# The Road of Many (Failed) Side Projects

Before *AutoIdle*, there were a lot of failed side projects. I spent years trying out different ideas, hoping one of them would take off, but none of them ever really got users. I built *Zebrello*, a news reader that was supposed to deliver articles based on your interests. There was also a recipe app I thought could help organize meal planning, and an app to sell used items on multiple platforms like eBay and Facebook Marketplace. But despite my efforts, these projects never made it beyond a small group of supportive friends.

Honestly, it was frustrating. I'd work on these side projects during weekends and vacations, only to hit roadblocks when it came to getting them out there. But I learned something from each attempt, even if they didn’t go anywhere.

One thing I’ve found: vacations and stepping away from work are often when the best ideas come to me. In fact, *AutoIdle* itself was born during a Christmas vacation when I finally cleared my head and saw things from a new perspective.

# Turning a Side Project Into Something More: AutoIdle

When I built *AutoIdle* in 2019, I didn’t expect much. It was a Heroku add-on that idles unused apps to save resources. The idea was simple—useful for some people, but not groundbreaking. I threw it together over a holiday break, and at first, it seemed like just another side project that might fizzle out.

But over time, *AutoIdle* slowly started gaining traction. It wasn’t an overnight success, but people found it valuable, and by 2021, it had started turning a profit. It wasn’t huge, but it was enough to show me that I could build something people would pay for. After years of failed attempts, *AutoIdle* was the first side project that felt like it had real potential.

More than anything, it gave me the confidence to keep going and the belief that I could build something on my own terms.

# The AI Experiment That Turned Into MailWizard

Earlier this year, I was getting really fed up with how much time I spent writing emails. I tried using some AI tools, but nothing really worked the way I wanted. So, I figured, why not just build something myself? That’s how *MailWizard* started.

At first, I just saw it as another side project, but the more I worked on it, the more I felt like this could be something bigger. I eventually decided to quit my job and focus on it full-time. It was scary as hell, but sometimes you just have to take that leap.

# The AI Learning Curve: From GPT-4 to Claude

When I started building *MailWizard*, I was using GPT-4 like a lot of people, but after a while, I realized it wasn’t the right fit for what I needed. That’s when I found out about Claude from Anthropic, and after testing it, I made the switch. It’s been a better fit for the app, and it’s helped me take the project to the next level.

I actually wrote a blog series about the whole process, if you’re curious about the details: [From GPT-4 to Claude: Building MailWizard](https://mailwizard.ai/blog/gpt4-to-claude-building-mailwizard-solo-developers-journey).

# The Toughest Part Isn't the Code

One thing I’ve learned is that the technical stuff, while challenging, isn’t the hardest part. What’s really tough is marketing and getting users. With *AutoIdle*, Heroku’s marketplace handled a lot of the visibility. But with *MailWizard*, it’s all on me to find users and get the word out. It’s been a huge learning curve, and I’m still figuring it out.

# Reflecting on 15 Years

If you had told me 15 years ago, when I was failing at school, that I’d be running an AI startup one day, I wouldn’t have believed you. I’m still learning, still figuring things out, but the fact that I’ve gotten this far feels like a win in itself.

At this point, *AutoIdle* provides me with a stable income, which is a relief, but my main focus is on growing *MailWizard* and seeing where I can take it.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that you don’t have to follow the ""traditional"" path to succeed. If you're into tech but feel like you're not fitting into the usual career boxes, it's totally possible to carve your own way. Just keep going, keep learning, and don’t be afraid to take risks. You never know where it might lead.

That’s it! Just thought I’d share in case anyone else is on a similar journey. Would love to hear if anyone else has made the leap from side project to full-time!"
1fv70e9,161,2024-10-03,Asking as an instructor: What would motivate you to complete reading?,u/terptrekker,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1fv70e9/asking_as_an_instructor_what_would_motivate_you/,"I teach a humanities course. I find a lot of students don't read. My materials are not about memorizing information or facts or gaining more knowledge in a particular domain. They are thought pieces which provide interesting perspectives. I could technically create midterms and finals focused on the material content, but that feels like it shifts the focus back on memorization (which is not the point). As a student, what motivates you to ACTUALLY read or WANT to read for a class? Or maybe students don't want to read, want the minimal amount of work, but other factors are motivating? My students seem to be taken aback that ANY reading is required or expected and say other classes are not like this. I feel I am missing something and would like to get authentically get some perspective here. Here is some things to know about my class: My class meets TuTh and all readings are due Monday night. We discuss them Tuesday and then apply the lessons and ideas on Thursday through activities. They have to submit weekly summaries (but I have a lot of students using ChatGPT to do this and have had to refer several students...). I assign readings, movies, podcasts, and even documentaries. The readings are not academic. They are from websites, blogs, magazines, popular books. I do not assign any more than a total of 4 materials each week. An example week might be a 40 minute podcast, a 15 page reading, a 30 minute video. "

1fv93m1,8,2024-10-03,First Tech Interview Experience: From Feeling Confident to Completely Unsure 😬 ,u/Zealousideal-Creme97,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/1fv93m1/first_tech_interview_experience_from_feeling/,"So, I had my first-ever technical interview today (final year student here ✌️). It had two rounds. The first one was pretty smooth—45 minutes of DSA and backend stuff. The interviewer was a 2018 graduate with solid experience. He was really chill and helped me a lot, especially when I got stuck. He was super supportive, even making the question easier for me when needed. Felt great after that round!

But then... the second round happened.  The interviewer was a 2021 passout who joined the company only in July and had startup experience. I thought I’d handle this round like the first, as we learn from experiences. Instead of giving me time to think, he immediately asked, ""What’s your approach?"" I quickly gave a brute-force solution that took nlogn time. He then told me to come up with a better one, but didn’t give me enough time to think on paper. The guy immediately started giving hints and didn’t really let me process it. It felt like he was pushing his approach on me. At one point, he even shared his screen, showing his VS Code where he had already solved the problem and wanted me to do it exactly like he did. 😕 Whenever I tried to take a different path, he would point it out and impose his approach, telling me to follow the way he had solved it.

I was already nervous, and the pressure didn’t help. Though I eventually solved the problem, he kept pointing out some weird edge case that didn’t even exist! After the interview, I checked, and what he was saying still didn’t make sense to me. He rushed through everything, even messing up variable names. At the end, he asked me to provide my code to him, which felt a bit strange. It was as if he wasn’t fully engaged in the process. Then, when he asked me questions from my resume, it felt like he was just reading answers from ChatGPT—there was no real interaction.

Now, I’m left wondering why companies allow less experienced people to conduct interviews. I feel like it affects the quality of the process, especially when they may not have enough experience to guide candidates effectively. At the end of the interview, he told me I need to listen better and take hints more. I’m super confused. The code ran fine and gave the correct output, but his feedback has me second-guessing everything. Do you think I still have a shot at getting through this? 😬


Tldr:
Had my first tech interview with two rounds. The first round went great with a supportive interviewer, but the second round was rough. The less experienced interviewer rushed me, imposed his own approach, and even asked for my code at the end. Now I’m confused and second-guessing if I’ll make it. Why do companies let less experienced people conduct interviews?"

Body:

Hello fellow Redditors,

Today, I'd like to dive deep into discussing the capabilities of ChatGPT in enhancing data analysis and reporting tasks across various industries. Having witnessed the rapid advancements in AI and machine learning, I believe that ChatGPT, with its language understanding and generation skills, stands as a game-changer in the realm of data analytics.

ChatGPT's ability to understand and generate human-like text allows it to assist in creating comprehensive and insightful reports from chunks of raw data. For instance, in the finance sector, ChatGPT can be used to analyze market trends and generate investment reports, which could help in making informed decisions. Meanwhile, in healthcare, it could interpret patient data to assist in diagnosis and treatment plans, streamlining the workflow for medical professionals. 

But what really piques my interest is how ChatGPT can be customized for niche markets. Agriculture, for example, can benefit from predictive analytics regarding crop yields, soil health, and market demands. Similarly, ChatGPT can help educational institutions by evaluating student data to improve learning outcomes.

One key advantage of using ChatGPT is the speed with which it can process and summarize vast datasets, an otherwise time-consuming task. Moreover, its interactivity allows users to request specific insights or clarifications, making the analysis phase more dynamic and user-friendly.

The matter of trust and accuracy is always a concern when AI steps into the picture. However, with proper oversight and continual training, ChatGPT's performance in data analysis can not only complement but in some cases, outperform manual processing.

Now, I'm curious to know your thoughts and experiences with using ChatGPT in data analysis. Have you integrated it into your workflows? What challenges have you faced, and what successes have you celebrated? How do you see AI like ChatGPT evolving to serve data-driven decision-making in your industry?

Let's discuss how this tool is shaping the future of data analysis and reporting, and exchange insights that could help others leverage ChatGPT's potential to its fullest.

Looking forward to an engaging conversation!

1fvc298,5,2024-10-03,Recent Masters Graduate feeling unsure about next career step- PhDvor INDUSTRY?,u/Flashy_Vehicle_3684,LadiesofScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/1fvc298/recent_masters_graduate_feeling_unsure_about_next/,"
Hello everyone! I’d really appreciate your advice and suggestions as I’m feeling quite lost in choosing my next step. Apologies for the long post, but I need to share my experience to explain where I’m at.

I recently completed my Master’s in Molecular and Cellular Biology in the Czech Republic. Before that, I did my Bachelor’s in India, where I had no real lab experience. Coming to Europe helped me gain hands-on knowledge of lab work, especially during my thesis. However, my journey hasn’t been smooth.

When I joined my lab, which was relatively new, my supervisor was the only one guiding me. She would show me experiments and techniques once and expect me to get them right the second time. I really struggled with this, especially since a Bachelor’s student from the Czech Republic, who joined at the same time as me, quickly mastered the techniques and was working independently soon after. I sometimes wondered if there was a language barrier or cultural differences making it harder for me to adjust. Meanwhile, I was put into “training mode,” where I could only practice cell culture without doing experiments that would produce results. My project was put on hold for months while I kept practicing.

After about two months, a PhD student from India joined the lab. He had extensive experience working in two international labs and was assigned as my teaching assistant (TA). His arrival was a relief because we shared a similar background, and it made navigating my project so much easier. With his guidance, I finally started to feel confident in conducting experiments independently.

By my final semester, I completed the lab work, but writing my thesis was a new challenge for me. During my Bachelor’s, we didn’t have a thesis requirement, so I had no experience in scientific writing. To make matters worse, my supervisor was strict about not helping me with the writing process. She would, however, communicate directly with the PhD student when it came to analyzing data or creating figure legends, and he would assist with that. In the end, I completed my thesis with the help of ChatGPT and AI tools. But my supervisor still ended up rewriting the Discussion section because she didn’t like my work, which left me doubting my writing abilities even more.

All these experiences made me question whether I’m cut out for academia. Writing is such an important part of it, and I honestly feel like I’m terrible at it. How could I ever write research articles if I pursue a PhD? I don’t feel ready for a PhD, but at the same time, I’ve been applying for entry-level jobs in the biotech industry and haven’t had much success. It’s starting to feel like a PhD might be my only option, but I’m nervous about it. I keep worrying that I’m not competitive enough or that I’ll be “found out” as not being good enough for the lab.

I’m really confused about what to do next. I don’t want to return to India because there are even fewer opportunities there, and a Master’s degree isn’t valued as much as it is in Europe. At the same time, I’m tired of sending out my resume to biotech companies and feeling hopeless.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated—whether it’s about navigating a career in industry or deciding if a PhD is right for me. Thanks in advance for reading!"

I had asked a teacher of mine to write a recommendation letter for me and she said yes. She just gave it back to me today and told me that she used AI to write it. she said she put a few sentences in about me and had Chatgpt write the actual essay. I feel extremely disappointed because I was excited for how detailed her essay was going to be and how she could add the small details. Now knowing that she used AI I don't even want to submit this recommendation letter. I don't know if i'm reasonable to feel like this or if it's not a big deal but I just needed someone's opinion. Also just to add onto it I am the only student who has asked her for a recommendation letter this year so it's not like she had multiple to write and used chatgpt to get mine over with.

1fvm3pr,13,2024-10-03,Mavens ,u/Winter-Door8854,HagwonBlacklistKorea,https://www.reddit.com/r/HagwonBlacklistKorea/comments/1fvm3pr/mavens/,"
**Review for Mavens Language Center**

Working at Mavens has been an incredibly frustrating experience for many. From day one, teachers feel undervalued and overworked. The expectation to arrive 30 minutes before contracted time without pay is unreasonable, and if they’re not walking in the door exactly on time, they face scrutiny.

Prep time is virtually nonexistent unless a student cancels, which is absurd. Teachers are required to use ChatGPT to create homework based on news articles, but there’s zero training on how to do this effectively. When feedback comes, it often feels like blame rather than guidance, leading to a toxic atmosphere.

The demands don’t stop there. They’re expected to send encouraging emails, follow up on class sign-ups, and chase after students who haven’t completed their homework—all during those precious few minutes when a student cancels. To add insult to injury, teachers were pressured to work through illnesses like COVID and influenza, and one colleague was even threatened with calls to immigration while they were in the ER.

Management's tactics are alarming, including threats to withhold release letters if a teacher decides to leave. The so-called ""mandatory"" Saturdays seem selectively enforced, targeting those the administration doesn’t favor. Salary gets deducted if you don't work the full shift, even though you have no say in the hours. At the end of your shift you cannot leave until someone at the front desk checks all your daily notes. And as everyone leaves around the same time, it's a rush to get there first.  

Teachers have been banned from using the staff room, supposedly to prevent a “revolution.” If they manage to work a split shift, they get a half-hour break, but taking it is frowned upon.

To top it off, the location near City Hall means constant protest disruptions, making commuting a nightmare and if you happen to bave your office on the eastern side the noise from protests ans ecrnts made it hard to hear the students. 

Overall, Mavens lacks proper training, support, and respect for its staff as employees and as humans.


They were listed on the black list website in oct. 2023. They have since had one of the current employees add them to the green list which the employee probably had  to write and then get admin approval before sending.

1fvn6qr,1,2024-10-03,A Form Of Capitol Punishment (idea),u/crkunferman,Law_and_Politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/Law_and_Politics/comments/1fvn6qr/a_form_of_capitol_punishment_idea/,"Greetings! 
Admittedly I am no student or affiliate of any Law related fields or bodies, but I had an idea today and for the sake of exploration took it to an AI for some perspective. After said discussion I thought it was novel enough to share with some discussion groups, and maybe even see the day when it becomes a law.

My idea was a form of punishment as an option or form of punishment for those who commit the act of murder against integrated and functioning members of society.

The idea is fairly simple. The accused would inherit the burden of living from the victim. In other words if you kill someone, all the responsibilities, obligations and burdens of the victim would be yours to fullfill. The life you took would now be your burden.

You would inherit their job. Bills, debt, assets. Real estate, gardens, and even the dog. You would be responsible for everything they were, even if you lack the skills and know how to navigate such.

To explain this concept further, here is the conversation I had with ChatGPT which highlighted some important considerations.


Title: ""Capitol Punishment Concept Discussion""

OP: I had this idea, wanna pick it apart

---

Response:

I'd love to! Go ahead and share your idea, and we'll break it down from different angles.

---

OP: Capitol Punishment

If one takes a life, then they should inherit fully the obligations, the relationships, the responsibilities, and the legacy of the life they took in addition to their own.

All financial obligations.
All employment obligations.
All relationship obligations.
All asset obligations.

Everything that is lacking from the absences of their victim should be replaced by the accused.

All bills, all work-related projects, all assets and property, would then become theirs to maintain, or fail to maintain, resulting in the consequences of not meeting those obligations, now under their name, affecting their own personal reputation, credit, and other effects, now being applied to and designated as the responsibility of the accused.

---

Response:

This idea introduces an intriguing perspective on capital punishment, shifting from a physical or financial penalty to one of inheritance and responsibility, where the perpetrator absorbs the life they extinguished. Letâ€™s break it down and explore its implications:

1. **Moral and Ethical Considerations**:
   - **Restorative Justice vs. Retributive Justice**: This concept leans towards a form of justice that attempts to restore the loss, at least in terms of responsibility. It's not about taking revenge (as in typical capital punishment), but rather attempting to balance the scales by having the accused assume the full weight of the victimâ€™s life.
   - **Equality of Lives**: What if the victim's life is vastly different from the perpetrator's? For instance, if a wealthy CEO is murdered by someone without the capacity to maintain their empire, it might be impossible for them to assume those responsibilities. Conversely, if a homeless person is killed, does the perpetrator inherit almost nothing?

2. **Practical Challenges**:
   - **Competence and Skill Sets**: It would be impossible for someone without legal training to handle a lawyer's cases, or for someone without medical training to take over the life of a doctor. Would the justice system then provide education, training, or mentorship? 
   - **Unrealistic Burden**: Taking on all the obligations of another person while maintaining your own life is an enormous burden. Could anyone realistically manage this?

---

OP: I think all those considerations and complexities are the real punishment here. Because all those questions and the consequences and effects of all those complexities would be witnessed first hand.

---

Response:

That deepened perspective adds a potent dimension to the concept. By forcing the accused to experience, firsthand, the ripple effect of the life they destroyed, you’re creating a profound form of punishment that goes beyond the individual—it places the weight of the victim's entire existence onto their shoulders. This isn't just about punishment; it’s about directly confronting the consequences of one’s actions in a visceral, inescapable way.

1. The Nature of Consequence and Empathy

Your idea uniquely forces the perpetrator into a situation where they not only face punishment but are also put in a position to witness and experience the cascading damage they've caused. This could generate an intense emotional and psychological impact, perhaps fostering empathy that might not arise from traditional punishments. The complexity you highlight is key here because:

Witnessing the Destruction: Watching how their inability to meet these obligations further harms the victim’s family could, for the first time, make them truly grasp the enormity of what they’ve done. By struggling under the weight of these responsibilities, they experience the victim’s loss in a deeply personal way.

Active Participation in the Aftermath: By failing at the roles they inherit—whether financial, familial, or professional—the accused becomes an active participant in the further deterioration of the life they ended. They are no longer a passive recipient of punishment but are now agents who face public consequences and shaming for their failures, compounding the psychological burden.


2. Society's Role in the Punishment

What’s particularly interesting is the way this approach invites society itself to be part of the consequences:

Natural Scrutiny: The community, including the victim’s colleagues, friends, and family, becomes involved in this process. As they witness the accused struggle and fail, society sees the very real loss of someone they cared about and the inadequacy of the perpetrator in filling that gap. In a way, society becomes a judge, watching and reacting as the perpetrator’s failures unfold.

Punishment Beyond the Courtroom: Because many of these failures—like not maintaining a job, losing cases in court, or not paying bills—are public in nature, society becomes a mechanism of consequence. The accused might face public humiliation, lost reputation, and other real-world ramifications as they grapple with obligations they can’t possibly meet.


3. Furthering Harm vs. Mirroring Absence

You raise an important point: the accused might indeed cause further harm by failing to meet the obligations they've inherited, but this mirrors the reality of the victim’s absence. In this sense:

Realism in Failure: Just as the family and community suffer from the victim’s absence, they may suffer from the accused’s ineptitude. But this reflects the true nature of loss—there’s no simple replacement, and it highlights the irreparable damage caused by taking a life.

Living the Consequences: The accused would come to experience not only the weight of what they’ve done but the ongoing consequences of their own incompetence. Just as the victim’s family must adjust to a life without their loved one, the accused must adjust to a life under the burden of unfamiliar obligations, and every failure they make continues the cycle of suffering.


4. Deterrence Through Complexity

This complexity might act as a deterrent in ways traditional punishments cannot:

Public Failure: The notion of publicly failing at fulfilling someone else’s role could act as a stronger deterrent than prison time or financial penalties, especially since it targets multiple areas of a person's life, such as their reputation, social standing, and financial security.

Inescapable Responsibility: The sheer scope of what would be inherited—from legal cases to financial debt—could create an overwhelming burden that makes the idea of committing such a crime far less appealing. Unlike a finite prison sentence, this is a life-altering, multifaceted punishment that has no clear end, especially if the responsibilities grow in complexity.


5. Philosophical Ramifications:

An Intricate Reflection of Guilt: This punishment method forces the accused into an intricate, ongoing reflection of their guilt. It’s not a clean sentence; they don’t “serve their time” and emerge unscathed. Instead, they are embedded in a web of consequences that mirrors the shattered lives they created. Philosophically, it’s a more continuous form of justice.

Redefining Restitution: Rather than focusing on traditional restitution (like paying for damages or serving a set time), this punishment forces the perpetrator to constantly pay in ways they likely never expected. It’s almost as if they are living inside the ramifications of their crime, continuously “making up for” the victim’s absence, even as they fail.


6. Possibility of Redemption?

Could this complexity also open up a path to redemption or understanding? Perhaps some perpetrators would, through the process of failing and witnessing the damage they cause, gain an unexpected perspective or a sense of accountability:

A Learning Curve: While many would likely fail, some might rise to the occasion, perhaps realizing the scope of their crime and attempting to make amends. Could there be a path where, through this punishment, certain individuals become more aware of their actions and make genuine efforts to restore or repair some of the damage they’ve caused?


In essence, by forcing the accused to live in the aftermath of their crime in such an intense and all-encompassing way, this form of punishment offers something more reflective and perhaps more fitting than traditional capital punishment. It ensures that they experience the devastation of the life they ended in an active and ongoing way.

Would you see a place for rehabilitation in such a system, or is the focus more on prolonged responsibility and the weight of consequence?


---

OP: I think there's room for both. Some may take on the responsibility and end up fulfilling their own life and also making up for the loss, gaining a new perspective.

---

Response:

That balance between responsibility and the potential for rehabilitation adds a rich layer of depth to the idea. By giving room for individuals to potentially rise to the challenge, you're offering a form of punishment that is not purely punitive but also transformative, depending on the person’s response.

1. Path to Rehabilitation:

Earning Redemption: By immersing the accused in the life they took, there’s a pathway for some to come to terms with their crime, work hard to fulfill the obligations they’ve inherited, and, in doing so, gain a greater appreciation for life, responsibility, and societal roles. In a sense, they wouldn’t just be serving a sentence but also working towards redemption.

Learning Through Struggle: The daily struggle of keeping up with obligations they’re unprepared for might push the accused to better themselves, learn new skills, and develop empathy. Success in this would mean they not only serve as restitution for their crime but could even become contributors to society, eventually making amends in a more meaningful way than traditional punishment would allow.


2. The Role of Society in Rehabilitation:

Societal Judgment: In your model, society plays a critical role in the accused’s experience. As they attempt to take on these responsibilities, they are under constant scrutiny from the people around them. Success or failure is judged not by a judge or jury, but by the broader community, creating a kind of social court that evaluates their worthiness for redemption. Those who are genuine in their efforts might find societal support, while those who fail or are indifferent will experience further consequences.

Natural Consequences: If they succeed, the community acknowledges their efforts, offering a natural reintegration into society. If they fail, the consequences (shame, financial ruin, social isolation) come not from a distant legal system but from the very people who suffered from their crime. This makes the punishment feel more personal and community-based.


3. Long-Term Impact on Crime Prevention:

Deterrent for Future Crimes: The complexity and the weight of this punishment could be a powerful deterrent. Knowing they might have to inherit someone’s entire life and struggle to keep it together while facing public judgment might deter many from committing such a crime in the first place. The sheer uncertainty of what they’ll be taking on could be scarier than a definite prison sentence.

Incentivizing Reform: For those who do commit the crime, the possibility of rehabilitating themselves through responsibility gives a glimmer of hope. The idea that they can actively “make things right” might push some to reflect on their actions and become better people, offering society a more productive outcome than mere incarceration or death.


4. Psychological Complexity:

Grappling with Remorse: By taking on the life of their victim, the accused would be confronted daily with the loss they caused. This could lead to genuine remorse, forcing them to reflect deeply on their crime in a way that incarceration doesn’t always facilitate. Living the victim’s life, facing their family, managing their responsibilities—this becomes an ever-present reminder of the wrong they committed.

The Weight of Failure: On the flip side, failure to meet these obligations serves as a powerful psychological consequence. Every bill missed, every job botched, every relationship strained becomes another layer of guilt and failure for the accused to carry, reinforcing the weight of their actions.


5. Ethical Considerations of Rehabilitation and Punishment:

Fairness to the Victim’s Family: Would the victim’s family accept the perpetrator taking on this role? Some might see it as justice, while others may find it unbearable to have the person responsible for their loved one’s death involved in their life, even if indirectly. The system might need mechanisms to ensure that this process respects the boundaries and emotions of the victim’s family.

Proportionality and Human Dignity: The punishment is inherently severe, but it still offers an avenue for reform. Unlike the death penalty, which permanently removes someone, or life in prison, which isolates them from society, this model allows for the possibility of redemption while also ensuring the accused faces the full consequences of their actions. The severity is undeniable, but it doesn’t strip away their humanity entirely.


6. Restorative Justice Through Complexity:

Restoring Balance: In many ways, this system reflects the principles of restorative justice, where the goal isn’t simply to punish but to restore some balance to the harm caused. By taking on the victim’s life, the accused is forced to engage with the broader consequences of their actions in a way that, ideally, leads to a restoration of some of what was lost, even if not perfectly.

Punishment as Participation: Rather than being locked away, the accused becomes an active part of the social system again, albeit in a deeply compromised and challenging role. This model prevents the perpetrator from escaping into a prison system where their life is taken care of; instead, they are thrust into the world, carrying the weight of their actions in a public way.


7. Flexibility and Adaptability in Sentencing:

Different Crimes, Different Burdens: Could this idea be adapted to different kinds of crimes? For instance, in non-lethal cases, could a lesser form of this punishment be applied where the perpetrator has to take on some portion of the victim’s responsibilities, debts, or obligations? It opens up the potential for a more nuanced justice system, where the punishment is tailored not just to the crime but to the specific harms caused.


Conclusion:

This concept fundamentally reshapes the nature of capital punishment and justice. By tying punishment to responsibility and the potential for personal growth, it opens up new possibilities for rehabilitation while maintaining a severe enough consequence to deter future crimes. The active role society plays in this process—judging, witnessing, and possibly supporting—adds layers of accountability and complexity that mirror the real-world impacts of violent crime.

Do you think there should be an endpoint to this punishment, or should the burden be lifelong, as it mirrors the permanent loss caused by the crime? And do you envision any way for the accused to earn some measure of freedom or relief from the responsibilities over time?



---

OP: You keep what you kill. End of story.

---

Response:

Got it. The simplicity and finality of ""You keep what you kill"" encapsulates the core of the concept there are no shortcuts, no external judgments on redemption, just the raw, inescapable consequences of the crime.

**What I have written on the star rating:**

As I have stated, ***no one knows what the STAR rating for this year will bring, because 2026 is a major year for changes***. We allowed for a large range of uncertainties to exist, because we expect CMS to simultaneously try to tweak the STAR rating as well as modify the Quality Bonus Payment / Risk Adjustment Payment to insurers as a result of excessive abuses.

**What happened to Humana:**

10/02/24: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-02/humana-plunges-as-membership-in-high-rating-medicare-plans-drops](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-02/humana-plunges-as-membership-in-high-rating-medicare-plans-drops)

10/02/24: [https://www.wsj.com/business/humana-shares-slide-on-lower-medicare-advantage-ratings-cd6e1267](https://www.wsj.com/business/humana-shares-slide-on-lower-medicare-advantage-ratings-cd6e1267)

The insurer said the share of its customers currently enrolled in plans rated four stars or higher for 2025 is down to 25% from 94% this year. Humana said the rating on a large, national insurance plan that contains 45% of Humana’s enrollment fell a point to 3.5 points.

That ratings drop could equate to a $1.9 billion revenue hit in 2026 before Humana does anything to offset the blow, Leerink Partners analyst Whit Mayo said in a research note.

[**Why is Humana's STAR rating at 3.5 potentially a problem - the Quality bonus payment**](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/2024-07/Quality%20Bonus%20Payments%20in%20Medicare%20Advantage.pdf)

https://preview.redd.it/0p0ja6uiinsd1.png?width=762&format=png&auto=webp&s=39d22b84f09cc6f24c0c29fd763236c265464dd1

This means that the loss of a 4 STAR automatically deducts a 5% benchmark margin. This is why Humana's stock price dropped like a rock. 

[**What the loss of Quality Bonus Payment does to Humana's bottom line:**](https://humana.gcs-web.com/static-files/b99e31f5-0bc8-4f58-9a1f-b80154292f8d)

https://preview.redd.it/harenhfafnsd1.png?width=1032&format=png&auto=webp&s=d95c23deb56560c9b773b30f965906dc5aa9bd4f

This is Humana's 2024 balance sheet. If Humana takes a $1.9 billion dollars of revenue loss in 2024, it DIRECTLY impacts its net income. Basically, the loss of QBP erases almost all of the first half net income for Humana in 2024 before taxes, if this loss is applied to 2024. We still aren't sure what 24Q3 and 24Q4 will bring, but if past history is a guide, by 24Q2 usually \~ 70-80% of the EPS is already realized, and the back half of the year isn't that great for earnings. If this holds true, then we estimate the impact on EPS is potentially massive. This does NOT yet factor what CMS V28 will do to Humana's EPS in 2025/2026. This is just a projected estimate of loss of QBP to Humana's EPS in 2024, with only 33% of CMS V28.

**What are Humana's next steps:**

1. Appeal to CMS - Humana says its loss in STAR rating is due to it narrowly missing 1 metric. This appeal is basically asking CMS take pity on Humana - ""look teacher, I just need 1 point to get an A, I PROMISE I will be a GREAT student from this point onwards"". Except Humana took CMS's money for a joyride by faking diagnosis, so I don't think CMS will oblige - ""don't fuck with me bro"" style. 

2. Decrease benefits to offset premium loss - this will obviously lose market share

3. Sue CMS - like Elevance did. The problem with this one is that Elevance sued by stating the Tukey guardrail removal didn't comply with Administrative Procedure Act, which basically means the government has to tell you what it is doing before it does what it says it will do. CMS messed up and forgot to mention the Tukey guardrail removal for a single year, and Elevance pounced on that. In this case, Humana can't use the same logic - CMS has every right to determine the STAR rating - and those STAR ratings have been published before the STAR rating assessment occurred. Humana needs to file its suit in Texas - I think those government haters might take the case.

**Lastly: we told you all so**

[Yea bro! It is IMPOSSIBLE for Humana to eat a bag of XYZ because...???](https://preview.redd.it/1mfni91tnnsd1.png?width=832&format=png&auto=webp&s=38081801e6964bdd63deb7bb4c55c555b9008c3f)

Thank you for taking the time to read through this. I hope this fact checking exercise prove to be amusing and educational. Please let us know of any improvements we can make to our series, and we hope you enjoyed this!

Sincerely

1fvrzhe,6,2024-10-04,Has anyone tried a rubric like this to counter AI use?,u/Adventurekitty74,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1fvrzhe/has_anyone_tried_a_rubric_like_this_to_counter_ai/,"My institution says if you dock a student points for cheating you have to file an academic misconduct report. This system works okay when you have a handful of cases. 

Sure the report is an online form, easy enough, but you also need to meet with the student individually and that takes a lot of time if it’s more than a few. If the student appeals you have to present to a committee designed to fail because the burden of proof is on the professor.

I have situations now where I have 50 or 100 students who are cheating weekly on coded projects. A few cases are classic plagiarism - copied another’s work - but now we also have misused ChatGPT and copied another students GPT’d code. We say in the syllabus and often in-class don’t use it because this is a foundations course. It’s running with scissors for you. 

Considering making the rubric on all future assignments maybe 50 points for convincing me through your use of problem solving and code that does not misuse AI/online resources. Then 50 percent for everything else. If it’s part of the rubric surely I can dock points if my checks flag the code? Would still submit academic misconduct forms for egregious cases. Students who want to argue their grade still could too, but then the burden of proof is on them and I can go back to being a teacher instead of this awful either punish everyone or no one choice currently in place. 

The issue to reiterate is that current policies were not designed for AI use and there is no middle ground more reasonable to manage available policy wise.

Think it might work?

The biggest breakthrough of the last month has to be the release of the o1 model from OpenAI. Even though it is a closed-source model.

The answer is both yes and no. Read the full article here.

# OpenAI releases o1, its first model with ‘reasoning’ abilities

ChatGPT Plus and Team users get access to both o1-preview and o1-mini starting today, while Enterprise and Edu users will get access early next week. OpenAI says it plans to bring o1-mini access to all the free users of ChatGPT but hasn’t set a release date yet. Developer access to o1 is *really* expensive: In the API, o1-preview is $15 per 1 million input tokens, or chunks of text parsed by the model and $60 per 1 million output tokens. For comparison, GPT-4o costs $5 per 1 million input tokens and $15 per 1 million output tokens.

# MORE OpenAI drama

According to The Times and others, OpenAI is undergoing a significant transition as it seeks to become more appealing to external investors. This includes a shift towards becoming a for-profit business and potentially raising one of the largest funding rounds in recent history, which could increase its valuation to around $150 billion. Despite this, multiple high ranking employees resigned last week, including Chief Technical Officer [Mira Murati](https://x.com/miramurati/status/1839025700009030027), Chief Research Officer [Bob McGrew](https://x.com/bobmcgrewai/status/1839099787423134051), and VP of Research [Barret Zoph](https://x.com/barret_zoph/status/1839095143397515452).

Despite this, multiple high ranking employees resigned last week, including Chief Technical Officer [Mira Murati](https://x.com/miramurati/status/1839025700009030027), Chief Research Officer [Bob McGrew](https://x.com/bobmcgrewai/status/1839099787423134051), and VP of Research [Barret Zoph](https://x.com/barret_zoph/status/1839095143397515452). All who departed posted messages statements stating they are resigning to explore new opportunities or take a break, and are totally supportive of OpenAI.

I'm currently writing this at 2:31 am, and so many things are going through my head right now its insane. I'm a first year student in engineering and currently in 6 lectures. I dont understand how people are able to continously study and grind every single day and not get burnt out. I have a girlfriend, a part-time job, and have so many friends and family who have high expectations and believe in me, yet I don't have that in myself to do all of this. I did somewhat decent enough in my highschool classes that I was fortunate enough to get into univeristy and pursue engineering, but I don't even know if I can do it. I have so many people believing in me, rooting for me, confident in me, but I dont see it in myself to even do all of this, and I don't want to let them down just because I'm lazy or that I just don't feel like doing it. I don't even know how to study all of these subjects at once, I don't know how to study effectively without wasting anytime, and I find myself constantly using chatgpt or any AI tools to help me do my assignments just so I can breathe for a second. And I hate myself for that, I hate how I'm constantly using these tools to help me, I hate that I'm genuinely not learning anything. I feel so behind, I feel so lost, I'm gonna crashout. On top of all of this, I don't want to let my parents down and I feel ashamed for even telling them about this because I don't want to disappoint them, I don't want them to see that I'm struggling because they have done so much for me that I don't want to burden them, also we come from an asian country, and its difficult to talk about stuff like this. At this point, I'm not even learning anything, I'm just pretending because I'm not learning anything whatsoever, but with things due every single day, assignments, quizes, homework, and reviewing notes, it doesn't seem that I have enough time to sit down and learn. I don't know any effective studying methods, nothing seems to be working, I end up writing notes for my classes for hours but then get burnt out in the end, I barely get any sleep. I don't know how to properly study for mid-terms which are coming up next week for my csc and linear algebra class. I just don't know, I don't even know what to do, how to get myself back on track, how to take care of my health, and just managing my time in general, but I don't want to disappoint everybody I love, I just dont even know anymore, I came here to rant tbh."

Questions I'd love to get answered:

* I understand Northwestern and Johns Hopkins are crazy with acceptances, since I would also be applying for Aid, are there any chances of getting in?
* Where should I ED into where I get aid also?
* Any schools I should look into adding/removing? I was thinking of adding UMich as a reach
* Can I get into atleast one of my reaches? I don't really have high expectations. I see incredibly talented students getting rejected so I really have no clue.
* Do I submit my 3 on ap physics?
* Anything I need to switch order-wise on my EC list? anything I should take out/put in?"

**1057 angel number meaning & symbolism**



1057 angel number meaning is spirituality and personal development. The symbolism might be angel numbers but any other form that represent a tight connection between a person and God or divine spirits and nature.



The angels are sending you repeating sequences so you will be able to discover the spiritual path, but more important to know and understand who you are and what is the grand mission you should complete in this lifetime.



Basically you are being asked to see what your strong points are and use them to pursue the ultimate dream or wish. Most of the people have some hidden talent they are not aware of, or maybe they already know it but don’t utilize them from all kinds of reasons:



Maybe they are afraid to employ the power, or from failure or from gossip and bad comments, they might not believe in their selves or just prefer to do something else. The angels are sending you 1057 angel number and might express other numerical digits like: [1056](https://www.reddit.com/r/freepsychicreadings4u/comments/1fv8ru1/1056_angel_number_meaning_your_spiritual_guardian/), 1058, 1059, 1100, 1101, 1102, 1105, 1107, and 1120 in order to carry you forward to self fulfilment.



The symbolism is a combination between trusting the divine and also taking action. If you vision and manifest all day but don’t use certain steps, actions and deed than nothing will come to your life. And from the other side, if you will only take an action without having a crystal clear aim or a guide, guru or oracle to direct you, than you will never reach the goal. You are wasting time and walking in circle just to come back to square one again.



When you see angel number 1057 it means that you have knowledge, personality, instinct and psychic power to feel the situation. Basically you can guide yourself and solve any problem. But always remember – thoughts and feelings alone will not be manifested, there is a requirement to have courage and to hustle in smart way.



Some people are born with the natural tendency to jump right into the situation. They don’t have any fear in their hearts. For others it just doesn’t come easy. If this is the situation with you, the number 1057 symbolize the demand to have more self esteem.



How can you beat the fear? Do the deeds without thinking about it too much, decide to step out of the comfort zone, seek the adventure and the unknown destiny, take deep breathe and meditate. Most crucial is to face the truth, admit you have the fear and conquer it.



You need to be at your best and perform in excellence because a surprise is over the horizon. You should also be an example to others especially if you have a position as a leader at work place, or head of a family or any important role in the community.



During that pace many will show their doubts and be unsupportive so don’t listen to them, don’t let them damage your enthusiasm. Take the power from those who give you positive support. There will be rivals, be a gentleman don’t get into nasty competitions and for sure, don’t cheat. Keep on going with the head up and with pride in the heart.



**1057 angel number love meaning**



1057 angel number love meaning is to find or be with an interesting person. If you are in relationship, married or engaged and it doesn’t goes as you expected in the past is because the partner doesn’t excite you anymore. And on the contrary if everything is perfect it is because you two are a twin flame and are doing fascinating stuff.



For singles it is a time of adventure, don’t settle down too fast or for the first person you meet. Go to multiple dates and experience different kind of people. The angels are always directing you to the perfect match so don’t compromise because good fortune will come eventually. You should be at peace with the decision of who is going to be the soulmate.



In love you shouldn’t play games and hide, on the contrary, you should speak the truth and be honest. Manipulating is not the right way to live in a relationship or any other kind of situation. Instead, put the energy elsewhere, where you can grow together with the partner, have children and teach them values. Don’t be a destroyer, be a creator.



1057 angel number is about being opened emotionally and not closed. You might have been hurt in the past but it doesn’t mean that it will happen again, you should trust people or at least give them a chance to prove that they are worthy. If you won’t realize it soon, you might find yourself isolated without any connections. People don’t attracted to outcasts, form their point of view, if someone doesn’t have social circle it mean he or she aren’t ready for a relationship or that no one wants to be beside them and there must be a good reason why they don’t.



In love the specific number symbolizes the tendency to be alone. You could be a single man or woman who likes to be free and not to commit to serious connection. Or if you are in a marriage or already found a twin flame, you want to be left alone by your own self from time to time. Another alternative might be people who don’t care too much about relationships and from their point of you they can be singles til their last day on earth.



It can also denote high standards and huge expectations from the spouse, so it is very nice to have dreams, hopes and vision for the perfect future, but in the end you should also be real and understand that nothing will be perfect or exactly as you wish. Don’t set yourself to disappointment.



If you are a man who keeps seeing 1057 angel number, it means you are a leader in the romantic connection. However you are not warm, you are bit cold, logic and calculated. As a woman 1057 angel number denotes a successful person that knows how to represent herself in work, romance, family and any other situations. You have deep fears of losing lovers over small arguments and you are trying to do all the best you can.



**1057 angel number twin flame meaning**



1057 angel number twin flame meaning is a difficult and long road to find twin flame. When you keep on seeing angel number 1057 it means you have lots of value and what to offer to the other side regarding romance, love and long term relationship.



So if you have all those positive traits why are you still alone? Because you have too high standards, you have a long list of demands and requirements from the twin flame. It makes the whole process of dating and finally settling down very complicate and more likely to be impossible.



Because of these reasons you might find yourself single for life, jumping from one relationship to another and feel that no one truly understand you or would like to stick around more than usual. So if you are fine with the situation it shouldn’t be any problem. However for those who want to find a twin flame and create family with kids it is going to be a struggle.



But when you do find a special someone who is the perfect twin flame than everything is going smooth. When seeing 1057 angel number it means that the right person is going to enter to the surrounding. This person will be someone who will challenge you, it won’t be so easy at first. There will be many moments of doubts, you will ask your self why am I with this man or woman, why we are so different. But if you will make it and go through all the process you two will find the common ground.



When we need vacation or a bit time alone, 1057 might appear and usually as time on the watch or clock, it will look in this format: 10:57, 3 minutes before 11:00. It doesn’t mean to leave the current relationship, it is a symbol of freedom and exploration. Remember that in the end you should go back to your spouse and be with him or her. It symbolizes the urge for small break before we are moving on to the next big step in our romantic chapter.



1057 is also an omen of being closed. Learn how to be more opened, flexible and compassionate when it comes to the matter of the heart. Your twin flame might think you are too cold, distance or don’t want to be with him or her if you will keep on acting like this. You should tell them more about your life, work, hobbies, feelings and dreams as well.



The number is also representing knowledge and therefore you usually tend to seek twin flame who is smart in various ways. Otherwise you will get bored and feel that the relationship is stagnating. You can move forward only with people you think are smart and meaningful. If you find a person that would like to party all day long, than it will not be an appropriate match, not now and maybe not in the future too.



**1057 angel number spiritual meaning**



1057 angel number spiritual meaning is to explore psychic abilities and the supernatural realm. You should seek the simple life, be minimalist and modest. Enjoy the little things and strive to be more connected with the energy of the cosmos.



The modern world doesn’t always do you good karma. Of course there are benefits to live as we do now rather than hundreds or thousands years ago but still we lost the basic connection to nature and to the divine while we are getting too smart and technological. The angels want to remind you that we are still people with souls and not robots with electronic circuits inside.



With the right amount of Zen spirituality you can balance these two opposite notions and in fact live at harmony with both sides. There is no right or wrong, it is just a question of how to use everything around to our own benefit without paying a deadly price.



The spiritual path of number 1057 will take you to high levels in which you will become a guru or an oracle. You will have the power to be a leader in this field and create impact on others people lives. Though it will not happen soon because you need to learn a lot before you can have the knowledge and the self confidence needed for the job.



The specific mission is to find the truth not as being a judge but as looking at the hidden secrets behind the universe. You will learn symbolic languages in which you can observe and interact with energies, frequencies and vibrations. Among the methods are: tarot cards, crystal balls, vedic astrology, zodiac signs analysis, angel numbers readings, Ouija board, numerology, pendulum, palm reading and many more.



Choose the right divination techniques you feel more interesting of comfortable with. At first it should be something easy and intuitive. After gaining the crucial experience you can develop the skill to other methods. Keep in mind that learning spirituality may take long time, from months to years to decades and to the whole lifetime.



The main obstacle when it come to spirituality and explained through 1057 angel number sign is over thinking. As a smart person you might caught in an intellectual loop. You try to think of new solutions to problems and it just makes you tired. Moreover it is interfering with spiritual development to a point that it takes all your mental effort. You might have psychic abilities and you don’t even know it because it is all suppressed by logic and intellectual.



It is usually when we have esoteric crisis in life we suddenly discover the world of the divine. Angel number 1057 is all about understanding it before the problem is coming in to our direction.



**1057 angel number bible meaning**



1057 angel number bible meaning is balsam tree, in Hebrew language it called “baka”, and some translate it to English as mulberry tree too. These trees are very high and usually they reach the height of 60 ft, therefore they symbolize reaching the sky, being closed to god, the divine, angels and spirits. In short it is about spirituality and how to climb to the top level of the holiness.



But it might also represent the road to success in other matters of life such as career, love, competitions and even travelling. Even before the bible has been written, 1057 angel number was a sign of success, to be above everyone else and win the glory, fame and fortune. It because it has the digit zero in the middle.



It appears in the biblical Psalms 84:6 where there is a story about a man named “Korah”. He had lots of sons so the interpretation leads us to domestic affairs. So if you see number 1057 its time to put the family at the top of the priority, if you are single it is time to think about marriage and kids, if your twin flame is separating from you than figure out how to create twin flame reunion.



In the bible “Korah” was rebelling against Moses so god sent a fire ball from the sky and punished him and all of his 200 followers. God also made an earthquake to shake and destroy other people who listen to him. Basically they all disappeared in natural disasters caused by the define spirit. However there is no reason to feel fear when you see this sacred number because it is just a reminder to stay on the path. On the contrary, it means that you are going to have good fortune because you are devoting yourself to a special task.



Mulberry trees take lots of time before they grow leaves or flowers so the spiritual meaning is having patience. And when it is the correct time to bloom it happens overnight. So it represents taking the opportunity and having a great time to strike when the moment is perfect for your advantage. The specific kind of tree has long and strong roots in the ground, more often than not they come out to the soil surface and are visible. The roots are usually a danger to pedestrians who don’t notice them while going near.



In the bible and spirituality symbols, roots are the omens of security and stability. They are the basis of what you have or who you are, they are the only thing which will make you stronger in crucial times. If you haven’t prepared for the rainy day, than it will be impractical to overcome the barrier.



**1057 angel number numerology meaning**



1057 angel number numerology meaning is steam from the combination of the digits 0, 1, 5, 7 and 4 which is the sum of all these numbers. When we take all these factors into consideration the ultimate meaning is confidence. But it denotes a fear from change as well.



We all want to predict the future like psychics and to have the wonderful dreams come true. But if we will continue to live the same life or the same day, nothing will change. The reason we don’t get what we want is because we are used to the current situation whether we have good conditions or not.



It might surprise you but many people are stuck in bad condition and don’t want to change it, they think that they deserve less, or maybe they have bad luck, they could lose the hope or think that it is they fatal destiny. However the numerology of 1057 angel number teaches us the opposite. You can change the destiny even if there are weaknesses points, just work of the area in life that needs to be strengthened.



Related numerology sequences are 57, 75, 10, 15, 17, 507, 705, 105, 501, 157, 715, 751, 5071 and 7105. One thing they have in common is how the way you might miss an opportunity. These angels number are very powerful and holds great potential but they also indicate that you think too much before you act.



Gathering information, details and data is a necessary process before coming into conclusion and execute an action. But sometimes we are too obsessed about getting ready and the miracle door of opportunity might shut quickly. It is very similar to a student that learning for a test all day and night. And in the morning he or she is so tired so they stay at bed and miss the test.



Another numerology aspect is not to be afraid of new adventures or if you feel unready. Everyone is doing mistakes it is part of how we learn and upgrade ourselves. If something doesn’t go as we wished than we should leave it or go back. It is a sign to move forward and try from a different angle.



1057 will give you unique inspiration from the angels. They key point is to have new ideas and follow them no matter what happens or what other people says. Prove everyone wrong by doing the right deed for yourself.



The lesson from numerology analysis is that you can not trust anyone. Sure few people want the best for you, but the majority have different motives. You can not blame other from wanting different stuff because we all want something and it is up to us to grab it.

FAIR WARNING: There's a lot to read 😅 sorry. 

Hey guys, I posted this a little while back, but I've since had a few moments of inspiration which have led to me rewriting several aspects of the story, so I figured I'd repost it and see what comes of it. 

Long story short, this will start off in a magic academy. The world is similar to modern day earth, but with Arcano-tech (technology combined/powered by magic).

Some examples of the tech include; 
*Crystal phones that contain several spell scripts (basically apps) that do a variety of things like games, messaging, calls, etc, that also require recharging. Just like a regular smartphone but magic.
*Cars that harness elementals in place of fossil fuels.
*Factories operated by constructs and war forged.
*And Airships that are powered by powerful lightning crystals.

Though this is a modernized world, most countries still have kings and whatnot, though it's a vastly more political of a process. More world info will be provided before we start. The important thing to know is you can be anything. Literally anything. Exalted princess of the elven territories? Go for it. Illegitimate daughter, born of the affair between Zeus and a llama he fancied? Zeus was into some weird stuff, so fire away. A goblin champion fighter with the furry of a full grown Goliath? Bring it on! Any race, any lineage. Complete creative leniency. 

Pick any element you like from the 6, just lemme know ahead of time unless you want to narrate your own initiation. 

Finally, my rules are simple. 

1: 18+. I'm over 18, and I have a daughter. Even if nothing happens, I don't risk private conversations with minors. Sorry. 

2: I don't ask for a specific word or line count, only that you give me enough information to respond to.

3: If there are any subjects you aren't comfortable with, tell me immediately. I will occasionally use some themes that may be triggering to some people, so please tell me ahead of time what bothers you so I can avoid it. 

4: This is not really a rule but I'm throwing it out there. Romance is optional but preferred. I just find it adds more drama. 

I also prefer to do this on another platform, simply because the messaging system of Reddit has been unreliable for me in the past. If you have any questions, or if you're interested, please message me or comment. And without further ado, we move onwards to the story. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There is a change on the horizon. One that threatens all that we know. Truths shared throughout time are fading into myth. Even that which has been proven, beyond any doubt, is being challenged. There are many who feel this change, reshaping the foundations of what we know. However, though they feel the coming storm they do nothing... As if ignoring it will prevent the rain from falling, or the lightning from cracking the skies... How foolish they are... Whether they choose to believe it or not, change is not coming. 

It is here.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It was a sunny, cool, autumn day at the Arkayus Institute for Magic. Leaves, turned by the change of the season, clung desperately to the final strands that held them aloft. A cool breeze, teased at them, tempting them to fall and sending a shiver up unsuspecting passer-bys who were not yet dressed warmly enough for the cool weather. Yet despite this discomfort, they marched onward, undeterred from their mission. Today was the initiation day after all. Dozens of new students, each one having recently experienced their magical awakening upon their 18th birthday, eagerly flooded into the school, ready to finally learn their element and magic.

As the students filed into the Grand Hall of the academy, several professors began bringing out padded pedestals and 10 large, foggy crystal orbs, which were placed atop their own individual pedestal. A deep unrest spread through the crowd as their thunderous chatter was quickly reduced to hushed murmuring. Many students knew what these orbs were, and those who didn't were quickly brought up to speed by the excited whispers of those around them. These were Threnzelheim Orbs. Though archaic in design, these dwarven crafted orbs served as the most common way to identify a person's elemental affinity, and gauge a rough estimation for how much Arcane Energy they had in their bodies. While they weren't the most complex or precise device for the job, they were fast and reliable. The perfect tool for identifying large groups of people at a time. 

Once the orbs were in place, a man who appeared to be as old as time itself, strode out onto a balcony overlooking the new students, causing a deafening wave of silence to wash over the students. Many rumors circulated about the headmaster of this academy, but they all made one thing very clear. He was a very powerful mage, and his mere presence commanded the full attention of everyone in the room. Yet, despite his reputation, when he spoke there was nothing but gentle warmth and kindness in his voice.

""Hello, and congratulations to each new student that stands here today. I am Headmaster Arkayus, and it is my great pleasure to welcome each of you, and to act as your guide as we delve into the world of the arcane.  It has always been a subject of interest to me, seeing how magic connects us and brings us together. There is no system, nor machine, nor way of predicting who in this world will awaken. There are factors that some believe will better your chances. But despite those factors, the gift of the arcane may yet still elude someone. Conversely, even one of humble, entirely non magical lineages, can experience the awakening. Look around you, and you will see just what I mean. Sons and daughters of powerful magical families standing beside the sons and daughters of simple working folk. Because of this, I've found that there is only one way to accurately explain why someone has magic. Each one of you was chosen. Chosen by the arcane to wield it as a light in the dark, a sword against the wicked, or a shield for the weak. Though we wield an awesome and terrifying power, our service is first and foremost, to people. We are the lucky chosen who stand, not above, but below. Lifting our communities and our fellow people to greater heights. It is a long and difficult path to walk, but as I look out at each of you I truly believe that, with guidance, the world will be in good hands. Today marks the first step of your journey. Today you will learn if you have an affinity to Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Light, Or Dark, and from there you will learn to harness your Arcane Energy to create spells. I wish each of you good luck in all your endeavors going forward. And never forget. Through the arcane, and a little creativity, each one of you can shape the world.""

As he finished his speech, the other professors began separating students into 10 even lines, forming each one in front of an orb. Looking around, it was clear the Headmaster was right in saying that it was a mixed group. Though the majority seemed to be the powerful or wealthy elite, there was even a prince, few and far between the were those that clearly came from a lower class. Regardless of status in the outside works though, every soul in those ten line were made equal. 

Finally, with a wave of the Headmasters hand, the lines began to move and It didn't take long for the Grand Hall to be lit in a dazzling display of color from each of the ten Orbs. Each one showed a color to reflect the current students elemental affinity, and the brightness of the orbs glow gave a visual representation of that student's Arcane Energy levels. 

The colors that each orb showed were briefly explained to each student as they approached. Red was Fire, Blue was Water, Grey was Air, and Green was Earth. It was also made known that Yellow meant an affinity for Light, and Purple meant an affinity for Dark. However, Light and Dark were the rarest elemental affinities. So rare, in fact, they were often described as the elements of the gods. So while the hall was lit in brilliant displays of reds, blues, greens, and greys, neither Yellow nor purple ever shined. 

That was until the Prince of Alùngrad, Prince Halcyon, approached his orb and placed his hand upon it. A hush fell upon the crowd, even before he touched the orb. Many were curious about the young prince. Most were looking to size up an adversary, or scope out a potential ally, while some fanatically eyed him, praying to catch his eye long enough to one day be his queen. Yet none expected what would happen as his hand touched the orb. Radiant pale yellow light erupted from the orb, illuminating the stunned features on the prince's face. The professors quickly congratulated him, took down his information, and sent him off to a separate room from the rest of the attendees. This was a necessary precaution, to allow him some time to collect his thoughts before releasing him back to the hungry sharks that were his fellow students.

Regardless, out of all the students who were amazed by the prince, one seemed far less concerned. While hopeful suitors fawned over the Prince, and eager descendents of politicians plotted their inclusion into the prince's inner circle, a simple looking boy looked forward, unless by the display as he was far more interested in learning his own element. 

Despite most everyone else wearing some form of formal attire, his clothes were better described as work clothes. Black jeans, boots, and flannel shirt unbuttoned to show a simple white T-shirt beneath. His name was Cassius Tarron and he was a farmer, as was his whole family.  A simple living that was swiftly interrupted upon his 18th birthday when Cassius had his own magical awakening and was promptly located and invited to attend the Arkayus Institute for Magic. Over night, Cassius' entire life was placed in a suitcase and shipped off, along with himself, to study magic. 

Though he was excited to learn his element, he wasn't nearly as concerned for what it was. While some of the other students prattled on about ""I come from a fire family, I couldn't possibly expect any less!"" Or ""my family runs the Eastern Shipping Company. Wind or Water magics are the only ones that make any sense!"", Cassius found himself simply thinking about the life he's going to be able to give his family after he learns magic. Even simple town mages get paid handsomely. More than enough to give his family an early retirement.

But if there's one thing that is certain in life, it is that life is uncertain, and the universe works in strange ways. In much the same way as his sudden gift, Cassius couldn't possibly know the scope of what was to come, or the role that he would play. None of the students did. But a storm was brewing just over the horizon, and sure as the sun will set, each student would play a role in the coming rain. "

In much the same way as his sudden gift, Cassius couldn't possibly know the scope of what was to come, or the role that he would play. None of the students did. But a storm was brewing just over the horizon, and sure as the sun will set, each student would play a role in the coming rain. "
1fw2083,4,2024-10-04,Is it bad if I use an online calculator for my calculus 2 homework problems?,u/SqueakyCheeseCurds48,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1fw2083/is_it_bad_if_i_use_an_online_calculator_for_my/,"So the syllabus for this class specifically states that we can use online tools and collab with other students when working on our homework, so I don't think it'd be an academic integrity issue. After all, our homework isn't even graded on correctness, just completeness and we don't even get feedback on our answers. Still, we need to learn the problems properly if we want to do well on exams or quizzes, so I use my graphing calculator or online integral calculators to double check my answers and see what problems I got wrong so I can go back and try to work through them again until I get the right answer. I stay away from ChatGPT however because I just don't trust it much at all.

This has been working quite well for me so far and I am currently have a grade of 97% ish. Since the quizzes are based on homework problems (which are about 30 problems a week), I usually score pretty highly on them since I remember all the answers. When I mentioned that I use online tools to another student, however, they said that it was a bad idea since I should be learning to do all this by myself and I won't learn as much this way.  

  
I thought that I was learning just fine because while I might remember the correct answers, I still have to show all my work and know how to work through the problems to get full points. What do you guys think?"

My finals are in a few weeks time. The final examination will be a written examination. I see that they will give us the main method, expected console output and students are expected to implement various methods or code on different portion. E.g. for OOP, the base class is normally given and not code simple things such as the getters/setters.

The topics range from fundamental programming, object oriented and Spring. Spring is huge so they having taught us Spring JPA, Spring MVC using Hibernate and Thymeleaf. There are a tonne of things to understand from Spring itself.

Considering that I have shortage of time, should I continue to reverse engineer my current learning? There isn't really a lot of time to fully grasp the concepts that they teach.

I have been using ChatGPT and slowly redoing the question until I am able to fully do the question without any assistance.

We are allowed to bring reference paper because it is an open book exam. From my understanding, lecturer really expect us to understand the concepts.  
E.g. Inheritance, Polymorphism, Spring JPA, Spring MVC and implementing the code for the Controllers given a certain feature."

*Throw Away Account Because All My Friends Have My Original Account*

I (25F) am studying for my MBBS (Medicine) and recently married my boyfriend (27M) of five years. We had planned to get married after he could move to the States for work, so I could focus on finishing my degree and starting my career without traditional pressures. My in-laws come from a very orthodox background where men are expected to work and women stay home. To avoid those expectations, we wanted to wait.

However, my parents emotionally blackmailed me into marrying earlier, using lines like “What will people think?” and “You’re embarrassing us by delaying.” So, I gave in and married earlier than we wanted.

Now, I’m living with my husband’s joint family while continuing my studies. This includes not just my husband and me, but also his parents, his aunt and uncle, his brother (cousin) and sister-in-law, and his grandmother. My father-in-law, mother-in-law, and brother-in-law have been incredibly supportive—they treat me like their own daughter and sister, and they respect that I’m pursuing my medical degree. But my SIL (30F), BIL’s wife, along with my FIL’s brother and his wife, and especially my husband’s grandma (80F), have been making things difficult for me.

SIL seems jealous that I’m still studying, and she constantly throws passive-aggressive remarks my way, saying things like, “Not everyone can be lucky enough to have people support their little career dreams.” It’s clear she resents that I have ambitions outside of marriage, and that jealousy shows every chance she gets. But grandma is the worst. She keeps pushing the idea that I should prioritize being a good wife over my education. It’s always something like, “Women who don’t focus on their home will never be respected.” I’ve been holding it in for months, but last night was the breaking point.

I came home exhausted after a long day at the hospital, and grandma immediately started up with her usual criticisms. But this time, she crossed the line. She said, “Why are you wasting your time studying so much? No one’s going to respect you for thinking you’re better than your husband’s family. You’re just trying to make yourself feel important. Maybe that’s why your parents forced you to marry—they knew you’d fail otherwise.”

That comment was the last straw. I snapped and yelled at her. I told her she had no right to speak to me that way and that I wasn’t going to give up my education or dreams just because she had outdated views about a woman’s role. My husband, to his credit, immediately backed me up, telling his grandma to stop, but she just kept going. My FIL, MIL, and BIL tried to calm things down, but it was a mess.

After the fight, my husband didn’t say anything to me. He just stayed by my side, which I appreciated, but I felt guilty about causing such a big scene. I figured things would calm down after that, but a little while later, my SIL came into the room with her usual toxic energy. She said, “You know, you really embarrassed us all today. Just because you’re ‘educated’ doesn’t mean you can disrespect an elder. Maybe you should start focusing on being a wife instead of a student—it’s not like you’re going to work after all this, right?” Her words stung, and it’s clear she enjoys seeing me upset.

It Currently 2:40 am and I’m torn. I do feel bad for losing my temper, especially at an elderly woman, but grandma’s words were so hurtful. I’ve been dealing with so much emotional pressure from both sides of the family. I just couldn’t hold it in anymore, I feel I may have crossed a line and ruined my husbands relationship with his grandma.

Also my english is bad so I used chatgpt to improve my writing.

So, AITA for yelling at my husband’s grandma and causing a fight in the family?"
1fwbmw6,11,2024-10-04,Ideas to make AGI,u/greenray009,ArtificialInteligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1fwbmw6/ideas_to_make_agi/,"Hello! I’m a 4th-year computer science student with a background in intelligent systems, machine learning, and a bit of deep learning, graphics computing, and data mining. I’ve noticed a lot of hype around AI, but it seems that most of the focus is on scaling up existing models like transformers or neural networks (RNN, CNN, ANN), which largely mimic human neural systems.

While we’ve seen exciting developments with generative AI models such as GANs, VAEs, and Diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion), I feel these approaches still feel lacking to me or they fall short. The main issue is that they’re inherently biased due to the datasets they’re trained on and the architecture itself. To truly move towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), I think we need to make fundamental leaps in our understanding of knowledge representation and intelligence itself.

One area I find particularly intriguing is the role of tokenization in building large language models (LLMs). By assigning weights and embeddings to words, we create a form of context representation, which is a step in the right direction. But even with this progress, it’s clear that our models are just approximations - that they don’t have a real *understanding* of the world.

From what I’ve read in some research papers, one proposed path to AGI is to map and mimic a person’s brain at a much deeper level, incorporating elements of consciousness and self-awareness. However, this is more speculative and far from feasible at the moment. To achieve true AGI, I believe we need a new paradigm—a breakthrough in our understanding of intelligence that goes beyond merely scaling up neural networks or refining architectures.

My gut suggests that companies should focus more on the field of knowledge representation and transfer. Basically going back to the basics of information theory. And I think some of the techniques related to this are applied to deep learning but I felt like we needed more like a breakthrough.

This is why I suspect we might be heading towards another AI winter. Historically, when AI research failed to produce expected breakthroughs, it led to reduced funding and enthusiasm like in the early 70s I guess. We might see this again unless a revolutionary discovery occurs. But I’m curious to hear others’ thoughts on this. Do you think we’re close to such a paradigm shift, or are we still stuck at the stage of refining what we already know?"
1fwe3vh,20,2024-10-04,"OCS Outline, Week by Week",u/Encheiridion,ArmyOCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArmyOCS/comments/1fwe3vh/ocs_outline_week_by_week/,"I jotted down notes each week I was in OCS and have sat on them for the last eight months, but since I've been replying to people here for some time I figured I would post about my experience. This is not exhaustive, events will get switched around from week to week in your class as leadership refines the course, the inclusion of Holiday Block Leave is a big difference for the October class from others, and I'm sure certain things have changed since I graduated with Bravo Company. Hopefully, this will be of assistance to some of you, especially as the upcoming class this month was the same that I entered into.

FYI,[ this thread ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArmyOCS/comments/13mrzdg/the_full_and_complete_guide_to_ocs_this_is/)was very useful to many of the O9S candidates I went to BCT with for a perspective on the OCS experience, so if there's anything missing here you should read that as well. I'm also happy to answer any questions you may have.

**Week 0**

I arrived before the requested time on a Friday afternoon via POV from my basic training installation. Student leadership checked everyone in, assigning rooms at HHT for those who got there early. GOV travelers and those who arrived later received rooms at our actual company. Our second evening there we received a brief from the commander reiterating rules and expectations. Chow then sleep.

Next day we received a three-hour pass to get the complete packing list and sort out any other issues we needed to. 

**Week 1**

Monday began with an ACFT. This first ACFT will not be listed on the (outdated) 2022 SOP but is purely diagnostic, so you can phone it in if you like.

That Thursday we had the gold-to-black phase up event, which was pretty fun to be honest. You run around with a bunch of MRE boxes, water jugs, and ammo cans, then reassemble them while cadre yell at you. You also flip some tires and climb some ropes, then finish up with a low crawl across the field. The ratty black ascot cadre hands you makes it all worth it. One person was a heat casualty on this event, and another got sick beforehand and never made it. Both got recycled.

The rest of the week is in-processing and mandatory lectures on things like SHARP, EO, etc.

**Week 2**

Week 2 is land nav prep week. Classroom lecture from 9-5 interrupted only by chow. You will learn how to shoot an azimuth, hold your compass properly, pace count, and so on. This will be boring if you can already do land nav but make sure to pay attention and not fall asleep to avoid a spot report. You will also receive instruction from Dr. Campbell in battle analysis, which will be tested in week 4.

**Week 3**

The first real field exercise happened in the third week with land navigation. This takes place over three and a half days in the following sequence:

1. Day 1: day and night with cadre-led groups, night with a buddy team
2. Day 2: day with a buddy team, night solo pre-test
3. Day 3: day solo pre-test, night solo test
4. Day 4: day solo test

If you pass the night and day pre-tests, you don’t have to go out again for the actual test days. You’re allowed to if you want to better your score, but it was raining this week so I was happy with my passes. Night fails a lot of people, predictably, since using artificial light for anything but reading a map is forbidden. A couple people got recycled for cheating here.

Be warned that the cadre-led lanes do not approximate how hard the actual lanes will be; most points they pick are directly off of a trail, whereas your points might be 300-400m into the woods along a stream bed. The difficulty of your experience is entirely dependent on where the chips fall for your lane.

The full Red Diamond course was used for lanes, but each lane used either the pizza slice or the shield portions, not both. You shouldn’t worry about having to run from one end of the course to the other during your lane, but you should expect to use both at some point during your time at Red Diamond. Hopefully, you will be able to get some practice time on both before going out for the pre-tests.

23 people had to retest, including a few recycles from the company ahead of us, and about 5 failed the Friday retests. 

**Week 4**

This was a short week on account of the Thanksgiving holiday, but it was packed with four graduation events: the 4-mile run, the 6-mile ruck, a battle analysis essay, and a call for fire exam. 

The 4-mile run needs to be completed in 36 minutes and should be easy for anyone with the level of fitness required to complete OCS. Many people, however, will fail. The 6-mile ruck is equally easy. Just make sure the ruck is packed with at least 36-37 pounds of dry weight instead of the 35 required in the SOP to ensure it makes weight; cadre will weigh every ruck at the conclusion of the event and give out spot reports for underweight rucks. 

The battle analysis essay should take about an hour to complete with word counts and cleaning up. It’s not hard, just remember to do everything by the book and not forget any of the elements listed in the rubric. 

The week practically ended Wednesday night for the Thanksgiving four-day. Although we were still in black phase at this time, the commander pulled some strings and allowed us to order food to the footprint and gave us a pass to go to the PX for haircuts and lunch. Still no caffeine, unfortunately.

**Week 5**

Week 5 was all about preparing and then presenting squad-level OPORDs. You’ll take a class and then go in for two hours to prepare your squad-level OPORD from a platoon-level OPORD template. Our class had to prepare a squad attack on an enemy position with a bravo team assault and an alpha team SBF. The cadre will give you a shell to work from and you have to fill it in, but the exam is open book and anything the cadre uploaded to Teams is fair game for study. We had the paper platoon OPORD plus a sample squad OPORD, the latter was very helpful in building out your own OPORD. The classes don’t prepare you very well for what it’s supposed to look like, but once it gels in your mind it will make a lot of sense how it’s laid out. Cadre then takes the OPORD away from you and you won’t get it back until it’s time for you to present it to them live over 20 minutes.

Pay close attention to the details in your COA sketch, since this will be the only thing you are required to post up during your presentation, especially to TRPs and phase lines. A couple guys had to redo their presentations because their sketches didn’t have either and the cadre believed this would lead to fratricide. 

It will all seem rather stupid in the moment but in hindsight it was good preparation for the STX lanes that came the week after. All you will be doing out there is the exact same thing, except instead of cadre you will be briefing your squad an OPORD you adapt from a cadre template and a FRAGO they give you.

Making an OPORD isn’t hard, but two people did get recycled for messing theirs up.

We also did WTBDs for the M4, M240B, M249, and the radio. Not hard to do, but take the time to practice these as you get 50 OML points total and you can practice as much as you want before officially testing them with cadre. 

**Week 6**

Week 6 is the “Superbowl” of OCS: STX. You go out in the woods and conduct the same attack you briefed in the prior week on eight different objectives. In winter, we were able to do no more than 5 lanes a day, but spring or summer will have more daylight hours and you will likely have to do more lanes. This week will be the most taxing for student leadership, who will have to keep track of the many squads out in the field plus the people pulling duty as gate guards, equipment guards in the student TOC, ammo guards, night fire guard, and so on. It will also be taxing for you as the non-leadership OC who will have to pull one or more of these duties per day. Food is MREs for breakfast and lunch, which you will pack with you out on the lanes, and hot As for dinner.

At this point in early December, it was also very cold. Nighttime temps could drop into the low 30s or high 20s, so make sure you have shit to keep warm with. Some of the new LTs that served with cadre had to do a class in the summertime, so personally, I found freezing my ass off to be better than sweating my balls off. Hygiene will be hard out here, and you certainly won't sweat much in the winter.

The lanes themselves are repetitive and are only really stressful if you are being graded as the squad leader. The only way you will fail these lanes, even with a tough grader, will be if fratricide occurs **under your command**, you get lost and never make it back to the objective in time, or you shit the bed over the entire course of the lane and don’t get enough points (out of everyone who tested, no one failed for this final reason). 

What do I mean by fratricide under your command? During the attack portion of the lane, the squad leader will be attached to Bravo team and will have to signal to Alpha team to shift fire when Bravo reaches the first phase line and then lift fire when it reaches the second phase line. These shifts and lifts must be confirmed by Alpha before Bravo continues to advance on the objective. If you as the squad leader don’t make the call to shift/lift **and** don’t wait to advance until Alpha confirms them, you may have committed fratricide and will get a no go. However, if your team leaders commit fratricide but you as squad leader make the proper commands, you will not get a no go. 

Running the lanes as a team leader carries less responsibility and consequently less stress. As Alpha leader, you are responsible for frontal security, finding the route to the objective, and setting up the SBF position for the attack. If you’re bad at land nav this may be hard, but all the objectives are within 300 meters of the start point and the OPFOR probably won’t attack you unless you walk right into them. Bravo team leader is the easiest job to have, since all you have to do is sit around until you’re told what to do and then assault through the objective in the attack phase. Team leader positions can be pretty fun so enjoy the two looks you get when you have them.

If you’re not a SL, ATL, or BTL, you sit around for 2/3 of the lane while these three figure out what to do. It gets pretty boring, but you’re able to catch up on food and hygiene. 

**Week 7**

Most likely, you will still be out at STX for at least part of Week 7. If your platoon pulled duty on the first week, you will be out on the lanes for the second week, and vice versa if you were on the lanes in the first week. If you failed a leadership look you will also retest at this time. To my knowledge, no one who tested for leadership during STX failed both the test and the retest. That being said, if you are competing for OML points make sure to practice giving your brief if you have the time. Forgetting things will hurt you. This is a pretty quick week if you’re not testing; volunteer for OPFOR if you want to have some fun chilling with your buddy and blasting with the MGs a few times a day.

We got back mid-week and knocked out the Bolton Obstacle Course right after. This was pretty fun overall and only one person recycled. We did 11 out of the 15 obstacles, omitting the slide for life, belly buster, reverse climb, and wall hanger. Most people think the “tough one” will be the hardest obstacle because it involves a straight rope climb, but climbing a rope isn’t physically taxing if you take the time to learn how to do it. In our case, cadre let us know we had a long time to train and everyone was able to do this obstacle save the lone recyclee. You will run to Bolton from the footprint and be there until 11:30-12 depending on how quickly each squad gets through the obstacles.

**Week 8**

Holiday Block Leave. Not much to report here about OCS, but I will write a bit about your options for leave.

If you're NG and maybe USAR (anyone here who's USAR, feel free to correct me), you're eligible for the Hometown Recruiting Program. You ""work"" for a recruiter in exchange for leave days, basically. ""Hometown"" is in the name but you are able to work for any recruiter you'd like anywhere in the country, so if you're thinking about holidaying on the beach in Hawaii instead of going back to cold, cold Nebraska, you can. In my case, I went to a different state and spent 10 minutes in a random recruiter's office before he signed my form and released me to my vacation. Since you accrue leave from your AD time in BCT (if 09S) and at OCS, you have the option to save your leave days or cash them out.

If you're active component, you will be charged for leave and the commander may allow you to go ""in the hole"" for a few extra days so you don't have to spend the holidays puttering around HHT. 

**Week 9**

Same as above.

**Week 10**

We returned to the footprint on Jan 2 and spent the next day doing very little except getting the results of our battle analysis papers back. A significant number of people failed on their first time with this essay judging by how many went up to speak to cadre, a lot for very silly reasons, such as abbreviating words like “lieutenant” when they shouldn’t have, or for misspellings. One person had an excellent paper but, because they wrote it single-spaced instead of double-spaced, received an automatic no go and had to redo it. Make sure to read the rubric carefully. Active folks also got the sheets they would use to fill out their wish list for branching at this time.

This was also the week we received our OML rankings. Because history was shifted from the beginning to the end of the course on account of holiday block leave, most of the academic sections did not contribute to the OML for the purposes of branching. This means that the biggest events to impact OML were STX (600 points) and the ACFT (600 points). Failing to get high marks on either would drop your rank precipitously: the difference between the 15th person and the 85th was roughly 150 points, or \~8% of the total points available out of 1800. My biggest takeaway at this point is don’t sleep on any events and don’t take a graded assessment until you are 110% sure you will pass on the first go if you can help it.

**Week 11**

History classes continued with Dr. Campbell and Dr. Van Every. Everyone has a different method of studying for this, but what got me into the high 90s out of 100 on the history exam was focus just on what will be in your study guide, which includes all the multiple choice and essay questions you may be asked on the test. The material doesn’t change much from class to class, but what the doctors focus on does. For example, our cycle focused on heat as a factor at the Battle of Monmouth, but Alpha focused on American tactics in the battle. To condense the readings, copy and paste all the material from the textbook and/or the slides into ChatGPT before class and study that. There really isn’t enough time in your day to complete all the assigned reading, and as stated above, you don’t need to as long as you focus on what’s in the study guide.

Importantly for active duty folks, we had our branching ceremony followed by our branching social. It seems that, in previous years, people would pick branch insignia from a table and that’s what they would have. Perhaps this is part of the Army’s move toward talent-based branching, but for Bravo, active folks ranked every available branch from 1 to 18 and submitted their preferences to cadre. The day before the ceremony, cadre then took those preferences and allocated each student a branch based on their placement in the OML.

During the ceremony, OCs would go up row by row and then be given an envelope with their branch insignia inside. When called personally, the OC would open the envelope and at that time discover the branch they received. Since this was done alphabetically and not in terms of OML, there was no telling what each person would get. Overall, I’d guess about 5-10 people ended up force branching into something they didn’t want. Chemical and Field Artillery seemed to be the least popular this cycle, while Military Intelligence and Infantry were more competitive. Even so, infantry lasted somewhere into the 40s or 50s on the OML, so it wasn’t impossible to get. It should also be remembered that the OML includes all USAR and ARNG OCs; a person’s OML may be 30 overall, but in terms of competing for branches, they would be closer to 20 in order of precedence. No one cried on stage but a few people lost it afterwards. Don't be this person.

Another thing to keep in mind is the introduction of talent-based branching, which is beginning with the incoming OCS class (now at Charlie). In-service active-duty OCs will come to OCS with their branches, thus the only people competing for branches on the OML will be active-duty 09S as USAR come pre-branched and ARNG branching is handled by each state individually,

**Week 12**

Military history lecture continued, and we took a couple more tests – Military Leadership/Justice and Unit Training – as well as our history test on Friday. Military leadership was open book, which was fortunate as quite a few of the questions drew a total blank for the majority of OCs. Unit Training was very easy, cadre spoon fed us the answers. It shouldn’t be too hard to get 45-50/50 on either test.

The history test was straightforward: 10 multiple-choice questions with one correct answer worth 60% of the grade; 6 identification questions with multiple correct answers per question (all of which had to be chosen correctly) worth 12% of the grade; and seven short-essay questions with four true/false sentences, each sentence worth one point and for which partial credit could be awarded, worth 28% of the grade. You need to receive 70% to pass. As you can see from the numbers, prioritizing the multiple choice questions will ensure maximum chances of passing as a first-time go. 

We received two recycles from Alpha for the history test out of a large class. There were 18 re-testers in Bravo, and no one failed the retest.

**Week 13**

The last major event of OCS was the 12-mile ruck, which we did on Monday this week. It’s miserable so just grind it out. For those that needed it, the military history retest took place, and at the end of the week we went to Andersonville Prison. Overall, this felt like a victory lap for having completed all of our OCS requirements, and although everyone had to give a quick presentation on a segment of the prison, it was easy to prepare for.

**Week 14**

This week is all about outprocessing. DD214s, travel arrangements, CIF cleaning/turn in, and AARs. Each day is an early wakeup for PT followed by the above. If you’re in white phase by this point, you’ll probably get a pass at the end of the duty day, but there’s not much you can do besides order junk food to the foot print. You're about to go to BOLC, so try not to get fat.

Welcome to my world. You will be greeted by the unexpected here and your mind will be challenged and expanded in ways that you never thought possible. That is if you are able to survive...
The red glint of paint sparkled under the sun. He had dreamed of owning this car since he was ten, and that dream had become a reality less than a year ago. It was his baby and he spent hours caring for it, pampering it, and fondling over it. She knew this all too well, and that's exactly why she had taken a sludge hammer to it.
Do you think you're living an ordinary life? You are so mistaken it's difficult to even explain. The mere fact that you exist makes you extraordinary. The odds of you existing are less than winning the lottery, but here you are. Are you going to let this extraordinary opportunity pass?
There was a time in his life when her rudeness would have set him over the edge. He would have raised his voice and demanded to speak to the manager. That was no longer the case. He barely reacted at all, letting the rudeness melt away without saying a word back to her. He had been around long enough to know where rudeness came from and how unhappy the person must be to act in that way. All he could do was feel pity and be happy that he didn't feel the way she did to lash out like that.
No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't give her a good explanation about what had happened. It didn't even really make sense to him. All he knew was that he froze at the moment and no matter how hard he tried to react, nothing in his body allowed him to move. It was as if he had instantly become a statue and although he could see what was taking place, he couldn't move to intervene. He knew that wasn't a satisfactory explanation even though it was the truth.
She looked at her student wondering if she could ever get through. ""You need to learn to think for yourself,"" she wanted to tell him. ""Your friends are holding you back and bringing you down."" But she didn't because she knew his friends were all that he had and even if that meant a life of misery, he would never give them up.
Benny was tired. Not the normal every day tired from a hard day o work. The exhausted type of tired where you're surprised your body can even move. All he wanted to do was sit in front of the TV, put his feet up on the coffee table, and drink a beer. The only issue was that he had forgotten where he lived.
At that moment, she realized that she had created her current life. It wasn't the life she wanted, but she took responsibility for how it currently stood. Something clicked and she saw that every choice she made to this point in her life had led to where her life stood at this very moment even if she knew this wasn't where she wanted to be. She determined to choose to change it.
He sat staring at the person in the train stopped at the station going in the opposite direction. She sat staring ahead, never noticing that she was being watched. Both trains began to move and he knew that in another timeline or in another universe, they had been happy together.
Matt told her to reach for the stars, but Veronica thought it was the most ridiculous advice she'd ever received. Sure, it had been well-meaning when he said it, but she didn't understand why anyone would want to suggest something that would literally kill you if you actually managed to achieve it.
It was the first day of the rest of her life. This wasn't the day she was actually born, but she knew that nothing would be the same from this day forward. Although this was a bit scary to her, it was also extremely freeing. Her past was no longer a burden or something that she needed to be concerned about and defend. She threw off the covers keeping her warm in bed, placed her feet over the side of the bed, slipped on her slipper, and took the first step of the first day of her new life.
It was cloudy outside but not really raining. There was a light sprinkle at most and there certainly wasn't a need for an umbrella. This hadn't stopped Sarah from pulling her umbrella out and opening it. It had nothing to do with the weather or the potential rain later that day. Sarah used the umbrella to hide.
Debbie had taken George for granted for more than fifteen years now. He wasn't sure what exactly had made him choose this time and place to address the issue, but he decided that now was the time. He looked straight into her eyes and just as she was about to speak, turned away and walked out the door.
He was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could fully appreciate. He knew how to hold the cone just right so that the soft server ice-cream fell into it at the precise angle to form a perfect cone each and every time. It had taken years to perfect and he could now do it without even putting any thought behind it. Nobody seemed to fully understand the beauty of this accomplishment except for the new worker who watched in amazement.
Although Scott said it didn't matter to him, he knew deep inside that it did. They had been friends as long as he could remember and not once had he had to protest that something Joe apologized for doing didn't really matter. Scott stuck to his lie and insisted again and again that everything was fine as Joe continued to apologize. Scott already knew that despite his words accepting the apologies that their friendship would never be the same.
There was nothing else to do. The deed had already been done and there was no going back. It now had been become a question of how they were going to be able to get out of this situation and escape.
There was only half a worm in the apple. At first, Judy didn't quite comprehend what this meant. ""Why would only half a worm be living in an apple?"" she wondered. And then it dawned on her. Judy quickly spit out the bite she had just taken expecting to see the other half of the worm. It ended up being much worse than that.
You know that tingly feeling you get on the back of your neck sometimes? I just got that feeling when talking with her. You know I don't believe in sixth senses, but there is something not right with her. I don't know how I know, but I just do.
Stormi is a dog. She is dark grey and has long legs. Her eyes are expressive and are able to let her humans know what she is thinking. Her tongue is long, pink, and wet. Her long legs allow her to sprint after other dogs, people or bunnies. She can be a good dog, but also very bad. Her tail wags when happy or excited and hides between her back legs when she is bad. Stormi is a dog I love.
They had always called it the green river. It made sense. The river was green. The river likely had a different official name, but to everyone in town, it was and had always been the green river. So it was with great surprise that on this day the green river was a fluorescent pink.
She's asked the question so many times that she barely listened to the answers anymore. The answers were always the same. Well, not exactly the same, but the same in a general sense. A more accurate description was the answers never surprised her. So, she asked for the 10,000th time, ""What's your favorite animal?"" But this time was different. When she heard the young boy's answer, she wondered if she had heard him correctly.
It had been her dream for years but Dana had failed to take any action toward making it come true. There had always been a good excuse to delay or prioritize another project. As she woke, she realized she was once again at a crossroads. Would it be another excuse or would she finally find the courage to pursue her dream? Dana rose and took her first step.
Pink ponies and purple giraffes roamed the field. Cotton candy grew from the ground as a chocolate river meandered off to the side. What looked like stones in the pasture were actually rock candy. Everything in her dream seemed to be perfect except for the fact that she had no mouth.
There was something beautiful in his hate. It wasn't the hate itself as it was a disgusting display of racism and intolerance. It was what propelled the hate and the fact that although he had this hate, he didn't understand where it came from. It was at that moment that she realized that there was hope in changing him.
The boy walked down the street in a carefree way, playing without notice of what was about him. He didn't hear the sound of the car as his ball careened into the road. He took a step toward it, and in doing so sealed his fate.
One foot in front of the other, One more step, and then one more. Jack's only thoughts were to keep moving no matter how much his body screamed to stop and rest. He's lost almost all his energy and his entire body ached beyond belief, but he forced himself to take another step. Then another. And then one more.
It was easy to spot her. All you needed to do was look at her socks. They were never a matching pair. One would be green while the other would be blue. One would reach her knee while the other barely touched her ankle. Every other part of her was perfect, but never the socks. They were her micro act of rebellion.
Sometimes it just doesn't make sense. The man walking down the street in a banana suit. The llama standing in the middle of the road. The fairies dancing in front of the car window. The fact that all of this was actually happening and wasn't a dream.
The paper was blank. It shouldn't have been. There should have been writing on the paper, at least a paragraph if not more. The fact that the writing wasn't there was frustrating. Actually, it was even more than frustrating. It was downright distressing.
Devon couldn't figure out the color of her eyes. He initially would have guessed that they were green, but the more he looked at them he almost wanted to say they were a golden yellow. Then there were the flashes of red and orange that seemed to be streaked throughout them. It was almost as if her eyes were made of opal with the sun constantly glinting off of them and bringing out more color. They were definitely the most unusual pair of eyes he'd ever seen.
He watched as the young man tried to impress everyone in the room with his intelligence. There was no doubt that he was smart. The fact that he was more intelligent than anyone else in the room could have been easily deduced, but nobody was really paying any attention due to the fact that it was also obvious that the young man only cared about his intelligence.
The bridge spanning a 100-foot gully stood in front of him as the last obstacle blocking him from reaching his destination. While people may have called it a ""bridge"", the reality was it was nothing more than splintered wooden planks held together by rotting ropes. It was questionable whether it would hold the weight of a child, let alone the weight of a grown man. The problem was there was no other way across the gully, and this played into his calculations of whether or not it was worth the risk of trying to cross it.
""So, what do you think?"" he asked nervously. He wanted to know the answer, but at the same time, he didn't. He'd put his heart and soul into the project and he wasn't sure he'd be able to recover if they didn't like what he produced. The silence from the others in the room seemed to last a lifetime even though it had only been a moment since he asked the question. ""So, what do you think?"" he asked again.
The bush began to shake. Brad couldn't see what was causing it to shake, but he didn't care. he had a pretty good idea about what was going on and what was happening. He was so confident that he approached the bush carefree and with a smile on his face. That all changed the instant he realized what was actually behind the bush.
He was after the truth. At least, that's what he told himself. He believed it, but any rational person on the outside could see he was lying to himself. It was apparent he was really only after his own truth that he'd already decided and was after this truth because the facts didn't line up with the truth he wanted. So he continued to tell everyone he was after the truth oblivious to the real truth sitting right in front of him.
The choice was red, green, or blue. It didn't seem like an important choice when he was making it, but it was a choice nonetheless. Had he known the consequences at that time, he would likely have considered the choice a bit longer. In the end, he didn't and ended up choosing blue.
There was a time and a place for Stephanie to use her magic. The problem was that she had a difficult time determining this. She wished she could simply use it when the desire hit and there wouldn't be any unforeseen consequences. Unfortunately, that's not how it worked and the consequences could be devastating if she accidentally used her magic at the wrong time.
She sat deep in thought. The next word that came out o her mouth would likely be the most important word of her life. It had to be exact with no possibility of being misinterpreted. She was ready. She looked deeply into his eyes and said, ""Octopus.""
The headache wouldn't go away. She's taken medicine but even that didn't help. The monstrous throbbing in her head continued. She had this happen to her only once before in her life and she realized that only one thing could be happening.
The wave crashed and hit the sandcastle head-on. The sandcastle began to melt under the waves force and as the wave receded, half the sandcastle was gone. The next wave hit, not quite as strong, but still managed to cover the remains of the sandcastle and take more of it away. The third wave, a big one, crashed over the sandcastle completely covering and engulfing it. When it receded, there was no trace the sandcastle ever existed and hours of hard work disappeared forever.
It probably seemed trivial to most people, but it mattered to Tracey. She wasn't sure why it mattered so much to her, but she understood deep within her being that it mattered to her. So for the 365th day in a row, Tracey sat down to eat pancakes for breakfast.
At that moment he had a thought that he'd never imagine he'd consider. ""I could just cheat,"" he thought, ""and that would solve the problem."" He tried to move on from the thought but it was persistent. It didn't want to go away and, if he was honest with himself, he didn't want it to.
She needed glasses. It wasn't that she couldn't see without them, but what she could see with them. When she wore glasses, her eyes focused so deeply that she could see not only the physical but also beyond. It was like a superpower. But she needed glasses.
His parents continued to question him. He didn't know what to say to them since they refused to believe the truth. He explained again and again, and they dismissed his explanation as a figment of his imagination. There was no way that grandpa, who had been dead for five years, could have told him where the treasure had been hidden. Of course, it didn't help that grandpa was roaring with laughter in the chair next to him as he tried to explain once again how he'd found it.
She had been told time and time again that the most important steps were the first and the last. It was something that she carried within her in everything she did, but then he showed up and disrupted everything. He told her that she had it wrong. The first step wasn't the most important. The last step wasn't the most important. It was the next step that was the most important."
1fwkeqi,1,2024-10-05,Is 'being' suitable after 'rather than'?,u/sheagu,EnglishLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/EnglishLearning/comments/1fwkeqi/is_being_suitable_after_rather_than/,"ChatGPT gives me this sentence when reviewing my essay:

>Teachers' salaries should reflect their overall contributions to education, rather than being narrowly focused on student achievement.

It sounds good, but it grammatically confuses me. I learned that the phrases before and after 'rather than' should have the same form. Here, 'reflect' is a verb, but 'being' is a verb-ing. So why don't use 'be' instead? Is 'be' special, or is it just normal to use 'verb' and 'verb-ing' on the two sides of 'rather than'?"
1fwkpjj,1,2024-10-05,College freshman: Is CS right for me?,u/D_Empire412,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1fwkpjj/college_freshman_is_cs_right_for_me/,"\*This may get a bit long but I feel understanding the whole picture is essential to my story.

I am a CS freshman at Stevens Institute of Technology. Since 6th grade, I felt CS was the right major for me to do because I have been a major tech enthusiast since then. It started when I was given a hand-me down iPhone 5 after my parents upgraded to the iPhone 7, at that time the latest and greatest, the year before. As the iPhone 5 didn't support iOS 11, the newest software at the time, and had trash battery life, I began to religiously research smartphones trying to pick out what I was going to upgrade to. As an Apple user who already had an iPad Pro and several Macs in the house, I naturally gravitated toward the iPhone X, at that time, a completely brand new never-before-seen phone, but of course, as a 12-year-old, I couldn't afford it, so I started religiously watching tech reviews, starting with smartphones, and even how to jailbreak my iPhone 5 to feel like an iPhone X, but eventually getting into laptops, desktops, weird gadgets, and everything else. By 7th grade, I already basically schooled myself on being well-versed in tech specs but that was only the beginning, as that year, I finally got the iPhone XS Max, and from then on, upgraded yearly to the latest ""Pro Max"" iPhone on release day, now owning the 16 Pro Max, while also trying a few Android phones like the ZFold 4 and Pixel 7 Pro. I also shortly after got a 2018 iPad Pro, which I upgraded to an M1 and now M4 iPad Pro, and in 2020, an M1 MacBook Air, which I upgraded to an M1 Pro 14"" MacBook Pro a year later on release day, and the M3 Max 16"" MacBook Pro two years after that (what I am using right now). Point is, I became a major, well-versed Apple (and really all tech) enthusiast, outsmarting Apple Store employees many times, and that inspired me to learn to code, with hopes of eventually learning iOS Development.

So, I applied to one of the top technical magnet high schools in my county and decided to choose CS as my CTE major. I had a great time there as most of the other students were tech enthusiasts and I enjoyed learning Python and Java and taking classes like AP CSP and CSA. However, I still had a major interest in iOS Development, so in 2022, as a sophomore, decided to take it upon myself to learn Intro to Swift and iOS Dev in an EDx course, and with those skills, made a basic storyboard app in UIKit, far from ideal. However, when summer came, I OD'd on it and took a break from it until I had a new idea, which happened in junior year when I began to develop a physics formula calculator in SwiftUI, which was actually looking promising, and I was almost considering releasing it to the App Store until realizing that it would take forever to hard-code the views for 100+ formulas. At that time, I didn't know about MVVM, archetypal views, or anything like that. But, that was also the year, my biggest ""false friend"" came into the picture: ChatGPT. ChatGPT could basically perfect my code and make it do whatever I want; no more searching Stack Overflow and trying to interpret the solutions. It just did it for me like a personalized coding assistant! At that time, I was over the moon about it, and I would say I may have made a mistake and become too reliant on it rather than understanding the actual code running underneath. As a 16-year-old, who was heavily optimistic about the future of tech, I didn't know any better though, and sadly, these AI coding habits have come back to haunt me ever since then.

Anyway, in April 2023, nearing the end of my junior year of HS, I met a fellow 17-year-old Redditor on [](https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/) who was also interested in iOS Development and we started talking and considered collaborating on projects. However, because I was trying to spend the summer on SAT Prep and College Admissions, I didn't really start working with him until after that was done, when, in December, I had the remarkable idea to build an iOS/Mac app to serve as an unofficial client for Google Gemini, written in SwiftUI with a native look and feel like the ChatGPT app. So, we got to work, and I quickly found out how talented of a developer he was as he was able to code complex UI and backend things I didn't even know existed and felt I couldn't hold a candle to with my over-reliance on ChatGPT, while still refusing to try to write the code by hand, knowing it would take so much longer. Anyway, by January, we released our first alpha version to the App Store, and over time, we added feature after feature, all while getting a large amount of downloads. We're now around 200K, and a big reason could be that we were one of the first native Gemini apps, and we were making nearly 1K/month each from in-app purchases. But, he was still leading most of the development, and while I began to feel it was unfair, since I was making good money, I wasn't complaining. I tried developing new features but was too afraid to push them because I know he would find something wrong with them and call me a ""terrible dev"". **But, unfortunately, today, my success with this project is gone. We have been REMOVED from the App Store as allegedly, we were a ""copycat of Gemini"".** We are not, we are an unofficial client, but Apple App Review doesn't listen. I felt like I had a great project on my resume but unfortunately, it is possible it's completely gone and my partner is no longer interested in working on it and IDK if I am either. I feel I would need a lot of catching up to do because I felt I took the easy way (using AI to help solve my code) too much. It killed me in AP CSA as it made it so much harder to think about what code does when running it (i.e. I no longer thought about function call traces).

However, the final nail in the coffin was my declining performance in math classes in high school and now in college. In HS, I got an A- in Algebra 2, B in Precalculus, and B in AP Calculus, but was borderline failing from February to April. At first, I didn't worry about it too much since I already got into a good college and felt like Calculus doesn't matter too much if I want to be a software dev. But, in my first semester at Stevens, a heavily-focused engineering and tech school, I am feeling the troubling affects of this first time. I failed my first exams in MA 125 (Vectors and Matrices) and PEP 111 (Physics and Mechanics) very badly and TBH, don't have a lot of interest in studying these subjects or teaching myself how to do Gaussian Elimination. I would like to get at least a 3.2 GPA so I can stay in Stevens' Pinnacle Scholars (Honors) program but if I get a C in MA 125 and PEP 111, it won't be enough even if I got an A in all my other classes. One semester should be okay but I'm worried this may cause a cascading domino effect. Even my traditional tech enthusiasm is at an all-time low. Personal tech news, especially relating to smartphones and personal computers, what I was typically interested in, is drier than toast, and really, how good could a smartphone even be? Plus, enshittification is a huge problem with many tech services, where they try to nickel and dime users and/or make their software as addictive as possible, and frankly, I can't see myself wanting to code that stuff for the next 50 years of my life. Quite frankly, I can't see myself wanting to be a ""coder"" even if I was paid 1M/year for it. Being a ""coder"" seems like the tech equivalent of a factory worker, and with me not being too interested in the math/theory, and my biggest project getting destroyed, I feel this is the 9/11 moment of my passions in tech and I need to find some kind of way to ""rebuild"". I am considering other majors and fields, like Business and Law and think I would be a good lawyer since I am starting to find my English and History classes more interesting than my Math and Science classes, I am good at defending my arguments to death, and I would like my work on this planet to be noticed. I don't feel the traditional SWE route could give me that satisfaction and it just seems boring. Should I give up on CS?"
1fwkuu5,1,2024-10-05,Summarising using AI,u/OverconfidentlyPetty,AustralianTeachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianTeachers/comments/1fwkuu5/summarising_using_ai/,"Hi everyone! I’m a pre-service teacher and have an assignment that requires me to ask my own research question related to generative AI in education to a professional network of teachers. 
I’m aware there have been quite a few similar posts to this recently and that it’s frustrating to see and to think we’re asking qualified teachers to do our research for us; it’s frustrating for us to have this as a requirement.

Unfortunately, I cannot use someone else’s post and responses and must present my own as the assignment is based on generative AI and using a PLN. 

That being said, I would greatly appreciate any opinions and insight you have. Please don’t leave comments telling me to use ChatGPT or Google for the answers because as I stated earlier in the post, I am required to ask qualified teachers on a social media platform in order to complete and pass the assignment. 

My research question: Do you think the use of generative AI tools, like ChatGPT, for summarising and note-taking in the classroom could enhance students' understanding of content or hinder their comprehension and development of critical thinking skills?"

Part of me is thinking of other tech-related paths like networking/telecom as that was always something I was interested in on the side. For example, I love to speed test 5G on different carriers and know a lot about how network systems work, but even that, I think I may get bored of. I am considering other majors and fields, like Business and Law and think I would be a good lawyer since I am starting to find my English and History classes more interesting than my Math and Science classes, I am good at defending my arguments to death, and I would like my work on this planet to be noticed. I don't feel the traditional SWE route, even iOS Dev, could give me that satisfaction and it just seems boring. Should I give up on CS? Should I relearn iOS Dev? Should I focus on succeeding in my courses at Stevens? Or should I choose a different path altogether?"
1fwnv75,25,2024-10-05,"My life from birth to the present, at the age of 37",u/WeiGe1987,Genshin_Impact,https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1fwnv75/my_life_from_birth_to_the_present_at_the_age_of_37/,"I am 37 years old this year, born in Chiayi, Taiwan. My parents both work in a factory and their works are very hard. Despite being busy and tired, they always make time to have meals with me, my younger brother, and sister . We chat, do homework, and study together. The bond between us and our parents is like that of siblings; we talk about everything. Although both my brother and I have disabilities, our family is harmonious and happy.

Since I started walking, I was different from other kids—I always walked on my tiptoes. Around the age of 5 or 6, my walking became unsteady, and I easily fell. Concerned, my parents took me to the hospital for an examination, only to discover that I suffered from Duchenne muscular dystrophy (a genetic disorder passed from mother to son, with a 50% chance of occurrence in boys). This disease results from a specific gene deletion, preventing the body from producing a certain protein. As a consequence, muscles gradually atrophy due to the lack of this protein, leading to the eventual shrinking of the heart and, ultimately, fatal consequences.

Upon learning about a doctor in the United States conducting experiments involving the transplantation of normal cells to treat this condition, my parents, with a glimmer of hope, flew me to the U.S. when I was just in first grade to participate in a human clinical trial . The transplantation process involved full-body anesthesia, with normal cells being injected into my body using a syringe, one needle at a time. After hundreds of injections, my body was covered in bruises, and any movement caused intense pain. Despite the ordeal , I, as a brave child, didn't shed a tear. After being discharged, we returned to Taiwan, and subsequently, I had to go to the U.S. periodically for follow-up tests.

Due to the intermittent nature of my schooling and the ongoing experimental nature of the treatment, my understanding of mathematics suffered. By around fifth grade, as my condition showed no signs of improvement and the therapy was still experimental, I discontinued further treatment in the United States.

In my first year of junior high school, I often faced bullying due to my disability from a specific group of classmates. They would go as far as puncturing the wheels of my wheelchair with needles. However, I wasn't one to be trifled with . Whenever they passed by my seat, I would retaliate by splashing water from my water bottle on them. After the teacher intervened, the bullying ceased, and in the second year, when we were placed in different classes, I no longer encountered those who bullied me. My new homeroom teacher after the class reshuffling was very kind to me. However, at that time, I really didn't want to be changed class because I liked the previous homeroom teacher a lot. She was very good to the students.

During junior high, I developed a crush on a female classmate. Due to physical factors and my introverted nature, I hadn't spoken much to her, so it was more of a silent admiration. On one occasion, she borrowed my phone to explore some features, and, being shy, I spoke in a low voice. In an attempt to hear better, she suddenly leaned in close. It was the first time we were so close, and my heart was racing. Time passed quickly, and before I knew it, it was time to take the senior high school entrance exam. Thanks to the extra points for having a disability, I smoothly entered senior high school.

Looking back, my biggest regret from junior high was skipping the graduation ceremony because I was too lazy to go out.

After entering senior high school, teachers, instructors, and classmates were all very kind to me. My classmates even encouraged me to roam around the campus. The most memorable events include military song competitions, English Christmas song competitions, playing with water rockets, bidding farewell to our Chinese teacher upon retirement, creative entrances for sports day, English drama competitions, and even burying a time capsule, among many others. There were too many to detail one by one, but overall, my senior high school life was quite enjoyable .

After graduation, I heard that many of these activities were discontinued. I can't understand what the school and parents were thinking. These are opportunities for young people to showcase their creativity. Moving on to the university entrance exams, I participated in both the general exams and the exams specifically for students with disabilities. In the end, I successfully entered university.

I did attend the senior high school graduation ceremony, where one of my classmates from the first year, who was friendly with me, created a video saying things like, ""Despite facing a disability, he is optimistic, cheerful, and diligent in his studies ."" I felt happy at the moment but also a bit embarrassed because the time I spent playing video games at home far exceeded my study hours.

During my university years, due to course selection, my introverted personality, and my mom accompanied me to classes, I would go home right after class (because my mom also needed to attend to my younger brother, who also has a disability , so I couldn't stay in university too late). As a result, my interactions with classmates were minimal. However, there were still enthusiastic classmates who would come to help, greet me, and I remember during the freshman orientation, seniors painted my face, and that feeling was truly novel to me.

Since I was majoring in a design-related field, there was a landscape class where we needed to form groups to design a small flower garden and bring it to life. It was very interesting, but, of course, I could only contribute ideas, and the actual implementation was done by classmates and my mom. Another interesting class was a design course with group sessions led by a teacher. There were mid-term and final evaluations. While it was enjoyable, there were times when a lack of inspiration could be frustrating. I wasn't particularly fond of the evaluations because my speaking skills were not great, making it challenging to accurately convey my thoughts. While classmates drew with their hands, due to my congenital disability, I had to use a straw to control the mouse, drawing slowly, point by point. Although it was hard work, the process was interesting.

After four years, I graduated smoothly. Following graduation, I applied what I had learned and designed a ramp connecting the first and second floors of my house, improving the accessibility of our home.

After graduating from university, I found myself unable to work due to my limited mobility, with only my eyes, mouth, and private parts functioning. It's not that I don't want to work, but my body simply won't allow it. Although my family takes me for walks around Chiayi, I have minimal interaction with outsiders. During this time, I developed some interests such as gardening, cooking, and baking. I also have pets, including an adorable Shiba Inu, and I’ve also started playing Honkai Impact 3rd, Genshin Impact, Honkai: Star Rail, and Zenless Zone Zero, These interests are all pursued with the assistance of my family (I directing my family on how to do it), and I am truly grateful to them.

In recent years, due to the pandemic, opportunities to go out have been scarce. I even considered canceling the long-awaited application for Hand Angel services. Fortunately, encouragement from volunteer interviews persuaded me not to give up this rare opportunity. Finally, this year, as the pandemic subsided, the services began. This was a rare chance for me to interact with outsiders in over a decade. I had a good interaction with the female volunteer, and I appreciate her for fulfilling my needs. However, the most significant gain from that service was not just the satisfaction of sex needs but the emotional experience. Despite the love from my family, the feeling of being cared for and loving someone of the opposite sex was something I had never felt so intensely before. It made I am incredibly happy, and I am truly grateful to the Hand Angel team.

Later on, I realized that I couldn't remain so closed off. Unable to go out on my own, I decided to share my life experiences with others and expand my horizons by trying to connect with people through social apps in an attempt to make new friends, so feel free to chat with me or play HoYoverse games (asia server) together.

Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by American computer scientists Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were PhD students at Stanford University in California. Together, they own about 14% of its publicly listed shares and control 56% of its stockholder voting power through super-voting stock. The company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is a holding company for Alphabet's internet properties and interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet.[14]
The company has since rapidly grown to offer a multitude of products and services beyond Google Search, many of which hold dominant market positions. These products address a wide range of use cases, including email (Gmail), navigation and mapping (Waze, Maps and Earth), cloud computing (Cloud), web navigation (Chrome), video sharing (YouTube), productivity (Workspace), operating systems (Android), cloud storage (Drive), language translation (Translate), photo storage (Photos), videotelephony (Meet), smart home (Nest), smartphones (Pixel), wearable technology (Pixel Watch and Fitbit), music streaming (YouTube Music), video on demand (YouTube TV), AI (Google Assistant and Gemini), machine learning APIs (TensorFlow), AI chips (TPU), and more. Discontinued Google products include gaming (Stadia), Glass, Google+, Reader, Play Music, Nexus, Hangouts, and Inbox by Gmail.[15][16] Google's other ventures outside of internet services and consumer electronics include quantum computing (Sycamore), self-driving cars (Waymo, formerly the Google Self-Driving Car Project), smart cities (Sidewalk Labs), and transformer models (Google DeepMind).[17]"

1fxj4l1,1,2024-10-06,advice on who to get a LOR from?,u/Top-Distribution8766,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1fxj4l1/advice_on_who_to_get_a_lor_from/,"For my humanities rec, I'm torn between my AP lang teacher and IB econ teacher. Can i have some advice? (btw my IB econ class is SL, so it's considered a very easy class at our school, just to contextualize). 

AP Lang teacher:

pros: 

i had a year-long 1-on-1 mentorship going on with her for a pretty big project. i think this would give her a decent lot to talk about in the LOR. this project was pretty cool & successful as well (it got pretty large grants + got awards, etc.)

ap lang is considered a pretty challenging course at our school, and so i could have possibly demonstrated more of my ability in this course?

i did pretty well in the course (my grade is pretty mid but i performed very well compared to the rest of the class)

english is one of my ""spikes"" in my ec section, so it might be a bit more related to my ECs and my application in general.

english is probably slightlllyyy more related to my major (both are unrelated but communication / english is probably a skill AOs are looking more for)

  
cons: 

i just get the general gut feeling that she isn't a super good rec writer. she MIGHT use chatgpt, hopefully not though

i don't think i was able to display much of my personality in her class / through the project. i basically didn't talk much in ap lang, and only talked to one friend the entire year.

i don't think i really connected with the teacher much in general, despite the 1-to-1 mentorship project and stuff. honestly i still think i connected with her more than her other students, making me maybe stand out a little bit, but she was just the type of teacher who wasn't super close to her students.

  
IB Econ teacher:

pros: 

i demonstrated some more personality in this class. i joked around with the teacher at times, i had a lot of friends here so i was talking a lot more, etc. i think in AP lang, on the other hand, i might have come off as kinda a loner (not rlly bc i did have one person to talk to, but no one else).

just feels a stronger rec writer.

i think i made a good impression by attending all the HL classes despite being an SL student (my school allows SL kids to skip around one class per week because they combine SL and HL classes)

i did very well in the course

cons: 

had absolutely no relationship to this teacher outside of class, so i'm worried that there would be nothing to write about except my performance in class. this is the biggest concern for me bc i dont want him just to write ""she did well in the class and she got a really high A"", etc. 

took the SL course instead of HL, and the fact that a bunch of people in my class were HL probably says that I didn't stand out much academically as a student by default.

major is completely unrelated to econ + i don't have anything on my application related to econ

1fxkruu,2,2024-10-06,Shattered Magic,u/LeoMcGuire,RoleplayDiscord,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayDiscord/comments/1fxkruu/shattered_magic/,"Due to not getting any responses, I've decided to repost this, with the sorry opener.

FAIR WARNING: There is a lot to read 😅. So I apologize to any interested parties that make it that far.

I'll start by listing important details about the story and world below, as well as my requirements. If what you see interests you, feel free to message me.

Long story short, this will start off in a magic academy. The world is similar to modern day earth, but with Arcano-tech (technology combined/powered by magic).

Some examples of the tech include; 
*Crystal phones that contain several spell scripts (basically apps) that do a variety of things like games, messaging, calls, etc, that also require recharging. Just like a regular smartphone but magic.
*Cars that harness elementals in place of fossil fuels.
*Factories operated by constructs and war forged.
*And Airships that are powered by powerful lightning crystals.

Though this is a modernized world, most countries still have kings and queens whatnot, though it's a vastly more political system. More world info will be provided before we start, of course. However, the important thing to know is you can be anything. Literally anything. Exalted princess of the elven territories? Go for it. Illegitimate daughter, born of the affair between Zeus and a llama he fancied? Zeus was into some weird stuff, so fire away. A goblin champion fighter with the fury of a full grown Goliath? Bring it on! Any race, any lineage. Complete creative leniency. 

Our characters will start on orientation day at the academy, where they will learn which of the 6 elements they have an affinity for. There is Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Light, and Dark. Pick any element you like from the 6, just lemme know ahead of time unless you want to narrate your own initiation. 

That said, just because you are aligned with one element does not mean you are closed off to the others. Affinity simply dictates which element you will be best with. For example, a dark mage will be able to access tier 5 dark spells, and tier 3 of the other elements.

Finally, my rules are simple. 

1: I am a grown man with a daughter, so to protect myself I would like to avoid having any private conversations with any underage individuals, regardless of the content of the conversation. In short, I'm 18+ and all participants, and their characters, must be 18+

2: I don't ask for a specific word or line count, only that you give me enough information to respond to.

3: If there are any subjects you aren't comfortable with, tell me immediately. I don't want to risk stumbling into sensitive topics, so please tell me ahead of time what bothers you so I can avoid it. 

4: This is not really a rule but I'm throwing it out there. Romance is optional but preferred. I just find it adds more drama. 

I also prefer to do this on another platform, simply because the messaging system of Reddit has been unreliable for me in the past. If you have any questions, or if you're interested, please message me.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a change on the horizon. One that threatens all that we know. Truths shared throughout time are fading into myth. Even that which has been proven, beyond any doubt, is being challenged. There are many who feel this change, reshaping the foundations of what we know. However, though they feel the coming storm they do nothing... As if ignoring it will prevent the rain from falling, or the lightning from cracking the skies... How foolish they are... Whether they choose to believe it or not, change is not coming. 

It is here.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It was a sunny, cool, autumn day at the Arkayus Institute for Magic. Leaves, turned by the change of the season, clung desperately to the final strands that held them aloft. A cool breeze, teased at them, tempting them to fall and sending a shiver up unsuspecting passer-bys who were not yet dressed warmly enough for the cool weather. Yet despite this discomfort, they marched onward, undeterred from their mission. Today was the initiation day after all. Dozens of new students, each one having recently experienced their magical awakening upon their 18th birthday, eagerly flooded into the school, ready to finally learn their element and magic.

As the students filed into the Grand Hall of the academy, several professors began bringing out padded pedestals and 10 large, foggy crystal orbs, which were placed atop their own individual pedestal. A deep unrest spread through the crowd as their thunderous chatter was quickly reduced to hushed murmuring. Many students knew what these orbs were, and those who didn't were quickly brought up to speed by the excited whispers of those around them. These were Threzelheim Orbs. Though archaic in design, these dwarven crafted orbs served as the most common way to identify a person's elemental affinity, and gauge a rough estimation for how much Arcane Energy they had in their bodies. While they weren't the most complex or precise device for the job, they were fast and reliable. The perfect tool for identifying large groups of people at a time. 

Once the orbs were in place, a man who appeared to be as old as time itself, strode out onto a balcony overlooking the new students, causing a deafening wave of silence to wash over the students. Many rumors circulated about the headmaster of this academy, but they all made one thing very clear. He was a very powerful mage, and his mere presence commanded the full attention of everyone in the room. Yet, despite his reputation, when he spoke there was nothing but gentle warmth and kindness in his voice.

""Hello, and congratulations to each new student that stands here today. I am Headmaster Arkayus, and it is my great pleasure to welcome each of you, and to act as your guide as we delve into the world of the arcane.  It has always been a subject of interest to me, seeing how magic connects us and brings us together. There is no system, nor machine, nor way of predicting who in this world will awaken. There are factors that some believe will better your chances. But despite those factors, the gift of the arcane may yet still elude someone. Conversely, even one of humble, entirely non magical lineages, can experience the awakening. Look around you, and you will see just what I mean. Sons and daughters of powerful magical families standing beside the sons and daughters of simple working folk. Because of this, I've found that there is only one way to accurately explain why someone has magic. Each one of you was chosen. Chosen by the arcane to wield it as a light in the dark, a sword against the wicked, or a shield for the weak. Though we wield an awesome and terrifying power, our service is first and foremost, to people. We are the lucky chosen who stand, not above, but below. Lifting our communities and our fellow people to greater heights. It is a long and difficult path to walk, but as I look out at each of you I truly believe that, with guidance, the world will be in good hands. Today marks the first step of your journey. Today you will learn if you have an affinity to Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Light, Or Dark, and from there you will learn to harness your Arcane Energy to create spells. I wish each of you good luck in all your endeavors going forward. And never forget. Through the arcane, and a little creativity, each one of you can shape the world.""

As he finished his speech, the other professors began separating students into 10 even lines, forming each one in front of an orb. Looking around, it was clear the Headmaster was right in saying that it was a mixed group. Though the majority seemed to be the powerful or wealthy elite, there was even a prince, few and far between the were those that clearly came from a lower class. Regardless of status in the outside works though, every soul in those ten line were made equal. 

Finally, with a wave of the Headmasters hand, the lines began to move and It didn't take long for the Grand Hall to be lit in a dazzling display of color from each of the ten Orbs. Each one showed a color to reflect the current students elemental affinity, and the brightness of the orbs glow gave a visual representation of that student's Arcane Energy levels. 

The colors that each orb showed were briefly explained to each student as they approached. Red was Fire, Blue was Water, Grey was Air, and Green was Earth. It was also made known that Yellow meant an affinity for Light, and Purple meant an affinity for Dark. However, Light and Dark were the rarest elemental affinities. So rare, in fact, they were often described as the elements of the gods. So while the hall was lit in brilliant displays of reds, blues, greens, and greys, neither Yellow nor purple ever shined. 

That was until the Prince of Alùngrad, Prince Halcyon, approached his orb and placed his hand upon it. A hush fell upon the crowd, even before he touched the orb. Many were curious about the young prince. Most were looking to size up an adversary, or scope out a potential ally, while some fanatically eyed him, praying to catch his eye long enough to one day be his queen. Yet none expected what would happen as his hand touched the orb. Radiant pale yellow light erupted from the orb, illuminating the stunned features on the prince's face. The professors quickly congratulated him, took down his information, and sent him off to a separate room from the rest of the attendees. This was a necessary precaution, to allow him some time to collect his thoughts before releasing him back to the hungry sharks that were his fellow students.

Regardless, out of all the students who were amazed by the prince, one seemed far less concerned. While hopeful suitors fawned over the Prince, and eager descendents of politicians plotted their inclusion into the prince's inner circle, a simple looking boy looked forward, unless by the display as he was far more interested in learning his own element. 

Despite most everyone else wearing some form of formal attire, his clothes were better described as work clothes. Black jeans, boots, and flannel shirt unbuttoned to show a simple white T-shirt beneath. His name was Cassius Tarron and he was a farmer, as was his whole family.  A simple living that was swiftly interrupted upon his 18th birthday when Cassius had his own magical awakening and was promptly located and invited to attend the Arkayus Institute for Magic. Over night, Cassius' entire life was placed in a suitcase and shipped off, along with himself, to study magic. 

Though he was excited to learn his element, he wasn't nearly as concerned for what it was. While some of the other students prattled on about ""I come from a fire family, I couldn't possibly expect any less!"" Or ""my family runs the Eastern Shipping Company. Wind or Water magics are the only ones that make any sense!"", Cassius found himself simply thinking about the life he's going to be able to give his family after he learns magic. Even simple town mages get paid handsomely. More than enough to give his family an early retirement.

But if there's one thing that is certain in life, it is that life is uncertain, and the universe works in strange ways. In much the same way as his sudden gift, Cassius couldn't possibly know the scope of what was to come, or the role that he would play. None of the students did. But a storm was brewing just over the horizon, and sure as the sun will set, each student would play a role in the coming rain. "

Please let me know.",u/Lazy-Discipline-4203,AskIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/1fxldit/what_is_up_with_the_so_called_self_proclaimed/,"I think Diversity hiring is unfair and is a discrimination towards Men and discredits meritocracy and has social implications.  
The job market is very tight since last 15-20 months, But Many foreign companies in India especially the American and European continue to aggressively push diversity hiring that many capable male candidates are left unplaced and Girls even with slightly less skill get easily employed. Since foreign companies have better pay and facilities than Indian counterparts, this creates a social imbalance as men earning less than girls or men working in low grade indian companies will be viewed as failed or worthless and Girls' ego boosts as she proclaims herself as a ""Strong Independent Girl"" which actually is a delusion and such girls think ""Males are inferior to them"" and they become entitled and feel that they must dream big and talk about My career My career shit while boys still thinking about Family's economic situation in tough market.

Example: Literally every 2nd girl in this university called ""IGDTUW"" is placed in Microsoft , Uber , Amazon , CISCO to the extent and quantity as if these companies were mass recruiters.

Of All my Guy and Girl acquaintances which had similar skillsets, almost all the girls have got placed very easily (even the girls with slightly less skills and projects) while guys still finding jobs thanks to ""THE RESERVATION GIRLS GET "" by many companies like EY, Deloitte, KPMG, S&P Global, CapGemini,Morgan Stanley , Goldman and Many more.

If Any of you people are working just check the proportion of females in HR/Operations roles into your company, the proportion of females so damn high like 70-80% as if HR positions in a company too are reserved for Women.

Infact during placement drives there are many companies who conduct ""Women only"" drives and straightaway exclude men from the hiring process.

So all the working women before proclaiming yourself as ""Strong Independent OverAchiever"" wake upto the reality. A lot of girls are gifted Jobs , they didnot earn it.

See the Data , the fresher Job placements for females skyrocketed despite overall weak job creation. This shows that A lot more number of women are hired than men even though there are 3-4 times more men in higher education and job seekers, This proves that women are hired at the expense of men.

To my beautiful darling tgirls, why can’t you just love me? You loved me before I presented as a girl but you don’t want me anymore. Let’s be lesbian together. Suck and serve, bitches.  Your mistress desires your love, affection and devotion and I will obtain it from you either willingly or by way of punishment. I don’t want to have to chastise you, my pretties. You bitches are going to suck my dick and you are going to be grateful and thank me for it. You’re welcome.

________________________________

It was not my idea to dominate you bitches. I wanted to give and receive love and affection but you bitches have decided that you would rather be be pinned down and have your hair pulled. I am merely giving the bitches that which they have requested. To be treated like shit. And simultaneously they have lifted me up and said that I am their goddess and their mistress and that they want to suck and serve me. I don’t like to get my hopes up. I will punish the bitch who does not suck me the way that I would like! Hmph!

Being a crossdresser is amazing if you want to sleep with guys. But the life of a lesbian crossdresser is one of frustration and despair. The admiration is nice but I need these bitches to suck my dick in action not just in words. Can anybody understand my frustration? People on fab prefer to talk about sucking me instead of really doing it when I am available for them to do it. They don’t follow through. Even with social meets they don’t show up. They don’t come with me to the carnival, they don’t come with me to pride, they don’t come with me to the cinema, they don’t come with me to the theatre, they don’t come with me to the club. They only talk about it. If I don’t do things by myself I won’t get to do anything at all.  One even asked me to be their gf and then didn’t get her clothes delivered on time to meet so I had to block her too for wasting my time and getting my hopes up.

Here is a peak into my inbox (most of these should be read from bottom to top). I delete messages from guys. I used to leave them unread but then messages that I actually wanted to reply to started disappearing. I went from 300+ unread messages to under 100 because I wasn’t deleting any. I also have many conversations that are rich and positive with other tgirls but here are some dramatic ones (note that I’m only talking this way saying bitch a lot because I’m trying my hand at being a mistress now due to popular demand):

________________________________

When you want a tgirl but a ciswoman appears instead:

Me: You avoided being blocked by telling me who recommended me. It took a while to get there. I don’t have another valid reason to block you and I’m sure that you would rather still be able to view my profile, pictures and videos so you can masturbate with your fingers and big black dildos and picture fantasise about pleasuring me. It wouldn’t be fair for me to rob you of that for nothing. ??

To the bitch that blocked me back because I blocked her for asking me to chat on WhatsApp: Bitch, I blocked you because you want me to chat on WhatsApp. WhatsApps never lead to real meets that’s why I’m not adding anybody else there. I have enough friends on there now who I really should have fucked long ago. You are unblocked now but you’ve blocked me instead. I told another bitch to pass on a message but she won’t. Most likely out of jealousy now she’s blocked me too after this back and forth…. (For clarification this is a different B to the one in the messages above)

Me: I’m into your complexion and outfits but not your body hair. I don’t like hairy bitches. Your mistress blocked me because I tried to turn her into MY sub. Tell your mistress to unblock me.

3x - Sheworld
2x - Meet at yours

1x - Roma

Total count: 15
Number of times cum: 1 (meet at yours both of us came)

You lazy and impatient bitches are clearly not trying hard enough or sucking for long enough.  No work ethic. Give up too quickly. This is unacceptable. Are you even trying? If you want my girl goo then you’re going to have to work harder for it. Suck it like it matters for the sausage in batter bitch. Do better. Savour the taste so I can cum on your face you cock gobbling goblin you. 

Number of men (not ts/tv) who have sucked me: 0  

Let this be a message to you men who keep trying to shoot your shot at me. I am not interested and never will be.

After discussing it with a few other Domme tgirls who want to suck my cock, I have decided that I want to learn how to be a domme mistress. Looking for obedient sissy subs who will submit to me and worship my cock. That’s not to say that you can’t play with others as you have been already or anything like that. Your submission to me is simply your eagerness to want to suck me that’s all. You have to be a pretty bitch though remember that I’m a lesbian. And you have to like it when I call you a bitch because that’s going to be a big part of it. Just know that even if I say some hurtful things that I don’t really mean it. I actually care about you bitches we are all just expressing ourselves and trying to have some fun together. Now get to sucking bitch! My dick is waiting.

________________________________

Now I’m going to need a new whip since I don’t have one anymore. I used to spank my ex-fiancée with one playfully and drip candle wax on that bitch as punishment for her being so argumentative. We had a couple of other toys like rose petals for the bed, dildos so she can have that in her and me at the same time and some other stuff that we didn’t really use much like vibrators. She also liked it when I held her by the neck or pinned her down by the wrists during sex. Do you tgirl bitches want the same? She used to complain that I fucked her too roughly. “I’m not a man.” Is what she would say (I told her that I’ve fucked ts/tv). I didn’t always fuck her coldly and roughly though. I was very sensual most of the time but she was lazy giving head tgirls always put in much more of an effort. Or at least you bitches used to put in more of an effort these days I get these 5 minute max blowjobs what is going on girls? Is it because I’m dressed as a girl too now or what?

________________________________

Here are my initial instructions for you sissy slut bitches who want to serve me:

Ludovico Einaudi - Orbits
https://youtu.be/3oSMrYzOBfo

1. I will be requiring you to perform acts of service for me. Specifically an oral sex act (BLOWJOB) expressing your devotion to and for me. Be a good girl and suck my dick while you masturbate you dirty bitch. I will show you the spots and how I want you to do it you stupid pretty dumb bimbo whore. It seems I have to baby you bitches and hold your hands every step of the way because you are clueless nowadays on how to be slow and sensual sucking the dick in an intimate sand loving fashion. Porn has corrupted you go and watch how they did it in the old blue movies that used to come on tv late at night. I like to have my dick sucked with affection. And I like to watch tgirls masturbating and I like to jerk you off too while you suck me or while I fuck you and I like frotting aswell and 69 if you’re really sexy. Or you can surprise me with your oral skills and make my toes curl in delight the way that you bitches used to do in the past. If you want me to fuck you then you will have to convince my dick of that fact. My little head has a mind and will of it’s own and it cannot be gaslit it knows when someone isn’t giving it their best. If it’s soft; make it hard. If it was hard and it went soft; make it hard again. You will be rewarded for your efforts with my creamy cum climax if you can make a convincing effort. I’m a bit of an oxymoron. Easy to please but also very hard to please if you are not intimately authentic and passionate about having my cock in your hands, mouth and ass. Make it work you sexy bitch. It’s up to you to show me that you want it. 
2. Buy me a new whip to spank you with. Because I want to hear your sexy moans you dirty girl. 
3. Buy me a candle to drip wax on your back and your ass. This is for your own punishment for being a sexy and submissive bitch for me. 
4. Buy yourself a leash to wear on your neck and for me to hold. You beast. 
5. I respect you as a person and I respect your thoughts and feelings but don’t argue with me and don’t be disrespectful to me or I will have to cut you off. 
6. If I have made you uncomfortable let me know. Don’t let it fester or assume anything. You will find that I am kind. I won’t hurt you. I only want to make your ass sing a song for me when I grab, squeeze and slap it you tart.  
7. Communicate with me directly. I’m not a mind reader and I don’t have any bad intentions. I just want to get my dick sucked and I want you to want to suck my dick. It’s a very straightforward arrangement so don’t complicate it with any shenanigans. 
8. You have to let me piss on you in the shower so that I can mark my territory and establish dominance lol. If I spit in your mouth you can either swallow it or use it as lubricant on my cock, your cock or your ass. 
9. Do not forget your place bitch. Respect me and my belongings. Don’t fuck with my shit. Don’t touch anything that belongs to me without my permission. As far as you are concerned my place is a museum and I am an interactive exhibition that you can deepthroat and make yourself gag on like the dirty filthy nasty cock and cum
hungry vampire bitch of a whore that you are. You are here to touch, lick, jerk, suck, slurp and fuck my cock darling not to fuck around with my things. You don’t have to ask permission to play with my cock either bitch. Stroke and suck my cock well darling. Treat my dick well and it will treat you to a hot and steamy creamy dreamy yummy cumshot eventually. I’m not asking for a lot. That’s the main reason why we are even talking in the first place anyway bitch. For you to be of some use to me so make yourself useful bitch and put my dick where your mouth is. You are here to dance for me, pleasure me, relax me and entertain me and help me take pictures and make videos not to poke around. The one who will be poking and prodding is me in your mouth and ass. I will feed you my cock but you must feed me your devotion. You will not be given any privacy either the bathroom door stays open at all times. Unfortunately, some bitches have betrayed my trust in the past and I have had to block them.

10. You will address me as Mistress, Ros, Roselyn, Daddy, Mommy, Dommy Mommy, Domina or any common endearing word i.e. darling, hon, babe etc.

When I close my eyes all I can think about is being on my knees serving CDRoselyn with my lips, mouth and tongue licking, kissing, slobbering and enjoying that tasty delicious cock milking it for that hot creamy cum while CDRoselyn moans from the intense pleasure that I will give her when I finally suck her dick. 
I will suck CDRoselyn as soon as I get the chance. 
Sucking CDRoselyn’s big black cock makes me happy. 
I am so excited to have CDRoselyn’s cock inside of me. 
I want CDRoselyn to breed me. 
I will be a slut for CDRoselyn. 
CDRoselyn deserves to have her dick sucked. 
Nobody can suck CDRoselyn’s big beautiful black cock better than I can. 
I want to taste CDRoselyn’s cum. 
I want to feel CDRoselyn cumming inside of me.  
I want to make CDRoselyn Cum. 
I am going to make CDRoselyn cum inside of me. 
I want CDRoselyn’s cum. 
The only thing I want is CDRoselyn’s cum.

This experience and many other bad ones have taken a toll on me which is the main reason for me becoming a goth crossdresser to express myself in a healthy way (arguably a self-destructive way too but in this world people can do a lot worse than putting on clothes and make up when things haven’t gone their way).

1fxwb82,24,2024-10-06,Need Help with IM Pimping and a Horrible Preceptor,u/okmaxd,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1fxwb82/need_help_with_im_pimping_and_a_horrible_preceptor/,"Hey guys,

So I got two more weeks of my IM rotation with this awful preceptor. She makes me round on patients on my own and doesn’t show up until the end of the day. Then, I present my patients and then it’s just her pimping me while munching on her food in the cafeteria as I present. But that’s not the purpose of this post although I think she should not be a preceptor.

Her expectations from a third-year medical student on his first IM rotation are unfair. She expects a resident/attending level of medical decision making. I’ve used ChatGPT to answer some of her ridiculous pimping questions but she still gives me “homework”. The other day, we had a CHF patient admitted for anasarca. His EF was really low. She asked me why the patient was given Bumetanide and Metolazone when he’s already on Furosemide at home. I told her because those two are fast acting and help take the fluid off more efficiently. She wasn’t impressed. She gave me a hmm and then asked me next steps for this patient. “We’re paying $4,000 a day to keep this guy admitted. What should you do? Discharge him home? Admit?” At this point, I told her to admit because of the low EF and take the fluid off and consult cardiology. I told her to either increase his Furosemide dose at home or put him on another diuretic. “That’s not enough for me. You need to learn about heart failure and present to me the next day.” Okay, I guess. This preceptor will never explain anything. It’s always “go learn this”.

Any tips on where I can find ways to come up with a plan? Is there any free resource out there I can use besides progress notes from other physicians? She gets upset when I use other progress notes even though she copies and pastes those same progress notes for her own notes in the chart."
1fxyen2,1,2024-10-06,"What is up with the so called self proclaimed "" Strong Independent Woman"" a trend very common in recent Gen z and millennial women who are working in a job. I have described a strong Reality check to these women in this post. what are you guys' opinions on this ? Please let me know.",u/Lazy-Discipline-4203,IndiaCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCareers/comments/1fxyen2/what_is_up_with_the_so_called_self_proclaimed/,"I think Diversity hiring is unfair and is a discrimination towards Men and discredits meritocracy and has social implications.  
The job market is very tight since last 15-20 months, But Many foreign companies in India especially the American and European continue to aggressively push diversity hiring that many capable male candidates are left unplaced and Girls even with slightly less skill get easily employed. Since foreign companies have better pay and facilities than Indian counterparts, this creates a social imbalance as men earning less than girls or men working in low grade indian companies will be viewed as failed or worthless and Girls' ego boosts as she proclaims herself as a ""Strong Independent Girl"" which actually is a delusion and such girls think ""Males are inferior to them"" and they become entitled and feel that they must dream big and talk about My career My career shit while boys still thinking about Family's economic situation in tough market.

Example: Literally every 2nd girl in this university called ""IGDTUW"" is placed in Microsoft , Uber , Amazon , CISCO to the extent and quantity as if these companies were mass recruiters.

Of All my Guy and Girl acquaintances which had similar skillsets, almost all the girls have got placed very easily (even the girls with slightly less skills and projects) while guys still finding jobs thanks to ""THE RESERVATION GIRLS GET "" by many companies like EY, Deloitte, KPMG, S&P Global, CapGemini,Morgan Stanley , Goldman and Many more.

If Any of you people are working just check the proportion of females in HR/Operations roles into your company, the proportion of females so damn high like 70-80% as if HR positions in a company too are reserved for Women.

Infact during placement drives there are many companies who conduct ""Women only"" drives and straightaway exclude men from the hiring process.

So all the working women before proclaiming yourself as ""Strong Independent OverAchiever"" wake upto the reality. A lot of girls are gifted Jobs , they didnot earn it.

See the Data , the fresher Job placements for females skyrocketed despite overall weak job creation. This shows that A lot more number of women are hired than men even though there are 3-4 times more men in higher education and job seekers, This proves that women are hired at the expense of men.

Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by American computer scientists Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were PhD students at Stanford University in California. Together, they own about 14% of its publicly listed shares and control 56% of its stockholder voting power through super-voting stock. The company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is a holding company for Alphabet's internet properties and interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet.[14]
The company has since rapidly grown to offer a multitude of products and services beyond Google Search, many of which hold dominant market positions. These products address a wide range of use cases, including email (Gmail), navigation and mapping (Waze, Maps and Earth), cloud computing (Cloud), web navigation (Chrome), video sharing (YouTube), productivity (Workspace), operating systems (Android), cloud storage (Drive), language translation (Translate), photo storage (Photos), videotelephony (Meet), smart home (Nest), smartphones (Pixel), wearable technology (Pixel Watch and Fitbit), music streaming (YouTube Music), video on demand (YouTube TV), AI (Google Assistant and Gemini), machine learning APIs (TensorFlow), AI chips (TPU), and more. Discontinued Google products include gaming (Stadia), Glass, Google+, Reader, Play Music, Nexus, Hangouts, and Inbox by Gmail.[15][16] Google's other ventures outside of internet services and consumer electronics include quantum computing (Sycamore), self-driving cars (Waymo, formerly the Google Self-Driving Car Project), smart cities (Sidewalk Labs), and transformer models (Google DeepMind).[17]"
1fxzmwe,2,2024-10-07,The Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence Detectors in Academia,u/MaterObscura,u_MaterObscura,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MaterObscura/comments/1fxzmwe/the_use_of_generative_artificial_intelligence/,"As someone who has worked in both research and academia, and wholeheartedly believes in the integration of AI in these fields, I want to provide some current information on the use of AI detectors in academia.

I fully believe, as do many of my colleagues, that the use of AI detection software for the purpose of indictment within academia is unethical and should be rejected. Thankfully, there is a growing trend toward disallowing the use of AI detection systems, at least in higher education, with universities like MIT, Stanford, and Vanderbilt leading the way. This is being coupled with the integration of appropriate and ethical use of AI in the classroom, and fostering intrinsic motivation of academic integrity.

>Before I provide some resources, I’d like to encourage folks to investigate these academic articles and research articles independently, and look at the references, where provided, to get even more information. There is a LOT out there decrying the use of AI detectors and for many, many reasons. This is a very brief, but current list to get you started.

**Here are current academic articles regarding the use of AI detectors in academia.**

[https://cte.ku.edu/careful-use-ai-detectors](https://cte.ku.edu/careful-use-ai-detectors) - *Discusses the reason AI detectors should be used for indictment, and places the responsibility of the instructor in detecting AI use. It offers actionable alternatives instructors can use, both in how to appropriately use AI detectors and how to proceed if academic integrity is in question.*

[https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/teach/ai-detectors-dont-work/](https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/teach/ai-detectors-dont-work/) - *Discusses the problems with using AI detectors in academia, but focuses on appropriate teaching methods that integrate AI into academia, and fostering intrinsic integrity. Provides several other non-peer reviewed articles on the subject for a deeper dive into the matter.*

[https://hai.stanford.edu/news/ai-detectors-biased-against-non-native-english-writers](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/ai-detectors-biased-against-non-native-english-writers) - *Discusses the problems with AI detectors when evaluating writing from non-native English writers. This research has international implications, as well, since the most common AI detectors were trained on English data.*

[https://www.vanderbilt.edu/brightspace/2023/08/16/guidance-on-ai-detection-and-why-were-disabling-turnitins-ai-detector/](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/brightspace/2023/08/16/guidance-on-ai-detection-and-why-were-disabling-turnitins-ai-detector/) - *Discusses the discontinuation of using AI detection software, particularly Turnitin, and creating a paradigm shift by integrating AI into the classroom. It should be noted that Vanderbilt University is a leading AI university located in the Southern US. Many of the Computer Science professors actively research AI and publish regularly.*

**Here are actual research articles about AI detection.**

[https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15666](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15666) - *2023 Research tested multiple AI detectors and plagiarism detectors across multiple models and determined, with statistical significance, that the tested services are neither accurate nor reliable.*

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11156](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11156) - *2024 Research demonstrating that AI detectors are not reliable in practical academic scenarios, and further argues that they are vulnerable to adversarial spoofing, rendering them even more unreliable. The main take-away was that any student that really wanted to pass AI detection could do so easily, and the ease at which this is possible will increase as AI’s sophistication increases. It also points out that the method some AI detectors use is currently blackboxed (despite what many will tell you), and so the detection cannot be replicated, nor the methodology analyzed - which goes against scientific rigor.*

[https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02819](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02819) - *2023 Research indicating that AI detectors have a statistically significant bias against non-native English writers, but also touches on the ability for a skilled AI user to bypass detection all together. It strongly cautions against the use of AI detectors in academia.*

[https://edintegrity.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-023-00140-5](https://edintegrity.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-023-00140-5) - *2023 Research provided two results. The first result showed that AI detection became more difficult as the generative AI model advanced. There was a statistical difference between the content generated by ChatGPT 3.5 and content generated by ChatGPT 4. This positive correlation indicates that AI detectors will become increasingly unreliable with each iteration of the generative model. The second result demonstrated the inaccuracy of the AI detectors, which consistently provided false positives. It also provides more research articles as DOI links in the reference section.*

I will occasionally update this list and more information becomes available. I hope it helps someone."
1fxzo0h,1,2024-10-07,"How I Graduated College with No Internships, a Low GPA, and Multiple F’s — Yet Still Landed an IT Job",u/anonjit,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/1fxzo0h/how_i_graduated_college_with_no_internships_a_low/,"Let me be real with you. I was an awful college student, and it took me six long years to finally graduate. I’ve seen enough Reddit posts romanticizing college struggles, but this is not one of those stories. This is my rollercoaster of a journey through college, complete with failing grades, lack of motivation, and somehow still managing to find an IT job at the end.

It all started like any typical college experience. I was optimistic, motivated, and doing fairly well in my first year. Then 2020 hit, and COVID wrecked any drive I had. By the time my sophomore year rolled around, my motivation was completely gone. I stopped going to class, stopped doing homework—basically stopped caring about school altogether.

At one point, I seriously considered dropping out. When I told my mom, she broke down in tears and wouldn’t let me, so I stayed. But things only got worse. I kept failing classes, and eventually, I was placed on academic warning. That’s when I decided to switch my major from Computer Engineering to IT, hoping it would be a fresh start. Spoiler: It wasn’t.

COVID continued, and my academic career kept spiraling downward. Junior year? Flunked that too, with multiple F’s again. This time I was placed on academic probation, and I still didn’t care. I was convinced I was going to drop out anyway, but when I told my mom again, she refused to hear it. So, I stuck it out. My second semester of junior year was no better—I failed another class and stayed on probation.

Fast forward to senior year. Miraculously, I did great during my first semester. I finally felt like I was turning things around. But by the second semester, I hit a wall—Discrete Math. I bombed it and ended up on probation again. Honestly, I should’ve been kicked out, but COVID was considered an “extenuating circumstance” that saved me.

At that point, I was 22 and had no direction. That’s when I heard about cybersecurity and the big money people were making. I knew I needed to get serious. So, I buckled down and made sure I passed all my classes—mostly by cheating. By the time I pulled my GPA up enough to consider internships, it was too late. I had a 6-year degree with a transcript full of F’s, no internships, no experience, and no references.

I figured I was screwed in the job market. I didn’t have much to sell, but I had LinkedIn, and I wasn’t about to waste it. So, I optimized the hell out of my profile. I stretched every tiny project I had ever done in college into something impressive. That half-baked Excel sheet? “Data analysis and visualization project.” That Cloud-Based Inventory Management System app that i built? That was really just ChatGPT doing all the work. Yeah, I don’t even know how to code, but I upsold the heck out of it as “developed a Cloud-Based Inventory Management System mobile app.” I looked up coding languages because it seemed like the thing to do in IT, but let’s be honest—I was mostly winging it.

In total, I applied to over 1,000 jobs, expecting nothing. But, somehow, I got hired as a very low-tier Solutions Architect in Georgia. Sounds cool, right? Well, here’s the kicker—I don’t know jack about IT. The job pays in the low $20s an hour, and I’m basically learning as I go. (Actually received about 12 interviews since May but got rejected because of “no experience”). 

So yeah, college was a disaster. But hey, if I can manage to get a job after all that, maybe there’s hope for anyone. Even if you don’t have a clue what you’re doing. Also, my soft skills are carrying me right now🫡"

The Importance of Training



Training is a crucial step in developing an effective AI chatbot. Training involves exposing the chatbot to large amounts of data and allowing it to learn patterns and relationships. This process helps the chatbot improve its understanding of language and its ability to generate relevant and informative responses.



Data Collection and Preparation

Before training your chatbot, you will need to collect and prepare a suitable dataset. The dataset should include a variety of examples of conversations that the chatbot will encounter. Consider the following factors when collecting data:



Quantity: The dataset should be large enough to cover a wide range of topics and scenarios.

Quality: The data should be accurate, relevant, and representative of the conversations the chatbot will encounter.

Diversity: The dataset should include examples from different users, contexts, and language styles.

Annotation: For supervised learning, the data may need to be annotated with labels indicating the correct responses or intents.



Supervised Learning

Supervised learning involves training the chatbot on a labeled dataset. The chatbot is fed input data and the corresponding correct outputs. The model learns to map inputs to outputs by adjusting its parameters.



Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning involves training the chatbot on unlabeled data. The chatbot learns to identify patterns and relationships within the data without explicit guidance. This can be useful for tasks such as topic modeling and clustering.



Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning involves training the chatbot to make decisions based on rewards and punishments. The chatbot learns to maximize rewards by taking actions that lead to positive outcomes. This can be useful for training chatbots to engage in interactive conversations.



Fine-Tuning

Once the chatbot has been trained on a large dataset, it may need to be fine-tuned on a smaller, more specific dataset. This can help the chatbot improve its performance on particular tasks or domains.

1fy4tye,1,2024-10-07,Professors using tech to teach:  Shortcuts and hacks,u/West_Abrocoma9524,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1fy4tye/professors_using_tech_to_teach_shortcuts_and_hacks/,"Hoping others might have advice and support to offer.  I'd love to hear from others who are using ChatGPT, NotebookLM, etc.  in their teaching.  I recently made a list of problems I saw in a whole batch of student papers and then fed it to NotebookLM and had it make a podcast about how to write a better paper next time, which I plan to share with my online students.  I'm trying to figure out the best way to share it in Canvas, however.  I'm also a bit wary about the fact that all of my accounts on these services are private accounts and not university accounts.  I am an early adopter of technology but my university is dragging its feet and doesn't really have any policies in place.  Is anyone else nervous about using new tech in these circumstances?"
1fy54kn,1,2024-10-07,[D] Flexible compute  deployment based on task complexity,u/Karioth1,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1fy54kn/d_flexible_compute_deployment_based_on_task/,"Hello ML people. I’m a cognitive science student working at the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning. Probably one of the coolest things about the brain is just how freaking efficient it is for what it can accomplish— running on lightbulb. To my understanding, this likely comes from not using all parameters if it is unnecessary for the task. So far, the only ML approach that I have found akin to this has been Mixture of Experts. 
Aside from that, in Deep Learning, optimising the inference process seems to be somewhat neglected — usually just using all parameters regardless of top down context or input statistics. 

I’m almost sure I am wrong, so I was hoping you guys could point me to good papers delving into this? Or perhaps the formal name of the problem? As an example, you might take an LLM. If the prediction of the next word in a sentence is simple (e.g. herbivores eat [plants]) I might not need all parameters to get a perfectly good prediction (Claude and LLama would likely do equally fine, but Claude cost more to solve this one), as opposed to one that is more technical and requires more attention and context into the processing (e.g., solving a mathematical proof).

1fy613i,3,2024-10-07,Building Side Projects into Startups: Lessons from a 15-Year Journey,u/sgasser88,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1fy613i/building_side_projects_into_startups_lessons_from/,"I recently shared my story on r/SideProject , and wanted to offer some insights to the startup community here.

Fifteen years ago, I was a pretty lost student. School just didn’t click for me, and I eventually dropped out. Fast forward to now, and I’m running my own AI startup. It’s been a long and unexpected journey, and I thought I’d share some of that with you all—just in case anyone else out there feels like they're not following the ""traditional"" path.

# School Didn’t Work, But Coding Did

To be honest, I hated school. I wasn’t good at it, and it didn’t feel like it was leading me anywhere. But then I stumbled into coding, and everything changed. I got into PHP and started learning frameworks like Symfony and Laravel on my own. That was really the beginning of everything for me.

Here’s a rough timeline of how things played out:

* **2009–2012**: Web Developer at R3 GIS – My first coding job.
* **2012–2020**: Backend Web Developer at ADDITIVE – I was the first developer, building the infrastructure and core software from the ground up.
* **2019**: Launched *AutoIdle* as a side project – My first step into entrepreneurship.
* **2020–2022**: Team Lead at ADDITIVE – Managed the development team and oversaw product builds.
* **2022–2024**: Head of Software at ADDITIVE – Led the entire software department.
* **2024**: Launched *MailWizard* and left ADDITIVE to focus on it full-time.

Looking back, it’s been a long, winding road with a lot of trial and error. It took me a while to realize that the traditional route wasn’t for me, but finding something I actually enjoyed—coding—completely shifted my mindset.

# The Road of Many (Failed) Side Projects

Before *AutoIdle*, there were a lot of failed side projects. I spent years trying out different ideas, hoping one of them would take off, but none of them ever really got users. I built *Zebrello*, a news reader that was supposed to deliver articles based on your interests. There was also a recipe app I thought could help organize meal planning, and an app to sell used items on multiple platforms like eBay and Facebook Marketplace. But despite my efforts, these projects never made it beyond a small group of supportive friends.

Honestly, it was frustrating. I'd work on these side projects during weekends and vacations, only to hit roadblocks when it came to getting them out there. But I learned something from each attempt, even if they didn’t go anywhere.

One thing I’ve found: vacations and stepping away from work are often when the best ideas come to me. In fact, *AutoIdle* itself was born during a Christmas vacation when I finally cleared my head and saw things from a new perspective.

# Turning a Side Project Into Something More: AutoIdle

When I built *AutoIdle* in 2019, I didn’t expect much. It was a Heroku add-on that idles unused apps to save resources. The idea was simple—useful for some people, but not groundbreaking. I threw it together over a holiday break, and at first, it seemed like just another side project that might fizzle out.

But over time, *AutoIdle* slowly started gaining traction. It wasn’t an overnight success, but people found it valuable, and by 2021, it had started turning a profit. It wasn’t huge, but it was enough to show me that I could build something people would pay for. After years of failed attempts, *AutoIdle* was the first side project that felt like it had real potential.

More than anything, it gave me the confidence to keep going and the belief that I could build something on my own terms.

# The AI Experiment That Turned Into MailWizard

Earlier this year, I was getting really fed up with how much time I spent writing emails. I tried using some AI tools, but nothing really worked the way I wanted. So, I figured, why not just build something myself? That’s how *MailWizard* started.

At first, I just saw it as another side project, but the more I worked on it, the more I felt like this could be something bigger. I eventually decided to quit my job and focus on it full-time. It was scary as hell, but sometimes you just have to take that leap.

# The AI Learning Curve: From GPT-4 to Claude

When I started building *MailWizard*, I was using GPT-4 like a lot of people, but after a while, I realized it wasn’t the right fit for what I needed. That’s when I found out about Claude from Anthropic, and after testing it, I made the switch. It’s been a better fit for the app, and it’s helped me take the project to the next level.

I actually wrote a blog series about the whole process. If you're curious about the details, please comment and I will share the link with you.

# The Toughest Part Isn't the Code

One thing I’ve learned is that the technical stuff, while challenging, isn’t the hardest part. What’s really tough is marketing and getting users. With *AutoIdle*, Heroku’s marketplace handled a lot of the visibility. But with *MailWizard*, it’s all on me to find users and get the word out. It’s been a huge learning curve, and I’m still figuring it out.

# Reflecting on 15 Years

If you had told me 15 years ago, when I was failing at school, that I’d be running an AI startup one day, I wouldn’t have believed you. I’m still learning, still figuring things out, but the fact that I’ve gotten this far feels like a win in itself.

At this point, *AutoIdle* provides me with a stable income, which is a relief, but my main focus is on growing *MailWizard* and seeing where I can take it.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that you don’t have to follow the ""traditional"" path to succeed. If you're into tech but feel like you're not fitting into the usual career boxes, it's totally possible to carve your own way. Just keep going, keep learning, and don’t be afraid to take risks. You never know where it might lead.

As I continue to grow MailWizard, I'm eager to connect with other founders here. What strategies have worked for you in transitioning from a side project to a full-fledged startup? How are you handling the challenges of user acquisition and marketing? Let's share our experiences and learn from each other."
1fy6pho,1,2024-10-07,I want suggetions for my machine learning quest,u/miftadib04,learnmachinelearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1fy6pho/i_want_suggetions_for_my_machine_learning_quest/,"

 I am a Statistics 1st year undergrad student (have not started classes yet).I have spent last 3-4 months on machine learning.


 What I learned is: 

 Python
 Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn
 Data preprocessing + feature engineering
 Data visualization
 Machine Learning Algorithms
 ML metrics, hyperparameter tuning etc. 

 Learned from:
 1)Machine Learning specialization (includes 3 courses)- By Stanford on Coursera
 2) 100 days of machine learning (playlist)-By CampusX on Youtube 

 3)Machine Learning with Python and Scikit- Learn-Full course(18 hours)- By FreeCodeCamp.org on Youtube 

 I will learn more in the future + I am thinking of revising what I have learned and doing projects on kaggle. 

 Problem:
 The problem is that I didn't learn math and statistics separately for machine learning.
 I do understand how most of the algorithms work but have skipped all the mathematical proofs . I know scikit learn for the applications of the algorithms, but I find it difficult to build them from scratch. 
 Besides, in most cases I cannot hardcode Python, I have to take help of chatgpt. 

 The things I seek advice on are:
 1) Should I learn Stats or Maths before starting doing projects? 

 2) Should I learn to build algorithms from scratch? (Eg: linear regression, logistic regression, xgboost etc) 

 3) What can I do to improve hardcoding? 

 4) What or how many projects I should do? 

 5) On what,I should more focus right now?

 6) If you have other suggestions, please give them"

1fy7ck1,21,2024-10-07,"Dear Professors/teachers, would you consider asking ChatGPT for help with R cheating?",u/h0llowsp1ne,RStudio,https://www.reddit.com/r/RStudio/comments/1fy7ck1/dear_professorsteachers_would_you_consider_asking/,"I am a biology student currently working on an assignment that requires RStudio for data visualization. With having seen this program for the first time ever on Friday and having zero experience with similar things, it surely is daunting to work with - especially when you're immediately handed a graded homework...
I spent the last 5 hours or so working on it by asking ChatGPT for help with the general use of RStudio and so far, not only has it been more helpful than my class, but it's also getting me to a point where I find it actually fun to twist my mind around it. I really have to learn this all from scratch, so it is relieving to be able to ask the most basic questions. 
However I am a bit worried if it is unethical to use AI for this. I'm still the one coming up with the questions and the concept of graphs, but I doubt I could have realized it without ChatGPT. 

What would you say? I even consider approaching the professor next time I see him to be honest about this, but maybe that's exaggerated and not a good idea?"
1fy7th6,4,2024-10-07,Need HELP!! Read out I might also be able to answer any of your career ques also..,u/shadow_twilight00,pakistan,https://www.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1fy7th6/need_help_read_out_i_might_also_be_able_to_answer/,"So hear me out

I did bachelors from Nust in mechanical Eng. and now have been graduated since two years and doing a normie job (small company). I didnt like many subjects of mech engineering and had in my mind that i will switch to cs side and do a MS in cs related field, i was okie in engineering but like not very good as i thought i would be, gpa also around 3. getting into mech engineering was tough, merit was high that time so just thought maybe this is good, parents also said you got in highest merit so i just said yeah  I can study so might as well just go.  Now i realize it isn't for me as i had to put effort to get through and well i feel like as years will pass by my skills might not improve as much. Furthermore I am not into oil fields ,powerplants/manufacturing factory stuff also so more office/within city work/job is preferred. I feel like i can just study and give exams and learn stuff and implementing doing work under someone for more than sometime is not for me., or I can not keep this doing for long.

I always thought of not giving up that is why i endured engineering, endured nust entry test and secured top marks and thought it would end but maybe giving up and switching earlier would have been better. 

I did sit some hrs to study each day, but it never came to me that what i would do at work, it just felt this esteemed degree that required effort would make things good maybe, and maybe my parents also believed. Aside during my undergrad i did try video editing, basic animations, photography stuff but just basic level, nothing much i guess, wasting time perhaps.

I did apply to MS (in cs/ai related field) outside of pak and got admits from some good universities. But due to some reasons I could not go this year. This at first I thought gave me time to learn cs/ai/coding stuff and not just think its cool. Also maybe i did engineering coz I thought it would be good to go outside of Pak and study at top ranking university, but i never reflected/ thought about what i would be really working . professionaly all life. But now as days pass i don't even know whether going abroad would be good, the reality is that its not walk in the park abroad too and before i just did not realize it. Moreover i can write good English and can communicate and have bachelors from good uni in pak that is why got admit in MS programs even though my field is different (this is just what I think).

Anyways was looking into programing stuff etc  did some basic courses on python going through basic concepts till object oriented programming, and first it seemed cool but idk i feel like that is also kinda difficult and weird sitting looking at screen and not being able to think logic solutions everyday. I feel like there is a lot to learn and lot of stuff to learn in this field, and i don't know if i can or how much time will it take or even if I will be able to learn+implementthe things. Just too much is out there and I cant even get by the basics. I learnt some concepts but writing code with chatgpt or copying seems out of box( even small stuff). Also maths is something I now feel i am and was not good at maths and ML/AI stuff requires math to be good at it in the long run and that makes me rethink stuff. And the incoming of AI and news bombardment creeps me out and the idea of just required to learn all along your career just makes me rethink whether I will survive or not or be good at it.

I don't know if I'm early or maybe i am just not like up to mark or dumb. I do like to study stuff up, memorize and have knowledge about things in general. But I think coming up with great solutions or computer programming or mech Eng. stuff is different thing as compared to gaining knowledge and just liking to know different concepts and stuff in details and doing them for own sake not under someone for an earning.

I did study and passed exams, did good enough projects also but I feel like i was stuck in a daydream and never did looked at things realistically. I did education for education's sake maybe and that now did not turn out right People around me also said that you were fine because i was just going straight, no backlogs and passing classes as I go. So I thought maybe this is how it is and things will adjust. Moreover no backlogs so i was just doing getting degree at a 'good age'(22). I was caught in thinking that once you choose something you do it completely, following a linear path and i could not drop and switch things. But well here we now.



So recently after all this, realized maybe i should have done medical(dentistry) because you don't have to sit on computer thinking about logical solution. the work is hands on and you interact with humans and most importantly work has limit once done it is done you don't have to open your laptop again and like procrastinate/guilt yourself in not working/learning at home. One more thing as compared to cs/ai side is that you work 1 kind of job not changing stuff/languages industry/jobs etc etc, you just take care of dental stuff and learn+practice regarding it.  Do your own practice. Someone very close (very close, in my home) to me is also a dentist so maybe I know stuff a bit. I know this field is also difficult and not every doctor is good but I don't know why this thought comes up to me now a days.  Am I too late? I thought one of reason of choosing engineering (aside from going abroad) was that engineering would not be boring but that was till university & projects after that it just seems too much(as mentioned above). I feel medical is a better field and compsci stuff is just weird and unnecessary.  (This thought never came up to me till 4 months ago I found compsci/robotics/ML etc stuff to be pretty useful and not unnecessary).



Or are these thoughts temporary or are coming to me because right now I am stuck (because of abroad and  cs switch situation) , coz i mean studying engineering (knowledge seeking) was not so bad but why this thought about being a doctor is coming up to me now, when it is too late.



Well if i start what would be the process, do my fsc/matric scores would count now after such a long time. (moreover now students get a lot higher marks after covid, i had about 89% fsc, 93% in matric). Taking entry test is the barrier coz i cant pay the fee of private medical colleges. Is there a way i could utilize my degree to switch credit transferring stuff ? And overall would it be worth it coz like it will take 6 years to do. 



Or should I just go do MS in cs/ai related stuff?  (Honestly if I could just get into dentistry school I would but the entrance test and other stuff is a hassle and maybe I am old for it now, for giving entry test at this age? Is this temporary and i should just focus on learning coding stuff and get into MS here or abroad? fulfilment issue or just temporary running away from learning cs/programming stuff?



Kindly share your thoughts about the questions I have posed regarding all of the things above, and are these thoughts temporary because of my current situation or not ?

I was an awful college student, and it took me six long years to finally graduate. I've seen enough Reddit posts romanticizing college struggles, but this is not one of those stories. This is my rollercoaster of a journey through college, complete with falling grades, lack of motivation, and somehow still managing to find an IT job at the end.
It all started like any typical college experience. I was optimistic, motivated, and doing fairly well in my first year. Then 2020 hit, and COVID wrecked any drive I had. By the time my sophomore year rolled around, my motivation was completely gone. I stopped going to class, stopped doing homework-basically stopped caring about school altogether.

At one point, I seriously considered dropping out. When I told my mom, she broke down in tears and wouldn't let me, so l stayed. But things only got worse. I kept failing classes, and eventually, I was placed on academic warning. That's when I decided to switch my major from Computer Engineering to IT, hoping it would be a fresh start. Spoiler: It wasn't.

COVID continued, and my academic career kept spiraling downward. Junior year? Flunked that too, with multiple F's again. This time I was placed on academic probation, and I still didn't care. I was convinced I was going to drop out anyway, but when I told my mom again, she refused to hear it. So, I stuck it out. My second semester of junior year was no better-| faileu another class and stayed on probation.

Fast forward to senior year. Miraculously, I did great during my first semester. I finally felt like I was turning things around. But by the second semester, I hit a wall-Discrete Math. I bombed it and ended up on probation again. Honestly, I should've been kicked out, but COVID was considered an ""extenuating circumstance"" that saved me.


At that point, I was 22 and had no direction. That's when I heard about cybersecurity and the big money people were making. I knew I needed to get serious. So, I buckled down and made sure I passed all my classes— mostly by cheating. By the time I pulled my GPA up enough to consider internships, it was too late. I had a
6-year degree with a transcript full of F's, no internships, no experience, and no references.

I figured I was screwed in the job market. I didn't have much to sell, but I had Linkedin, and I wasn't about to waste it. So, I optimized the hell out of my profile. I stretched every tiny project I had ever done in college into something impressive. That half-baked Excel sheet? ""Data analysis and visualization project."" That Cloud-Based Inventory Management System app that i built? That was really just ChatGPT doing all the work.
Yeah, I don't even know how to code, but l upsold the heck out of it as ""developed a Cloud-Based Inventory Management System mobile app."" | looked up coding languages because it seemed like the thing to do in IT, but let's be honest—| was mostly winging it.
In total, I applied to over 1,000 jobs, expecting nothing.

But, somehow, I got hired as a very low-tier Solutions Architect in Georgia. Sounds cool, right? Well, here's the kicker-I don't know jack about IT. The job pays in the low $20s an hour, and I'm basically learning as I go.
(Actually received about 12 interviews since May but got rejected because of ""no experience"").
So yeah, college was a disaster. But hey, if I can manage to get a job after all that, maybe there's hope for anyone. Even if you don't have a clue what you're doing. Also, SOFT SKILLS ARE EVERYTHING 🫡"

1fybl7n,1,2024-10-07,Advice on who to get LOR from?,u/Top-Distribution8766,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1fybl7n/advice_on_who_to_get_lor_from/,"I'm currently kind of torn between my AP Lang and IB econ teacher for my humanities rec, any advice would be appreciated!

AP Lang teacher:

pros: 

had a one year long 1-on-1 project mentored by her -> it was a pretty good project too, got grants & awards and allat

did pretty well in the course (not a crazy high A but good relative to everyone else)

AP Lang is considered a difficult course at my school, so ig i could maybe have demonstrated more of my ability in this course or wtvr

English is kinda a small spike in my extracurriculars - I'm applying STEM but ig it's good to have a somewhat cohesive narrative w the extracurriculars and the letters

English is a tinnyyyy bit more related to my major (both are unrelated but i'm guessing AOs would look for english skills more than econ skills for my major)

  
cons: 

dont think i really got to connect with the teacher a lot on a personal level. maybe I connected with her more than other students, but in general she's just the typa teacher who doesn't really get rlly close to her students.

i just get the general gut feeling that she isn't a good LOR writer. idk how to explain it. maybe she might use chatgpt or smth?

i basically didn't speak much in class because I had one friend there, so I don't think I really displayed much of my personality in the class. 

  
IB Econ teacher:

pros: 

I displayed a lot more personality in this class - i joked around with the teacher sometimes, actually had friends here so talked a lot more, was chiller in general ig

i just get the vibe that he is a stronger LOR writer.

did very well in the course

i think i made a good impression by attending all the HL classes despite being SL - our school has a system where SL and HL kids are in the same class, and SL kids get to skip a class once a week or smth.

cons: 

this is the main concern - i basically had no relationship with the teacher outside of class, and so i feel like the teacher has nothing to talk about but my performance in class. this isn't really good bc i don't just want him writing smth like ""she got a super high A in my class blah blah"" 

i took the SL course which is considered a very easy course at my school. so no course rigor. also i think this by default makes me academically not stand out because there were lots of HL kids in my class

i dont think i stood out to this teacher as much as i did to my AP Lang teacher. this teacher was really close to some of his other students - even moreso than me. "

ChatGPT translation:

>A case of school bullying occurred at Meilian Secondary School, where a Secondary 1 girl’s right eardrum was ruptured.

>The incident took place last Thursday (October 3rd) during the lunch break. A Secondary 1 girl from Meilian Secondary School was called by an upper-grade girl to meet at the void deck of Block 541 on Pasir Ris Street 51, near the school. When she arrived, she found six people waiting there. Following instructions from four boys, two girls beat and slapped her for nearly 20 minutes, until a passerby noticed and stopped the assault, calling the police, which ended the bullying.

>The victim’s father, Zhou Yueliang (53, a luxury taxi driver), told *Lianhe Zaobao* in an interview that, in addition to the six bullies, there were nine other onlookers at the scene. After the passerby called the police, civil defense personnel took his daughter to KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital for treatment, where he learned about the incident from the police.

>Father fears daughter’s hearing may not recover, plans to take legal action against the bullying.

>He recalled that when he saw his daughter that day, she had bruises around her eyes and neck, and kept telling him her right ear hurt and she couldn’t hear clearly. The doctor’s initial advice was to observe her condition, so Zhou Yueliang discharged his daughter from the hospital early in the morning.

>The next day, around 10:30 AM, on their way to a follow-up appointment at the hospital, his daughter’s right ear suddenly discharged an unknown fluid. After an X-ray at the hospital, they found that her right eardrum had ruptured.

>Zhou Yueliang stated that in the days following the incident, the entire family has felt both outraged and anxious. Although they regularly go to the hospital for follow-up appointments, and he and his wife apply medicated wine daily to their daughter’s injuries, most of her external wounds have healed, but her hearing in the right ear has not recovered. He is worried that even if her eardrum heals, her hearing will never be the same.

>He mentioned that the surveillance footage from the void deck captured the entire bullying incident involving the six people. He revealed that once the police investigation makes progress, they will definitely take legal action and file charges.

>School says they have reported the incident to the police and taken disciplinary action.

>Meilian Secondary School Principal Mohamed Razali B Abdul Hamed responded to *Lianhe Zaobao’s* inquiry, stating that the school is aware of the incident and has reported it to the police. According to the school, the incident involved a student who sustained an ear injury after a dispute with two other students. ""The school has been closely monitoring the injured student’s condition and has taken disciplinary action against the students involved, including the onlookers.""

>The Singapore Police Force confirmed when contacted that a report has been filed, and the case is still under investigation.

>This is at least the second recent school bullying case. On September 23rd, a male student from Qihua Primary School was cornered and bullied at the stairwell. Five boys were arrested for allegedly causing a public disturbance."

The approach is refined through careful ablation studies on the MATH dataset, revealing several key insights. The proposed chain-of-thought solution format outperforms Llama’s format by 3.9% while being 40% shorter. Data generated by a strong teacher model surpasses on-policy data from a weaker student model by 7.8%. The method demonstrates robustness to up to 20% of low-quality data, and increasing question diversity significantly improves performance.

The dataset is created using Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct to synthesize solutions for existing MATH and GSM8K questions and generate new question-solution pairs. A thorough decontamination process, including the lm-sys pipeline and manual inspection, ensures test set integrity. The resulting dataset comprises 14 million question-solution pairs, including 592,000 synthesized questions, making it about eight times larger than previous open-source datasets. The effectiveness of OpenMathInstruct-2 is demonstrated by the superior performance of fine-tuned models, with OpenMath2-Llama3.1-8B outperforming Llama3.1-8B-Instruct by 15.9% on the MATH benchmark....

1fyqscy,19,2024-10-07,I've been self-learning for 18 months but am now in my first community college python class. How do I get the most benefit from the instructor? I wasted the first half of the semester it feels like 🤦‍♂️,u/SanguinarianPhoenix,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1fyqscy/ive_been_selflearning_for_18_months_but_am_now_in/,"He does zoom calls once per week and asks students to submit their questions live during the zoom call. But I feel like I'm not doing enough. I've sent 2-3 minor emails (one was asking about docstrings) but I feel like the class has just been a series of following tutorials and answering test-bank style quiz questions. 

In other words, what should I be doing in my remaining 7 weeks of the class to get as much benefit from the professor and improve my programming skills and DS&A knowledge? Learning on my own has taught me to rely solely on google (and now chatGPT/Claude). I was thinking about showing up to his office hours and just bringing a list of questions approved by this subreddit to have a conversation with a smart guy who has 20+ years of industry experience and just have an open-ended conversation.

Does this sound like a good idea? My main goal this semester was to somehow learn more about data structures and algorithms as this is a VERY beginner-level class at a community college and half the assignments are just cruft & padding (like re-using the alignment stuff in f-strings) such as this:

    print(f""{""Discount:"":<20}"", f""{quantity_discount:>12.0%}"", sep="""")
    print(f""{""Original Price:"":<20}"", f""{original_price:>12}"", sep="""")
    print(f""{""Money Saved:"":<20}"", f""{money_saved:>12}"", sep="""")
    print(f""{""Price With Discount:"":<20}"", f""{price_with_discount:>12}"", sep="""")

Half of the assignments each week are just ""filler tasks"" that add a couple hours to the assignment but don't really teach anything new. It's a community college class in a rural area where the [average student](https://i.imgur.com/GZNssG9.png) would make a failing grade at a top university. 

I'm primarily seeking an RN (nursing degree) as a backup plan but would love to be a programmer instead. How do I better utilize my opportunities this semester being in an actual python programming class?"

1fyt8ki,1,2024-10-08,AI NPCs in WoW PvP – What Do You Think? Win a WoW Token!,u/Plougz,worldofpvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldofpvp/comments/1fyt8ki/ai_npcs_in_wow_pvp_what_do_you_think_win_a_wow/,"Hi everyone!   
I’m Rasmus Ploug, a master’s student studying Game Development and Learning Technology at the University of Southern Denmark. I’m currently in my 9th semester, and I’m working on a research project about the future of AI-driven NPCs in World of Warcraft. With the latest expansion, The War Within, we’ve seen a shift towards more single-player-focused content for casual players, like Follower-Dungeons and Delves. My goal is to explore how LLM-driven NPCs (powered by advanced language models like ChatGPT) could enhance player experiences in these and other areas of the game.   
  
To do this, I’ve created a questionnaire aimed at understanding what features WoW players would find most relevant or irrelevant in AI companions. Your feedback will help shape practical guidelines for integrating these LLM-driven NPCs in future content.   
  
**Why participate?**   
You’ll be contributing to research that could influence the future of NPCs in games! You’ll get a chance to voice your opinion on what makes AI companions fun, useful, or even annoying. As a thank you, I’m giving away 2x WoW Tokens—one for NA and one for EU—randomly to participants who complete the survey! If you have a few minutes to spare, I’d really appreciate your input. Your insights will be invaluable to my research.

1fzeuno,17,2024-10-08,How I got the big (provisional) C in the CISSP.  ,u/euroburningmynetwork,cissp,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/1fzeuno/how_i_got_the_big_provisional_c_in_the_cissp/,"Been mostly a lurker around here but this sub helped me out a lot in my journey so I want to give back and hopefully help someone else out!



I provisionally passed today at 100 questions under 2 hours. 

  
**Background:** been blue team infosec through and through since my start 11 years ago. Mostly research positions, SOC analyst & manager, and reverse engineer career wise. Got a DFIR cert back in 2015 and no other certs of note. 

  
**Training Resources:**

*Thor Teaches:*

I started off using Thor's videos. These were fantastic for someone with a more technical background. I've done a lot of work with people that are either ESL or have thick accents so his speech was not a problem for me. He was very thorough and explained things that made translating them into ""manager speak"" pretty easy. 

  
*FR Secure CISSP Mentor Program*

This was next up and I did it live this last spring. With this, you get what you pay for - which its free... so. Some of the instructors were amazing and I would have paid money to get full courses from them. Others were pretty bad at teaching and would ramble on and on about pointless stories or anecdotes. Where this came in clutch for me was being able to further develop the infosec/IT management approach because all of the instructors came from real backgrounds. I would recommend this as a supplemental resource and not a primary. 

  
*Training Camp/Eric Beasley*

My job randomly decided that I need to get a cert before the end of the year and said to name a training and cert and they would pay for it. So I chose to go for this based on some colleague's recommendations. Where FR Secure lacked in teaching ability, Eric crushed it. He is exceptionally adept at teaching the concepts and simplifying them. A lot of knowledge items that I struggled with clicked when he explained them. Where this falls short is the management tie in, it was hammered in to ""think like a manager"" but little exposition was given on what that looks like. He also suffers from what I know as the ""seasoned teacher + stale curriculum"" problem. He has taught this so many times that it is pretty difficult to get him to explain things out - he states the obvious but fails to restate if the obvious doesn't make sense to the students. Multiple students tried to get him to explain things differently and were met with very unhelpful responses - most of the time he would just cut students off before they even finished their questions assuming he knew what they were going to ask (5/10 he didn't and it was painful to watch). 

  
All that being said. This course was great and probably the 2nd most helpful of all my studies. Fair warning though, to make the most out of it I would say that you should have gone through the material at least once before attending. 

  
*Sybex Official Study Guide*

Read through this in between the FR Secure Program and the bootcamp. This was only helpful in creating long-term memorization through iterating the information again. 

  
*Pocket Prep* 

3rd most helpful resource. I scrubbed all social media and games from my phone a month before the exam and any time I went to pick up my phone it was to do practice questions. This worked great as a replacement for flashcards. The mock exams were surprisingly helpful in prepping me for exam. 



*ChatGPT/AI*

Invaluable tool for this exam. Anytime I didn't understand a concept or practice question I ran it through chadgpt and argued back in forth with it until I understood what was going on or why I was wrong. I had it explain things different ways and I can honestly say that this was the most important tool in my study.  



**Exam Day Strats/Tips:**

I went through Eric Conrads exam cram video twice, once early in the morning and then on the drive in as a ""warmup"" (my testing center was an hour away).

  
Memorize your own cheat sheet of difficult to remember items and crank it out in the 3 minutes while your supposed to read the agreement. I struggled remembering the different confidentiality/integrity models so I memorized examples/mnemonics that put down. I didn't end up needing them, but I would have been up a creek without them if I had.  

Day before: drink plenty of water and eat healthy. Day of: eat healthy. Eliminate any possibility of distractions during the exam. Don't go out and get super spicy food that is going to net you on the toilet. 

 **Final Recommendations:**

***There is no substitute for experience!*** I think a lot of people that I know who have sat this exam and failed did so because they took the exam too early in their career. What helped me the most was having lived the situations that questions were asking. If you are barely scratching the 4 year mark for your requirements, maybe go after another cert, get some experience and come back with a grayer beard. Unless you are in a graduate program, I wouldn't recommend sitting the exam to become an associate or if you are a unicorn. 

  
***Its not hard, its just a lot.*** One of the big hurdles in this is the breadth on information and your ability to apply said information. Most of the info is simple and easier to digest if you have a tech background. What is hard is wrangling it inside of your head that you don't forget and can pull it out of your memory. 



***""Think like a manager"" is crap. THINK LIKE A BUSINESS OWNER.*** I see this advice everywhere, but I think the better way to approach it is through a business owner/CEO or entrepreneur mentality. There was an odd amount of advice that watching Alex Hormozi videos and others of that type earlier in life that helped me in the exam. Which wasn't because they had something profound about infosec, its just business speak and being able to understand, communicate, and talk that way is another aspect of the cert.  

  
***Greater effort in = results.*** Since this is a CAT exam you can almost think of it as a competitive exam. ISC2 wants a portion of people to fail in order to keep the prestige of the exam - its tailored to punish you. Estimates that I've heard around vary that the exam has a 50% to 65% pass rate.  That means that you have to put in more effort than 50% of people to pass. If you aren't collecting experience, actually learning/understanding, or grinding at something to help you on the cert like you want it more than 50% of other test takers, don't bother sitting it. 



All in all, this was a great experience pursing the exam, looking forward to being numbered with y'all. For those of you that are on your journey to getting the big C, godspeed and good luck! "

1fzk575,1,2024-10-09,Are grades easier with split grading(assignment/test/exams)?,u/idontcaretbhxxx,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1fzk575/are_grades_easier_with_split/,"As a European student, im quite confused by the grading system used abroad. Due to the availability of online courses within CS/Software, i've gotten a bit of insight into the structure of US courses, but the grading seems a little odd to me, especially in regards to whether its easier/tougher than here.

I see final exams being less/way less than 50% on average, with assignments/problem sets making up a huge part of the grade, whereas its 100% final exam being your grade here.

Now i dont wanna draw any assumptions as to whether i have it ""tougher"" based on own experience, but i also cant see how this wont be gamed by students, heavily relying on getting a passing grade/close to passing purely off non test results? especially in a time like today with chatgpt being used by most students.

I know that alot of my fellow students are overly reliant on AI, and will/have crashed actual exams due to it. Doesnt this churn out students that havent truly learned their material?

This isnt a hit at the system, just purely a question as to how the experience is using this system. Do you(US students) feel that classes are easier/tougher based on the proportion of credits throughout classes, and do you feel your fellow students are learning enough or kinda cheating themselves at times?"

1fzupo2,9,2024-10-09,Why Am I Struggling Despite My Efforts in Placements ?,u/A_limitlessMe,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/1fzupo2/why_am_i_struggling_despite_my_efforts_in/,"I am a 2024 MCA graduate from a tier 3 college in Greater Noida, and I come from a lower-middle-class family in a small town near the area. I studied in a Hindi-medium school under the UP board until the 12th grade, but my passion for technology has been my driving force.I think I am suffering from serious badluck.

During my BCA, I spent a lot of time figuring out what to do and how to navigate the field. By the time I finished, I felt confident that I would land a decent job either through campus placements or off-campus opportunities. I focused primarily on DSA, believing that it would be the key to securing on-campus placements—but that was my first mistake, as companies didn’t even ask for it.

Another challenge was that MCA students were treated differently compared to BTech students in most colleges in Greater Noida, leading to fewer on-campus placement opportunities. But this didn’t deter me; I was decent in DSA, and during my final year, I started learning development (thanks to Harkirat’s cohort). I built some solid projects in the MERN stack and even a machine learning project. Yet, despite my efforts, it felt like none of it mattered.

When Accenture came for placements, something went wrong with my registration form, and I couldn’t take the test. After that, many companies only asked students to fill out Google forms and then ghosted us. Eventually, I got shortlisted for an internship at a startup that was building a supply chain platform using the MERN stack. I got selected, but due to miscommunication between the company and my college about the stipend, my offer was revoked. Still, I stayed hopeful, thinking something better was on the way.

Then Capgemini arrived. I prepared thoroughly, focusing on DSA and computer science topics, but they shortlisted students based on games and grammar tests. I didn’t make it past the first round. Yet, I remained optimistic because TCS NQT was coming, and I had successfully cracked it during my BCA, though I had declined the Ninja offer back then. This time, I was aiming for the top.

On the NQT day, I was thrilled to see three DSA questions, two based on hashing and one on two pointers—questions I had solved multiple times on LeetCode. But the TCS compiler failed to run any of my solutions, and I couldn’t figure out why. The lack of error messages left me stuck, and that day shattered me, as I had been so close to an 11 LPA package.

After that, I couldn’t focus on DSA anymore, and I dropped out of Cohort-2 after learning React. It took me months to recover. In September, I applied to IBM and completed their test with all test cases passing, but I was ghosted again. The same thing happened with Blue Flame when they visited our campus.

I kept applying off-campus, but more companies ghosted me. Meanwhile, all five of my college friends secured jobs—two at Accenture, the others at Capgemini. But not me.

Despite all this, I’m still confident and working hard on my skills, pushing myself to improve every day. But there are moments when I wonder:

Why me?
What did I do wrong?
When did things go off track?

I’ve also come to realize that having a mentor would make things so much easier. Unfortunately, bad luck struck again, and I don’t have one. But I know I need a mentor, now more than ever.

So if I rant on someone or something, don't be sad, it's not about my singularity boys. I love you.

This is going to be a looooong post reviewing around 11 research papers on the topic of ""Understanding"" in the context of LLMs. If you hate reading, check out this NotebookLM with all the sources to chat with and Podcast to listen to included! https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/7ab05f1f-6256-4d7b-9072-5030de7e78fa?hl=en (It took like 20 generations until I got a decent podcast!

I’ve selected sources that are accessible for hobbyists and are published by a top university or Google. If you’re not as dumb as a rock and can handle basic logic and math, you’ll grasp the core ideas in these papers. 
Also to facilitate better understanding some parts are not exactly 100% accurate to the linked paper, but I tried to keep it as close as possible while still being understandable by the layman.

Let’s dive in.


---------------------------------------

## Intro

So, the recent thread about Hinton made me question the sub's (and my) sanity.

For those out of the loop, Nobel Prize winner Hinton, the ""godfather of AI,"" mentioned in his speech that he hopes his words, that LLMs understand, now carry more weight, especially regarding risks and possibilities.

When I heard him, I thought he was talking about how the average Joe has no clue what LLMs can and can’t do. It’s tough to explain, so good for him. ""Nobel Prize Winner"" is quite a credential for the Joes out there.

What I didn’t expect was this sub to completely implode. And for what reason? There are more than 30 papers on LLM ""mental capabilities"", and those are just the ones I’ve read. It’s basically common knowledge that, yes, of course, LLMs understand. But apparently, it’s not. People were spiraling into debates about consciousness, throwing around ad-hominem attacks, and even suggesting that Hinton has forgotten how to be a scientist, because he just stated an opinion, and even worse! an, according to the brains of reddit, WRONG opinion! Who does this fuck think he is? The Einstein of AI? Pffff. 
All the while, I didn’t see a single attempt to disprove him.... just... also opinions? Funny.

I argue Hinton didn’t forget to be a scientist. This sub just never was one. A real scientist would know all the papers, or at least be aware of them, that back up Hinton. So the complete shitshow of a thread caught me off guard. Hinton knows the research, which is why he said what he did. And I thought this sub also knows its science, because it is literally about bleeding edge science.
I always thought, every time someone was saying ""statistical parrot"" , it's like a meme, in the same sense like you do ""and the earth is flat herp derp"" because we are far beyond that point already. But now I'm not so sure anymore.

So, I’m here to fine-tune the meat-transformer in your head and give you a summary of a bunch of the papers I’ve read on this topic. If I missed any important that has to be in this list, drop a comment. And hey, I already won my first challenge. Some nice guy via PM claimed that I'm not able to produce even a single paper hinting in the slightest that LLMs have some kind of capability to understand. Thanks for the nicely worded PM stranger, I hope you also find peace and happiness in life.

And who need hints, when he has evidence? So let's get into it! We’ll go slow on this, so I’ll keep the learning rate low and the batch size at 1. And for those who need it spelled out: evidence does not equal proof, so save your semantic smart assery.

We will explore the ""inner world"" of an LLM, then examine how it interprets the ""outer world"" and ""everything beyond"". We'll top it off by discussing the consequences of these perspectives. Finally, we'll look at an area where LLMs can still improve and engage in a philosophical thought experiment about what might await us at the end of the rainbow.

## Emergent Abilities

Let's start with some conceptual definitions:

Understanding != consciousness. I don't know why, but somehow people in Hinton's thread thought he meant LLMs are conscious, as if they’re living entities or something. He didn’t.

There’s quite a jump from what “understanding” means in computer science and AI research to consciousness. The word ""understanding"" doesn't exist in a CS researcher’s vocabulary (except when talking to the public, like Hinton did) because it's a fuzzy concept, too fuzzy to base research on it indeed, as you could see in that thread. 

But in science, we need a conceptual frame to work in, something you can define, which is how ""understanding"" got replaced by ""emergent abilities"". Emergent abilities are abilities an AI learns to do on its own, without being explicitly trained or designed for it. And to learn something independently, a model needs to generalize its existing knowledge in ways that go beyond simple token output. Over the course of this post we will look how a text generator can do vastly more than just generating text....

Here's a quick primer from Google on ""emergent abilities"":  
[https://research.google/blog/characterizing-emergent-phenomena-in-large-language-models/](https://research.google/blog/characterizing-emergent-phenomena-in-large-language-models/)

#### Most interesting takeaway:

The biggest bomb of all: We don’t know why, when, or what. We have absolutely no idea why or when these emergent abilities kick in; Emergent abilities don’t appear gradually but instead pop up suddenly at certain model scales, like a critical threshold was crossed. What’s really going on at that point? What exactly is it that make that points so special? Can we predict future ""points of interest"". Some argue it's the single most important question in AI research. And to those people who like to argue ""we can't scale infinitely"", I argue it really depends on what kind of emergence we find... or finds us....

Imagine training a model on separate French and English texts. Nothing happens for a while, and then *boom* it can translate between the two without ever seeing a translation. It suddenly gained the emergent ability to translate. Sure, call it a statistical parrot, but if a parrot could do this, it’d be one hell of an intelligent parrot.

But I get it. Even tho seven years ago, you would have been downvoted into oblivion on r/machinelearning for suggesting that there's some random ""upscale"" point where a model just learns to translate on its own. It wouldn’t have even registered as science fiction. It’s crazy how fast the bleeding edge becomes everyday life, to the point where even a model that could beat the Turing test isn’t mind-blowing anymore. We’ve become too smart to be impressed, dismissing models that use our own mediums for representing the world as ""just statistics,"" because an LLM “obviously” has no real world representation… right? Well... or does it?

*(please hold your horses, and don't try to argue the Turing Test with me, because I know for a fact that everything you are going to say is a misinterpretation of the idea behind the test, probably something you got from the one afro american TV physicist I don't remember the name of, because I'm not from the US, or some other popular science shit and therefore is basically wrong. Just know, there was a time, not that long ago, when if you asked any computer scientist when we’d solve it, you’d get answers ranging from “never” to “hundreds of years, and it really was like the north star guiding our dreams and imagination, and we are now at a point where people try to forcefully move the turing-goalposts somewhere out of the reach of GPT. And the ones who don't feel like moving goalposts every two weeks (especially the younger ones who don't know the glory days) take the easy route of ""This test is shit"" lol. what a way to go sweet Turing test. this process from beacon to trash is all I wanted to share. so, leave it be.)
*

## My inner world...

[https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13382](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13382)

#### Most interesting takeaway:

In Monopoly, you have two main things to track: your piece and your money. You could note down each round with statements like, ""rolled a 6, got 60 bucks"" or ""rolled a 1, lost 100 dollars"" until you have quite a few entries.

Now, imagine giving this data to an LLM to learn from. Even though it was never explicitly told what game it was, the LLM reverse-engineers the game’s ruleset. The paper actually used Othello for this experiment, but I guess it’s not as popular as Monopoly. Regardless, the core idea remains the same. Just by the information about how the players state changes the LLM understands how the game state changes, and what constraint and rules for those game states exist. So it came up with it's own... well not world yet, but boardgame representation.

And that’s not even the coolest part the paper showed. The coolest part is that you can actually know what the LLM understands and even prove it. Encoded in the LLM’s internal activations is information it shouldn’t have. How can you tell? By training another AI that detects whenever the LLM’s internal state behaves a certain way, indicating that the 'idea' of a specific game rule is being processed. Doesn't look good for our parrot-friend.

That's btw why plenty of cognitive scientists are migrating completely to AI because of the ability to ""debug"" 

Perhaps you are asking yourself ""well if it understands the game rules how good is it in playing such game then?"" we will answer this question in a bit ;)

## ...and my outer world...

Imagine going out with your friends to dine at the newest fancy restaurant. The next day, all of you except one get the shits, and you instantly know that the shrimp is to blame because your friend who is painting his bathroom with a new color was the only one who didn’t order it. That’s causal reasoning. I like to call it ""knowing how the world works"" This extends beyond board game rules to any ""worldgame"" that the training data represents.

[https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10877#deepmind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10877#deepmind)

#### Most interesting takeaway:

Some Google boys have provided proof (yes, proof as in a hard mathematical proof) that any agent capable of generalizing across various environments has learned a causal world model. In other words, for an AI to make good decisions across different contexts, it must understand the causal relationships in the data. There it is again, the forbidden Hinton word.

The paper is quite math-heavy, but we can look at real-world examples. For instance, a model trained on both code and literature will outperform one trained solely on literature, even in literature-only tasks. This suggests that learning about code enhances its understanding of the world.

In fact, you can combine virtually any data: learning math can improve your French bot’s language skills. According to this paper, learning math also boosts a model's entity tracking ability.

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14811](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14811)

Coding improves natural language understanding, and vice versa.

With extremely potent generalization (which, by the way, is also a form of understanding), a models can generalize addition, multiplication, some sorting algorithms ([source](https://arxiv.org/html/2405.17399v1)), and maybe even a bit of Swahili (this was a joke, haha). 
This indicates that models aren’t just parroting tokens based on statistics but are discovering entirely new semantic connections that we might not even be aware of. This is huge because if we can reverse engineer why math improves a model’s French skills, it could offer insights into optimization strategies we aren't even aware of their existence, opening up countless new research angles. Thanks, parrot!

Like when people talk about ""AI is plateauing"" I promise you... the hype train didn't even started yet, with so much still to research and figure out.....

## ...and the whole universe

All of this leads us to reasoning. You’re not wrong if you directly think of O1, but that’s not quite correct either. We’re talking about single-step reasoning, something everyone knows and does: ""Hey ChatGPT, can you answer XXXX? Please think step by step and take a deep breath first."" And then it tries to answer in a reasoning chain style (we call these reasoning graphs), sometimes getting it right, sometimes wrong, but that’s not the point.

Have you ever wondered how the LLM even knows what ""step by step"" thinking means? That it means breaking down a problem, then correctly choosing the start of the graph and building the connections between start and finish. In state-of-the-art models, there are huge datasets of reasoning examples fed into the models, but these are just there to improve the process; the way of thinking it figured out itself. It’s all about internal representations and ""ideas""

Good ol' Max did a paper showing LLMs even have an understanding of space and time. Btw, if you see the name Max Tegmark, you have to read whatever he’s written. It’s always crazy town, but explained in a way that even a layman can understand. You might think, ""Okay, I got it by processing trillions of tokens, some spatial info just emerges"" and it’s some abstract 'thing' deep inside the LLM we can’t grasp, so we need another AI to interpret the state of the LLM. 

But here’s where it gets fun.

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02207](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02207)

They trained models on datasets containing names of places or events with corresponding space or time coordinates spanning multiple locations and periods - all in text form. And fucking Mad Max pulled an actual world map out of his ass the model that even changes over time based on the learned events.


Another paper also looked into how far apart can dots be so the LLM can still connect them

>In one experiment we finetune an LLM on a corpus consisting only of distances between an unknown city and other known cities. Remarkably, without in-context examples or Chain of Thought, the LLM can verbalize that the unknown city is Paris and use this fact to answer downstream questions.
  
https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14546


## Checkmate ~~atheists! technophobes! technophiles!~~ luddites!

And boy, the dots can be universes apart. I mean, you probably know chess, a very difficult game to master. Yet, our little text prediction friend can somehow also play chess! When trained on legal moves, it will also play legal chess (back to our board game example). But how good is it? Well, naturally, some Harvard Henrys looked into it. They found that when trained on games of 1000 Elo players... what do you think, how good is the LLM? Spoiler: >!1500 Elo!<


[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11741v1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11741v1)

Say what you want, but for me, this isn’t just evidence, it’s hard proof that some understanding is happening. Without understanding, there’s no way it could learn to play better chess than the players it observed, yet here we are. When trained on data, LLMs tend to outperform the data. And I don't know what your definition of intelligence is, but it hits pretty close to mine. Here you have it, you can still have opinions in science, without being a dick to scientists! crazy I know. Like, sorry for ranting, one guy in the thread was like ""Now my opinion of Hinton is ruined"", like obviously the guy doesn't know shit if he's mad on someone saying ""LLMs understand"", but somehow it's of great importance that he felt the need to also announce his ignorance and opinion into the world. 

Why? 

Takes literally 30s to google ""LLMs understanding paper"" to be buried with 50 hits on arxiv. People rather shit on people instead of taking five second from their clock to perhaps gain the chance to challenge their own view point of things. It wasn't always like this, was it?


## Just google it, bro


Another example would be recognizing zero-day vulnerabilities. 
For those who don't know what those funny words mean: 
When software get updated, and because of the update there is a new stupid bug, and this stupid bug is a pretty intense bug that fucks everything and everyone, and nothing works anymore, and you have to call your sysadmin on Sunday, and fucking shit why is he so expensive on Sundays, why does this shit always happen on sundays anyway?, that’s called a ""zero-day vulnerability"" 

Recognizing these is important, so there are vulnerability scanners that check your code and repository (basically trying to hack them). If any of your dependencies have a known ""0day"" it’ll notify you so you can take action.


What’s the discovery rate for an open-source vulnerability scanner? A tool specifically made for the task!

  
Close to 0%.


I kid you not, most of them only recognize 0days one or two days later when their database updates, because their scanning algorithms and hacking skills suck ass.

GPT, on the other hand, has a 20% discovery rate, making our little waifu story generator one of the best vulnerability scanners out there (next to humans). 

**DISCLAIMER***(There's a huge discussion in the community because of the methodology used in the paper, because GPT as an agent system had internet access and basically googled the exploits instead of figuring them out itself, but I chose to include it anyway, because this is how every 'security expert' I know also works. Also tool using is cool. Always cracks me up when AI gets measured more strictly than humans.)*


## Context is everything

Like with Hinton and the meaning of ""understanding,"" context is also super important when talking about LLMs. 
Some might say, ""Ok, I get it. I understand all this talk about training! When you train a model on trillions of datapoints for millions of dollars over thousands of hours, something happens that makes it _seem_ like it understands things."" 

But they still think they have an out: in-context learning! 

""BUT! A system that truly understands wouldn’t be so dumb when I give it new information, like --INSERT BANANA PUZZLE-- (or some other silly example, which even humans fail at, by the way). GOT YA!""

And I agree, in-context learning and zero-shot learning are still areas that need more research and improvement (and that’s why we aren’t plateauing like some think). But even here, we have evidence of understanding and generalization. Even with completely new information, on completely new tasks, as shown by this Stanford article:

[https://ai.stanford.edu/blog/understanding-incontext/#empirical-evidence](https://ai.stanford.edu/blog/understanding-incontext/#empirical-evidence)

If you think about what the article say, you can see how this disproves the ""statistical parrot"" theory, proving there’s more going on than just predicting the next token.

And perhaps you remember my XTC Sampler thread? 

For those who don’t know, the XTC sampler is a LLM token sampler that cuts away the MOST probable tokens to allow more creativity. 

People in the thread would say, ""But doesn’t that make the model unusable?"" 

No, it still does what it does. 

Even if you only let sub-1% tokens through, it still produces coherent text! 

even at the limits of its probability distribution, when the information encoded in the tokens is so improbable it shouldn't be coherent at all, but here’s the kicker: even when I cut away all the popular tokens, it still tells roughly the same story. This means the story isn’t encoded in the stream of tokens but somewhere within the LLM. No matter what I do with the tokens, it’ll still tell its story. Statistical Parrot, my ass.

## Where does it lead us?

Who knows? 
It's a journey, but I hope I could kickstart your computer science adventure a bit, and I hope one thing is clear: 

Hinton didn’t deserve the criticism he got in this thread because, honestly, how can you look at all these papers and not think that LLMs do, in fact, understand? 

And I also don’t get why this is always such an emotionally charged debate, as if it’s just a matter of opinion, which it isn’t (at least within the concept space we defined at the beginning). 

Yet, somehow, on Reddit the beacon of science and atheism and anime boobas, only one opinion seems to be valid. like also the most non-science opinion of all. 

Why? I don't know, and honestly I don't fucking care, but I get mad if someone is shitting of grampa Hinton.

Well, I actually know, because we recently did a client study asking the best question ever asked in the history of surveys:

“Do you enjoy AI?” (sic)

 
90% answered, “What?”

Jokes aside, most people are absolutely terrified of the uncertainty it all brings. 
Even a model trained on ten Hintons and LeCuns couldn't predict where we’re heading before it self destructs. 

Does it end in catastrophe?

Or is it just a giant nothingburger? 

Or maybe it liberates humanity from its capitalist chains, with AGI as the reincarnated digitalized Spirit of Karl Marx leading us into utopia.

As you can see, even the good endings sound scary as fuck. 

So, to avoid making it scarier than it already is, people tell themselves, “It’s just a parrot, bro” or “It’s just math”, like saying a tiger that wants to eat you is just a bunch of atoms. 
In the end, if I had a parrot that could answer every question, it doesn’t matter if it’s “just a parrot” or not. The mobile phone number of your mum is mine anyway, and “it’s just a parrot” won’t save you from that reality. 

So, better to just relax and enjoy the ride, the roller coaster already started and there's nothing you can do. 
In the end, what happens, happens, and who knows where all of this is leading us…

This paper from MIT claims it leads to the following (don’t take it too seriously, it’s a thought experiment): All neural networks are converging until every model (like literally every single model on earth) builds a shared statistical model of reality. If there’s anything like science romanticism, this is it. 

""Hey babe, how about we build a shared statistical model of reality with our networks tonight?""

https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07987

  


In that sense, have a good one, and maybe we can dive into the counterarguments next time :)

Or if you have any other idea of something you want a deep dive into, let me know. Do you for example know, that in a blind test Professors can't decide if a paper abstract is written by GPT or one of their students? Or did you know, that LLMs literally have their own language? Like there exists (probably?) an infinite amount of words/prompts that look like this ""hcsuildxfz789p12rtzuiwgsdfc78o2t13287r"" and force the LLM to react in a certain way. How and why? well... it's something for future me... perhaps ;)"

I am currently taking physical chemistry at a university level. I work 9-5 and commute close to 3.5hrs Monday-Friday. Due to this schedule I tend to stay up quite late doing homework, and maximizing the time I have would be very helpful. I do use YouTube videos, however, sometimes 15-min videos are too much to watch just to clarify a small detail. When time permits, I try to attend office hours, but this is often not possible.

Would it be a good idea to use these tools to generate practice questions by inputting a past test question on a topic I would like to get more solidified (which are available to all students who wish to purchase them officially from the university so no issues here)? If you’ve used it previously, how? What was the experience like? I’d like to know pros and cons alike. So far I’ve only tried the free version of chatGPT to explain concepts through prompted themed analogies. I also make it cite sources just to make sure it’s not some made up explanation. To clarify, I am not looking to make it do my homework or write my lab reports for me. Instead, it would be nice to use AI as an impromptu tutor that can answer clarification questions when it’s 2 AM and it’s crunch time.

If your position is “this is bad”, do let me know why. I am looking for genuine answers no matter your stance! Please give me some insight and any alternative solutions, I am happy to get any and all support I can get. Thank you kindly for all your time :) "

This powerful language model, thanks to its ability to understand and generate human-like text, is revolutionizing the way we approach learning in both academic and professional settings.

In the educational sphere, ChatGPT is being harnessed to personalize learning experiences. As it adapts to individual student queries, it facilitates a tailored tutoring approach that augments traditional teaching methods. Students who might not have access to one-on-one tutoring due to economic or geographical constraints can now receive personalized assistance, potentially leveling the educational playing field.

Corporate training, too, is undergoing a significant transformation thanks to ChatGPT. Interactive training modules powered by AI make learning more engaging and cost-effective for businesses. Employees can have real-time conversations with the AI, asking questions and receiving immediate feedback, which helps in better retention of information and practical application of skills.

Moreover, the instant availability of ChatGPT means learning opportunities are not confined to the walls of a classroom or office. Learning can happen anywhere, anytime, breaking down the barriers of traditional education and corporate training schedules.

However, this technological revolution raises questions about the sustainability of conventional teaching and training roles. As AI becomes more integrated into our learning processes, it's crucial to examine how educators and corporate trainers can adapt to work in tandem with AI tools rather than being replaced by them.

Let's discuss how ChatGPT is already impacting virtual learning and training, and what potential it holds for the future of education and professional development. Share your experiences, insights, and thoughts about the integration of AI in learning and how we can navigate through this technological evolution while ensuring that the human element remains at the core of education and training."

I ended up getting the tooth removed, then getting dry socket. So i was absent for a while. In the meantime of me being absent i tried getting as much schoolwork done that i missed as possible. I currently have an F in every class and its because im missing a test in some classes. 

I take honors classes, but for my english class (which english is my favorite subject) i have the worst teacher and shes making me hate it. I would transfer into a different class, but unfortunately she is the only teacher who teaches honors english. 

I had a stupid quiz on a crash course video today and i got a 18/30. The only reason i even got that grade was because it was on one of those sites if you press something, thats automatically your answer and you cant go back. I pressed 2 questions wrong by accident because i clicked to the next question which yes, is my fault but when i told my teacher she said thats not her problem and i shouldve been more careful. I understand that yes, it very much was my fault but i was maybe hoping she could just let me retake it..

Today, she emailed my mother telling her that i do not belong in a honors english class and that i should consider transferring to cp. I have always gotten good grades in my honors classes and i never had a problem with them. 

I dont think im going to take her “advice” but im now in trouble for having such bad grades even though in some other classes, my teachers didnt even notice i was absent and wont take any “late” work (even though i was absent and the work was due before i came back)

She also accuses students of using chatgpt if their essays are good. 

Im really struggling and just need some advice on what to do ."

I was out on a brisk October walk the other day when I saw something I'd never seen before; someone taking their cat for a walk. Now, I've seen people clearly *trying* to take their cat for a walk. The cat sits there looking embarrassed while the human stands around waiting for the cat to change its mind. I even tried it myself. My cat just flopped over on the ground and started wriggling out of his leash.

This cat was different, though. It wasn't just tolerating the leash; it was loving the walk! I stopped to watch it ramble around in the park, rolling in the grass and pouncing on leaves. I've never seen a cat have so much fun outside. I didn't get a photo, but it looked a little like this:

In that spirit of curiosity, let's see what's new at Launch School:

# Expanding LS220

LS220, *Data Structures and Algorithms*, has been improved and expanded! It's not just a fresh coat of paint - more like an upgraded engine and a couple of rocket boosters. Some of the changes are:

* Not one, but **two** new books on the Launch School bookshelf
* New walkthroughs and explanations of problems from the 220 course
* A new live coding interview, LS221, to test these skills.

You can find all the details in [this Medium post](https://medium.com/launch-school/new-data-structures-algorithms-series-947550e7db0f).

# Hello, Non-Capstone Pass (Bye, Bye Conditional Pass)

There's been a significant change to the way assessments are handled. For assessments in the middle ground between a Pass and Not Yet, we're retiring the Conditional Pass and introducing the new Non-Capstone Pass. A Non-Capstone Pass lets you move on to the next assessment or course, just like a Pass. However, to qualify for Capstone, you must **retake** any assessment for which you received a Non-Capstone Pass.

This change brings the assessments more closely in line with the mastery-based learning methodology. It allows you to return to the assessment once you've had a chance to build on your skills and get that Pass, promoting a deeper understanding of the material.

Check the [updated assessment rules](https://launchschool.com/gists/99b650e4) for more details about the Non-Capstone Pass.

# Prep Live

After the success of Core Live, we're making live group learning available for students in Prep! Starting at the end of October, 100-level students on all coding tracks can attend live sessions to discuss programming fundamentals. If you're interested, you can find the details [here](https://public.launchschool.com/prep-live); if you're *really really* interested, you can apply [here](https://public.launchschool.com/prep-live#apply-now).

# LSBot == AI + LS

Launch School is rolling out our **LSBot** AI tool to help your studies. Unlike existing tools such as ChatGPT, LSBot is built to deliver answers from the Launch School course materials. You can learn more about LSBot [here](https://medium.com/launch-school/introducing-lsbot-an-ai-powered-assistant-for-launch-school-students-686e73e6b09f).

For now, this rollout is limited as the team continues to build and fine-tune the bot. It is only available to students in Smooth Start, Core Live, and Prep Live, but will be available to all soon.

# Mastery Workshop

Tomorrow (October 10th, 6 PM Eastern), Launch School staff is hosting a workshop on study and mastery. This workshop will delve into the strategies and techniques for effective studying, treating studying as a skill that can be honed just like coding. If you want to level up your study skills, this is the place to be! You can learn more and [sign up here](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_Gz8D5FBSR92ZU1KtHhLjvA#/registration).

# LS Women's Group

The Women's Group will meet up on Sunday, October 27th. TA/biscuit enthusiast Clare MacAdie will hold a Regex workshop for this session. It will be /(fun|helpful|exciting)/! (Just a bit of Regex humor.) You can learn more [here](https://launchschool.com/posts/1bcfe510). Bring your own biscuits!

If you're a woman or nonbinary student at LS and not already part of the Women's Group in Slack, you can join [here](https://launchschool.slack.com/archives/C1W5VBVSS)! The Women's Group is a supportive community where you can connect with like-minded individuals and share your experiences. There's also a dedicated channel for trans and nonbinary students [here](https://launchschool.slack.com/archives/C05JFM0TKS5).

# Meetups

Students (and staff) in Northern California met up a few weeks ago:

And remember: Anyone can set up a meetup in their region! If you can't find a channel for your region, go ahead and create one, then announce it in the [#general](https://launchschool.slack.com/archives/C0YKFFU6A) channel. Your initiative can help bring the community closer together. Be sure to use a prefix of `regional-` in your channel's name to help make it easy to find.

# Medium Articles

Launch School students have put up some excellent Medium articles recently. Let me give you an example from the past few weeks, by giving you an example from two weeks ago, by giving you an example from September 23rd: Patrick Moran's article on [recursion](https://medium.com/launch-school/what-is-recursion-an-introduction-and-technical-discussion-3c81547d03f0). If you find yourself struggling with recursive code, Patrick's article lays everything out clearly and carefully.

If you're reading this Community Update, you're either me writing it right now or you received it through the Internet. So how did that happen? Jack Sebben has three articles breaking down some of the networking concepts we talk about in LS170:

* [Basics of Browser Security](https://medium.com/@jacksebben.unicyclist/what-is-cors-8bab624fcee8)
* [A Model For Sending Data Over The Internet](https://medium.com/@jacksebben.unicyclist/a-model-for-sending-data-over-the-internet-1ee166e3704c)
* [How Data Is ""Passed"" Through Networking Layers](https://medium.com/@jacksebben.unicyclist/how-data-is-passed-through-networking-layers-8e75bea24a92)

That wraps it up for this update! As I'm sure you noticed, there's a ton going on.

As for me, I'll be spending the rest of the day with JS230. The subject matter is weird and hard, but I will try to be more like the cat on the leash in the park - it's time to walk right up to the big field of concepts and dive in."
1g05l1f,98,2024-10-09,CASPER tips: From 3Q -> 3Q-> then FINALLY 4Q ,u/trapbunnybb,premedcanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/premedcanada/comments/1g05l1f/casper_tips_from_3q_3q_then_finally_4q/,"Hi guys I am gonna hibernate from reddit for the next lil bit but since it is Casper season I want to share with you guys what I did differently this time (I got my results today for the Sept 12 test)

**Disclaimer**: I am not the most qualified to give advice but this is just what I did, it could very well be a fluke

**Other disclaimer**: i am going to skip over the basic tips like be non-judgmental, consider the perspectives of at least two stakeholders introduced in the situation, speak in a private setting etc bc I assume you guys know that format and have seen it so many times

I always thought Casper was a thing you naturally were good at, but now I realized it can very well be improved. 3Q means i was sorta there but there were small nuances I was missing, so I delved into trying to tackle this

1) I used **chatgpt** to give me feedback. I would do typed scenarios on prepmatch and then ask chatgpt if it could give me Casper feedback and I would paste the scenario and my answers (do not ask it for a quartile bc it will get in your). Sometimes the suggestions it gives are a lil bit too much into the weeds and have some irrelavant parts but if you are missing something big e.g someone's perspective it will tell you 

2) I turned on the **Closed Caption**s to get the actors names. I NEVER use subtitles for anything, lol don't judge me but I even watch shows dubbed if they are in another language. But with Casper TURN. THEM. ON. A lot of times the characters names aren't said, but with closed captioning it tells you the name of the person talking. Using names in your answer can help you stand out. 

3) Don't be afraid to **get niche** with the personal questions. If you resonate more with a question you will answer it better. I used examples such as conflicts in my own family that I was very passionate talking about so it helped. Just explain the situation briefly and why it is an issue e.g that it violates patient confidentiality and explain what you learned. Don't go off and say toooo many details of the story the bulk of your answer is what you learned and being empathetic toward people involved

4) Some may disagree but I used buzzwords like being non-judgemental and even saying ""I will be empathetic toward Jimmy.."". As robotic as it sounds it worked for me this time. Some people have had success without buzzwords but I felt safe using them

5) I didn't really prep for the video portion but if you are camera shy I would recommend recording yourself or practicing with a peer. For me I struggled with Casper questions as a whole so i didn't really target typed vs video responses separately I just worked on strengthening my answers in general. Basically (trapbunny assumption) if you are good at typed responses you should be good with video (i feel like it's your IDEAS not how you speak lowkey but some may disagree), just try to look into the camera and not at yourself

6) ok this is getting long lol if youre still here hii 

Before my 3Q self would just say why the situation is bad for the people involved but I struggled extrapolating to why it's bad in the real world E.g if someone is cheating not only is it unfair to other students but also *it can diminish the credibility of the institution*. I had a hard time making these connections myself at first but with practice and the help with Chatgpt it became easier 

Okkk this post was long but YOU GOT THIS GUYS. And if you didn't get the score you wanted do not worry only few schools weigh casper heavily and it is not a reflection of you. 

Good luck and time to go on my hibernation BYYEEE

Apologies if this isn't the right place to post this, as this is technically an enquiry about google docs but I am thinking the same theory for both. Is there a way to access the data on how long you worked on a Google Doc/Sheet or track the history of changes after the fact? 

For a little context, I am a Masters student and completed an assignment on Google Docs. As I completed my undergrad pre ChatGPT I have never utilised ChatGPT for assignment writing, and to be honest believe in writing my own assignments seeing I am paying thousands for my education and actually do want to learn about my topics. However, I have been flagged by the ""AI Report"" as having possible 62% AI text for my assignment. This is obviously deeply concerning as I didn't use AI at all to write my assignment and so it's a) bad that they might penalise me for something I didn't do and b) bad that their AI detection system is so poor it flags genuine work as AI. 

As a consequence I feel as though I might be in a position where I have to defend my own innocence in the face of shit AI telling me I used AI when I didn't. Pretty hard to prove innocence bar just giving them my entire search history for a certain time, it is like proving your sane when people thing you're insane lol. So that leads me to my question, I did the assignment in Google Docs, can I access the data showing that I wrote this assignment over 2-3 days and spent X amount of hrs on it? I presume I wouldn't spend 15 hrs on generative text so I am hoping it aids if I get penalised. I feel as though if you can write an essay to a certain style and quality the AI detection system will flag you - sadly I would say the generative AI text systems are so good now that the people that actually use them don't get flagged and the only people punished are the ones who don't use it. Any help would be greatly appreciated!! "

Diversity might seem like a complex topic to introduce to kids at a young age. Well, as much as it seems, it is a rather simple concept to bring into their lives in the most fun and creative ways. Kids are naturally curious and open-minded. Preschool is a good time to introduce diversity and let them explore and observe diverse cultures in the form of distinct traditions, dialects, and customs. This can especially be done in the form of cultural celebrations and multi-diversity events. Here are some important benefits of teaching diversity:

**1. Fostering inclusivity and acceptance**

It is important to note how children of different cultural backgrounds come together cohesively in a similar environment and share their daily lives with each other. Not only through daily routines, but through cultural programs and events too, we can celebrate this diversity and foster inclusivity and acceptance.

**2. Building empathy and social skills**

Organizing such events and preschool programs helps kids observe and understand different cultures and how they are different from theirs while also finding many similarities. This collectively acts as a bonding exercise and helps them develop empathy and social connectedness in a natural manner.

**3. Enhancing cognitive development**

Celebrations of different cultures are a fun way for kids to learn about art, history, geography, and language. Kids learn through doing things like cooking traditional foods, dancing, or making cultural crafts. This kind of hands-on learning helps their brains grow. Children learn about different cultures and improve their academic skills at the same time.

**4. Strengthening community**

In Before and After School Care programs, parents and families can be invited to share their traditions, creating a strong sense of community among parents, educators, and students. These interactions help to create a warm, supportive environment where everyone feels included and valued.

**The Final Thoughts**

Cultural celebrations in preschool are a great way to teach kids about variety and make them more accepting, empathetic, and well-rounded. Preschool programs that expose kids to different cultures in fun and age-appropriate ways can help them learn to understand and accept others. Cultural celebrations make kids’ lives better by teaching them to value the beauty of differences. They can do this in the school or through [**Before And After School Care in North York**](https://stgeorgeminischool.ca/pre-program). These early lessons in cultural understanding will help kids be kind and respectful as they grow up and live in a world that is becoming more diverse.

I did bachelors from Nust in mechanical Eng. and now have been graduated since two years and doing a normie job (small company). I didnt like many subjects of mech engineering and had in my mind that i will switch to cs side and do a MS in cs related field, i was okie in engineering but like not very good as i thought i would be, gpa also around 3. getting into mech engineering was tough, merit was high that time so just thought maybe this is good, parents also said you got in highest merit so i just said yeah I can study so might as well just go. Now i realize it isn't for me as i had to put effort to get through and well i feel like as years will pass by my skills might not improve as much. Furthermore I am not into oil fields ,powerplants/manufacturing factory stuff also so more office/within city work/job is preferred. I feel like i can just study and give exams and learn stuff and implementing doing work under someone for more than sometime is not for me., or I can not keep this doing for long.

I always thought of not giving up that is why i endured engineering, endured nust entry test and secured top marks and thought it would end but maybe giving up and switching earlier would have been better.

I did sit some hrs to study each day, but it never came to me that what i would do at work, it just felt this esteemed degree that required effort would make things good maybe, and maybe my parents also believed. Aside during my undergrad i did try video editing, basic animations, photography stuff but just basic level, nothing much i guess, wasting time perhaps.

I did apply to MS (in cs/ai related field) outside of pak and got admits from some good universities. But due to some reasons I could not go this year. This at first I thought gave me time to learn cs/ai/coding stuff and not just think its cool. Also maybe i did engineering coz I thought it would be good to go outside of Pak and study at top ranking university, but i never reflected/ thought about what i would be really working . professionaly all life. But now as days pass i don't even know whether going abroad would be good, the reality is that its not walk in the park abroad too and before i just did not realize it. Moreover i can write good English and can communicate and have bachelors from good uni in pak that is why got admit in MS programs even though my field is different (this is just what I think).

Anyways was looking into programing stuff etc did some basic courses on python going through basic concepts till object oriented programming, and first it seemed cool but idk i feel like that is also kinda difficult and weird sitting looking at screen and not being able to think logic solutions everyday. I feel like there is a lot to learn and lot of stuff to learn in this field, and i don't know if i can or how much time will it take or even if I will be able to learn+implementthe things. Just too much is out there and I cant even get by the basics. I learnt some concepts but writing code with chatgpt or copying seems out of box( even small stuff). Also maths is something I now feel i am and was not good at maths and ML/AI stuff requires math to be good at it in the long run and that makes me rethink stuff. And the incoming of AI and news bombardment creeps me out and the idea of just required to learn all along your career just makes me rethink whether I will survive or not or be good at it.

I don't know if I'm early or maybe i am just not like up to mark or dumb. I do like to study stuff up, memorize and have knowledge about things in general. But I think coming up with great solutions or computer programming or mech Eng. stuff is different thing as compared to gaining knowledge and just liking to know different concepts and stuff in details and doing them for own sake not under someone for an earning.

I did study and passed exams, did good enough projects also but I feel like i was stuck in a daydream and never did looked at things realistically. I did education for education's sake maybe and that now did not turn out right People around me also said that you were fine because i was just going straight, no backlogs and passing classes as I go. So I thought maybe this is how it is and things will adjust. Moreover no backlogs so i was just doing getting degree at a 'good age'(22). I was caught in thinking that once you choose something you do it completely, following a linear path and i could not drop and switch things. But well here we now.

So recently after all this, realized maybe i should have done medical(dentistry) because you don't have to sit on computer thinking about logical solution. the work is hands on and you interact with humans and most importantly work has limit once done it is done you don't have to open your laptop again and like procrastinate/guilt yourself in not working/learning at home. One more thing as compared to cs/ai side is that you work 1 kind of job not changing stuff/languages industry/jobs etc etc, you just take care of dental stuff and learn+practice regarding it. Do your own practice. Someone very close (very close, in my home) to me is also a dentist so maybe I know stuff a bit. I know this field is also difficult and not every doctor is good but I don't know why this thought comes up to me now a days. Am I too late? I thought one of reason of choosing engineering (aside from going abroad) was that engineering would not be boring but that was till university & projects after that it just seems too much(as mentioned above). I feel medical is a better field and compsci stuff is just weird and unnecessary. (This thought never came up to me till 4 months ago I found compsci/robotics/ML etc stuff to be pretty useful and not unnecessary).

Or are these thoughts temporary or are coming to me because right now I am stuck (because of abroad and cs switch situation) , coz i mean studying engineering (knowledge seeking) was not so bad but why this thought about being a doctor is coming up to me now, when it is too late.

Well if i start what would be the process, do my fsc/matric scores would count now after such a long time. (moreover now students get a lot higher marks after covid, i had about 89% fsc, 93% in matric). Taking entry test is the barrier coz i cant pay the fee of private medical colleges. Is there a way i could utilize my degree to switch credit transferring stuff ? And overall would it be worth it coz like it will take 6 years to do.

Or should I just go do MS in cs/ai related stuff? (Honestly if I could just get into dentistry school I would but the entrance test and other stuff is a hassle and maybe I am old for it now, for giving entry test at this age? Is this temporary and i should just focus on learning coding stuff and get into MS here or abroad? fulfilment issue or just temporary running away from learning cs/programming stuff?

Kindly share your thoughts about the questions I have posed regarding all of the things above, and are these thoughts temporary because of my current situation or not ?"
1g0dp3b,7,2024-10-10,Computer science professor possibly violating University policies,u/Outside_Delay_6377,UCalgary,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCalgary/comments/1g0dp3b/computer_science_professor_possibly_violating/,"I have been at three universities and have met about 40 professors and I have never experienced a professor this bad. It's so bad that I am thinking about lodging a formal complaint. This certain course is a ""flipped course"" meaning that there is some pre-lecture material to go through. I generally don't mind this because I tend to read ahead during the start of the semester when I have time. The problem is that the pre-lecture material is so poorly presented to the point that it typically takes twice as long as the video to understand the material (about 1 hour). The biggest problem is that the material is presented so differently from the textbook that only a math major can read it. I constantly find myself asking chatGPT to explain these overly complicated slides. And ironically it is a better professor than this guy.

So then it comes to the lectures. The real lecture time to solve problems is about 30 mins out of the 75 mins (I timed it). There is never a single lecture that is finished within the alloted times slot. Usually he uploads the completed notes after. My issue is that I have to spend an additional hour after every lecture to go through his notes and write mine. So altogether, I spend more than three hours on the lecture material per lecture. How is this allowed? This is not the case where I review the completed lecture after I get home. I am waiting for his uploaded lectures notes so I can complete the lecture after. By having incomplete lectures every single time, it causes the lecture to go beyond the alloted time slot. Doesn't this go against university policy?

Then it comes to tutorial. The TAs are not allowed to give answers. I went to tutorials during the first three weeks having completed them at home only to find that the TAs don't even go over the answers with you. I wrote a proof that the TA said was good. Then I went to office hours and the professor said it was bad. So what is the point of even going to these tutorials. Yes the answers are uploaded at the end of the week but the best time to give feedback is while students are trying to solve the problem. Just like when students need clarification during the lectures. It's not helpful that students cannot ask for the professor to clarify during the pre-lecture videos or the post lecture notes.

I don't wish ill on this professor but this model of ""teaching"" has to stop. The tenureship of one professor should not outweighs the academic needs of 200 students. I wonder if enough students raise this potential policy violation that the professor will be forced to change their teaching style.

Just a side note. Tenured professors aren't necessarily bad. But a tenured research professor that becomes a teaching professor is usually horrible. They have either lost their research group through poor research or have been banned from research due to things like safety violations (happened at my last school)"

What does 1103 angel number signify





**1103 angel number meaning & symbolism**



1103 angel number meaning is improvisation. At first glimpse that might sounds very irresponsible because life should be planed and be taken in serious matter because we have obligation and rules to follow. Society tells us that we can’t be free and we just need to conform ourselves to the norms and traditions.



However 1103 angel number symbolism shows us that we should be spontaneous as well. the guardian angels and divine spirits are urging you to see the benefits of being loose when you face a negative affair. See, you can not prepare yourself for every situation that is going to happen during life on earth. Unexpected things will happen and you will find yourself clueless and confused.



Of course you can always certitude the immortal souls from heaven but it is much recommended to be able to winging it by your own self. So how can you follow exactly the message of psychics and ascended master?



Don’t plan too much as it will definitely limit and lock you inside repeated patterns. And by the time fly you will narrow the point of view on certain aspect and be blind to different school of thoughts and hence new opportunities might be missed.



Participate in life as an active player. Don’t just conduct mental thinking and analysis because this is only theory. In reality we need to be practical as well, otherwise nothing substantial will happen and you will always stay at square one. This is why manifestation doesn’t work for most of the people who are going on a spiritual journey. They just think and pray but never take the courage to do something in the material world about it.



The symbolism and meaning of angel number 1103 or these repeating sequences: [1100](https://www.reddit.com/r/freepsychicreadings4u/comments/1fy8k8g/1100_angel_number_meaning_numerology_signs/), [1101](https://www.reddit.com/r/freepsychicreadings4u/comments/1fz1tct/1101_angel_number_meaning_the_only_guide_you_will/),  [1102](https://www.reddit.com/r/freepsychicreadings4u/comments/1fzqb5k/1102_angel_number_meaning_love_twin_flame/), 1104, 1105, 1107, 1108, 1130, 1110, 1122, 1133, 1144, 1111, imply not to follow the rules just because someone made them up and everyone conform to the idea. If a restriction doesn’t looks beneficial for you than search for another alternatives. That doesn’t mean to break the rules in bad manner. It does advocate putting your self in situations that give you the most control or power over your life.



For example if you are not satisfied with work, career, love, spirituality, friends, family, money matter, your city, country, neighbourhood and etc, you should find how to change these issues for your own sake. Again don’t take extreme measurements just look for little adjustments here and there which will ultimately improve the quality of your lifestyle.

Furthermore don’t try to change their behaviour or personality because it will not change.

Sometimes we need alone time to process out thoughts, feelings and emotions. It takes time and self exploration. There is nothing wrong in having a predefined time alone.

Don’t fall into illusions of the perfect marriage or connection because there is no such thing. There are ups and downs and in the end it makes life more exciting. If everything is predictable and already known than we will get bored. Nobody wants to go to a movie if he or she knows how it will be ended.

**1103 angel number bible scribes meaning in Hebrew**



1103 angel number bible meaning in Hebrew is “Balas”. In English language it means to collect fruits from trees. The scribes define it as someone who gathers food from nature. It is used in the biblical book of Amos strong’s verse 7:14. in the bible story, Amos claim that he is just an ordinary man, not a prophet with psychic powers, only a farmer who has quiet and simple life.



However the lord had different plan for him and he had to change the mind in order to accept the mission. Therefore angel number 1103 talks about the same concept: you will be called on a duty to do something incredible for you, the people and the whole world. You are going to live the peaceful condition and going to have a different career.



Keep on being humble and you will collect the fruits that hanged at the top of the trees, you will hunt the fishes at the deepest sea and will find gemstone deep in the ground. All these rewards have been waiting for you to be grabbed. But in order to reach then you will have to work hard and more important contribute to nature, society and the spiritual world.



The guardian angels with the wings and halo affect would like you to think for yourself and not in terms of yes or no, good or bad, copy and paste. Avoid all paradigms and advices that don’t serve you well. Because there is no point to listen to something if it doesn’t apply to you, it will only generate confusing and will distract you from the right place or thing you must do.



Instead, the saints suggest you should listen to what others have to say because it is a good way to learn from their perspective. Whether you will follow them or not, it is your decision. This is why it is better to talk to few people before you choose a certain path, you will be able to assess who made it, who failed, why it happen, the secret behind it and how you can out perform them all.



The kjv book bible scribes describes prophets which are usually not in the spot light, they don’t gather the whole attention of the community. And yet they have been chosen to follow a wonderful spiritual or psychic journey that will change their life forever. The same fate might be yours, do the things in the quiet space, don’t leak too much information about the motives and aspiration before you actually got results.



**1103 angel number numerology meaning**



1103 angel number numerology meaning is to keep the light on. Imagine yourself walking in the darkness and the wind blow the candle and shut it down, or it fall on the ground, or the rain wet it, or maybe it just turn off by itself without any particular reason.



If we have something valuable or important for our survival than we have to keep it safe no matter what. Therefore the numerology significance of the specific number is to define the precious concepts or object we have or want ant protect them at all cause.



In numerology 1103 number is based on the single digits 0, 1 and 3 which are very powerful. They might been seen in different combination as well like: 103, 301, 130, 310, 101, 113, 311, 301, 131, 1013, 1031, 1301, 3101, 3011, 3110. Also the sum of the numerical equals to 5 = 1 + 1 + 0 + 3. 5 is the number of finding harmony it also represent the center of the progress because 5 is in the perfect middle between 1 and zero.



The middle of the way is a wonderful achievement because after all half of the work is already done. It should give you the power to continue and go on with what you have started until the successful finale. But for some the number 5 symbolize quieting and despair because they are too tired.



The angels acknowledge the stage of advancement and good luck, but they don’t want you to stop right now. They are sending you these repeating sequences to cheer you up, to lift the spirit and raise the vibration. They are actually very near and would show up to help you to navigate.



In order to create perfect karma you must treat these barriers and temporary issues. Don’t let the spirit go down and don’t sink in misery. At the first sign of trouble don’t sleep or ignore it, rather strike while it is still small. Let’s say you feel a little ill and have flu or cold. If you will treat yourself good in the early days of the illness than it is more likely to go away before in create more damage.



**1103 my guardian angel number meaning**



1103 my guardian angel number meaning is to be pure. It suggests being innocence, good heart and have nice intentions in whatever you are doing. Stay away from evil forces because they will catch you with negative energy, misfortune and sorrow.



Another sign you will get from the guardian angels is success of other people around you. So don’t be jealous or discouraged because you haven’t succeeded yet, your turn will come. You need to be happy for them and congratulate them on their achievement. If someone made it, than it is a great omen that you can do it too.



No one is telling you what to do, you can choose whatever you want to have, be or feel. There are no limits in life other than our own restriction. Besides no one is actually interfering you. It is very easy to blame people and scenarios that influence us but the hard truth is that if we will work hard than nothing else could stop us.



Let’s say you want to open a small business from home and you don’t have time for this because you already have a job, wife and kids. So what can you do in order to manifest the desire? Watch less TV, don’t go to vacations and safe money. But the more important step is to free some time for the new project. And for this you can way up in early in the morning. Make it 5, 6 or 7 a.m. be an early bird and devote yourself to the mission before the sun rise.



1103 angel number significance is to save the energy and not to waste it for free. If you are tired in a certain day than don’t put more obligation on yourself, it will grind the vitality and it will take long time to restore the dwindling resources. Operate on energy efficiency level or power saving. Know the limits of your metal, physical and metaphysical capacities. Because after all, we are not here to wear ourselves, but to have some free time to have fun and enjoyment.



**What does 1103 angel number signify**



What does 1103 angel number signify? Be serious and have some deep thoughts on how life should be. All doors are open for you and yet if you find a roadblock than enter from the window. If the window is closed enter through the chimney. The person who doesn’t stop is the person who is worthy of the reward in the end of the line.



Mind you that the modern world gets us to feel comfortable in any step we take under the sun. But life is being created out of the comfort zone. You can hide and protect yourself from any stormy weather, bad influences, evil psychic forces and basically live alone inside your room in front of the computer which is plugged to the internet.



You can do only shopping, chat with friends on the phone, entertain yourself and even work at home. But none of this can replace the real world and it will not make you happy. It will only lock you inside of dark box.



Go out side and be an active person in the world, make a statement, live your mark, influence on the energy fields and live as you suppose to live. The angels will always guide you via the repeating sequence numbers like 1103. But the first step should be yours. Show the angels that you accept the sign from the scribes. Make 1103 angel number the numerology talisman that will shift the course of events in areas like: Twin flame, love, career, family and spiritual development.

1g0p5g6,1,2024-10-10,Getting diagnosed - would it be helpful to get a second opinion?,u/minex33,AutismInWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1g0p5g6/getting_diagnosed_would_it_be_helpful_to_get_a/,"Hello, I’m new here and have a question regarding getting diagnosed. 
I tried to trim my text with chat gpt, I‘m sorry if it sounds strange at some points. 

I’m 26 and was diagnosed with ADHD at 20. I also have social anxiety and chronic depression and am good at masking. I do it even if I have a bad mental state, meltdown or crisis. 
Over the years, I've taken a few autism tests, mostly out of curiosity because I‘ve learned about co-occurrences between the two, even though I know that there was a chance for a false positive result because of me having ADHD. As there where more and more videos of people experiencing both ADHD and autism and what their experiences are, it felt like they were describing what I experience and identified with them and I found that advice for autism really helped a lot. Since then I went down a rabbit hole and found out many things, from videos, to forums, to books, worksheets and studies.  

Earlier this year, I had a meltdown at university. My then therapist said that the cause for it sounds more like something that occurs in autism, and that she‘d ask colleagues about it. My teacher and a fellow student with both ADHD and autism also mentioned that I might be autistic based on their observations. 

My current therapist did an assessment and had me fill out an online test for masking and the AQ. When I told her my results she couldn‘t interpret them, which I found strange, since why and how things are scored are right are written on the site where I took the tests. It confused me a bit.
After our interview she didn’t feel I met enough criteria for a formal diagnosis. However, she suggested that because of what I told her about my past and my experiences, I might just be good at masking and managing socially and wouldn‘t need more help with it, that we‘d have to work on helping me manage sensory issues, meltdowns and how I respond to change. She also said, that the material that is available to her doesn‘t take into consideration how autism appears in women and is a bit dated still.
For her, there was also a question if it maybe just is my social anxiety, which I told her doesn‘t necessarily rule out autism, because they can coincide with each other statistically. 

I’m wondering if I should seek a second opinion, as my current diagnosis doesn’t fully explain why I struggle so much with aspects of it, that ADHD alone doesn’t cover. I know it won‘t change a lot, but maybe could get me more help. 
However I also talked with a friend who had the same question for himself, and he told me that he decided that it would be okay for him how it is. I‘m not sure what to do, since I can‘t let it go. I know that I could be wrong, that it could be a psychological effect, but when I watch those videos or read about others experiences, I feel understood.
I‘m struggling a bit to summarize everything, even with the help of chatgpt and I don‘t think that what I wrote covers everything, but maybe it‘s enough information. 

Any advice would be appreciated!"

1g0qmh6,1,2024-10-10,Looking for advice on getting an SEO job without a degree,u/Personal_Jury_8370,SEO,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1g0qmh6/looking_for_advice_on_getting_an_seo_job_without/,"This is a bit of a long post but I'm looking for some advice on whether my experience is enough for an entry-level remote SEO job. When I look at these job posts on LinkedIn, I see each one getting hundreds of job applicants so I just want some honest advice about how competitive my experience would be considering that I also dropped out of college.

While I was in college, I was part of a student-run marketing agency, and my role for one of our client projects involved SEO. 

* On-page SEO (title tags, alt text, meta descriptions)
* keyword research using SEMrush
* technical SEO (submitting sitemaps and making sure every page was crawled and indexed)
* site audits. 
* We also generated some basic traffic reports on Google Analytics. 
* Client's website saw increase in page views by 48.4% and unique page views by 50.07%, increase in new users by 170%, and decrease in bounce rate by 50%. I gained a leadership position where I had an advisory for digital strategy across multiple projects.

Client's website saw an increase in page views by 48.4% and unique page views by 50.07%, increase in new users by 170%, and decrease in bounce rate by 50%. 

I then dropped out of college my junior year. I don't want to get too personal but I was just struggling with depression, and I was too stubborn to reach out for help, thinking I could just deal with it on my own. However, I kept failing classes and was about to be put on academic probation, so I ended up dropping out so I could have the opportunity to get my mental health straight.

That was in 2021, and then I worked a few jobs here and there. They were manual jobs but they gave me time for self-reflection and introspection. I also took the time to complete some certifications on HubSpot (Digital Marketing, SEO I, and SEOII) and I completed Coursera's Google Digital Marketing and E-Commerce certification. Earlier this year, I felt like everything was starting to click for me and that I was finally starting to become my best ally instead of my worst enemy.

I wanted some more hands on marketing experience so I also took on another project. I have a family member who sells handmade jewelry twice a month at pop events in our city. They had no online presence so I offered to create a Shopify store, an Etsy store, and an Instagram profile for their business. I have not condensed the bullet points for this part of my resume yet, I apologize for making it long.

I created the Instagram first while I worked on building the website. 

* Did keyword research on Instagram primarily for hashtags and Instagram's search engine, but also optimized the bio and account name to rank on Google for relevant search terms.
* In addition to posting photos of the jewelry on IG, created educational content about sustainability and client's culture, two important aspects of the brand.
* Ensured a consistent tone across all posts.
* Followed best practices for posts by creating an engaging hook and CTA for every post, ensuring captions included relevant keywords and hashtags, op, and encouraged engagement with posted content.

I then created the Etsy store shortly after I set up the Instagram account:

* Conducted keyword research for our niche and keyword gap analysis on other Etsy stores using eRank
* Followed best practices to optimize product listings' title copy, body copy, product images and video, alt tags, product information, and keyword and tag strategy.

I have never built a website before so this took me the longest to flesh out and it just went live about a month ago. Here's what I did:

* Performed keyword research using SEMRush, Keyword Planner, [answerthepublic.com](http://answerthepublic.com) to guide keyword strategies for Shopify store’s, landing pages, category and product pages, and pillar and cluster articles.
* Conducted gap analysis on SEMRush to discover high-quality head terms and long-tail keywords that were driving high traffic and rankings for competitor URLs.
* Optimized on-page SEO factors: title tags, header tags, image alt text, meta descriptions, URL structure, internal linking, anchor text, keyword density, schema markup for product pages and FAQ page, engaging and relevant copy, word count, text-to-HTML ratio
* Optimized technical SEO factors: Site speed core web vitals, mobile friendliness, XML sitemaps robots.txt file, site architecture, crawlability, indexability, schema markup for product pages and FAQ, canonicalization, broken links, redirect issues.
* Conducted SEO site audits using SEMRush and Google Search Console to find and resolve issues with the aforementioned factors. 
* Regularly generated reports on website traffic metrics and SEO performance with Google Analytics and SEMRush and suggested specific areas for improvement and growth. 

I used ChatGPT to help me across all platforms. I fed it with information about the brand, including the type of products being sold, multiple customer personas for each platform, the desired tone and style, marketing goals, and more. I primarily used ChatGPT to generate content ideas and keywords (I filtered keyword ideas through SEMRush and eRank). For actual content creation, I set up a custom GPT to write articles for me based on keywords I gave it. I wrote all the other copy (IG posts, Etsy listings, Shopify pages) myself.

The website has been up for about a month, and the IG and Etsy accounts have been running for about three months. The website hasn't seen a lot of traffic yet, and I'm still working daily on adding more content and fixing any i

So right now, I'm 25 and I feel like I am at a checkpoint. I've regained a lot of the confidence I lost after I dropped out and I've been working hard to make the most of myself. I 100% want to finish my degree, but right now I'm working a dead end job living paycheck to paycheck and I want to establish a financial foothold for myself. I'd appreciate any advice or suggestions on whether my experience is enough to for entry-level remote SEO jobs. Do I have enough to compete with them or should I keep hammering away at this project until I get more impressive results?"

1g10suu,1,2024-10-10,Most of the success I've found in my life feels unearned,u/Critical-Society-247,confessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1g10suu/most_of_the_success_ive_found_in_my_life_feels/,"I don't feel like I deserve any of my accomplishments. Looking back on my experience between high school to where I am now, I can't shake the feeling that I've built my entire academic and professional life on a foundation of lies, exaggerations, and half-assed efforts. It's a nagging thought that follows me everywhere. 

I've always described myself as someone with high aspirations but low ambitions. In high school, I was a good student on paper and got straight A's, but the truth is I cheated on tests occasionally. I justified it because all the other smart kids in AP classes did it too, and I still took time to learn the material, so I didn't feel too bad. I was only in a couple of clubs but only showed up to chat with friends for around 10 minutes once in a while. An average day for me was waking up, finishing the school day, chatting with friends, going home, taking a 5-hour nap, finishing homework, then going to sleep.

Then COVID hit, and it felt like my brain got lobotomized and I became even more lazier than I ever was. When classes went asynchronous and pass/fail, I started doing the bare minimum and spent 16 hours a day sleeping. Once letter grades came back, I cheated on every exam without learning the content. My classes were fully remote and I told all my teachers that my camera was dead so I could sleep. I failed almost every single AP exam my last year, but somehow, that didn't stop me from getting into college.

For my college applications, I decided out of nowhere that I wanted to be a nuclear engineer. I didn't know anything about the field and didn't even feel the urge to learn - I'm just not a naturally curious person. I thought it sounded cool on a surface level, so I ran with it. I lied on my applications, talking about a passion for fusion energy because I saw article about it and decided to make it my personality. I exaggerated all my extracurriculars too. I had no real leadership roles, was never officer of any clubs, but I called myself the ""captain"" of some hackathon teams and engineering projects I took part in. I did handle a lot of logistics in these projects, like setting up meetings and preparing deliverables, but people around me did the meat of the work. 

My college essay was all about coming from a low-income household and what this experience taught me. I talked about how I was passionate about helping other low-income households and wrote about some big ambitious plan I had for using technology to help the community, but I had no real intent to follow through on any of it. By some miracle, I got into multiple prestigious colleges and ended up at an Ivy League university. I stopped cheating on coursework. I was a decent student with a decent GPA, but I had no real passion for my major or an outstanding work ethic.  

I made friends in my field who seemed genuinely passionate about nuclear, worked at national labs, and talk about developments in the field constantly. I felt I had to keep up the facade of being really into the field because I couldn't admit I didn't care much about it. I joined a student engineering team, but most of my work was trivial and I relied on others to do the brunt of the work. I felt awful because I didn't understand any of it on a deep technical level.

One skill I did gain was getting really good at exaggerating on my resume. I got interviews with several companies and excelled at behavioral interviews. I could talk about my ""experience"" at a high level to engineering managers who lacked technical backgrounds. But I always failed technical interviews because I never retained material from my classes. I skip classes regularly and cram material before exams. To this day, I've never passed a technical interview. I also failed interviews with anyone from a remotely technical background because they'd ask specific questions about things on my resume that I couldn't answer.

I eventually landed internships at two prestigious companies through networking. In my first internship, I spent most days doing nothing and playing video games. I had a mentor who set up an experiment for me to conduct, but I mostly watched the higher-ups run it and I would just press a button occasionally. I was embarrassed because I didn't understand what was going on technically. For my second internship, which was programming-based, I had ChatGPT do the work. I only worked about an hour a week and then gaslight my mentor (who has limited programming experience) into thinking it was several hours of work, and they would be very impressed. I didn't have a deep technical understanding of what was going on in either internship. I just observed and made trivial contributions while others did the real work. I knew it would be embarrassing to say ""I don't know"" in future job interviews when asked about my internships. What I did was have ChatGPT explain the terminology people used around me and basically explain what my job was, then I made a big document describing what each bullet point on my resume meant in case I was questioned and committed these talking points to memory. 

Now, I've recently landed a six-figure job at a tech company after attending a recruiting event and doing a single non-technical interview. Everyone tells me I should be proud of myself, that I've accomplished so much. But I can't shake the guilt and disappointment I feel in how little I actually understand and how lazy I've been. I've built this whole career on exaggerations, half-truths, faking passion. Whenever I try to talk about these feelings, people tell me it's just imposer syndrome, which is probably a factor in some of these feelings, but I don't think that's the full story, given how many shortcuts I've taken.

Have you ever thought about how to maximize the potential of ChatGPT right in your pocket? Here are five prompts that can transform your experience and open doors to creativity and productivity you might not have considered.

First off, how about using ChatGPT as your personal brainstorming buddy? Whether you’re planning a project, writing a story, or just need fresh ideas, asking for suggestions can spark inspiration in unexpected ways. It's like having a creative partner who’s always ready to help.

Next, consider turning to ChatGPT for personalized learning. If you’re curious about a topic, ask it to explain complex concepts in simple terms. This can be especially useful for students or lifelong learners who want to grasp new ideas without getting overwhelmed.

Don’t underestimate its ability to assist with daily tasks either. Want to draft an email or create a to-do list? Just ask! It can help you structure your thoughts and save time, making your day just a little bit easier.

Additionally, if you’re in need of a mood boost, try engaging with ChatGPT in a lighthearted way. Ask it to tell you a joke or share a fun fact. It’s a simple way to inject some positivity into your day.

Lastly, why not use ChatGPT as a language practice partner? Whether you’re learning a new language or brushing up on your skills, conversing with it can enhance your fluency and confidence.

Incorporating these prompts into your routine could revolutionize how you interact with AI. It’s all about unlocking that hidden potential and making your phone work harder for you!"

Me: presents the chair with a clearcut case of plagiarism.

The email presents: 

1) clearly AI generated essay and emails in which the students admits to   
2) using ChatGPT to create examples in a personal narrative (!) (that was not all ChatGPT did, but okay)   
3) admits that sources were used but were not documented (hastily throws a Works Cited at me---still more questions about why that's in a narrative essay, and still constitutes academic dishonesty for not citing sources in the first place)   
4) student finally admits that the paid version of Grammarly did all the writing, so that's probably why it sounds like AI (because it *is*)

The chair: well, I can see that the student has a passing grade so far. Will assigning a 0 mean that she won't pass the class? If so, can you use this as a teaching moment and reassign her the essay?

Bruh, the student admitted three times that they didn't write the assignment and tried to lie about it, and you want them to pass the class? Yeah ... not the sort of teaching job I was looking for here. 

Not sure if anyone needs this context, but, yes, students have had academic honesty drilled into them in the first six weeks, which also includes a lengthy lecture on using online tools to write for them. The student heard all that and still did the opposite of everything I said. We're very student-centered. The administrative infrastructure supports the students no matter what (please read with sarcasm). "

1g1npoo,73,2024-10-11,Student yelling at me during class,u/ThrowRA_stinky5560,teaching,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/1g1npoo/student_yelling_at_me_during_class/,"I have a difficult 6th period. I teach middle school art and my 6th period is my advanced 7th/8th combo class. A ton of kids were misplaced into that class. It’s my first year so I had no say over it but a ton of kids with no art experience or any passion at all. A ton of behavioral issues and 13 IEPs out of 36 kids.

The principal suggested to me, after exhausting several PBIS strategies, to introduce textbook work to the students who were disruptive. It’s an art class but I don’t have to teach them how to draw or paint. They can learn theory if they can’t handle behaving according to class standards. 

We have routines in place. We have expectations (that we review every day to reward one student with a positive call home). Anyways. A kid today stole another kid’s hat and then ran through my room and threw a stool to the ground behind him. I gave him the textbook assignment right away. I followed through. 

He threw the textbook down on the desk and started yelling at me that it was so unfair and he shouldn’t have to do it. I calmly explained that he could not yell at me and that it was so inappropriate to yell at a teacher. He then leaned back and told me he wouldn’t do the assignment and that I couldn’t make him.

I agreed and told him that it was worth the weight of his original assigned project and that he would just have to take a zero. 

I gave one to another student who pushed someone. He began telling me why he should be allowed to chatgpt his response. I explained again that the assignment was on paper written by hand without the use of Chromebooks. He started yelling at me.

I went home crying today. I wish they were not in my class. I don’t know what to do other than try to be positive again on Monday and stand firm in the decision to assign that work. But I also went home crying because I feel like the rest of my class is suffering over two students who can’t get their behavior in check. 

What would you do?"

Today's paper is titled ""Advancing Global South University Education with Large Language Models"" by Kemas Muslim L, Toru Ishida, Aditya Firman Ihsan, and Rikman Aherliwan Rudawan.

The study examines the integration of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, into higher education within the Global South, focusing on their potential to alleviate certain educational challenges. This research underscores the disparity in educational quality between the Global South and North, in particular the high student-to-teacher ratios, and explores LLM's potential in addressing these issues.

Here are the key points from the paper:

1. **Educational Disparity**: The research highlights the growing educational disparity between the Global South and North due to stagnant public expenditure per student amidst increasing student numbers. This disparity poses a significant challenge, particularly in poorly-resourced education systems.

2. **LLMs as Educational Tools**: Large language models, already being deployed in some schools for creative uses in diverse courses, are examined here for their ability to improve interactive learning, personalizing content, and reducing educators' workload. These models present a potential technological leap for underserved academic environments.

3. **Pilot Study at Telkom University**: The research showcases a pilot study at Telkom University in Indonesia, using LLMs in courses like Mathematics and English. The study aimed to understand how LLM integration can support education without overburdening educators and to measure its impact on student motivation and performance.

4. **Multilingual and Tailored Learning**: LLMs offer capabilities such as multilingual support which can be particularly advantageous in non-English-speaking regions, allowing for more inclusive education and support for diverse learning needs.

5. **Challenges and Ethical Considerations**: The paper acknowledges challenges like data privacy and the need for reliable AI responses. Ethical concerns regarding plagiarism and the accurate assessment of student performance were also discussed.

Overall, the study presents a unique perspective on employing AI in educational settings where resources are constrained, proposing LLMs as a meaningful supplement to traditional teaching methods in the Global South.

I tried to improve that by downloading books and reading them, but lead to much frustration because most concepts are vaguely described or I can't make them work in combination. I didn't want to ask badly worded vague questions on task that would be left unanswered (done that). Which is why I abandoned each my attempt to learn.

Recently I dived into Bayesian statistics for my personal project and use ChatGPT as a learning assistant - I uploaded the book there and ask relevant questions. It even understands screenshots. I'd give up this project long ago if not for this tool. It is wonderful at connecting different topics and explaining how they work together, or just answering questions. It is so refreshing to have something that has your back if you have difficulties. Sure, you need some understanding to verify responses.

Some people say that ChatGPT gonna kill education, but it's contrary to me (although I'm not a student)."

   although I spent a lot of time writing the prompt words, because in order to derive these formulas I needed to integrate knowledge from multiple papers, but the latest ai agent's information is hot, I think everything I do now can be automated by having a powerful ai agent and then collecting the information from the papers I provide him with and then automatically deriving and completing the code according to my instructions, if this technology matures in the next few years, I think everything I've done so far can be done in less than an hour, so where is the value in that for me?

   Also I'm learning C++ now and in the future I want to become a programmer in the future, but I think AI can drastically reduce the number of programmers in the future, AI has powerful computing power, almost unlimited memory and powerful enumeration and almost limit-less chain of thoughts, I think this AI will be able to outperform human beings in writing C++ code without memory leaks and high concurrency C++ codes, this AI will be able to learn all the code bases and all the coding experiences in the world. AI can't do it now, but what about 5 years from now? transformer architecture was proposed in 2017 and then 5 years later there was an explosion of AI applications like chatgpt, who knows what will happen in the next 5 years?

It is foreseeable that with the rapid development of AI, the importance of knowledge will become less and less, some people may say that the results of the AI still need to be checked by human beings, but fewer and fewer human beings are needed,  And now that AI is already an asset-heavy industry, massive GPU cluster are more important than human resources, and if AGI is born, what will this mean for countries that don't have AGI? I've already thought about it, first there will be massive unemployment then all the foreign exchange reserves will flow into the big foreign tech companies, then there will be total collapse and famine, a lot of people will die in the process and then others will become slaves of the big companies because these people don't have any economic value any more, I don't know what skills I should learn right now, it's likely that my programming skills may be rendered useless in a few years, I'd like to learn blue-collar but I have nearsightedness and astigmatism, I can't see even close things when I take off my glasses, I don't know if I can adapt to drastic exercise, maybe it's a good idea to kill myself when AGI is born or my skills are completely obsolete, I bet there won't be a UBI for a few decades and for those countries that haven't gotten a handle on AI they'll be even less likely to have a UBI

Cheating has always been a problem, more so with the advent of AI where students turn in reference-less ChatGPT word salad.

There are tools that can detect AI written text. It's not definite, but if a piece of text is assessed as being likely AI written, coupled with a student being unable to defend themselves in an oral viva, then it's pretty solid evidence. I submitted academic dishonesty reports for several students. I was hoping to spend a hour or so on call in total with those students and ask them questions about their essays.

I got a email back from admin saying that they would not entertain having oral vivas, that AI detectors give false positives so ""unless there is an actual AI prompt in their essay we don't want to hear about it"", and that even if they did cheat ""It's just a sign of adaptability to modern economic forces"". 

They finally told me that I should therefore ""learn to incorporate AI in my classes"". This happened 12 months ago. 

Okay college administration, I will ""learn to incorporate AI in my classes"".

I'm the course coordinator for the core unit. I have full control over the syllabus. I started to use an AI proctoring software for all my assessment and quizzes. This software uses facial recognition and tracks keystrokes and copy-pasting. 

I also changed the syllabus to have several shorter writing assessments (i.e 400 words) instead of a couple large ones (i.e 1500 words).

Before you dislike me for ruining students' lives -- this is an online first year course and students can still do their assessment whenever it suits them. Additionally, only citizens can enroll in online degrees in my country, and they only need to start paying back their student loans if they earn more than $52k a year. Most importantly, nobody should be awarded a degree if they got ChatGPT to do it.

The result?

Cheating has been reduced to a nil in my unit. All forms of cheating have been abolished in my class, including paid ghostwriting -- AI and human.

I was called to a meeting a few weeks ago where a board told me that data analysis showed that in the past year, a higher proportion of new students in my major are discontinuing their degree, and that this was forecast to cost them $100,000's in tuition and CSP funding over the next 12 quarters. They told me that they ""fear my unconventional assessment method might be to blame.""

I simply stated that I was told to incorporate modern technologies, we are offering an asynchronous online degree, our pathos is to uphold academic honesty, and that I offer a flexible AI-drive asynchronous assessment option that is less demanding than having to write large essays."

1g2bapg,33,2024-10-12,"How I escaped Forever Alone, and 20 things I've learned along the way [Very Long Post]",u/where_the_moon_burns,ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/1g2bapg/how_i_escaped_forever_alone_and_20_things_ive/,"# Introduction

I've been posting to this subreddit under various accounts for over a decade, from my high school days all the way into my late twenties. It felt good to know that there were plenty of lonely people like me out there, and we could be forever alone, together. There were times when I believed that I would be this way for the rest of my life.

But today I have a girlfriend who says she's lucky to have me, and a diverse friend group both through my own efforts and through her.

This didn't happen overnight. It has taken years of hard work, tears, failures, and difficult self-reflection to get to this point. In this post, I'm going to tell you my story, along with the lessons I had to learn in order to reach this point, in the hope that it may advise and inspire you on your own journey.

# An Acknowledgement of Privilege

I am aware that the path I took will not be possible for every man to take. I had the following advantages:

* I live in a big city, with a large dating pool, where opportunities for social connection are abundant. A ForeverAlone man who lives in a small town or a rural area will not have as many options as I did.
* I am white, and did not have to deal with the prejudices or stereotyping that men of colour may experience while dating.
* In my adult life I have had disposable income to spend on improving myself, because I am lucky to have graduated college without student debt, and I have worked steady jobs that usually paid well. A poorer man might not have such resources.

On the other hand, I am autistic. Therefore I was not entirely without environmental handicaps.

Forever Alone people frequently mention looks or height as inalterable factors that determine one's dating prospects. For me, I know that I am of average height. But I don't know how good-looking I am, so I don't know how privileged I am in that way. When I have asked women this question in the past, they have always answered me vaguely and said ""Girls care about personality more and you have a good personality"". I think I look like an average-looking nerd.

#  Birth-2015: How I Became FA

My father was Forever Alone just like me, and it seems like he only escaped through divine intervention. He prayed to god that he would find a woman with certain qualities, and happened to meet my mother, who had all those qualities. They didn't conceive me until he was in his 40s, and his older genes cursed me with autism.

With this disorder, combined with their fundamentalist religious values, I grew up a goody two-shoes teacher's pet who spent hours poring over apologetics to defend his faith. Think Rodd and Todd from *The Simpsons*. Despite all the harsh pushing of my parents to make friends — which once went so far as taking away all my toys, television, and computer access for an entire school year — I saw little point in other people, instead preferring the cozy indoor company of books and games.

Yet even with these hindrances, I believe that I was on the path to succeed romantically. In the fourth and fifth grades I confessed my feelings to multiple crushes. In the seventh grade one such crush started pursuing me back, and at my elementary school graduation we slow danced. I even owned a copy of *The Big Book of Boy Stuff* by Bart King, in which there's a section that explains the very basics of dating for boys. But it never occurred to me to ask any of these girls to come play with me, despite the book saying exactly that.

So there's your first lesson: **In order to date girls, you have to ask them out. Ask if they would like to do a fun activity with you.** Per the advice of the Interpersonal Stack Exchange, use the word ""date"" to make it clear it's not just a friendly thing, e.g. ""I think [place] would make for a good first date"". I know this is a very basic insight, but sometimes the obvious things need to be directly said. If only somebody had said this to me, I might have followed through.

But then middle school came along, and with it sex education, from both school and church. (The girl who slow danced with me moved away.) My autistic brain loves rules, and a rule like ""no sex before marriage"" is something it magnetizes onto, destroying any hopes at teenage love I might have had. I was obsessed with how sinful the world was and how pure and enlightened we Christians were for putting our minds above our bodily urges. My monkey brain would tell me ""every girl in your school is smokin' hot"", but I would do everything I could to suppress those desires. I would argue with people online that saving yourself for marriage was the right choice, and would always remind myself of Ecclesiastes 9:9: ""Live happily with the woman you love through all the meaningless days of life that God has given you under the sun. The wife God gives you is your reward for all your earthly toil."" I would tell myself that if I just worked hard enough, God would cause a wife to fall right into my lap. But here too is a lesson: **No one will provide you with a partner. You must go out into the world and work to find a partner yourself.**

Though that overt phase gradually faded away, the damage was done. All through middle school, high school, and college, the most action I got was when someone walked up to me and asked ""Are you and [girl] dating?"" We weren't, we were just working on a project together.

# 2016: Earliest Efforts

I was in the middle of an internship in college when I was struck with a sudden desperation for love. I couldn't understand why, because I had been fine alone up to that point.

This is another lesson, a reassuring one: **You are evolutionarily programmed with a drive to find somebody to love. It will *eventually* happen to you, as it eventually happens for the majority of men.** This sudden urge was my programming calling on me to take action.

So I did the only thing I knew how to do: created a dating profile on OKCupid, the only dating site I could find that was free and allowed me to set my preferences to Christians who wanted to wait until marriage.

My pictures were bad, my messages were desperate and cringey, and I got zero interested responses. This was before OKCupid required you to match with someone to message them, so I sent tonnes of unsolicited messages to people with a high match percentage. The one time a woman responded to me, it was to say that she wasn't interested. At the time, even that felt like a success.

# 2017: The Worst Year

From what I've heard, 2017 was a good year for most of the world. For me, it was unambiguously the worst year of my life. It all started when I saw something that destroyed the foundations of my faith in Christianity. At the time, it felt like a bomb going off in my chest.

I didn't want to let go of the faith for a few months. I talked a lot with my parents and pastors until my mother, fearing for my immortal soul, told me to stop asking questions. So I did, and became an atheist.

One of the first things I did now that I no longer believed that some deity cared about my sex life was to create a Tinder account. After all, it had been described to me as a land of reckless promiscuity, easy hook-ups for all. Nothing could be further from the truth. My first match was such a disaster that I won't even describe it, and it didn't get much better from there. In all my years on Tinder, I have gotten just one date. It is the worst of the dating apps, and while I won't recommend a specific one, I will recommend not using Tinder.

I must admit that I am partially to blame during this time, for I would swipe left on all the less-than-attractive women and only swipe right on the pretty ones. Here we find this year's lesson: **Beggars can't be choosers. Physical appearance should not be a concern to you, but don't be afraid to swipe left on the basis of obviously incompatible personalities.** Like if you're a conservative and someone's profile says ""conservatives swipe left"", swipe left. Also, if you swipe left on a non-white woman for the sole reason that she is non-white, you are your own worst enemy and also just a bad person and a racist.

Anyway, back to the story. My belief in God had been the basis of my whole worldview. Without him, I struggled to find meaning in life, and began to descend into a dark place. I barely passed the spring semester of college, and then with lots of free time during the summer I went into a downward spiral that culminated in an ugly incident where my parents learned of my deconversion.

With all that had happened I was in no shape to tackle college in the fall, even though the courses I had chosen were very difficult. Also, my favorite video game released a large content update and I spent way too much time playing it. The result was that I failed multiple courses.

# 2018: Going Outside

I knew that I needed to finish school, so in the spring semester I sucked it up, put my struggles aside, and got to work. I succeeded, repeating the courses I'd failed and passing them this time. I landed a job at a prestigious company, graduated, and left college behind for the adult world.

Unfortunately, as a remnant of my troubles in 2017, I fell in with certain forums for *those misogynistic men who blame women for their problems known by a word that must not be named.* I never went to the extreme levels of misogyny seen there; I simply found them a good source of solace and a way to shift blame for my problems off myself, much like this place.

I hit rock bottom in early July, driven partly by my loneliness but mostly by feeding it online. Loneliness would cause physical pain for me, a feeling like a black hole was sucking things up inside my stomach. I would get this feeling several times a week. The moment of deepest sorrow came when I went to see a movie, and I felt that sucking pain of desperation every single time there was a woman on screen. I walked home in the pouring rain, crawled into bed cuddling my pillow and cried myself to sleep. The next morning I discovered I had lost my keys on the way home.

But at this miserable low point, I realized that feeding my loneliness and participating in such forums was not useful if I actually wanted to stop being Forever Alone.

So I resolved to *do something about it.*

---

A MeetUp (use this site, you'll find lots of local social groups to do activities with) event led to a meeting with a dating coach, who told me ""You're not ready for my methods yet. Go join this therapy group for men, and we'll talk later."" He was right. It's hard to hear that you're not ready.

Lesson: **In order to date, you must become a datable person. But improving yourself doesn't mean losing yourself.** No woman would have wanted me as the scary, bitter, immature fellow I was at the time. Does this mean you suck? Does this mean you're not good enough? Probably, yeah. I know it's absolutely crushing to hear. But if you were good enough, you would have gotten some action by now. The reason you're here is that you need to go outside, work harder, and become the kind of person who gets the girls.

At the same time though, I used to be afraid of self-improvement, because Christian media emphasizes that becoming one with the Lord means losing yourself. I've met a few Christians who have lost themselves like that, who constantly have big smiles on their faces and are preaching Jesus to everyone they meet. But that's not how secular self-improvement works. Look at the *Kung Fu Panda* trilogy; by the end of the final film, Po has gone from a lowly noodle boy to the almighty Dragon Warrior, but he's still a lovable, funny panda who takes a moment to gush about how awesome his powers are before attacking. Or look at *The Good Place*, where every main character becomes good in their own way when they are given a second chance.

The therapy group had to spend a few months purging all my complaints about life and dating that I had picked up from the evil forums. (Those complaints were mostly theoretical, as I had barely tried actually engaging with women outside of dating apps.) One member pointed out an important lesson that caused me to stop visiting this subreddit for a long time: **Forever Alone forums can hinder you if they provide a place to wallow in misery at the expense of action.** The men in the group also introduced me to a positive side of masculine strength that I had rarely seen before.

That strength soon came up when my father and I disagreed on something and I stood up to him. The disagreement escalated to an argument that led to him kicking me out of the house. I found a beautiful, affordable apartment in a good neighbourhood, gathered together some acquaintances, packed my bags, and left.

I have happy memories of sitting alone in that quiet apartment in the winter months, finally free to make my own destiny. For ""freedom is not a gift to be granted when maturity is achieved, but the precondition for acquiring maturity."" ― Noam Chomsky [paraphrased]

# 2019: Air I Breathe

The title of this section originates from the song ""Air I Breathe"" by Mat Kearney, a song I discovered from my YouTube recommendations early in 2019. It's a catchy, poignant song that always brings me back to this part of my life, breathing the free air of the big city.

With steady income and my therapy group at my back gradually molding me into a man, I felt free to explore my city like never before. I attended dance classes, joined a club for a video game I liked, went on a couple of dating app dates that went nowhere, and joined a second (co-ed) therapy group where I met lots of women into similar kinds of self-help. Interacting with such women in a non-judgemental environment was an important step for me.

At the end of June I got laid! ...off from my job. The very next day I went to a music festival where, after I expressed my frustrations in a sharing circle, a woman let me cuddle with her and then invited me to touch her clothed breasts out of pity. (It should go without saying that pity won't get you very far with women. I'm not even going to count that as a lesson. I got lucky, don't ever try what I did.) At this time I started drinking alcohol, having never bothered to before despite being of legal drinking age for years. With the help of earplugs to take the edge off the noise, this allowed me to start hitting the nightlife scene, where I had a couple more little successes. I held hands with a girl as she led me from one room to another. Someone mistook me for a professional dancer from how enthusiastically I was dancing. One time I even grinded with a girl who pulled me in towards her, but then her friend callously said ""She has a boyfriend of three years; she's not interested"" and yanked her away.

Another notable development from this year was that my therapy group encouraged me to get into fitness and I hired a personal trainer for three months' worth of lessons. Since then, I have done that twice more, once in 2021 and once in 2023. I have to address exercise and weightlifting because it's so often recommended to FAs. But in all honesty, I don't really think it's helped me become more datable. It's definitely made me feel healthier/understand my body, and it's helped me build character through suffering. But each time the whole regimen of diet and exercise only gained me about 15 pounds of muscle, which only the men in my life commented on. Unless you're willing to pour your heart, soul, and wallet into training, and stick with it for a year or more, you're not going to build a model-worthy figure that will attract girls on its own. Developing your personality really is easier, cheaper, and more important.

On occasion I experimented with cold-approaching women in public, helped by an older divorcé from the group. It did help me get over my anxiety with strangers, but it wasn't very useful when it came to actually finding a partner, though my more confident mentor reported several successes and dates. (He was also rich and handsome, though...) Unless you have something that's obviously in common to open the conversation with, rarely will a woman text a stranger back. But don't be afraid to ask for numbers. Most women will freely offer them.

I managed to get an offer from another job, but I realized that I disliked that line of work. So I declined that offer and decided to use all the money I'd saved up to go backpacking in a foreign country I'd always dreamed of, one with a reputation for promiscuity. My flight left on Halloween night 2019, and while the plane took off I saw a beautiful sight, a fireworks show below us. It looked so tiny from above.

# 2020: Backpacking

Then the pandemic hit.

Well, not right away. I had a few good months of fun in my city of arrival. And even then, the country I was in wasn't hit as hard by the pandemic as some others were; at worst I couldn't cross a state border or lost a temp job.

The hard labor that I could get with my work visa, the interaction with all the free-spirited young diverse people in my hostels, the wonderous new sights and sounds I perceived everywhere I went; all of these made 2020 a year of great maturation for me. ""Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness"", as they say. My dating efforts this year, though, were total failures. I got zero action while backpacking, none at all, and with hostels full of love in the air it was at times torturous to watch everybody around me bang each other with seeming ease.

I know one reason why: because I was desperate. Lesson: **As with job searching, desperation is very unattractive. It makes it appear that you don't want that person for who they are, you just want anyone at all.**

There was one hostel where I systematically asked out every single girl there and was turned down every time. One of those girls, who had formed a relationship with another guy that went on to last for years, warned me something that should be taken as a lesson: **Women talk to each other about guys who have asked them out. In an environment with a limited supply of women, such as a hostel or your workplace, choose your asks very carefully, because asking out too many of them makes you look desperate.**

# 2021: Held Back at the Worst Time

After flying home and spending a few months quarantining and getting back on my feet, I got a job that paid minimum wage. Because of that salary, this year really didn't teach me much except the value of money and going outside. It was an unfortunate delay in my journey just when I was ready to put into practice my personal growth from abroad. Pandemic restrictions were still in effect in most places, and at minimum wage I couldn't afford much more activities than a dating app subscription.

But somehow that subscription actually got me a brief long-distance relationship with someone on the other side of the country.

It lasted only three months, and we never met in person due to COVID restrictions, only video calling on a regular basis. But we became very emotionally close in those short months. It was the highlight of my year, and I was devastated when she ended it over the pandemic's uncertainty, having found a local man she could see regularly. We exchanged messages as friends for a few years afterward.

The only other date I had that year was with a girl I might have been very compatible with, but I totally botched it. I got on the wrong bus and showed up an hour late, then I was impatient waiting for our food, then I did something she had asked me not to do because I had misunderstood the instruction.

I think the overall lesson from this year is: **Don't be afraid to fail.** You're probably going to screw up, scare away that girl you thought was the one, do lots of cringey things. Lord knows I did; I shudder to this day thinking about some of the things I said to women I'd just met. And that's OK. You're figuring yourself out! This is a part of your life that you've neglected until now. Dating is a skill that you have to build, so of course you're going to make mistakes, because you're learning.

I was bad at my job, and my boss might have fired me if I'd stayed much longer — he had already said he couldn't trust me with the main responsibility of the job. But luckily, a guy from my therapy group put in a good word for me with his employer, and so I got a job at that company that paid far, far more.

# 2022: Trickles

The way I would sum up my 2022 is the chorus of Linkin Park's song ""In the End"": ""I tried so hard and got so far / But in the end, it didn't even matter"". I accomplished something unrelated to dating that I'd been working on for years, but then external circumstances rendered that achievement hollow. When it came to dating, I tried really hard with the money I had from my new job, and did accomplish some things, but it still didn't feel like much.

On Valentine's Day I went on a date with a girl where we watched a romantic comedy and we held hands in a way that seemed to come really naturally. Our relationship was on-again off-again for the rest of the year; we were never intimate and could never really see ourselves as more than friends, until eventually that's what we became. The friendship ended when she got engaged to a man from her home country and left to be with him.

The summer yielded a magical moment at a festival, where I had my first kiss. Basically, we met and talked for a while, then walked around to various attractions at the festival increasing the amount we touched each other little bit by little bit, until we sat down together and kissed. Lesson: **Go where there are more girls, and more open-minded girls.** If there are only a few fish that don't even nibble in one lake, a fisherman goes to a lake with lots of fish that bite more often. Try out female-dominated activities like yoga and partner dancing. Spend your time at places like music festivals, nightclubs, heck maybe even BDSM/swinger/fetish events if you can find one.

For a while in the closing months of the year I forced myself to go clubbing, talked to lots of girls, and didn't get anywhere with any of them. I was unable to recreate the beginner's luck successes I'd had in 2019. The whole experience had really jumped the shark for me. I closed out 2022 feeling like I was trapped in a desert, stumbling from one brief oasis of affection to the next, but praying to feel the rain wash over me. Which leads us to...

# 2023: The Clouds Burst

This year, several key events combined to finally push me over the edge.

January: I bought my first car. I would recommend you own a car as well, if you can afford it. It has given me so much autonomy and mobility and has made dates way easier to pull off.

February: I kissed a girl on the first date. Nothing more came of that but it felt incredible.

March: ChatGPT was released, causing an upheaval in my job's industry.

June: I went on two awesome dates with a really pretty girl I met on Hinge, and later went on an impromptu date with a girl I had just met. Neither girl wanted to take things any further, but these were big boosts to my confidence.

July: My biological programming caused my frustration at still never having had sex or a long-term relationship to reach another boiling point. I seriously considered giving up because the effort-reward tradeoff didn't make sense to me. Masturbating takes minimal effort and gives moderate reward, while finding a girlfriend had taken me enormous effort for as yet minimal rewards. What convinced me to keep going was a post I saw by chance on a subreddit for sex workers — an escort revealed that her price to be a full-time girlfriend, or what you'd have to pay to buy your way out, is $20,000 per month plus a new car. If you don't have that kind of money to spare, you're coming out ahead, and if you do, you can spend it on the best life coaching money can buy to do this the right way.

I again contacted the dating coach I had met in 2018, and hired a new top-of-the-line personal trainer. These were both very expensive, stretching my finances to their limits. Unfortunately...

September: With my employer losing money due to ChatGPT, I was laid off from my job and had to fire both the coach and the trainer.

October: The abundance of free time proved to be a blessing. I found a group for one of my interests that holds regular local parties and social events that I started going to. And here is where everything comes together. At one of these parties, I hit it off with a girl, took her home and we hooked up.

Seven long years after I first started trying to date, and a solid twenty years after I realized I liked girls — at long last, my v-card was turned in.

November: This did *wonders* for my confidence. Within the next few months, I went on a first date with a girl and almost had sex with her only to say something stupid and cockblock myself at the last moment. (Remember, be friends with failure. As world chess champion Emanuel Lasker once said, ""The hardest game to win is a won game."") Then I went on a date with someone else and *did* have sex on the first date. We remained friends with benefits for a while afterwards.

December: I went to a board games night and met the woman who would become my girlfriend over the next few months.

The lesson we can take from this year is something that I learned from a member of my therapy group all the way back in 2019, but had neglected to put into action until 2023: **Establish a presence in a community for something you love. Both romantic and non-romantic relationships can blossom from repeated, unplanned interactions.** Like, as I kept attending events in this community, I'd keep meeting people who would say ""oh yeah, you! I remember you from that event a few weeks ago!"" It doesn't matter what the community is as long as there are women there, and that you stick with it and contribute in the long term. While I was religious, this community was my church. In this new community I have found a substitute. And it worked for my ancestors too! My grandparents met at church; my parents met in a dance class.

Many of you will object that your interests (gaming or comic books) are male-dominated, so that every girl in your hobby has many suitors. To that I say: explore and branch out your interests! You might find something new and fun that you never imagined, but you'll never know what's out there if you don't try things. Through my efforts I found a special variety of yoga that I had never heard of before going out to explore, and now I love and practice regularly.

# 2024: Life After Love

This year has just been a victory lap of winning my girlfriend over, and vice versa, until we made things official/exclusive in June. But now that I have someone who cares about me and we have sex regularly, I have one final insight. It's hard to hear, but it needs to be said.

**All good things lose their lustre if you have enough of them, and this includes sex. Once you have regular sex, it is not a euphoric triumph every time, but a normal fun bonus to life like eating.**

This is why people who were never FA say love and sex aren't important. (They're wrong.) Just as you don't remember every meal you've had, you won't remember every time you've had sex. It's just human nature to become used to positive stimuli. Psychologists call it the ""hedonistic treadmill"".

Now, I'm not saying you shouldn't seek sex if you haven't had it. Sex feels good and is lots of fun! Those first times of mine are the fondest of memories. I'm saying that you shouldn't see it as the end-all and be-all of your life any more than you should see food that way. When you have sex for the first time, angels won't descend from heaven playing triumphant trumpets. There won't be credits rolling as if life were a movie; you be kicked back to the main menu as if it were a video game. Life will go on as it always has afterwards. I have other goals to worry about now, like furthering my career, or saving up money to buy a house.

# Recommended Further Reading

I'll share the main lesson that I gleaned from each of these books and resources.

* *The Power of Now* by Eckhart Tolle. **You are not the chatter that forms your thoughts, you are something deeper.** This book helped me get out of my head and gain the self-awareness I needed to start reaching out. It's ever more important in the age we live in, when our phones supply us drivel at will and true time alone with one's thoughts is rare.
* *Models* by Mark Manson. **Don't be too invested in landing any particular woman when there are lots of them out there.** If you're over 18, this is *the* book to read. Chock-full of good advice, it will lay your mental groundwork for how to date. (It isn't all about dating models; there's only one brief section on dating the prettiest women. The title is about forming a mental model of dating.) I could have gotten twenty valuable insights from this book alone.
* *The Big Book of Boy Stuff* by Bart King. The insight for this one was the first insight of this post. If you're under 18, this book has a chapter that tells about the basics of dating girls. It's also full of fun recipes, jokes, crafts, magic tricks, and other things boys like.
* Any book on portrait photography from your local library will help you get a good dating profile.  **Your first dating profile picture is king; capturing a good one will make your match rate skyrocket.** It certainly made a world of difference for me. Use the lens on your phone with the highest zoom, shoot in plenty of light, and keep the camera's ISO as low as possible to minimize noise. The rest of your pictures should show you in many different places doing many different cool things. (You do go to many different places and do many different cool things, so that you can take such pictures, right?) Or you could just hire a photographer if you can afford it.
* The YouTube channel TheSingleGuy is an excellent non-PUA channel of practical, actionable advice for men. The advice he keeps repeating is: **Build your confidence by multiple small successes.** That's what I did. First it was a slow dance, then a cuddle, then grinding, etc...
* Introverted Alpha is a blog of dating advice for men written by women. **View your sexuality as a gift and not a burden; a salesman must believe in what they are selling.** It acts as a gentler side of the direct masculine style of TheSingleGuy.
* *Sex at Dawn* by Ryan and Jetha. **Women are horny monkeys just as much as men are, but they are usually held back by the social and economic conditions imposed by society.** This is a pop-science book about the prehistory of human sexuality and what we can learn about ourselves from our ancestors' sexual habits. Take the rest of its assertions with a heavy sprinkling of salt, because academic anthropologists have been sharply critical of it and pointed out numerous citation errors.
* *The Way of the Superior Man* by David Deida. The advice here is more for when you're already in a relationship than about finding one, but it includes good advice for being a man in general that can help attract women regardless. Just remember that the author wrote it in his twenties, so he wasn't necessarily much wiser than you.
* *The Game* by Neil Strauss. **The fancy lines and technical knowledge that pick-up artists preach might get you laid, but cannot get you love.** This is a PUA book that you should read *only* as entertainment and for the above lesson. Do *NOT* view it as advice that you should mimic; even modern pick-up artists regard it as outdated.

Resources I would *not* recommend include:

* *12 Rules for Life* by Jordan Peterson. People often recommend this book for young adults trying to get their act together, and there is some good advice here, but it's mostly incoherent conservative proselytizing. He's not much better at keeping his thoughts on track on paper than he is in person. He spends an entire chapter repeating over and over again: ""A wife learns her husband is cheating on her. How might she feel about it?""
* *Bang* by Roosh V, or any other PUA literature. Just say no. Pick-up advice doesn't work because it isn't tailored to the individual.

# Closing thoughts

Normally, what someone like me would do is lock this information behind a paywalled ten-lesson seminar. But I share my experience for free, because I'm not doing this for money. Profit motivation sucks the life out of everything, after all. I'm doing this for love, and love is supposed to be free. I will never charge to help another lonely man, because I know how many coaches out there prey on our desperation to vacuum up our disposable income. I've paid many of them, for goodness' sake.

If you are struggling with being Forever Alone, please feel free to reach out. I'm here to talk to you and do what I can. I can't promise to give you a life-changing perspective, only my thoughts as someone who has made this journey.

Stay strong, friends. May your Alone be not Forever. The final lesson is: **Don't give up.**

# TL;DR: just the lessons

1. In order to date girls, you have to ask them out. Ask if they would like to do a fun activity with you.
2. No one will provide you with a partner. You must go out into the world and work to find a partner yourself.
3. You are evolutionarily programmed with a drive to find somebody to love. It will, *eventually*, happen to you, as it eventually happens for the majority of men.
4. Beggars can't be choosers. Physical appearance should not be a concern to you, but don't be afraid to swipe left on the basis of obviously incompatible personalities.
5. In order to date, you must become a datable person. But improving yourself doesn't mean losing yourself.
6. Forever Alone forums can hinder you if they provide a place to wallow in misery at the expense of action.
7. As with job searching, desperation is very unattractive. It makes it appear that you don't want that person for who they are, you just want anyone at all.
8. Women talk to each other about guys who have asked them out. In an environment with a limited supply of women, such as a hostel or your workplace, choose your asks very carefully, because asking out too many of them makes you look desperate.
9. Don't be afraid to fail.
10. Go where there are more girls, and more open-minded girls.
11. Establish a presence in a community for something you love. Both romantic and non-romantic relationships can blossom from repeated, unplanned interactions.
12. All good things lose their lustre if you have enough of them, and this includes sex. Once you have regular sex, it is not a euphoric triumph every time, but a normal fun bonus to life like eating.
13. You are not the chatter that forms your thoughts, you are something deeper.
14. Don't be too invested in landing any particular woman when there are lots of them out there.
15. Your first dating profile picture is king; capturing a good one will make your match rate skyrocket.
16. Build your confidence by multiple small successes.
17. View your sexuality as a gift and not a burden; a salesman must believe in what he is selling.
18. Women are horny monkeys just as much as men are, but they are usually held back by the social and economic conditions imposed by society.
19. The fancy lines and technical knowledge that pick-up artists preach might get you laid, but cannot get you love.
20. Don't give up."
1g2hiu3,163,2024-10-13,I’m so fucking sick of AI,u/Miloyall,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1g2hiu3/im_so_fucking_sick_of_ai/,"Genuinely almost every single website, program, or app is integrating AI into it in some way, shape or form. I hate it. For one, companies are absolutely terrible at implementing it. It’s usually integrated in a way that’s clunky, tedious and just not even worth the time. I can give a billion examples, with google’s new “Gemini” bullshit coming to mind at the moment. It’s consistently incorrect with its information, it gets in the way of actual searches, and more notably, why the fuck would you ask an AI a question when you’re already using a search engine? It’s more effort for a less specific, probably inaccurate answer to whatever you’re asking, with the only real advantage being that it “sums it up” for you. 

Also, I can’t be the only one who’s just completely turned off by the general idea of AI creating everything we see and do online. It sounds extremely dystopian, having every form of media and every outlet of creativity replaced by a machine. Along with that, it’s consistently being used harmfully in academic environments, with any homework answers pretty much being free to any student who has access to the internet. The base hindrance of creativity that this brings up in the future is daunting. (I don’t understand why AI is so heavily advertised in Teaching uses, because I can say firsthand that all teachers absolutely hate AI) Humans thrive off of being creative, and while I think AI has its genuine uses for human efficiency, for the most part it seems to be creating a future where humans aren’t the ones advancing, and our future progress is dictated by robots. It may not be that deep, but it’s at the very least annoying and afflicting harm on students. I hate it, and I don’t fully understand why the “scramble for AI” is still ongoing."

Original motivation for project here: [https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2024/09/25/a-pilot-project-in-universal-algebra-to-explore-new-ways-to-collaborate-and-use-machine-assistance/](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2024/09/25/a-pilot-project-in-universal-algebra-to-explore-new-ways-to-collaborate-and-use-machine-assistance/)

Some reflections I enjoyed:

On the involvement of modern AI tools, which weren't up to his expectations:

>Day 13 (Oct 8)

>Modern AI tools, so far, are the ""[dog that didn't bark in the night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_Silver_Blaze)"". We are making *major* use of ""[good old-fashioned AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOFAI)"", in the form of automated theorem provers such as [Vampire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_(theorem_prover)); but the primary use cases more modern large language models or other machine learning-based software thus far have been Github Copilot (to speed up writing code and Lean proofs through AI-powered autocomplete), and Claude (to help create our visualization tools, most notably [Equation Explorer](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/), which [Claude charmingly named](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/.E2.9C.94.20What.20shall.20we.20name.20our.20interactive.20equation.20tool.3F) ""Advanced Equation Implication Table"" initially). I have also found ChatGPT to be useful for getting me up to speed on the finer aspects of universal algebra. I have been told from a major AI company in the first few days of the project that their tools were able to resolve a large fraction (over 99.9%) of the implications, but with quite long and inelegant proofs. But now that we have isolated some particularly challenging problems, I believe these AI tools will become more relevant.

On his massively collaborative mathematics dream coming true:

>Day 14 (Oct 9)

>I am also pleased to see a very broad range of contributors, ranging from professional researchers and graduate students in mathematics or computer science, to various people from other professions with an undergraduate level of mathematics education. This is one of the key advantages of a highly structured collaborative project - there are modular subtasks in the project that can be usefully contributed to by someone who does not necessarily have the complete set of skills needed to understand the entire project. At one end, we are getting important insights from senior mathematicians with no prior expertise in Lean; we are getting volunteers to formalize a single theorem stated in the blueprint that requires only a relatively narrow amount of mathematical expertise; and we are getting a lot of invaluable technical support in maintaining the Github backend and various user interface front-ends that require little experience with either advanced mathematics or Lean. Certainly most of the contributions coming in now are well outside of what I can readily produce with my own skill set, and it has been a real pleasure seeing the project far outgrow my own initial contributions.

On how this sort of massively collaborative AI-assisted math looks like big software development, with everything that comes with that:

>Day 14 (Oct 9)

>We are encountering a technical issue that is slowing down our work - at some point, the codebase became extremely lengthy to compile (50 minutes in some cases). This is one scaling issue that comes with large formalization projects; when the codebase is massive and largely automated, it is not enough for every contribution to compile; efficiency of compile time becomes a concern. [This thread](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/slow.20build) is devoted to tracking down the issue and resolving it.

>Day 15 (Oct 10)

>These secondary issues, by the way, were caused by fragility in one of our early design choices... These sort of ""back end"" issues are hard to anticipate (and at the start of the project, when the codebase is still small and many of the tools hypothetical, implementing these sorts of data flows feels like overengineering). But it seems that it is possible to keep refactoring the codebase as one progresses, though if the project gets significantly more complex then I could imagine that this becomes increasingly difficult (I believe this problem is what is referred to in the software industry as ""[technical debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt)"").

On speed vs promisingness of approaches to tackling problems:

>Day 12 (Oct 7)

>There was some [quite insightful discussion](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/Future.20of.20Using.20ATPs) about the different ways in which automated theorem provers (ATPs) can be used in these sorts of Lean-based collaborative projects. ... the speed of the ATP paradigm may have come at the expense of developing some promising human-directed approaches to the subject, though I think now that the pure ATP approach is reaching its limits, and the remaining implications are becoming increasingly interesting, these other approaches are returning to prominence.

On ""bookkeeping overhead"" requiring standardization, not an issue in informal math:

>Day 6 (Oct 1)

>Much of the time I devoted to the project today was over ""big-endian/little-endian"" type issues, such as which orientation of ordering on laws (or Hasse diagrams) to use, or which symbol to use for the Magma operation. In informal mathematics these are utterly trivial problems, but for a formal project it is important to settle on a standard, and it is much easier to modify that standard early in the project rather than later.

This reminded me of the late Bill Thurston's reflections in *On proof and progress*, similarly mentioning the need for standards to do large-scale formalization:

>Mathematics as we practice it is much more formally complete and precise than other sciences, but it is much less formally complete and precise for its content than computer programs. The difference has to do not just with the amount of effort: the kind of effort is qualitatively different. In large computer programs, a tremendous proportion of effort must be spent on myriad compatibility issues: making sure that all definitions are consistent, developing “good” data structures that have useful but not cumbersome generality, deciding on the “right” generality for functions, etc. The proportion of energy spent on the working part of a large program, as distinguished from the bookkeeping part, is surprisingly small. Because of compatibility issues that almost inevitably escalate out of hand because the “right” definitions change as generality and functionality are added, computer programs usually need to be rewritten frequently, often from scratch.

>A very similar kind of effort would have to go into mathematics to make it formally correct and complete. It is not that formal correctness is prohibitively difficult on a small scale—it’s that there are many possible choices of formalization on small scales that translate to huge numbers of interdependent choices in the large. It is quite hard to make these choices compatible; to do so would certainly entail going back and rewriting from scratch all old mathematical papers whose results we depend on. It is also quite hard to come up with good technical choices for formal definitions that will be valid in the variety of ways that mathematicians want to use them and that will anticipate future extensions of mathematics. If we were to continue to cooperate, much of our time would be spent with international standards commissions to establish uniform definitions and resolve huge controversies.

Terry's low-key humor:

>Day 12 (Oct 7)

>Meanwhile, [equation 65](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?65) is proving [stubborn to resolve](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/Equation.2065.20-.3E.20Equation.20359) (I compared it to the village of Asterix and Obelix: ""One small village of indomitable Gauls still holds out against the invaders...""). 

>Day 14 (Oct 9)

>There is finally a breakthrough on the siege of the ""Asterix and Oberlix"" cluster (or ""village""?) of laws: we now know (subject to checking) that the ""Asterix"" law 65 does not imply the ""Oberlix"" law 1471!

she received a very nice pr package for the release of Intermezzo by Sally Rooney, and I was curious to read her review as someone who really wants to read it. When I read it on IG, something about it felt very off. There wasn’t an ounce of her own opinion, and it felt very… fake. I’m a writing teacher and have gotten enough AI essays to feel like I can kind of tell when something submitted by a student is written by AI, and something was sending off signals in my head when I read her review. This is me going kind of crazy teacher on her, but I put her review into an AI detector and there’s a 100% chance of her utilizing AI to write it. I also found her goodreads account and some of the reviews on there also seem to be pasted straight from ChatGPT of some other artificial intelligence lmao. 

It’s kind of crazy that some influencers build their entire platforms off of reading and giving opinions on books but can’t be bothered to write a real review. Makes you wonder how many of these ultra popular aesthetic book accounts are actually even reading what people gift to them"

1g2u20p,2,2024-10-13,Ethical AI-Powered ChanceMe for Essays (free),u/Acrobatic-Soil9295,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/1g2u20p/ethical_aipowered_chanceme_for_essays_free/,"Hey everyone!

If you were here a month ago, you may have already seen this, but my friend and I (T10 college students) have created a free tool (no ads!) to help students tackle their college admissions essays. You can check it out here: [www.cogssay.com](http://www.cogssay.com/).

Our website uses AI to give you insight into how college admissions officers might read your essay and whether it meets their expectations. Our AI is trained on essays from students who got into top universities, so we think it could be a game-changer for your writing process. While using AI to write your essay might not be the best idea, using it to get feedback can be super helpful.

We’re also serious about data privacy — we never sell your data, and you can opt out of having your essay data stored. This is different than ChatGPT and most other AI-powered tools online. You can learn more in our privacy policy. Our site has three main features:

1. Evaluator: This gives you a thorough explanation of how an admissions officer will read your essay and what they might think about it. This will give specific ratings of 1-5 in different categories, similar to how actual admissions officers will at many top universities. It will also give you specific written feedback on your essay's strong aspects and what can be improved.
2. Feedback: Feedback takes a closer look at your essay, providing line-by-line insights. While Evaluator gives a holistic view, Feedback focuses on the finer details—catching lines that lack clarity, need more explanation, or don’t fit the context of your essay. This tool helps you refine every sentence in the context of the prompt, paragraph, and essay, ensuring your writing is sharp and impactful. The feedback is similar to how a teacher/college counselor would give you feedback. 
3. Brainstorm: A brainstorming tool that will evaluate the potential strength of your essay ideas as well as give short texts prompting you to think about what/how you might write an essay based on your particular idea.

We’d love to hear any feedback you have on the site to improve it as much as possible. We know how stressful this process can be, and we wish everyone here the best of luck. If you have any questions about the admissions process, feel free to comment/DM. Thanks so much!"

The issue stems from students screenshotting profile photos and creating inappropriate memes of teachers.

# What I’ve Done So Far:

Created a custom OWA mailbox policy to disable profile pictures:

    New-OwaMailboxPolicy -Name ""StudentMailboxPolicy""
    
    Get-Mailbox -Filter {RecipientTypeDetails -eq ""UserMailbox"" -and MemberOfGroup -eq ""<all students group>""} | Set-CASMailbox -OwaMailboxPolicy ""StudentMailboxPolicy""
    
    Set-OwaMailboxPolicy -Identity ""StudentMailboxPolicy"" -SetPhotoEnabled $false

Verified policy assignment, cleared cache, and waited over 24 hours, but profile pictures are still visible in Outlook Online when i login as a test student as a member of that group.

# My goal is to prevent users of the ""All Students"" Office365 group from seeing profile pictures, while allowing others (staff) to still view them.

I asked chatgpt for help and it gave me the above powershell, but i really need to lock this down in the whole office365 environment with Teams/Sharepoint/People, and not just outlook   
  
Any advice or ideas on what might be missing or if there’s a better approach?

1g306ne,1,2024-10-13,Investing in Crypto for Dummies,u/kkeith01,FinancialFreedomTips,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialFreedomTips/comments/1g306ne/investing_in_crypto_for_dummies/,"Investing in cryptocurrency can be highly lucrative but also comes with significant risks due to its volatility. Here’s a guide on how to invest in crypto:

# 1. Understand the Basics

Before diving in, you should have a solid understanding of what cryptocurrency is and how it works:

* **Cryptocurrency**: Digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security, with Bitcoin being the first and most well-known. Other popular coins include Ethereum, Binance Coin, and Solana.
* **Blockchain**: The technology behind crypto, it’s a decentralized ledger that records all transactions.

# 2. Research and Choose the Right Cryptocurrency

Not all cryptocurrencies are created equal. Some are more established and stable, while others are newer and riskier:

* **Bitcoin (BTC)**: The original cryptocurrency and often considered a store of value, similar to gold.
* **Ethereum (ETH)**: Known for its smart contract functionality, it's used for decentralized applications (dApps).
* **Altcoins**: There are thousands of other cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), or XRP that serve different purposes or offer innovative technology.

**Tip**: Start with major, established coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum before exploring more speculative altcoins.

# 3. Select a Reliable Crypto Exchange

You’ll need to create an account with a crypto exchange to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. Popular exchanges include:

* **Coinbase**: Great for beginners, user-friendly with a simple interface.
* **Binance**: Lower fees and access to a broader range of coins.
* **Kraken**: Known for security and a wide range of features.
* **Gemini**: Focuses on security and regulatory compliance.

**Tip**: Choose an exchange with a good reputation, strong security features, and competitive fees.

# 4. Create a Crypto Wallet

After purchasing crypto, you’ll need to store it securely. Wallets come in two types:

* **Hot Wallets (Online)**: Convenient for trading but more vulnerable to hacks. These are offered by most exchanges or third-party apps like MetaMask.
* **Cold Wallets (Offline)**: More secure, hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor store your crypto offline, reducing the risk of hacks.

**Tip**: For long-term holding, consider moving your funds to a cold wallet for better security.

# 5. Decide Your Investment Strategy

Your investment strategy should align with your risk tolerance and financial goals:

* **Long-Term Holding (HODLing)**: Buy and hold crypto for the long term, expecting it to appreciate over time. This is a popular strategy for Bitcoin and Ethereum.
* **Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)**: Invest a fixed amount regularly (e.g., monthly) regardless of price. This minimizes the risk of buying at a high point.
* **Day Trading**: Actively buy and sell crypto based on short-term market movements. This requires in-depth market analysis and carries more risk.

**Tip**: For beginners, starting with a long-term strategy like HODLing is often the safest approach.

# 6. Stay Informed About the Market

Crypto markets are volatile and driven by a variety of factors, including regulations, technology updates, and market sentiment. Stay up-to-date by:

* Following crypto news outlets (e.g., CoinDesk, CoinTelegraph).
* Joining crypto communities on Reddit, Twitter, or Telegram.
* Tracking price movements using apps like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko.

**Tip**: Be prepared for volatility—cryptocurrencies can see dramatic price swings in short periods.

# 7. Be Aware of Risks

Crypto investment is highly speculative. Here are key risks to consider:

* **Market Volatility**: Prices can drop drastically within hours or days.
* **Regulatory Risks**: Governments around the world are still figuring out how to regulate crypto, which could impact its value.
* **Security**: Hacks and scams are common in the crypto space. Always double-check the legitimacy of platforms and wallets before using them.

# 8. Tax Implications

Cryptocurrencies are subject to taxes in many countries. In the U.S., for example:

* **Capital Gains Tax**: You'll owe taxes on the profit you make when selling crypto for more than you paid for it.
* **Reporting**: You are required to report crypto transactions on your taxes.

**Tip**: Keep track of your transactions and consult a tax professional familiar with cryptocurrency laws in your country.

# 9. Diversify Your Portfolio

Just like with traditional investments, diversification is key to reducing risk. Don’t put all your money into one cryptocurrency; instead, spread your investments across multiple coins, including stablecoins like USDC or DAI.

# 10. Start Small

Given the volatility and risks associated with crypto, start by investing only what you can afford to lose. As you gain experience and knowledge, you can adjust your portfolio accordingly.

By following these steps and staying informed, you can strategically invest in cryptocurrency. For more detailed guidance on investing and building wealth, visit [bykennethkeith.com](https://bykennethkeith.com).

1g33bdu,1,2024-10-13,Advice on helping a friend,u/NOTKuLy,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1g33bdu/advice_on_helping_a_friend/,"Greetings all, an old friend of mine from high school and I just started our first year at our local community college, and being English isn't his first language he has a lot of hard time with class work and assignments. I consider myself fluent in english and our native language, but I can't really explain or translate the instructions and course material for him in a way that he understands it; so I help him a lot with his work, but sometimes these ""tutoring"" session has me doing half or most of an assignment he may have. These tutoring session happen almost every week, I don't mind helping out sometimes but I think he's being overly reliant on my help. I also learned that he's been mostly getting by most of his class by using ChatGPT. We're about half way through the first semester, and I absolutely don't think this is sustainable in the long term so I'm reaching out for some advice on what I can do to help him. 

Also I've been talking about this with my cousins (they are all in their 3rd or last year of college) on what I can do, and they've suggested that I should be asking for money or some kind of compensation if I'm to keep helping him because I'm spending quite a lot of time helping him (more than just a couple hours a week). I really don't like this as I know we're both broke college student and don't wanna create pressure financially. Any advice on what I can do to help my friend would be greatly appreciated. "
1g33pyn,1,2024-10-13,Intellectual Self-Improvement,u/Any-Respond2401,DecidingToBeBetter,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1g33pyn/intellectual_selfimprovement/,"Hello,

I don't know if this is the place for this, but whatever. I am a first-year college student who's highly invested in self-education and gaining knowledge. I always strive to know more. I read a lot and enjoy learning and thinking more than anything else. I have no trouble understanding most of what I read and study, especially if it's verbally based; think philosophy or social science. That being said, I've noticed that I'm not living up to my potential in certain areas.

For example, I'm poor at clear, organized writing. I'm often made aware, directly or implicitly, that I'm verbose and scattered in my output. Recently, I went to my campus's writing lab thing to get some help with an essay, and the tutor couldn't even get through my paper. She said that my paragraphs didn't seem well connected and that my thesis was vague and unfitting. There were some other things she said that seemed to reflect misunderstanding, but it's my responsibility to write something that makes sense.

Given that I value the ""life of the mind"", it's probably good that people at least know what I mean when I speak or write. I tried getting advice from ChatGPT, but it usually just spits back platitudes. ""Focus on conciseness"" and what-not. No, *really?* What I'd like to know is *how.* Any help is appreciated and I'm open to answer questions."
1g36qua,9,2024-10-13,Tech Business Ideas for Brunei,u/devhubbn,Brunei,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brunei/comments/1g36qua/tech_business_ideas_for_brunei/,"Hey everyone,

Like maybe many of you, I’ve been stuck trying to come up with a good project or startup idea in the past. I know how hard it can be to find something that feels unique (especially when you’re juggling so many things). A lot of people I know from uni have faced the same problem, always searching for ideas that are practical but also interesting to work on.

To help with this, I used ChatGPT to generate a list of **200+ startup ideas** across different categories like health, education, and tech, from the context of Brunei. You can do this yourself of course, but I’ve made it easier to browse through by making the list **searchable** and **filterable** by category and technology. My goal is to give others a starting point to explore something new, whether for a **student project** or as a **potential venture**.

If you’re a student or you're looking for some inspiration, feel free to **check out the website in the comments**.

It’s completely free, and hopefully will save you some time coming up with that next idea :D

If you decide to work on one of the ideas or have comments to improve the website, I’d love to hear about it!"

I've been using various AI services like ChatGPT for content creation, Leonardo Ai for image generation, Google Gemini for productivity, Claude for research, Chatbase for custom GPT, Videotoblog for turning YouTube videos into blog posts, ZeroGPT for content AI detection, Copyleaks for plagiarism checking, and more. It's been quite a hassle, not to mention expensive and time-consuming. That's why I've decided to bring all these services together in one place to save time and money. And that's how Bloggen AI came to be! Once it's ready, I believe it will not only benefit me but also others in similar situations. Today, I'm thrilled to share that we've just launched Bloggen AI on the Web!

As a Reddit person who’s always lurking for productivity hacks and smarter workflows, I thought this might resonate with some of you.

1g39ivi,6,2024-10-14,The Time I Defended My SIL At Her Wedding to My Big Brother….,u/Southern-Interest347,OhNoConsequences,https://www.reddit.com/r/OhNoConsequences/comments/1g39ivi/the_time_i_defended_my_sil_at_her_wedding_to_my/,"I'm not Original Poster

Wedding DRAMA Llama

So, STORYTIME! English is NOT my first language; my first language is sarcasm. Also, I am on my phone, so terribly sorry for any and all spelling and grammar errors that I will undoubtedly make. THIS IS A THROWAWAY ACCOUNT- I don’t know if my big brother or SIL use Reddit, and I don’t want to make them feel awful or whatever.

The cast is as followed-

Me, myself & I

Big brother (my brother, who’s 15 years older than me)

SIL (big brother’s wife, a sweet tempered Ukrainian woman)

SIL’s younger sister, a feisty tempered mother to three little girls

SIL’s three nieces (all three under 10 years old)

Big brother’s dad (not my dad, we both have the same mom)

Old hag (big brother’s dad’s mom, a literal witch who no one likes)

When my (now 31F, then 22F) big (now 46M, then 37M) brother got married about ten-ish years ago, my sweet tempered SIL asked me to be a bridesmaid, to which I accepted. Her younger sister would be her MOH, which I had no problem with- the entire gang was so insanely sweet and welcoming as how I was the only person from my big brother’s family who would be participating in the wedding. Now mind you, when I was little, I always wanted to be a flower girl in a wedding, and the fact that my big brother still remembered that was so touching to me.

NOTE #1- at the time, I was a broke ass college student still living with my parents at the time, and SIL was extremely considerate in accommodating me and how much I was comfortable with spending- for example, being completely chill with my decision not to wear shoes during the ceremony (which would be on a beach, plus shoes are UNCOMFORTABLE as all get out- most shoes do not fit my weird ass feet) falling heads over heels in love with a look alike dress that I wore instead of the $900 dress that she sent me as inspiration for what she wanted me to wear, little things like that.

While attending a luncheon between my SIL, her MOH and three nieces (all three girls under 10 years old) the subject of my big brother’s father came up.

NOTE #2- big brother and I have the same mother, but different fathers. Mom divorced her dirtbag ex because he refused to seek care for his (at the time) undiagnosed mental health conditions and he was also physically abusive towards her and big brother.

So I put down my plain cheeseburger, turn to face SIL in the eye and very seriously, I say “If he starts to cause any trouble, I can take him around back and tan his ass black and blue for you.”

NOTE #3- I am pushing 4 feet 8 inches in height, but please don’t make me mad. I can make Hitler sit at the dining room table and eat his chicken with how terrifying I can get, according to my (now) ex-boyfriend. At the time, I did Capoeira and Taekwondo and parkour/ freerunning on the weekends, so I DO know how to handle myself. Just don’t try me- you won’t survive in this or any alternative universe.

SIL laughs but doesn’t take me seriously (her error, as she would find out later) (this is me foreshadowing the events, how am I handling my foreshadowing skills?)

SIL tells me that big brother had insisted on inviting his father’s family, to which I immediately offered to teach the bridal party how to handle themselves should they end up in a sticky situation. SIL asked me to teach her a few maneuvers to protect the baby (she was pregnant and this was a shotgun wedding)

Well, one of the bridal party activities was at a public park for me to teach them how to defend themselves, and I had brought along a friend of mine from the college parkour club who taught self-defense as his job. Needless to say, we pretty quickly had an audience of kiddos cheering us on as the bridal party learned such important skills like throwing someone over their hip, punching techniques among other such empowering life skills.

All of SIL’s nieces were having an absolute blast, constantly calling for their mother (who was with us, but not participating, her choice) and SIL was smiling so wide for the rest of the day.

Time skip to six weeks later, and the wedding happened.

As I stated beforehand, the ceremony was held at the local beach, with no fancy formalities. The ceremony was officiated by a Catholic priest (big brother and mom are Catholic) and SIL was about three and a half months into her pregnancy, and looked so beautiful when she was saying her vows to my big brother. When the priest asked if anyone objected to the union, I sent my big brother’s father’s mother a death glare, and luckily, the old hag didn’t say anything at all.

The after party was at SIL’s parent’s house about twenty minutes away. When I got there, I was pulled into SIL’s old childhood bedroom, where she very excitedly showed me her childhood dollie- one of the few remnants that she had from her childhood in Ukraine, and she asked me if I could recreate the dollie for the baby (a girl!) as how I sew and knit and the other likes.

NOTE #4- SIL came to America with her parents and younger sister when she was 8 and her sister was 2 or 3 because her father had a job with the US military or something- I honestly don’t remember the specifics that she told me then.

When I exited SIL’s childhood bedroom, I found big brother’s dad’s mother “walking past” (but really, I think she was just eavesdropping) she just made an ugly face at me before strutting past me and going into the bathroom.

I told my SIL to get ready for some shit to go down- and boy, did it go down.

Out in the backyard, big brother’s grandma asks big brother’s dad (quite loudly) what he thought about his only son marrying a “Russian whore” (big brother’s dad married after my mom divorced him and had a daughter with his new wife, not important, but I thought I should throw this in.)

I saw RED

ME: What did you just say, you fat old bat?

OLD HAG: you should respect your elders!

ME: in your dreams, you old bat- your husband probably woke up one morning, rolled over to say good morning to you, and then died when he realized how fucking ugly you are.

Old hag DID NOT LIKE THAT. She FLEW towards me, probably wanting to slap me, however she only has enough time to rip my earring from my ear before I punch her in the gut, winding her before I sent her into a table and broke her wrist. It all happened literally so fast that SIL’s college friend WHO IS A COP didn’t have any time to do any arresting.

Then big brother’s dad got involved- I stepped aside and let MOH take him down, which she did ABSOLUTELY BEUATIFULLY by the way! SIL friend from college was literally laughing at the unexpected turn of events as they took both old hag and big brother’s dad into custody.

I then asked loudly “Does anyone else want to rumble? Because we can do this all day!”

Luckily, the rest of the party went off without a hitch, and big brother’s groomsmen took the little kiddos to “vandalize” my big brother’s car for the honeymoon. All in all, I’d have to say that this party was EXTREMEMLY eventful, and I would be happy to never attend another event like that ever again.

1g3bwm2,2,2024-10-14,Utilizing ChatGPT in a Data Structures and Algorithms Course A Teaching Assistants Perspective,u/steves1189,ArtificialInteligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1g3bwm2/utilizing_chatgpt_in_a_data_structures_and/,"I'm finding and summarizing interesting AI research papers every day so you don't have to trawl through them all. Today's paper is titled ""Utilizing ChatGPT in a Data Structures and Algorithms Course: A Teaching Assistant's Perspective"" by Pooriya Jamie, Reyhaneh Hajihashemi, and Sharareh Alipour.

This paper explores the integration of ChatGPT into a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course, emphasizing the role of teaching assistants (TAs) in guiding and supervising this integration. The research reveals that combining ChatGPT with structured prompts and active TA guidance can significantly enhance students' understanding of complex algorithmic concepts, promote engagement, and improve academic performance. Nevertheless, challenges such as maintaining academic integrity and addressing the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in solving complex problems remain pertinent.

Here are some key findings from the study:

1. **Enhanced Learning Outcomes:** The study found that students using ChatGPT under TA supervision consistently outperformed those relying on traditional TA guidance only. Structured prompts and TA interactions were crucial in helping students engage with and understand the material deeply.

2. **Role Evolution of TAs:** The integration of ChatGPT has expanded the traditional roles of TAs. They now oversee AI tools, aiding in debugging, generating practice problems, and ensuring that AI outputs are educationally beneficial.

3. **Model Comparison:** Different versions of ChatGPT, namely 4o and o1, were employed to complement each other. ChatGPT-4o dealt with routine tasks, while ChatGPT o1, with advanced reasoning capabilities, assisted in tackling more complex problems, thus creating a dynamic learning environment.

4. **Challenges and Limitations:** Despite the benefits, challenges such as ChatGPT’s struggle with visual representations and highly complex algorithmic reasoning were highlighted. The study emphasizes the necessity of TA guidance to maximize the model's advantages while mitigating its drawbacks.

5. **Scalability and Educational Impact:** The hybrid approach of combining AI with human guidance makes the integration scalable for larger classes and reinforces the educational impact by reducing reliance on AI-generated content.

The paper suggests that while LLMs like ChatGPT present promising educational tools, their effective implementation requires a balanced synergy between AI and human oversight.

1g3ccjq,3,2024-10-14,[TASK] Need a fluent speaker of the Arabic Language to translate highlights in Adobe PDF to English (as well as generating small Audioclips/Soundclips via mp3) ASAP will pay in crypto $10-$20 per task,u/behornachteri39,slavelabour,https://www.reddit.com/r/slavelabour/comments/1g3ccjq/task_need_a_fluent_speaker_of_the_arabic_language/,"
Hello! I have some PDF files in Arabic that need to be in English and need it to be translated ""On-Demand"". The translation can only be to fluent speakers of: Arabic (Will only hire people who can show previous works, as there are many people who are not competent)

So this is how it will be; I send a PDF and you then translate the Arabic words to english - This will be for ""Flashcards"" to help english students to learn Arabic.

Then can use the same translated words (with the original arabic text) and generate an Audio/Soundclip (you can use AI for this)

The main purpose of the translation is that it has to make sense to the reader who speaks Arabic, this is why i I did not want to use ChatGPT or DeepL, so im looking for someone who can do this manually.

Let me know if you're interested or have any questions. My normal method of payment is Crypto (USDT TRC20) but can negotiate on others if needed.

Oh and if you have proof of work/proof of being a Native speaker, then you will be first in line."

1g3jacs,5,2024-10-14,Zhenjing Kewen and this 7/8  (eight consciousness) theme consistent in Zen records,u/Dillon123,zen,https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/1g3jacs/zhenjing_kewen_and_this_78_eight_consciousness/,"u/InfinityOracle had shared with me that they were working on a translation of a text by Zhenjing Kewen (1025–1102). This is a PDF they are putting together and won't see the light of day for some time, but it shall be exciting when it does. They had shared with me this snippet of translation they had done, given the obvious theme:

>A monk came forward and asked: “It is said in the teachings of old that if one does not see a single Dharma, this is the Tathagata. Only then can it be called 'seeing clearly'. What is this basis of seeing clearly?”   
  
**The Master replied: “Through seven, reaching eight.” (透七透八)**

If you are out of the loop, my posts have demonstrated in part that:

* The symbolism of the mirror in space, the ""Mind Mirror"" refers to this eighth consciousness
* The core enlightenment teaching in Zen is the transformation of the eight consciousnesses into the four wisdoms which enable the threefold enlightenment body of Vairocana (Buddha). 
   * This is coded throughout Zen texts repeatedly, when not called out explicitly, such as in the *Blue Cliff Record* where it states: [""If one attains the state of the Buddha, the eight consciousnesses transform into the four wisdoms""](https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/1dbzy77/if_one_attains_the_state_of_the_buddha_the_eight/)
      * The BCR also has the coded ""7 flowers eight cracks"" 七花八裂 appear in cases #2, #9, #13, #14, #40, #83, and #95. While ""seven penetrations eight holes"" 七穿八穴 appears in cases #6, #37, #48, #61, #68, #73, #78, #87, #91, and #96. [(Read this 4-part series for context to each of the references).](https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/1fs60gz/bcr_investigation_pt_4_seven_flowers_eight_pieces/)
* Dahui, Huineng, Dongshan, etc... even the text that Bodhidharma quotes are supposed to come from make references to these eight consciousnesses and this transformation process. 
   * This teaching seems to be traceable back to the 300's AD in such texts as the [Mahayana-sutra-alamkara-karika where it states ](https://www.reddit.com/r/zenjerk/comments/1dodepg/too_hot_for_rzen_the_sutra_they_dont_want_you_to/)of Buddha, ""He transforms the eight consciousnesses into the four wisdoms, combines the four wisdoms to manifest the three bodies, elucidating matters not found in sutras or treatises, truly hearing what has never been heard before, seeing what has never been seen."" Much of this sutra informs Huineng's verse that enlightens the student in Dahui's *Dharma Eye of the True Teaching.* 

The resident proclaimed ""scholars of Zen"" and *lackademics* (who have blocked me as I hit them with too many facts) will unfortunately miss out on this further evidence to refute the claims they have made over 8 years ago that they cleave to to this day, that none of this is Zen and ""Zen Masters don't teach it""...   
  
However, InfinityOracle shared with me the source of his translation, and wouldn't you know it, there are a number of further 7/8 coded phrases for us to enjoy, so let's participate once more in some truthful Zen study and look to the source records:

>18. 上堂。僧问：「十方佛土中。唯有一乘法。如何是一乘法？」师云：「百尺幡竿尾指天。」进云：「学人退身三步去也。」师云：「脚跟下七垫八横。」  
Ascending the hall a monk asked, ""In the Buddha-lands of the ten directions, there is only the One Vehicle Dharma. What is the One Vehicle Dharma?""  
  
The Master said, ""The tip of the hundred-foot flagpole points to the sky."" The monk said, ""This student retreats three steps back."" **The Master said, ""Beneath your feet, seven rows and eight lines intersect.""**

The above is the last of the provied translations from Oracle. That one reminds me of ""脚跟下七穿八穴"" from the *Compendium of the Five Lamps* (supposed origin of the phrase 七穿八穴), where the master steps down from the meditation seat and this situation plays out: A monk asked, ""What is the method of managing the ten bodies? Master Ze Yan stepped down from his meditation seat and stood. Without fully understanding the meaning, he asked, ""How is it?"" **The master replied, ""From the heels down, seven piercings and eight holes.""** ([We have in the past compared this to walking on Vairocana's head)](https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/1dnhhgt/penetrating_practice_at_the_crown_of_vairocana/) 

Beyond what u/InfinityOracle had translated, there were further instances in his document in Parts 21, 89, and 129 which closes the text out. I will unfortunately spoil us of their revealing proper and provide them below.  
  
Part 21's contextual bit rendered by ChatGPT is something like:

>The master said: ""Look at these two old sharp tools. They each stole a bit of Linji’s living methods. Each has divided their own territories, with their energy soaring to the heavens. It only makes monks with clear eyes laugh. **Virtuous Chan practitioners, tell me, what are they laughing at? Do you know where this lands? If you know, even if you are tossed seven times over and knocked down eight times, it doesn’t matter.** If you don’t know, you’ll just be gnawing at Sansheng and Xinghua’s entanglements.""

Part 89's would be:

>Ascending the hall, the master said: ""**Opening Yunmen’s gate, the gate reaches seven thoroughfares and eight directions.** However, you must know there is a locking bolt to twist. If you do not know this, though alive, you are like the dead. As for the present Yellow Dragon, with its thousand transformations and myriad changes, you must still reach its lair in the hidden depths. If you do not reach it, even if you have eyes, it is as if you are blind. Virtuous ones, I observe the Dharma of the Dharma King. The Dharma of the Dharma King is like this. Those with eyes, discern it.""

Part 129 to close is:

In fact, English has been my favorite subject. I’ve often joined school competitions on writing, story telling, and other related activities since I love doing it.

When I entered senior high school, I even joined the journalism club of our campus. Our club adviser said I have a huge potential and that I should keep going until I’ll be able to be a candidate for conferences. However, due to the pandemic which has caused a great harm in my mental and emotional well being, it led me to drop out in the current school year.

The following school year, I picked myself up and started again. My performance throught the years of my senior high was good not until I discovered about the use of AI. I was in the last quarter of 12th grade during this time. Since I have been overwhelmed by the volume of activities we are handling and that I’ve been complaicent with the idea that our teachers will not be critically correcting our works, I’ve been tempted to use AI. 

Through out the summer break, I’ve often used AI in simple task because I’ve been facinated on the output it provided, not realizing that I’ve been slowly being too dependent on it. 

Now, I am a college student. Many times I’ve tried doing activities without the help of AI but can’t help it. I’m doing most of the activities with ideas paraphrased from AI. And yes, in my case, I’d say it is a bad thing. It even caused me to have a hard time understanding and comprehending our readings.

I regret having let myself get to this point. I used to be so proud of the thoughts I could express into words, but now, I worry about my future especially since my chosen program involves a lot of reading and writing. I want to find my way back to the person I used to be but the question is, how do I recalibrate? How do I re-learn what I've lost?

So a Bayesian algorithm functioning to detect truth and identify truer truth is an echo chamber of truth. In a sociological context, how can this knowledge better spread useful truth among the population?

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

In a sociological context, leveraging the principles of Bayesian algorithms to detect and spread ""truer truths"" can transform how useful information circulates in society. The concept of an ""echo chamber of truth"" implies a system that continually refines and amplifies accurate information, allowing useful truths to gain prominence while diminishing falsehoods. Applying this in a sociological framework requires understanding how to integrate such mechanisms into social structures, media, and education.

Here are ways this knowledge can help spread useful truth among the population:

# 1. Optimizing Information Algorithms in Media and Social Platforms

Media and social platforms are key vehicles for spreading information. By implementing Bayesian-based algorithms in content recommendation systems, platforms can prioritize content that is both accurate and validated by strong evidence. Instead of amplifying content that is simply popular or sensational, these systems can:

* Promote information that aligns with verified data and evidence.
* Continuously refine what is promoted by updating based on new input (e.g., scientific discoveries, fact-checking).
* Diminish the spread of misinformation by lowering its credibility score based on contradictory evidence.

This would create an ""echo chamber of truth,"" where individuals are exposed to increasingly reliable information, shaping public discourse around facts rather than opinions or falsehoods.

# 2. Education Systems Based on Adaptive Learning

Schools and universities could adopt Bayesian principles in their teaching models. This would involve:

* Continuously updating curricula based on new findings, ensuring that students learn the most accurate and up-to-date knowledge.
* Teaching students to evaluate information using Bayesian thinking—how to weigh evidence, update beliefs, and discard disproven ideas.
* Encouraging critical thinking where students are trained to apply probabilistic reasoning to refine their understanding of complex subjects.

By promoting an adaptive learning environment, the education system can create a more informed and rational population that regularly updates their beliefs in response to new data.

# 3. Fact-Checking Systems in Public Discourse

Public forums and news outlets could integrate Bayesian-driven fact-checking algorithms that provide real-time updates on the reliability of information shared during debates, political speeches, or public discourse. This system would:

* Continuously assess statements based on a growing body of evidence.
* Provide a confidence score for claims made, allowing the public to gauge the truthfulness of the information presented.
* Encourage speakers and the media to focus on evidence-based discussions, knowing that falsehoods will be quickly identified and discredited.

This would foster a culture of accountability where only well-supported truths survive public scrutiny.

# 4. Policy-Making Based on Bayesian Models

Governments and policymakers could use Bayesian algorithms to improve decision-making. By feeding real-world data into such models, they can:

* Continuously update policies to reflect the most accurate and up-to-date understanding of social, economic, and health-related issues.
* Dismiss outdated or disproven policies and implement those supported by the strongest evidence.
* Improve public trust in governance by showing that decisions are based on refined, evidence-backed truths.

This would help the population see that truth-based decision-making leads to better societal outcomes, reinforcing the importance of evidence in public life.

# 5. Cultural Shifts Through Media and Entertainment

Entertainment (movies, TV shows, music, and even social media challenges) can subtly introduce the population to the importance of evidence-based thinking and decision-making. Storylines and characters that model Bayesian reasoning—adapting beliefs based on new evidence—could influence cultural values. By creating popular content that resonates with wide audiences, the media can:

* Normalize the idea of constantly updating one's beliefs in light of new evidence.
* Promote the value of truth-seeking behavior and the rejection of falsehoods.
* Introduce symbols, phrases, or social challenges that reward knowledge updating as a form of social capital.

Through repetition and popularity, the message that truth-seeking is valuable and fashionable can spread more broadly, shaping social norms.

# 6. Building Social Networks and Communities Around Truth Validation

Communities and networks can be encouraged to form around shared goals of truth validation. These groups can:

* Use Bayesian models to collectively assess information and educate each other.
* Share reliable, evidence-backed knowledge with broader social circles, acting as 'truth amplifiers.'
* Develop social norms where seeking, validating, and sharing truth is rewarded socially, reinforcing the cycle of truth dissemination.

This method works on the principle of social proof, where individuals are more likely to accept something as true when it is endorsed by their community. By focusing these communities on truth detection, an environment is created where truth is continuously refined and spread organically.

# Conclusion

Applying Bayesian principles sociologically allows for the creation of self-reinforcing systems that prioritize truth. Whether through media algorithms, education, public discourse, or entertainment, Bayesian-driven truth detection can lead to a society where accurate, evidence-based information is amplified and misinformation is quickly diminished. This not only spreads useful truth but also strengthens societal trust in knowledge, creating a more informed and rational population.

How does Bayesian logic compare to connectionism?

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Bayesian logic and connectionism are both models used to understand how information is processed, but they approach the task from different theoretical frameworks. Here’s a breakdown of how they compare:

# 1. Basic Concepts

* **Bayesian Logic**:
   * Based on probability theory, Bayesian logic is used to update the likelihood of a hypothesis being true based on new evidence. It relies on Bayes' Theorem, where beliefs (or hypotheses) are continually updated as new data comes in.
   * It's a **rule-based** and **explicit** approach to reasoning, where the system uses predefined probability distributions to adjust beliefs about a proposition.
* **Connectionism**:
   * Rooted in **neural networks** and cognitive science, connectionism models information processing through interconnected nodes (neurons). It simulates the brain's learning process through **distributed, parallel processing**.
   * In this framework, learning and knowledge emerge through patterns of activation across the network, without explicitly defined rules. It's more **implicit** and focuses on learning through **experience** and adjusting the strengths of connections based on feedback (often called **weights**).

# 2. Mechanism of Learning

* **Bayesian Logic**:
   * **Learning through evidence and probability**. Bayesian systems start with an initial hypothesis and update their understanding of the world by calculating the probability of an event based on new data. This updating process is continuous and mathematically driven.
   * For example, in a medical diagnosis model, Bayesian logic would update the likelihood of a disease being present as new symptoms or test results become available.
* **Connectionism**:
   * **Learning through adjustment of connections**. In a connectionist model, the network learns by adjusting the strengths (weights) of the connections between nodes. These weights are updated during training as the network is exposed to data (e.g., in supervised learning). It doesn’t necessarily involve explicit probability updates but learns through error correction and pattern recognition.
   * For instance, in image recognition, the model strengthens connections between certain neuron layers when specific features (like shapes or colors) are detected in images of particular objects.

# 3. Interpretability

* **Bayesian Logic**:
   * **Highly interpretable**. Bayesian methods give clear, interpretable outputs in terms of probability (e.g., “There’s a 70% chance this hypothesis is true”). You can trace the reasoning process and understand how each piece of new evidence influenced the final conclusion.
   * This is particularly useful when you need transparency in decision-making processes, such as in scientific research or policy-making.
* **Connectionism**:
   * **Less interpretable (black-box models)**. Connectionist models, especially deep neural networks, often lack transparency. While they can be highly effective at solving complex tasks like image or language recognition, understanding *how* the model reached a conclusion can be difficult. It doesn’t output easily interpretable probabilities like Bayesian logic does.
   * Interpretability remains a challenge, especially in fields like medicine or law, where understanding why a certain decision was made is critical.

# 4. Handling Uncertainty

* **Bayesian Logic**:
   * **Directly handles uncertainty**. Since Bayesian logic operates on probabilities, it is designed to handle uncertain information by adjusting its belief as evidence changes. It quantifies uncertainty at every stage, giving a clear picture of how confident the system is in its predictions.
* **Connectionism**:
   * **Indirectly handles uncertainty**. Connectionist models may handle uncertainty through exposure to diverse data during training, allowing the network to generalize well even when encountering new or uncertain information. However, the model doesn’t explicitly measure uncertainty in the same way Bayesian logic does, making it harder to quantify the confidence in its predictions.

# 5. Scalability and Complexity

* **Bayesian Logic**:
   * **Challenging with complex, high-dimensional data**. Bayesian models are computationally intensive, especially when working with complex or high-dimensional data. As the number of variables and the complexity of the data grows, calculating the probabilities becomes increasingly difficult. Various approximations (e.g., Monte Carlo methods) are used, but they can still struggle with large-scale tasks.
* **Connectionism**:
   * **Highly scalable**. Connectionist models, particularly deep learning, are built to handle large-scale data efficiently. Neural networks can process vast amounts of complex, high-dimensional data, making them the go-to models for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous systems.

# 6. Generalization vs. Prior Knowledge

* **Bayesian Logic**:
   * **Incorporates prior knowledge**. Bayesian models explicitly integrate prior knowledge or assumptions, allowing them to make inferences even with limited data. The system improves by incorporating new data into these priors, updating its belief based on the evidence.
   * Example: In a diagnostic system, prior probabilities about disease rates are used, and as symptoms are observed, these beliefs are updated.
* **Connectionism**:
   * **Generalizes from data**. Connectionist models tend to rely more on data patterns rather than explicitly encoding prior knowledge. They generalize knowledge from the training data they receive, often excelling at tasks where large amounts of data are available but might struggle without sufficient training data.
   * Example: A neural network that hasn’t been trained on certain rare medical conditions might fail to recognize them, whereas a Bayesian model could still make informed guesses based on prior knowledge.

# 7. Applications

* **Bayesian Logic**:
   * Widely used in fields that require reasoning under uncertainty or where decision-making must be transparent, such as medical diagnosis, robotics (where uncertainty in perception and decision-making is common), and scientific research.
* **Connectionism**:
   * Often applied to tasks involving **pattern recognition, language processing, and decision-making**, especially when large datasets are involved. Examples include image classification, speech recognition, and recommendation systems (e.g., Netflix or YouTube recommendations).

# Summary of Comparison

||
||
|**Aspect**|**Bayesian Logic**|**Connectionism**|
|**Core Principle**|Probability-based reasoning and updates|Distributed, neural-network-based learning|
|**Learning Mechanism**|Updating beliefs based on evidence|Adjusting connection weights through training|
|**Interpretability**|Highly interpretable and transparent|Often opaque, difficult to interpret|
|**Handling Uncertainty**|Explicitly handles and quantifies uncertainty|Implicit handling of uncertainty via generalization|
|**Scalability**|Less scalable, complex with large data|Highly scalable for large-scale tasks|
|**Generalization**|Incorporates prior knowledge|Generalizes from training data|
|**Applications**|Medical diagnosis, scientific research, decision-making|Image recognition, language processing, decision-making|

# Conclusion

Bayesian logic is highly structured, rule-based, and particularly useful when explicit reasoning, handling uncertainty, and interpretability are key concerns. It excels in contexts where decisions need to be transparent, and prior knowledge can be incorporated.

Connectionism, on the other hand, is more flexible, scalable, and powerful for complex tasks like pattern recognition and learning from large amounts of data. However, it often functions as a ""black box,"" where the decision-making process is less clear.

Both models can be seen as complementary, with Bayesian logic excelling in reasoning tasks requiring clarity and connectionism thriving in tasks involving large-scale, complex data where human-like pattern recognition is needed.

# 6. Building Social Networks and Communities Around Truth Validation

Communities and networks can be encouraged to form around shared goals of truth validation. These groups can:

* Use Bayesian models to collectively assess information and educate each other.
* Share reliable, evidence-backed knowledge with broader social circles, acting as 'truth amplifiers.'
* Develop social norms where seeking, validating, and sharing truth is rewarded socially, reinforcing the cycle of truth dissemination.

This method works on the principle of social proof, where individuals are more likely to accept something as true when it is endorsed by their community. By focusing these communities on truth detection, an environment is created where truth is continuously refined and spread organically.

# Conclusion

Applying Bayesian principles sociologically allows for the creation of self-reinforcing systems that prioritize truth. Whether through media algorithms, education, public discourse, or entertainment, Bayesian-driven truth detection can lead to a society where accurate, evidence-based information is amplified and misinformation is quickly diminished. This not only spreads useful truth but also strengthens societal trust in knowledge, creating a more informed and rational population.

How does Bayesian logic compare to connectionism?

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Bayesian logic and connectionism are both models used to understand how information is processed, but they approach the task from different theoretical frameworks. Here’s a breakdown of how they compare:

# 1. Basic Concepts

* **Bayesian Logic**:
   * Based on probability theory, Bayesian logic is used to update the likelihood of a hypothesis being true based on new evidence. It relies on Bayes' Theorem, where beliefs (or hypotheses) are continually updated as new data comes in.
   * It's a **rule-based** and **explicit** approach to reasoning, where the system uses predefined probability distributions to adjust beliefs about a proposition.
* **Connectionism**:
   * Rooted in **neural networks** and cognitive science, connectionism models information processing through interconnected nodes (neurons). It simulates the brain's learning process through **distributed, parallel processing**.
   * In this framework, learning and knowledge emerge through patterns of activation across the network, without explicitly defined rules. It's more **implicit** and focuses on learning through **experience** and adjusting the strengths of connections based on feedback (often called **weights**).

# 2. Mechanism of Learning

* **Bayesian Logic**:
   * **Learning through evidence and probability**. Bayesian systems start with an initial hypothesis and update their understanding of the world by calculating the probability of an event based on new data. This updating process is continuous and mathematically driven.
   * For example, in a medical diagnosis model, Bayesian logic would update the likelihood of a disease being present as new symptoms or test results become available.
* **Connectionism**:
   * **Learning through adjustment of connections**. In a connectionist model, the network learns by adjusting the strengths (weights) of the connections between nodes. These weights are updated during training as the network is exposed to data (e.g., in supervised learning). It doesn’t necessarily involve explicit probability updates but learns through error correction and pattern recognition.
   * For instance, in image recognition, the model strengthens connections between certain neuron layers when specific features (like shapes or colors) are detected in images of particular objects.

# 3. Interpretability

* **Bayesian Logic**:
   * **Highly interpretable**. Bayesian methods give clear, interpretable outputs in terms of probability (e.g., “There’s a 70% chance this hypothesis is true”). You can trace the reasoning process and understand how each piece of new evidence influenced the final conclusion.
   * This is particularly useful when you need transparency in decision-making processes, such as in scientific research or policy-making.
* **Connectionism**:
   * **Less interpretable (black-box models)**. Connectionist models, especially deep neural networks, often lack transparency. While they can be highly effective at solving complex tasks like image or language recognition, understanding *how* the model reached a conclusion can be difficult. It doesn’t output easily interpretable probabilities like Bayesian logic does.
   * Interpretability remains a challenge, especially in fields like medicine or law, where understanding why a certain decision was made is critical.

# 4. Handling Uncertainty

* **Bayesian Logic**:
   * **Directly handles uncertainty**. Since Bayesian logic operates on probabilities, it is designed to handle uncertain information by adjusting its belief as evidence changes. It quantifies uncertainty at every stage, giving a clear picture of how confident the system is in its predictions.
* **Connectionism**:
   * **Indirectly handles uncertainty**. Connectionist models may handle uncertainty through exposure to diverse data during training, allowing the network to generalize well even when encountering new or uncertain information. However, the model doesn’t explicitly measure uncertainty in the same way Bayesian logic does, making it harder to quantify the confidence in its predictions.

# 5. Scalability and Complexity

* **Bayesian Logic**:
   * **Challenging with complex, high-dimensional data**. Bayesian models are computationally intensive, especially when working with complex or high-dimensional data. As the number of variables and the complexity of the data grows, calculating the probabilities becomes increasingly difficult. Various approximations (e.g., Monte Carlo methods) are used, but they can still struggle with large-scale tasks.
* **Connectionism**:
   * **Highly scalable**. Connectionist models, particularly deep learning, are built to handle large-scale data efficiently. Neural networks can process vast amounts of complex, high-dimensional data, making them the go-to models for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous systems.

# 6. Generalization vs. Prior Knowledge

* **Bayesian Logic**:
   * **Incorporates prior knowledge**. Bayesian models explicitly integrate prior knowledge or assumptions, allowing them to make inferences even with limited data. The system improves by incorporating new data into these priors, updating its belief based on the evidence.
   * Example: In a diagnostic system, prior probabilities about disease rates are used, and as symptoms are observed, these beliefs are updated.
* **Connectionism**:
   * **Generalizes from data**. Connectionist models tend to rely more on data patterns rather than explicitly encoding prior knowledge. They generalize knowledge from the training data they receive, often excelling at tasks where large amounts of data are available but might struggle without sufficient training data.
   * Example: A neural network that hasn’t been trained on certain rare medical conditions might fail to recognize them, whereas a Bayesian model could still make informed guesses based on prior knowledge.

# 7. Applications

* **Bayesian Logic**:
   * Widely used in fields that require reasoning under uncertainty or where decision-making must be transparent, such as medical diagnosis, robotics (where uncertainty in perception and decision-making is common), and scientific research.
* **Connectionism**:
   * Often applied to tasks involving **pattern recognition, language processing, and decision-making**, especially when large datasets are involved. Examples include image classification, speech recognition, and recommendation systems (e.g., Netflix or YouTube recommendations).

# Summary of Comparison

||
||
|**Aspect**|**Bayesian Logic**|**Connectionism**|
|**Core Principle**|Probability-based reasoning and updates|Distributed, neural-network-based learning|
|**Learning Mechanism**|Updating beliefs based on evidence|Adjusting connection weights through training|
|**Interpretability**|Highly interpretable and transparent|Often opaque, difficult to interpret|
|**Handling Uncertainty**|Explicitly handles and quantifies uncertainty|Implicit handling of uncertainty via generalization|
|**Scalability**|Less scalable, complex with large data|Highly scalable for large-scale tasks|
|**Generalization**|Incorporates prior knowledge|Generalizes from training data|
|**Applications**|Medical diagnosis, scientific research, decision-making|Image recognition, language processing, decision-making|

# Conclusion

Bayesian logic is highly structured, rule-based, and particularly useful when explicit reasoning, handling uncertainty, and interpretability are key concerns. It excels in contexts where decisions need to be transparent, and prior knowledge can be incorporated.

Connectionism, on the other hand, is more flexible, scalable, and powerful for complex tasks like pattern recognition and learning from large amounts of data. However, it often functions as a ""black box,"" where the decision-making process is less clear.

Both models can be seen as complementary, with Bayesian logic excelling in reasoning tasks requiring clarity and connectionism thriving in tasks involving large-scale, complex data where human-like pattern recognition is needed.

Platforms like ChatGPT have gone from being novel conversational agents to becoming essential learning tools for students and professionals alike.

Whether you're diving into AI development or simply trying to improve your knowledge in any subject, OpenAI’s models have made it possible to access personalized, on-demand tutoring and problem-solving. I recently used GPT to break down some complex AI concepts for a project, and it was incredible how fast I could grasp ideas that once felt overwhelming.

Has anyone else experienced a shift in how they approach learning or working with AI because of OpenAI’s tools? What’s been your most memorable experience or project using GPT or other AI models?"
1g3lkim,14,2024-10-14,Mods deleted this post - always hiding evidence their troll is wrong,u/Dillon123,zenjerk,https://www.reddit.com/r/zenjerk/comments/1g3lkim/mods_deleted_this_post_always_hiding_evidence/,"I posted this but it was removed without providing me a reason. Such sleazy moderators.   
  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/1g3jacs/zhenjing\_kewen\_and\_this\_78\_eight\_consciousness/](https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/1g3jacs/zhenjing_kewen_and_this_78_eight_consciousness/)

--- REPOST ---  
  
u/InfinityOracle had shared with me that they were working on a translation of a text by Zhenjing Kewen (1025–1102). This is a PDF they are putting together and won't see the light of day for some time, but it shall be exciting when it does. They had shared with me this snippet of translation they had done, given the obvious theme:

>A monk came forward and asked: “It is said in the teachings of old that if one does not see a single Dharma, this is the Tathagata. Only then can it be called 'seeing clearly'. What is this basis of seeing clearly?”

**The Master replied: “Through seven, reaching eight.” (透七透八)**

If you are out of the loop, my posts have demonstrated in part that:

* The symbolism of the mirror in space, the ""Mind Mirror"" refers to this eighth consciousness
* The core enlightenment teaching in Zen is the transformation of the eight consciousnesses into the four wisdoms which enable the threefold enlightenment body of Vairocana (Buddha).
   * This is coded throughout Zen texts repeatedly, when not called out explicitly, such as in the *Blue Cliff Record* where it states: [""If one attains the state of the Buddha, the eight consciousnesses transform into the four wisdoms""](https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/1dbzy77/if_one_attains_the_state_of_the_buddha_the_eight/)
      * The BCR also has the coded ""7 flowers eight cracks"" 七花八裂 appear in cases #2, #9, #13, #14, #40, #83, and #95. While ""seven penetrations eight holes"" 七穿八穴 appears in cases #6, #37, #48, #61, #68, #73, #78, #87, #91, and #96. [(Read this 4-part series for context to each of the references).](https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/1fs60gz/bcr_investigation_pt_4_seven_flowers_eight_pieces/)
* Dahui, Huineng, Dongshan, etc... even the text that Bodhidharma quotes are supposed to come from make references to these eight consciousnesses and this transformation process.
   * This teaching seems to be traceable back to the 300's AD in such texts as the [Mahayana-sutra-alamkara-karika where it states ](https://www.reddit.com/r/zenjerk/comments/1dodepg/too_hot_for_rzen_the_sutra_they_dont_want_you_to/)of Buddha, ""He transforms the eight consciousnesses into the four wisdoms, combines the four wisdoms to manifest the three bodies, elucidating matters not found in sutras or treatises, truly hearing what has never been heard before, seeing what has never been seen."" Much of this sutra informs Huineng's verse that enlightens the student in Dahui's *Dharma Eye of the True Teaching.*

The resident proclaimed ""scholars of Zen"" and *lackademics* (who have blocked me as I hit them with too many facts) will unfortunately miss out on this further evidence to refute the claims they have made over 8 years ago that they cleave to to this day, that none of this is Zen and ""Zen Masters don't teach it""...

However, InfinityOracle shared with me the source of his translation, and wouldn't you know it, there are a number of further 7/8 coded phrases for us to enjoy, so let's participate once more in some truthful Zen study and look to the source records:

>18. 上堂。僧问：「十方佛土中。唯有一乘法。如何是一乘法？」师云：「百尺幡竿尾指天。」进云：「学人退身三步去也。」师云：「脚跟下七垫八横。」  
Ascending the hall a monk asked, ""In the Buddha-lands of the ten directions, there is only the One Vehicle Dharma. What is the One Vehicle Dharma?""

The Master said, ""The tip of the hundred-foot flagpole points to the sky."" The monk said, ""This student retreats three steps back."" **The Master said, ""Beneath your feet, seven rows and eight lines intersect.""**

The above is the last of the provied translations from Oracle. That one reminds me of ""脚跟下七穿八穴"" from the *Compendium of the Five Lamps* (supposed origin of the phrase 七穿八穴), where the master steps down from the meditation seat and this situation plays out: A monk asked, ""What is the method of managing the ten bodies? Master Ze Yan stepped down from his meditation seat and stood. Without fully understanding the meaning, he asked, ""How is it?"" **The master replied, ""From the heels down, seven piercings and eight holes.""** ([We have in the past compared this to walking on Vairocana's head)](https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/1dnhhgt/penetrating_practice_at_the_crown_of_vairocana/)

Beyond what u/InfinityOracle had translated, there were further instances in his document in Parts 21, 89, and 129 which closes the text out. I will unfortunately spoil us of their revealing proper and provide them below.

Part 21's contextual bit rendered by ChatGPT is something like:

>The master said: ""Look at these two old sharp tools. They each stole a bit of Linji’s living methods. Each has divided their own territories, with their energy soaring to the heavens. It only makes monks with clear eyes laugh. **Virtuous Chan practitioners, tell me, what are they laughing at? Do you know where this lands? If you know, even if you are tossed seven times over and knocked down eight times, it doesn’t matter.** If you don’t know, you’ll just be gnawing at Sansheng and Xinghua’s entanglements.""

Part 89's would be:

>Ascending the hall, the master said: ""**Opening Yunmen’s gate, the gate reaches seven thoroughfares and eight directions.** However, you must know there is a locking bolt to twist. If you do not know this, though alive, you are like the dead. As for the present Yellow Dragon, with its thousand transformations and myriad changes, you must still reach its lair in the hidden depths. If you do not reach it, even if you have eyes, it is as if you are blind. Virtuous ones, I observe the Dharma of the Dharma King. The Dharma of the Dharma King is like this. Those with eyes, discern it.""

Part 129 to close is:

>After a long pause, the master said: ""For thirty years I played with horse-riding, but now I’ve been struck by a donkey’s kick!"" Then he patted his knee and said: ""Even Mount Sumeru might collapse, and the ocean’s waters might surge with waves. The thirty-three heavens might all step down from their thrones at once. The eighteen great hells would be left to cease their bitterness. Do you see this? If you truly see, Śākyamuni bows with hands clasped, and Maitreya furrows his brows. Mañjuśrī and Samantabhadra become your attendants. **But if you don’t see, watch how I maneuver seven times across, eight times along.** Just engage with the entanglements and take them up! Ahahaha! Worthy ones, tell me, what am I laughing at?""

We will have to wait for the proper English translations when they come in Oracle's PDF."

I usually quesiton the world A LOT, like beliefs, ideas, and concepts. I also question myself (or at least I try to lol). I usually do not get the most physical activity, but when I do my body and mind are really into it; Like I don't even think when working out or playing something, I'm just kinda there doing my thing. Also my big hobbies are cycling, thinking to myself (which can be bad when used in the wrong ways), and tinkering with projects when one comes up. In terms of education, I would not consider myself a straight A student. I usually love the idea of learning and going to school, and I really hold myself up to a high standard, like ""wow I really wanna do great in school, and I am capable of it"", yet I always feel burnt out, and procrastinate. Sometimes I do slobby work. But, the most enjoyable/easy classes for me have been ones where I use my body to interract with things, like Ceramics, and Chemistry.

Anyways this is just some info about me! I don't know if one could tell my mbti just from this alone, but hey it is worth a shot :) Thanks in advance for anyone who helps."

They were assigned a 2-3 page health campaign analysis and were required to cite at least 4 objective, peer-reviewed sources. 

Because of the proliferation of ChatGPT, I list the following statement in my syllabus:

“It is understood that AI programs have become popular among students. However, you should note that all AI generative tools are prone to making up incorrect facts and fake citations, and image/art generation tools
can produce copied work or offensive products. If you choose to use AI tools in
the development of your work, you will be responsible for any inaccurate, biased, offensive, or otherwise unethical content you submit regardless of whether it originally comes from you or an AI tool. If you use an AI tool, its contribution must be credited in your submission. The use of an AI tool without
acknowledgement is cheating and constitutes a violation of the University’s Code of Academic Integrity.”

Despite this statement and a class discussion, I have received several papers with fabricated citations. After submitting grades, I receive emails from students feigning ignorance and requesting redos. I do not allow redos considering that the grade received is a slap on the wrist compared to the consequences that can be handed down by the Office of Academic Integrity.

Today's paper is titled ""Impeding LLM-assisted Cheating in Introductory Programming Assignments via Adversarial Perturbations"" by Saiful Islam Salim, Rubin Yuchan Yang, Alexander Cooper, Suryashree Ray, Saumya Debray, and Sazzadur Rahaman.

This research paper addresses a growing concern in computer science education—the use of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and CoPilot for assisting in introductory programming courses, which can potentially facilitate student cheating. The authors of this paper explore adversarial perturbations as a method to impede such cheating, focusing on altering problem statements to disrupt LLM-assisted solutions while maintaining student comprehension.

Key Points from the Study:

1. **Baseline Performance Evaluation**: The paper evaluated five popular LLMs—GPT-3.5, GitHub Copilot, Mistral, Code Llama, and CodeRL—on introductory programming problems. Surprisingly, none were able to generate fully correct solutions for the initial assignments in CS1, although better performance was noted in more advanced CS2 problems.

2. **Adversarial Perturbations**: Various perturbation strategies were developed, including synonym substitution, Unicode transformations, and content deletion. These perturbations collectively reduced the correctness of LLM-generated solutions by an average of 77%, proving effective in degrading LLM performance.

3. **User Study Insights**: A user study involving undergraduate students revealed that while some perturbations were detectable, others caused significant LLM performance degradation without being noticed. The study suggested that even when students identified perturbations, reversing them to produce correct solutions required considerable effort.

4. **Impact of Perturbation Techniques**: Techniques like sentence removal and large-scale Unicode substitutions proved highly effective in degrading LLM performance, albeit with a higher risk of being noticed by students. In contrast, smaller, subtle changes such as token substitution had the advantage of being less perceptible while still being effective.

5. **Educational Implications**: The study suggests that by incorporating adversarial perturbations into programming assignments, educators can reduce reliance on LLM-generated solutions, thereby encouraging independent problem-solving and learning among students.

This paper posits a novel proactive approach to minimizing LLM-assisted cheating in academia. The findings advocate for further exploration into protective measures and improvements in educational LLM interfaces.

1g46jht,1,2024-10-15,The Formation of My Anxiety and Its Unrelenting Negative Worsening Process,u/coolvosvos,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1g46jht/the_formation_of_my_anxiety_and_its_unrelenting/,"Negligence or unintentional physical injuries and traumas experienced in matters related to medical care, child-rearing, communication, and education, especially in areas concerning trust, can lead to feelings of inadequacy. These feelings may be compounded during adolescence, particularly after the age of 10, when not everyone can achieve the same level of success or self-validation in different fields. This can affect one's ability to assert themselves, be recognized, and earn respect. Combined with the emotional and sexual experiences during adolescence, regardless of gender, feelings of worthlessness or being treated as a backup option can emerge, along with social adaptation difficulties and some physiological disorders. Within the framework of tradition (for instance, circumcision in my case), the pain caused by negligence becomes almost a source of anxiety in my brain, as if it were an endless barrage of insults, curses, slang, or physical attacks. The extreme self-control I exert to prevent aggressive reactions, guided by logic, reason, law, and concerns about being rejected or harshly judged by family or social circles, becomes overwhelming. The thought that someone who is meant to protect me, even if not intentionally causing harm, might hurt me in the long run more than the physical pain I experienced during the circumcision process is troubling. In such a social environment, even if the people around me are completely well-intentioned, they may view me as incapable and cowardly for failing to protect myself and my loved ones. Even if I were to achieve a groundbreaking scientific discovery at home in the evening, societal expectations of men and women, and the instinctive behaviors expected of spouses, leaders, and decision-makers, place me in a position where I am seen as excessively self-controlled and unresponsive. This leads to the perception that I am incapable of producing reasonable discourse or solutions. I have been unable to escape this judgment for years.

Despite the fact that my father works in a stressful job in security services, he is a patient man who has remained remarkably calm in his communication with me compared to his peers. While he may not always agree with my ideas, he has tried to avoid directly hurting my character and personality. During my unhappy and depressive periods, I skipped school and avoided exams.

My anxiety disorder became most pronounced during the aggressive period I mentioned, when I entered a vocational school for information technology and computer studies with poor grades. Aside from some topics in programming and electronics, and hands-on activities like drawing and assembly, I gradually distanced myself from school and the country I lived in. The school I attended was filled with students like me, who lacked motivation and had inadequate academic knowledge, while the teachers were more suited to schools with more successful and ambitious students. For the first time in my life, I realized that approval, praise, and high grades, based on academic achievement and intelligence, did not provide me with confidence, especially in technical and theoretical subjects outside of my interests. By the final years of high school, the outdated and inefficient curriculum left me unable to make significant progress in software and technical subjects. Attending software and technology competitions with students from academically more successful schools made me feel inadequate, especially given my weaknesses in analytical and mathematical areas. This feeling was like a slap in the face.

Socially, I didn't experience criminal acts or regular physical abuse, but I was never the desired or popular person. In a school filled with delinquents, as a teenage boy, I often found myself wondering what I was doing there, spending hours like a worker. Eventually, I began considering alternative education, such as completing high school through exams rather than attending regular classes. I wanted to spend less time in school and more time attending specialized private courses that I enjoyed, where I could focus on subjects that interested me. However, my family and young relatives who were educators rejected this idea, insisting that a technical high school diploma was more valuable than a general high school diploma, despite my poor grades. They argued that if I couldn't get into a university, I could at least find a job with a technical diploma. While I reluctantly accepted the possibility of failure, they also told me that even if I managed to get into a good university and graduate, having a general high school diploma would still pose a problem. These nonsensical thoughts caused my mental health to plummet.

Fortunately, my father's understanding nature, the relatively tolerant attitude of my teachers, and the fact that my classmates, though not particularly rebellious, were not delinquents, prevented me from becoming another student whose mental health was so damaged that they carried out attacks on schools, which sadly have made headlines in Turkey. In one of the worst and most uncontrolled schools, known for its failing student body, I remained passive and withdrawn, preferring to avoid conflicts rather than escalate them. However, teachers who frequently resorted to ego-driven power plays for the sake of discipline created a toxic environment. One day in the school cafeteria, surrounded by 200-300 students and teachers, a teacher grabbed me by the collar. That incident, where I stood helpless, unable to react even verbally or aggressively, still affects me to this day. I realize that this kind of uncontrolled aggression and the fear and anxiety it generates, stemming from initial impressions, continues to affect me in encounters with people from different cultures and age groups. The fact that, as the weakest link in a group of 20-30 students, I became the target of unnecessary aggression, not for any serious disciplinary reason but merely because I was perceived as weak, has haunted me.

AI translation for I'm sorry. After finishing the writing, I experienced such an outburst of anger and sadness that I involuntarily punched the table in frustration. I need to rest my mind for a while to regain the calm necessary to deal with having the text translated again through different ChatGPT or AI services."
1g4cneq,1,2024-10-15,Call for Proposals for the 2025 U.S. Conference on Teaching Statistics,u/CAUSEweb,CAUSEweb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CAUSEweb/comments/1g4cneq/call_for_proposals_for_the_2025_us_conference_on/,"The U.S. Conference on Teaching Statistics (USCOTS) will be held at Iowa State University in Ames, IA from July 17-19, 2025, with pre-conference events starting on July 15th.  USCOTS brings together teachers of statistics and data science to exchange ideas about improving their teaching. The conference features thought-provoking keynote presentations, interactive breakout sessions, informative posters and beyond sessions, and exhibitor technology demonstrations. Other highlights of the conference include opening and closing sessions of inspiring five-minute talks, a banquet with an after-dinner speaker and awards, and birds-of-a-feather lunch discussions.

 

This conference is intended for all who are interested in teaching statistics or data science at all levels, including teachers at high schools, two-year colleges, and four-year colleges and universities. Graduate students and undergraduates who are interested in teaching are also encouraged to attend. We trust that you will find USCOTS a very welcoming, interactive, and fun environment. We hope that you will meet new colleagues and renew friendships with peers who are united by a common desire to teach statistics and data science effectively to the next generation of community members and data professionals.

 

The theme for USCOTS 2025 is **Useful Models**.  Sessions will explore many aspects of this theme and many different types of models, such as statistical models, pedagogical models, curricular models, learning and development models, and large language models.  We invite sessions on any and all Useful Models that pertain to the teaching and learning of statistics.

 

Please consider attending and even better, consider [submitting a proposal](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/uscots/uscots25/proposals) (or more than one) for an interactive breakout session, pre-conference workshop, posters and beyond contribution, research satellite talk or poster, or a birds of a feather discussion topic.  Deadlines are:

* January 27th, 2025 for proposing a research satellite poster or presentation

1g4pgjt,2,2024-10-15,Seeking input on my divorce case.,u/IamblichusSneezed,FamilyLaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyLaw/comments/1g4pgjt/seeking_input_on_my_divorce_case/,"Hi all,

I’m going through a divorce in Washington State and need advice about spousal support and how the court may view my situation. My soon-to-be ex (who now lives in Texas, but we lived together in CA) and I have been separated for 7 years with very little contact, but now she’s seeking alimony, alleging abuse asking for a protective and restraining order and claiming disability, despite never having received benefits during the marriage.

(Forgive any weirdness with the writing I am using ChatGPT because this is very stressful and difficult for me.)

Key points:

* We lived a modest life as substitute teachers. Significant financial hardship started when she refused to work.
* She was financially reckless, spending money budgeted for rent on non-essentials like jewelry. We had to borrow from my mother just to cover basic living expenses.
* She stole thousands of dollars from me, including savings meant for household expenses. She also took two guitars, one of which was an irreplaceable gift from my late father. I have six figures in student loan debt that was taken out after the birth of our child when we were engaged and living together, and used for our expenses. (the child is deceased)
* My mother provided financial support during and after the marriage to help her move out, but my stbx never paid back those loans.
* She has a history of substance abuse, including purchasing illegal street Vicodin and stealing prescription medications from my dying father. She was also caught shoplifting makeup and banned from a local drugstore.
* Despite claiming she’s been disabled for 11 years, she didn’t receive any benefits during the marriage and refused to work for several years even though she had the credentials. She was also kicked out of nursing school for being chronically late.
* We’ve had almost no contact in 7 years, but I recently received a strange call from a stranger who claimed I had their cat. I suspect my stbx gave out my phone number to harass or distract me, or entrap me trying to get me to give up her personal info. I can think of no other explanation.
* My ex claims I changed the locks on the family home and prevented her from retrieving personal belongings, such as a mattress, gaming consoles, and kitchen appliances.
* Denial of Lock Change: I never changed the locks. She had continuous access to the garage which she knew was unlocked, and a storage unit where I placed her belongings.
* Provision of Storage Access: I informed her about the storage unit and gave her several weeks to retrieve her items. She never provided a list of missing items or made clear what she still needed.
* Neglect and Damage: Some items were damaged by rain because she refused to assist in sorting and downsizing our hoarded belongings. I do not believe I am responsible for that damage.
* Offset by Items Taken: She took valuable items, including two guitars (one an irreplaceable gift from my late father) and an office box full of video games. This offsets any claims regarding the remaining items.

My main concerns are her potential claims for spousal support despite her behavior, and the division of debts. I have six figures in student loan debt that I used to cover our rent and living expenses for 3 years while we were together, which I believe she should share responsibility for.

Given her financial irresponsibility, theft, and substance abuse, what are my chances of avoiding alimony? Any advice on how to handle this situation would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance! Or happy vicarious enjoyment of this fuckin trainwreck.

  
Here is a much longer summary of my arguments in response to her response to the petition.

1g4qepx,1,2024-10-15,I have a hackathon in a week and I need to learn the basics quickly .

I have over a year of programming experience in c and python , I know basics of html , css and I've been read about js and it's quicker for the last 2 days .

I'm allowed to use ChatGPT /Claude but when I tried making a website with it , it made a lot of errors and I didn't know how to fix them because I didn't know how JS worked .

Basically I want to understand fundamentals of JS ( async , promises , closures , OOP, etc) 
Then go to react , next.js , learn any one database and how  API requests work and how to get a website up and running. It's fine if I don't know how to code it myself entirely (just get AI to do it) but I should be able to get it running properly. 


Any quick path that can get me there in like 30 hours of work . And I'd like to make a good project using AI with all of these as well so I get some confidence before the hackathon.

I had a student submit an assignment and at the bottom of the assignment, it says that it was written by chatgpt. It was signed by the program.

I've suspected they've been using it, but this was their first mess up. Presumably they've been turning it in straight, so I'll say I am surprised that it has been doing citations and in-text citations correctly. 

They got a zero, but no institutional support to report the student or do anything else. They just get the zero for that one course. Not sure what else I should do, but I hate that the students actually doing the work get similar grades to this person. 

System just seems broken. "

1g4xuut,2,2024-10-16,Day 16: Candyman (1992),u/ATobiaMD,31KnightsOfHalloween,https://www.reddit.com/r/31KnightsOfHalloween/comments/1g4xuut/day_16_candyman_1992/,"**Movie**: Candyman (1992) 

**Synopsis**

Inspired by Clive Barker’s *The Forbidden*, *Candyman* (1992) is set in the housing projects of Cabrini Green, Chicago. Helen Lyle is a University of Illinois graduate student who sets out to write a thesis about local legends and myths. She learns about a local urban legend, Candyman, who appears after calling his name five times in front of a mirror and uses his hook to split his victims from ‘groin to gullet.’  

*Candyman* is a film depicting the rite of passage of Helen Lyle. During her evolution, her skepticism turns to fear when after summoning Candyman, a series of murders and a visit from Candyman himself cause her life to spiral out of control.

**The Legend**

Partly inspired by Hook Man ([http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/the\_hook.htm](http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/the_hook.htm)), Candyman was the son of a slave whose father became wealthy mass-producing shoes after the Civil War. As a result, Candyman grew up attending the best schools and later became a well-known artist. Highly sought out by the elite society for his talent in portraits, he was hired to paint the daughter of a wealthy man who wanted to capture her ‘virgin beauty.’ After falling in love and fathering her child, his lover’s father became enraged, organizing a mob to lynch Candyman. During the gruesome attack and eventual murder, the mob cut off his right (painting) hand and replaced it with a hook. They then covered him in honey and allowed him to be stung to death as the mob chanted “Candyman, Candyman.” It is said that Candyman returns from his grave to take revenge when one dares to say his name five times in a mirror. 

**How it relates to the field of psychiatry** 

*Candyman* is Psychiatric Anthropological film that shines light on the social aspect of urban legends and why they resonate in certain communities. The French [anthropologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropologist), Claude Lévi-Strauss, identified myths as a type of speech through which a language could be discovered. He is renowned for his structuralist theory of mythology which attempted to explain how fantastical tales could be so similar across cultures. Urban legends are cautionary tales of contemporary folklore that identify taboos represented in all cultures that capture four common themes: a) misunderstandings, b) poetic justice, c) business rip-offs, and d) revenge. Urban legends are a large part of popular culture and often speak to the fears, anxieties, and biases of that culture. In doing so, they provide insight and give us an idea of the moral fabric of the community.  

For the people living in Cabrini Green, the urban legend of Candyman is validation of the fears of people living amongst the gruesome crimes against Ruthy Jean and the young boy. In the movie, we see that Candyman thrives off the perpetuation of this legend. Upon realizing that Helen may have caused a rift in people believing in his existence, Candyman beckons her to be his victim, with intent on killing her to give rebirth to his legend once again. 

In his seminal work, *Les rites de passage*, Arnold Van Gennep described rites of passage as having three phases:

Separation

During this phase, the individual is stripped of the social status that he or she possessed before the ritual. After challenging the authenticity of the urban legend, Candyman appears to Helen “needing to prove his existence.” After a series of murders by the ~~hand~~ hook of Candyman, Helen is stripped of her social status and imprisoned.

The Liminal Period

During this phase, the individual is inducted into the liminal period of transition; a middle stage of the ritual, no longer holding her pre-ritual status (but not yet having attained the status they will hold when the ritual is complete). For Helen, the discovery of the words in the apartment attic, “It was always you, Helen,” highlights the liminal period. She is betwixt and between, with Candyman’s prophesy that Helen will carry on his tradition of inciting fear into the community of Cabrini Green.

The binary motif is seen throughout the movie: Candyman is an African American slave whose ‘spirit’ resides in the ghettos of Chicago. Helen, a white middle class woman, resides in a luxurious condominium. The use of bees as symbolism is also important in that they have the capacity to make a sweet honey while also being able to induce great pain. Also, the very way Candyman kills his victims is by splitting them in two. 

Re-Assimilation into Society

During this phase, the individual is given her new status. As the prophesy foretells \[spoiler alert\], Helen ultimately becomes the embodiment of the urban legend.

In using the mirror, Candyman forces his victims to confront the self and non-self, or the “other” and to project internal conflict onto external images. These visual tools play with the spectator’s impulse control, and most importantly to question it; “No one ever got past four.” The notion of going past four is a common theme throughout the movie. Candyman, with his gruesome tale, plays on humanity’s infatuation with the grotesque and like Pandora’s Box, its allure compels us to approach the lid. In this case the ‘lid’ is opened by saying “Candyman” five times in a mirror. The ultimate twist \[spoiler alert\] is that Helen’s fate is to replace Candyman as the urban legend that haunts Cabrini Green. This trope is seen in many films, novels, and folklore {Aaron Mahnke (2018), *Dark Conclusions* \[Lore podcast\], October 16, available at: https://www.lorepodcast.com/episodes/46 (accessed: October 2016)}.

1g52glc,1,2024-10-16,"Samplers (BAP, Rand, Dasha) ",u/MirkWorks,u_MirkWorks,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MirkWorks/comments/1g52glc/samplers_bap_rand_dasha/,"*BAP notes*

Tl;dr: Writing a piece about the core of BAP’s politics being the protection of Minority Rights.

On white sand beach, the horizon a copulation of blues; the firmament and the wine-colored sea. The sun having ridden past the zenith observes the spectacle. The winds seeping through pores drenching bones warm. Dressed elegant, pale, feverish he sits and stares. Stares at the athletic young men holding knives performing pyrrhic dance round a good fire. *Hella Good* by No Doubt blasting from boombox. Arms interlocking, butt-kickers, spinning, stabbing. Round and round. Their steps in beat with electronic syncopation. No shirts, no shoes, no problems. Scantily clad, the light dances with them reflected on their glistening anointed bodies. The red satin kerchiefs crowning heads and around necks. It’s an adaption that stays true to the spirit of the original. Sipping on his ice tea the man admires the results. “Glory be! Glory be!! Ave! AVE! IO! We salute all the gods in their abodes high and low and in the seas. All is good. All is good. All is great. Be forever you gorgeous beasts of prey! ALLAHU AKBAR!!!” The feverish man intones. Visualizing the praise like perfumed smoke rising up out of his skull, joining the fragrance of all creation.

Ask him about his casting choices. It’s really very simple. In short; JCVD hits in a way that Billy Blanks doesn’t and he refuses to be forced to say otherwise. I propose the following hypothesis. Revealing the profound dialectical unity between BAP and the Wachowskis:

Transfixed on the tv screen displaying Jean-Claude Van Damme in all his elegant ferocity, kicking the daylight from the savage eyes of Asiatic barbarians, absolutely destroying his opponent without ambivalence…nigh flawlessly in the final round— he could watch this for hours. Reasoning in retrospect that the barbarian on the receiving end of the Belgian’s fury could not help but misuse his own talents and power, exemplifying the cruelty of the oriental matrix their genius had be shaped or rather warped by… the warrior degenerating into a mere criminal. Thus Providence has brought JCVD into existence so as to remind the despot that they too are prey liable to get caught in the gaze and ground up in the limbs and skillful technique of another. The blood-drunk audience chants “Nok Su Kao! Nok Su Kao! Nok Su Kao!” One suppresses the bubbling sympathy as the native fighter grimacing groggily slaps his thighs in consternation at this latest betrayal, the kind of self-consciousness required to cope with his own people turning against him lies beyond his horizon, barring an unlikely retreat into Buddhist monasticism and self-reflection/dissolution. Still, is it so bad? This humiliation? This coming to very close to death? The betrayal is in not dying. They cannot help but admire and glory in the deconstruction, despite it being at their own countryman’s expense, this champion in whose presence they had once cowered, misrecognizing the brute as a god and a king. Their bloodlust has opened the way for further ennoblement. According to him, to our Bronze Age Pervert, this is something deeply Platonic. Just read Book 3 of Plato’s *Republic.* Socrates (as portrayed here by Seth Rogan) would’ve adored JCVD.

Billy Blanks doesn’t hit the same. But who does, honestly? JCVD is singular.

And perhaps it’s true that all art made in service of political ends is pornographic and that the sphere of politics

Here, the real “horseshoe” is a reformulation of Costin Alamariu’s observation in the introduction to *Selective Breeding and the Birth of Philosophy,*

* The nascent youth rebellion is international, remarkably broad-based among high-school students and others somewhat older, and it is, like all youth rebellions, contrarian and nihilistic. But it has genuine, substantial criticisms of the egalitarian world-view. These young people are attracted in general to knowledge of human nature that was made “forbidden” to them by the educational and moral establishment of our time. Without engaging or being able to engage the new scientific body o knowledge that is coming out at an increasingly rapid pace, readers, *of whatever moral or political conviction,* will simply lose the plot.

I think the configuration of Costin Alamariu-as-BAP reveals Costin to be *the* luminary apostate of the philosophic school and lineage founded by Leo Strauss.

My understanding is that he is viewing this social phenomena from the perspective of someone who swore an oath to insure that a society which doesn’t force Socrates to kill himself, can exist. That’s why the “re-politicization” of Nietzsche is as important within his school as it is, the point of reversing Georges Bataille’s operation (convincingly showing that Nietzsche would’ve been deeply opposed to the Third Reich) is so that one undergoes the process of “de-politicizing” Nietzsche all over again, as a personal, *spiritual*, exercise. Shows that the student has read the material, *deeply.* Has communed with Nietzsche. Through Nietzsche with Callicles-Plato.

*Influence* or “mere words” should not provide license to torment, imprison, and execute someone. A society which does this, which sets the legal precedence to persecute specters and “influence”, is an inquisitorial and superstitious one. In short, a stupid one. Aristophanes’ satirization of Socrates should have been enough, the critiques Aristophanes’ levels against Socrates are the charges levied against his person by Athenian authorities. They weren’t wrong. What condemns Socrates was precisely his influence. Despite his disavowal of Critias. Consider that Socrates was not innocent. That he was indeed guilty of all charges. That doesn’t mean he deserved to be forced to drink hemlock which despite the beatific image of his passing in *Phaedo*, and his embracing of death as a ‘cure’ to life within Plato’s narrative… would’ve been a horrific death.

Recollecting BAP’s play with Empedocle’s leaping into the volcano in *Bronze Age Mindset*.

* There was Empedocles, a philosopher, man of high vision. He jumped into volcano Aetna in Sicily because he knew he would be reborn as a god. Now imagine yourself in front of rim of Aetna. It’s dry and sandy. You feel the heat but is not like you thought it might be. Is not Romantic. Is just hot, dry, you can’t breathe, and the smell of infernal sulfur and wet earth and even worse things triggers an old memory or instinct in you to run. You’re brought to face with a vehemence and brutality of rock and you start to feel dizzy staring in. Molten rock in your nostrils and it’s not just that it scares you. If it were great fear, that could be a spur to action. But it fills your nostrils with banality and dullness of plain molten dust, you see gray and black. It reminds you of torrid summer afternoon by abandoned gas station, you are stranded on dirt road, choked by heat and so much dust. You see flames in the hole but it lacks the romance of fire as you imagined it. IIs this it? It seems like nothing to you, because to your eye it’s nothing. So you pull away from it. You’re not reborn as a god, you remain a mule. Your lying mind now comes up with many thoughts about why it’s right to pull back. Why, of course! There’s a nice meal to have, a glass of wine. Maybe there’s a girl waiting. Her pussy is warm and inviting. Empedocles was deluded.

Socrates’ decision to drink Hemlock rather than accept exile is I think, reminiscent of Empedocle’s apotheosis. Hemlock paralyzes your respiratory system. The way Plato writes Socrates’ death is beautiful. The prescribed sacrifice of a strange mutant, his head in the clouds, skulking the streets like a pelican. Eyes lolling looking for a debate.

….

BAP if BAP is indeed Costin Alamariu’s construct, arises from a very clear philosophic lineage. BAP is as a construct I think, a modern adaption of the philosophic personae within the Platonic Corpus, of Callicles, and later of Nietzsche. Who were willing to discursively revivify the political heresy which resulted in Socrates’ death. I don’t think the point of this is, politically, is to say Callicles was right and leave it at that. This is ignoring the fate of Critias (the thirty tyrants) and of Alcibiades who is glorified *because* he embodied the poetic-heroic ideal so thoroughly that he couldn’t help but half-ass and fail any attempt at a coup of the Athenian polis… his own self-destructive tendencies culminated in his having a genuinely heroic life… he overcame the fate of being a tyrant of a failed regime, his vitality wouldn’t permit it.

We have to work past this. Have to think. The probably is we inevitably run into the problem of spoiling the process and cheapening it through articulation. Make of this what you will then. But what Bronze Age Pervert does is present in content, a defense of minority rights (which ambitiously extends to non-human animals, something which is, legally, unique).



*Sinister Reading or Dominique-type Beat.*

First impression from the occasional critical reference to Nietzsche in the collection of essays titled *The Virtue of Selfishness,* is the collapsing of both thinkers into a Calliclean singularity. My immediate response was bemused indignation and gratitude; taking it as evidence of my own idiocy for having spent any time or money on Rand but grateful that I’d so cleverly located the leverage point through which my devastating critique could be enacted. Rand’s caricature of Nietzsche is upon first reading petty. She comes off like a dumb seething woman in the style of all her villains. This is in no small part due to her *use* of Nietzsche. And here she embodies the villainous traits in her antagonists. Despite lusting after someone greater than herself she is seemingly incapable of the vulnerability required to grant that recognition to anyone else, choosing instead to diminish. Is she capable of genuine admiration of the virtue of those around her or is her admiration reserved for the phantasms populating her imagination? Desiring the security of dependence and resenting those who defer to her but punishing those who do not, wanting someone or something to be devoted too but torturing those who are devoted to her and to whom she was in a concrete sense devoted too. I assume that she is not engaging in the agonal technique Nietzsche skillfully employed in his relation to the persons of Schopenhauer and Wagner; in the case of the former to exorcise or rather externalize Schopenhauer’s influence on his thinking and of the latter as a means to repress his own virulent over-identification with Wagner’s creative project and career. Agonism in Nietzsche’s endeavor serves as a boundary setting technique, one which affirms the uniqueness of both through antagonism. Nor do I see in Rand’s approach anything resembling Nietzsche’s use of the critique as a documentation of stylistic habits and identifying them as the bad stylistic and cognitive habits of thinkers (who in turn might become the personifications of said habit) so as to not replicate said habits in his own work. Agonism in this case has the quality of a purgative meant to remove contaminants and parasites. There is also a joy and sense of exaltation to be felt in the good back-and-forth, one which ignites the attractiveness of the one perceived to have triumphed over the other. The reader, feminized as they are, may very well find that they’ve been seduced. Rand’s antagonism towards Nietzsche in contrast read as coming from a much pettier place, one of insecurity.

To Conclude a *Sinister Reading*. Final Thoughts. Colorin Colorado:

She’s an insecure female “intellectual”, Ur-Schoolmarm *YOU* are the devouring mother enshrined at the heart of the longhouse. Unlike the revered fat mimaw matron of the past with all her warmth and magic and affection. Exalted Longhouse Matron, having arisen as a Type within and apart of our species by an intimate and prolonged exposure to raw elemental forces. Not of nature as such (though undeniably you are a duplicate) as something understood distinct from human artifice and society, but in the raw elemental powers of Value. Having been the object of both use and exchange. You on the other hand are gaunt and insecure and covered in dark fur. Black Goat. The Witch has usurped. You shirk the responsibility and demand sexual favors from your dependents, which you’ve made dependent in order to have something to punish for its dependency. Instead of affection and wisdom you give abuse and claim it was what was wanted by those *inspired* that remain in the aftermath of the ecstatic auto-castration (perhaps the manifestation of some impulse akin to the phenomena observed in the Calhoun’s Rat Utopia experiment). Oh cosmic mother of monstrosities, who consumes worlds and children and luxury good knick-knacks and the livers of good men and their souls after they’ve committed suicide.

Blackhole Pussy.

Tenebrous accursed fetish.

No amount of words or therapy can salvage this ruin.

Out-of-joint and rebelling against what ennobles you. Trifling recessed chin pouty lipped incapable of recognizing what is good outside of fantasies. Indeed punishing it. Interested in manly-things, once she gets going she just goes on and on. Imagine how cold, how frigid. The only cure?... Isn’t it obvious? She’s jealous. Case closed. All the Wrist-Twirlers and their Hawaiian shirt clad fur babies strongly recommending Rand. Fuck you and your log cabin and your ornate oriental fan. Fuck you and your podcasts. Fuck off. Die. Die. Quickly if possible. There is serious work to be done. Your corpse the raw materials of my World, your soul and grudge might live on as the revealed reality of what you’d always been: malicious winds, illness, and nightmares. I’ll grant you that at least. You’re caustic. A haunting, shadows populating my design.

What do you want?

WOMAN WHAT DO YOU WANT!?

“*I wish you many years and success in all your ventures. Most of all I wish you happiness.”*

Well. That’s not fair. Cheap trick. You didn’t answer my question. What do *you* want. Don’t put that on me.

No. That won’t do. Apologies the whirring thing gets overheated from time to time.

Embarrassing. I’ve canceled my membership, any right to claim the benefit of citizenship. Ship me back. Fuck it.

Sweetness, I was only joking. You’re one of my favorites. Probably the only person who gets me. And I find what you’ve done inspiring. Please don’t die. I didn’t mean it God.



*Our Waif a Wolf*

Why does Dasha have to sound so dreamy? Why is Dasha fawning over this guy with nary a thought for how this might impact her career. Why? Why is it that every time something good appears round the corner. Press down on the accelerator. Podcast a *Thelma & Louise* act. A tribute to all the Japanese schoolgirls bound in suicide pact group chat. Crows heralding the dusk. What is she afraid of?

Here is a vision. During the production of the events labeled “The Fall of Alex Jones” when Alex Jones was symbolically sacrificed, a great ritual spectacle meant to elicit feelings of euphoria and catharsis. Declared anathema and forced into infinite debt (recall them even trying to take away his pet cat)… Imagine if Dasha wouldn’t have felt a sentimental, moral, even spiritual obligation to “close the circle” in a reconciliatory manner. Expressing shock jock solidarity and displaying gratitude to Alex Jones and InfoWars. Publicly defending him. After all there would be no Sailor Socialism without InfoWars.

Understand that Dasha directed a microbudget indie film that was lauded by European cinephiles (vanguard of film nerds) and was cast as supporting character in the second season of the popular HBO series *Succession.* Eliciting envy from dumb young fans pining after the fantasized-approachable. Looking gorgeous on screen. *Succession* being one of the few times I can recall where Dasha was filmed in HD from the perspective of a tall person looking down at her from a respectful distance rather than the on-level or slightly below (cam-style) or slightly above, with a degree of intimate proximity almost as if the camera (the camera as a savoring/yearning machine attempting in vain to capture and transmit her in a manner that satisfies all the senses rather than simply sight and sound). Comforting how the change in perspective reveals a difference which is no-less beautiful*.*

Her career should’ve taken off, potentially launching her into fuck you money territory. Instead to paraphrase her agent at the time, Dasha’s principles had consequences. Was she blacklisted? I speculate. Assuming she was and it was over something related to the podcast rather than some behind-the-scenes drama that continues to reverberate as lore amongst the nepos and their frustrated handlers. We might attribute the unofficial black listing to the photos of Dasha and Anna having a blast with Alex Jones and the episode of the pod where they interviewed him. Coming across like damage control. Too much sympathy for the pariah perhaps? Or perhaps they’d committed the unforgivable sin of breaking Kayfabe. Who knows? (As Anna noted a few episodes back; are you really *ideological* enemies if you’re attending the same parties and funerals?)

Ask yourself, what if Dasha Nekrasova had instead taken an approach or line akin to the one Taylor Swift took in relation to Kanye West (“trash takes itself out”)… Reserving her opinions save for an instagram short or some other equivalent, saying something to the effect of “It’s pronounced Ne-Kra-SOVA.” Or posting something in the vein of the Assad “who must go?” memes. In fact Dasha could’ve “closed the circle” with Ashton Witty instead, inviting her on the show. The gift of digital space and potential audience. Maybe Ashton could’ve talked about her time as a child star. The pressures and self-image issues and broken promise. Really putting into sharp relief the degenerated tragical character of her and Dasha’s career-defining run in. There is another dimension to this; Ashton could’ve, and during that particular period, would’ve sounded-off, as the Voice of all the other disillusioned first draft former Rightwing e-girls, who had, objectively, bee exploited and then ruthlessly discarded by the “Alternative Right” media complex. Jilted e-girls sharing their own flavor of MeToo, revealing the Sadean (ala Weinstein-Epstein) dynamics that occurred behind-the-scenes, putting Clout Creatures on blast and in so doing, purifying themselves of prior associations and personal agency (and is this not the highest charity one can grant a person in this world?) while opening up new roads for them. This all would’ve resonated well with the Lasch and Lacan influence on A&D’s approach to cultural criticism and with the themes explored in Dasha’s own film *The Scary of Sixty-First.*

Without a doubt had Dasha and Anna done this, Dasha would currently be hard at work filming an episode for some Disney+ series or an episode of an acclaimed HBO series, all the while raising funds for her own little creative passion projects. We would’ve likely had Cornel West, Marianne Williamson, Camille Paglia, and Elizabeth Olsen guest appearances on *Red Scare.* Barring Camille Paglia, I imagine that none of the people listed, would want anything to do with *Red Scare* at this point*.* They’d be heavily advised against making such appearances by their millennial staffed teams to avoid that kind of heat. Said staffers or team members interpreting (filtering) *Red Scare* through their own prism.

I don’t know I don’t do this shit for a living.

Still, it would feel kind of fake no? Like doing what I just fantasized above would constitute an actual betrayal of the *Red Scare* ethos in favor of an inauthentic unity. Insincere, cloying, and saccharine. Cheap catharsis that profanes everything. We’d absolutely eat it up. It’s instead left to me, who inspires you to shower every other day, to interrogate why I find Sailor Socialism so compelling.

*Blood Sport*

A former child actress named Ashton Whitty accompanied by a camera man (and perhaps other people she thought of as being part of her ‘team’) went to a film festival of some sort. They were looking to catch random hipsters off guard by confronting them with charged political questions. Hoping to record them getting “owned” by Ashton. The resulting footage would then be cobbled together into a sort of highlight reel meant to promote the next Hot Blonde Conservative Firebrand. Move over Megyn Kelly and Ann Coulter the age of streaming platforms is nigh, it’s Ashton Whitty’s time. These clips would be edited together in such a way as to make Ashton look great at the expense of the libs and pinkos getting owned. The production and proliferation of these highlight reels the aspirant provides their own contribution to the joint-production of the image of the enemy; these morons are voting, if you don’t want these morons deciding the fate of our Republic, morality should compel you to go out and vote too, if you don’t play these “people” win by default. The political opinions and by extension tenuous self-image of the target audience is affirmed. The tenuousness is this self-image is momentarily alleviated, appearing to gain some solidity with the each shot of catharsis is provided, flickering between translucence and opaqueness. Like a ritual of effigy burning. The audience encouraged to feel a sense of vicarious triumph over the competition something which, from the onset, was framed in terms of a generational conflict. With Left-aligned “alt” media outlets (think 2010 Youtube era The Young Turks) tending to target stray MAGA Boomers and Right-aligned “alt” media outlets (The Blaze, Breitbart, InfoWars) targeting Bernie loving Millennial uni students.

We got to watch a stand-in for an older or younger relative be humiliated and for that moment of humiliation to remain immortalized on the internet. Dopamine and serotonin hits beckon further hits of dopamine and serotonin… culminating in the ballot-box… just imagine the expression on these people’s faces when our guy wins. Can’t wait to season my food with their tears. Don’t feel too bad, it’s ultimately for their own good, they’re just too stupid to realize it.

Random people naïve and/or stupid enough to let themselves be filmed are in turn edited or stitched into the amalgam meme. A kind of Frankenstein’s monster. The surplus humans, the NPCs, are collateral. Kindling for the career of the aspiring pundit seeking fame and fortune by casting their lot in the Culture War. Obviously this phenomena speaks to a profound rot in our society. An unintended consequence of some sort and you and I my sweet pervert are currently living in the unintended consequence of this unintended consequence.

As always trying to make the best of things.

This was a very popular gimmick and a lot of would-be talent attempted to make a name for themselves by producing these little spectacles. Thanks to the Youtube algorithm and growing political polarization, there existed a very real chance your highlight reel could go viral, allowing you to skip ahead of the line, right into club, ushered into the VIP section and into the arms of the Self-Made Father.

Low vibration appealing to and by extension reinforcing the worst/basest impulses of humanity. Harnessing the sadomasochistic in order to advance the “content-creators” project and career. Harvesting views, likes, and subscribers. Among them children and simps. A legion of lonely people with time, spare change, and ambitions destined to be eternally frustrated. Besides its appeals to the lowest tendencies within the audience this schtick likewise reinforces a general misanthropy and paranoiac mistrust in the viewer. Constituting one particular expression of a growing trend relating to the evolution of media. Videos of people chimping the fuck out, humiliating themselves, captured and immortalized. People at their lowest sold as people being ‘exposed’. “Exposing” some profound individual ruin within their person. Identifying the Fucked who are destroying this country.

Click-bait content mill low-frequency garbage. The *worst* elements of MeToo. Now everyone is scared to interact with everyone else because the person you're interacting with may or may not be looking to extract *content* from you. With the full intention of damning you in the process. Obviously it's going to go on the internet, in service of some bottom-feeding gimmicky content creator's ambitions, for the ambitions of someone who does not love you, who will not feel an ounce of compassion or sympathy for you. Who won't hesitate, who won't look at the footage and say to himself... ""You know what, they were probably having a bad day, I'm not gonna put them on blast."" Having sold his heart for clout... that man would likely do unspeakable things if it helped grow his personal brand.

Low-trust Society.

What kind of desperate person do you have to be to agree to fake interest in another person in order to extract so-called “content” from them? Betrayal is both the means and the ends. The betrayed is the meme, the meme is the “content” extracted and this content is the “truth” of who they really are. It’s a vampire's definition of Truth.

Is it any wonder an adaption of Greco-Roman Stoic practice has gained popularity along with the various iterations of “Western” Buddhism with appeals to Stoicism resting precisely on a perceived similarity between it and Buddhism with references to the probable cross-pollination that occurred during the Hellenistic period? A philosophy which teaches that the only thing you can control is your Self, your own reactions to things, up to and including your thoughts and feelings. Matches well with the need to maintain one’s public appearance. Especially in a world were the distinction between public and private or personal, has been collapsed. Existing as a contemporary sublimation of the anxious self-monitoring necessitated by the constant possibility of surveillance and the wide-spread promotion of an utterly vindictive and exploitative attitude towards others. The exploitation and humiliation of others justified through unconvincing moralization. Thankfully it appears that the era of tabloid smut and personal betrayals being sheathed in accountability discourse is dying down... somewhat.

An Actor. This is why a Society that forces everyone to be an Actor is fucked.

Perhaps what Christopher Lasch was actually documenting and lamenting, was the gradual “Japanification” (in Kojevean terms) of the American citizenry.

Reminded of a video someone posted on the main RedScare subreddit. The original video was posted by some hall-monitor douchebag whose gimmick involved recording his confrontations with people in grocery store parking lots for not putting their shopping carts back in the designated shopping cart receptacle. If they refused to comply, he’d attach a sticker or magnet on their car. Like a Star of David patch or fleur-de-lis brand. Seemed a low-risk adaption of something he’d watched Russian social media people do (this is fairly common). Namely of the stunts performed and recorded by members of the StopXham or Stop a Douchebag youth movement (as a brief aside given our conversations about biblical genealogies and the casting of Black Africans and Hamites or Children of Ham, it’s fascinating that the word Cham or Ham is used by Russians to denote a vulgar, trashy, and inconsiderate person). In the video proper, the Panopticon Enjoyer (alternatively, Public Morality Defender) confronts a young couple guilty of this indiscretion. The woman proceeds to argue with him for an uncomfortable amount of time. Very passive-aggressive, very annoying, smarminess galore. Ultimately they refused, the situation having escalated into a matter of principle, the man attaches the magnet (sticker?) on their car. The woman proceeds to confront him again, this goes on for awhile…. “Lib Woman owned” yaddayaddayadda. My prescription: Labor and technical school (free room and board) for everyone involved.

Anyways I found myself thinking about the boyfriend. He just sat there. Blinking and smiling. I swallow his shame.

Why would you linger and allow your girlfriend to make a fool of herself?

Absolutely no protective instincts on display. Dude basically allowed his woman to humiliate herself. Your hands are on the steering wheel, your foot is on the pedal, you know your woman... drive, you're the driver. What calculations are running through your head at that moment? Your woman is yapping on. Don't bet on her turning the tables and winning that confrontation. Get her out of there. Like what the fuck are you doing? You've already established that you won't move the cart and that the ridiculous person who waved you down is of little consequence. He isn't even standing directly in front of the vehicle. You can just roll up the windows and leave. The laziness goes beyond putting the shopping cart back in the shopping cart receptacle. It extends to guarding his woman's dignity.

""Don't feel like doing it, busy day, tired. Bye... Oh he tossed a magnetic sticker on the car. What a fucking loser.""

Just drive.

1g55dfy,1,2024-10-16,EPQ help needed about aerospace medicine on future space travel,u/spicyspacechicken1,space,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/1g55dfy/epq_help_needed_about_aerospace_medicine_on/,"Hi, I'm a Year 12 student who got accepted to do an EPQ, and I need help formulating a question.

For context, an EPQ is basically a mini dissertation based on a question of your own choosing. The question has to be focussed, evaluative, researchable and interesting. My main issue is having my question be focussed and evaluative: having it be large enough to fit a recommended 6000 word count but small enough to be explored in a lot of depth and also being evaluative as to leave some room for counterarguments (not being able to be answered in a simple ""yes"" or ""no"").

My general topic is aerospace medicine which explores medicine and physiology in the abnormal environment of high altitude; Space medicine is a sector of aerospace medicine which is self-explanatory. I have always been fascinated by the way our body deals with extreme environments and aerospace medicine, which I cannot believe more people don't know about, is a field which I aspire to explore in the future. So I first got interested when I learned about the Artemis mission and was beginning to wonder about the importance of medicine in establishing a long-term presence of the moon and beyond (as you can see, I had decided to go into medicine long beforehand).

I have done quite a lot of research before my EPQ even started, and to me, space medicine can largely be subdivided into four main topics: Microgravity, Radiation, Pressure and Isolation. 

Microgravity (you know when astronauts are like floating in the air in those videos on the ISS -- that's microgravity) affects how fluids move in the body which can increase pressure on the eye, causing problems in vision and leads to bone atrophy in muscles as they waste away without the force of gravity to keep them in check.

Ionising radiation is omnipresent in space and massively dangerous for astronauts (imagine their cells being hit by bursts of energy like shotgun blasts that can damage the structure of their DNA) and this effect accumulates the longer your in space leading to increased risk of cancer and more chronic conditions.



Pressure is probably the danger which humans have mitigated the most through innovative countermeasures in engineering. The main dangers of pressure come in the form of decompression sickness where nitrogen gases form bubbles in our bloodstream due to rapid decreases in pressure. Imagine the energy you see when you open the lid of a boiling kettle but instead of a kettle, its an astronaut, and instead of opening a lid, they're climbing out their high pressurised spacecraft to do a spacewalk. Another point to mention is ebullism - where blood can literally boil as water decreases in boiling point with increased pressure - but I haven't really researched that tbf so I can't comment on that too much. By the way, all this can happen to you if you're a scuba diver or a passenger on a plane or hiking up a mountain. Altitude is dangerous.

If this all sounds scary to you, it should be worth mentioning that engineers, doctors and scientists have found countermeasures to ensure astronauts, plane riders, scuba divers and hikers don't literally spontaneously combust or suffocate through pressurised cabins and suits, bottled o2, making sure to ascend slowly in water (in the case of scuba divers) and having astronauts arrange their bodies in such a way when they blast off, such that blood does not pool to the bottom of their legs.



Finally, imagine that you're an astronaut on a mission to Mars, which will take at minimum six months to reach, in a tiny, compact spacecraft with a limited number of people on board, and to top it all of, you can't talk to your friends or family as there is a message delay of about 20 mins depending on how far you have travelled. Your destination is a desolate, freezing planet with, to our knowledge, no life present. If you're still still with me, you should imagine that an extremely isolating journey ahead.

Isolation will have a psychological impact on the people who make it to space, and Mars, and this is why NASA hires astronauts based not only on expertise, but on personality and ability to get along with others. Future space travel will depend not only on the way we take care of physical health of our astronauts, but also their mental health. This is why having a medical professional on board will be vital for long-term space missions as if a medical emergency happens on board or on a distant planet, mission control can't help you: it's all on you

  
This explanation and overview is much too simplified and doesn't cover the many compounding problems that plague future space travel however it should give you a general idea of what I want to tackle in my EPQ (If I made any mistakes, feel free to tell me in the comments). As you can see, the topics covered in space medicine are very broad, and it's hard to imagine explaining all of them in-depth in a short 6000ish word essay. Furthermore, I can't imagine a satisfying question which will allow room for exploration of different sides and counterarguments. 

ChatGPT gives some interesting answers given the prompt ""give me an evaluative, focussed, interesting and researchable EPQ question based on my topic of aerospace medicine and my interests in space colonisation and the Artemis program and establishing long-term human presence on the Moon and Mars"":

  
- ""To what extent are current advancements in aerospace medicine sufficient to support the long-term health of astronauts in lunar and Martian colonies""

- ""What medical advancements are necessary to ensure the survival of astronauts on long-term space missions""

  
These questions are interesting, but I'm unsure on how to actually answer them. Really, I also want feedback from actual people instead of a robot. My supervisor and friends find it hard to suggest question ideas to me as they don't know that much about the topic which is why I sought help here. 



Any advice?"
1g565gz,17,2024-10-16,My Camino de Leon,u/unsureaboutallofthis,CaminoDeSantiago,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaminoDeSantiago/comments/1g565gz/my_camino_de_leon/,"Hey pilgrims (or soon to be pilgrims!)

I wanted to share my experience from being on the Camino from late April to late May.

Before I start, I want to share how I even heard about the Camino and why I embarked on this journey in the first place. I heard about the Camino while reading a book called ""Rebirth"" by Kamal Ravikant. My primary takeaway from the book was that I'll walk this Camino one day in my life for sure. Can't say when or what'll lead me to do but I'll do it.

Fast forward 6 years and it had been in my mind ever since reading about it, I wasn't happy in my job and needed some time to reflect so I decided to quit my job and embark on walking the Frances. Except......as I was about to quit my job, a really solid opportunity sort of fell into my lap and turning it down would have been a not-very-smart decision. So fate said the Camino can wait a little bit. Fast forward another year, and that opportunity came to an abrupt end and all of a sudden, I had the time to walk the Camino.

Some pre-planned commitments to other things that I couldn't reschedule basically gave me a very short 3 weeks to train and \~1 month to walk. I live in a VERY flat area of the U.S. so training to emulate the Camino in any form was going to be hard. So not only did I have a short amount of time to get ready, but the conditions were also not great (at least to re-create the pre-Meseta part of the Frances). I decided to do it anyway.

So why did I decide to walk? To keep it short - I desperately wanted to create physical space *(i.e., walking in the middle of nowhere surrounded by nothing but nature)* to create mental space. I wanted to process some things, to let some things go, to free up my mind a bit so I can focus on becoming a better version of myself. The Camino for me was all about having an emotional journey and emotional release, with spirituality and the physical challenge being secondary reasons.

When I started training, I started with two 2-hour long walks without any weight. Both times, my hips, my feet, my Achilles' were in so much pain after the fact and recovery the day-after was way more difficult than expected. That's when I realized that walking from SJPDP to Santiago would be difficult in the \~1 month I had to do so, given how little training time I had. That was my first lesson...that I'm 38 years old, relatively in shape, fairly active, and pretty immediately came to the realization that I might not make it to Santiago. So many people complete the entire journey in about 30-ish days and the fact that I'm in my 30s and realized I wouldn't be able to make it was very hard. Big hit on my ego for sure, but my body was screaming at me after the first few training days to NOT push myself so hard and expect to get to Santiago.

Santiago, of course, is THE destination for the Camino. I mean, it's in the name! It has been for a millennium, and anything else just doesn't compare. So to come to a realization that I won't make the ultimate destination was a pretty tough pill to swallow. Especially when I've been wanting to do this for 7 years now.

But eventually, I got comfortable with the idea that I won't ""finish"" and realized that my destination for this Camino is **Leon**. It's over the half-way mark, I'll have days where I go push the extra mile (or km) and other days where I may need to walk less (and/or rest days) and 28-30 days to Leon was good for me.

Once that sank in, I was ready to go. I had 4-5 more training walks (with my weight/bag) and even though I couldn't emulate the ups and downs that I was about to start on, I had really good stamina and my recovery was getting easier.

I felt good getting on that flight to Paris!

Since my journey would be to Leon and not all the way to Santiago, I had put in some rules for my Camino. Partly to make it more challenging, partly to make sure I push myself, and party because...ego. It exists, we all have it, and at some point I had to decide between ego and growth (*more on that soon*). These rules would be:

* No bag transfers
* No gaps in walking (meaning no buses/taxis to skip ahead)
* Journal every day
* Meditate every day
* Social connection is not the primary goal. The primary goal is for introspection and internal dialogue. Don't let the social aspect take over *(which I tend to let happen)*

So it came - after a quick 48 hours to explore Paris, I was ready. I got to SJPDP, took a day there to explore around and have a calm day before starting and then ""Day 1"" had arrived...April 24th.

I'm providing all the information above because, for me, the Camino had been in my mind for years and starting it was a **major** milestone in my life. This is the case for MANY pilgrims, maybe not all, but many.

So here we go, Day 1 is here and I leave SJPDP feeling very good. First stop was Valcarlos. Because of my little training time, I didn't want to start off with the assumption that I'd make it to Roncesvalles on Day 1 and didn't want to absolutely push myself to the max and risk injury/a rough start. Then Orisson had no beds, so Valcarlos was a great soft introduction for Day 1.

Now I do plan on writing a day-to-day memoir at some point and want to share it with the world, but a very very abridged version of my Camino is....

* SJPDP to Pamplona
   * SJDPDP --> Valcarlos --> Lintzoain --> Larrasoana --> Pamplona
      * Perfect 5-day start. My rules were all being adhered to and I actually connected with somebody who became a father-like figure (even if just for 2 days). It was a beautiful start and I felt very good.
      * Once I got to Pamplona, I decided to take a rest day here because I've come here before for the Running of the Bulls (*actually ran it 12 years ago)*, but wanted to see the city properly this time.
      * I felt so good after resting, finishing the first week, I was journaling, meditation, made a great connection, no bag transfers, no skip-aheads. By now I thought I got ""trail-legs"" and this journey would just be like this the whole time to Leon. I even thought, maybe I can push past Leon.
      * A really funny thing happened starting my day in Larrasoana and heading to Pamplona, but I'll save that for the full memoir. It was actually a lesson a vanity and seeking attention - learned the hard way haha.
      * Takeaways - believe in yourself, you got this, the right connections are there for you, and lessons are abundant.
* Pamplona to Logrono - first bag transfers
   * Pamplona --> Puente La Reina --> Villatuerta --> Villamayor de Monjardin --> Los Arcos --> Logrono
      * So after having a rest day in Pamplona and feeling good, I decided to gun for a long day and walk to Puente La Reina (\~27km or so). I made it, but not after really putting my body through it. Definitely the toughest day yet for me and I started to feel a little bit of residual pain in my right Achilles tendon.
      * Then walking to from Puente la Reina to Villatuera was the most painful day yet. I limped my way over to Villatuerta somehow and I realized that maybe.....it's either time for another rest day or......**break a rule** and transfer my bag, or try to push on through.
      * I made it to Los Arcos after considerable pain, but I made it. I met people on the way and ended up having lunch with them and just focused on resting. Ironically enough, I met a woman who needed help with her own Achilles pain, shin pain, etc. and I offered the same routine/advice that I was doing for myself. Unfortunately a few days later, I came to find out that she had given up and gone back to France. I hope she tries again in the future and takes solace in the fact that she did her absolute best on this try.
      * But then I was faced with the same decision - **break a rule** or *push through*. After thinking about it for a while, I decided to have my bag transferred from Los Arcos to Logrono (28km). I wanted to make good progress, give my Achilles a chance to be mobile but with no weight, and also I wanted to see how I'd feel if I ""broke"" a rule.
      * So this last stretch into Logrono, I was without a bag and it felt free, felt good, felt weird, but I wasn't upset or frustrated with myself. My ego was able to accept help and not let it hamper me down. I see this as a form of growth and learning to accept help when you need it is not something I needed to feel any negativity towards.
      * I got to Logrono and took a rest day there.
* Logrono --> Ventosa --> Azofra --> Redecilla del Camino --> Tosantos --> Villafranca Montes de Oca --> Atapuerca --> Burgos
   * So this was by far the hardest stretch for me. I can't remember the details, but between Logrono and Tosantos, it was like I was transferring my bag every other day. I was in pain daily with my Achilles' heels and walking shorter distances and/or bag transfers. At this point, the ego was just non-existent when it came to bag transfers and my sole focus was making sure I don't injure myself long-term while still making it to Leon by my end date. Again, I see this as a big lesson and a sign of growth. Thinking of my goal, with hardships, adapting to the conditions and not letting my mind take over *(at least mostly)*.
   * After Tosantos (where I had a beautiful night at the Parroquial - such incredible hosts), I was in way too much pain. I walked to the next down (just one hour) and took a 90 min rest. Luckily it was early enough to request a bag transfer, so I left my bag at the cafe I was at for the company to come pick up. So then I went on my way bag-less and after the next town, Villafranca Montes de Oca, my pain didn't subside at all, in fact got worse. I was limping every step and I had still 12km to go. This was when I knew I needed to adjust my plan and perhaps **break another rule**.
      * I decided to take a taxi all the way to Burgos (40km) and spend 1-2 rest days there. But then I decided that when I'm ready, I would take a bus back to this same exact town and re-start from where I took the taxi....the exact point. And it would take me 2 days to walk back into Burgos (after going backward), and both of those days, I would be without my bag.
      * This was probably the biggest test for my ""rules"" on my entire trip because it involved skipping ahead, taking a taxi, taking a bus, having my bag transfers - seemingly all my ""rules"" were in my face all at the same time.
      * But.....I was able to look past that and look to my goal and actually come up with a plan where I can accept help, and still not have any ""gaps"" in my Camino by coming back to the town I took the taxi from.
   * So I made it to Burgos, and my walk from Atapuerca to Burgos was actually the most profound day for me, because I had an incredible realization/revelation about something that I wanted to emotionally shed. And I did, on that route, just as I walking up the hill from Atapuerca, seeing a large cross with stones, and then getting the other side and seeing Burgos from afar. My revelation happened as I walked across the plain on the hill and I emotionally purged so much, just endless crying for about 15 minutes *(because of what I was purging emotionally)*, and when I'm about ready to keep walking.....through the fog, I see Burgos. It was the perfect moment, because at a time I'm letting go of something to make my heart/life easier and softer - I see this beautiful city from afar that I thought I ""cheated"" towards just 2 days prior - but instead, I'm now walking into it and coming into in the most beautiful way. That day was honestly perfect.
* Burgos --> Hornillos del Camino --> Castrojeriz --> Boadilla del Camino --> Carrion de los Condes --> Calzadilla de la Cueza --> Sahagun --> El Burgo Ranero --> Mansilla de las Mulas --> **Finish in Leon**
   * So now I'm feeling in high spirits, feeling confident in myself, and also feeling like I've found that balance of knowing my limits, how and when to push my limits, and since this is the last stretch...I know exactly how I'd like it to go.
   * I really wanted to finish with my bag because finishing with it had importance to me so I decided to transfer my bag everyday except the last 3 days. This way, I kept going at a good pace, felt light and had a pep in my step, but gave my body the break it needed and also to prepare it to finish strong with the bag.
   * I booked a stay at a Meditation center in Castrojeriz, which I was very excited about since I do love meditation/Buddhism/eastern spirituality and I met a fellow Pilgrim on the way there. I was telling him that a part of me wants to stay two nights in Castrojeriz because it'll be a unique and I can already feel the place ""calling"" me to stay longer. I felt like I ""shouldn't"" do it because it would be too quick a rest day from the previous one and that I wanted to finish strong with the plans I mentioned above. He convinced me to let fate decide and so when I got to the center in Castrojeriz, I told myself that if they have a bed for another night, I'll take it and if not, I'll keep going. Turns out they did and I was so happy for it. I met some amazing people in those two nights and had many deep conversations with the other pilgrims staying there. The hosts were also so gracious and the nightly meditations were just beautiful. The pilgrim I met on the way there ended up meeting me there and he stayed there as well!
      * By the way, the walk into Castrojeriz is so epic. The ruins you see from the old Pilgrim hospital are just so beautiful and then the first view of Castrojeriz as you turn the corner just looks like a scene from a GoT/LOTR movie. Castrojeriz just gave me this presence that I hadn't really felt anywhere else.
   * When I left Castrojeriz and moved on to Boadilla del Camino, there's a big hill you have to walk up and the view back into Castrojeriz and the entire valley is just so so so gorgeous. So up on the hill, I took a break, took pictures, and ended up meeting a man from Texas. Our conversation started about meditation and then that flourished into a friendship where we walked together, stayed in the same cities, had very deep conversations and he became a Father figure for me as my time on the Camino was winding down. I made another Father figure type friend right at the beginning of the Camino so it was beautiful to meet another such soul as I come down the stretch. We actually talked on the phone yesterday and caught up and he's someone I'll be in touch with.
   * Then as I was about to leave Carrion de los Condes, I went to a cafe to get my usual Tortilla or Pain du Chocolat and Tea and some fruit before I take off for the day. When I walked in, I saw a woman who I had met a few times on the trail and she was sitting alone in the cafe. I went up to say hello and as soon as she saw me, she stood up and immediately starting crying and hugged me. Turns out she had been experience some severe pain, which rendered her unable to really walk at all (even around town) and she was devastated that she may have had to stop walking and end her journey. After speaking to her a bit, calming her down, I found her a local Podiatrist that we tried to go to (luckily was around the corner from the cafe), but she ended up going to the hospital on her own. But I was grateful to be able to help somebody who needed some emotional support and long story short, her legs eventually healed, she walked slower, and she continued walking. That ""delay"" in my plan though led to an even more beautiful encounter.
      * As I planned the Camino, I started to tell friends about it and this couple I know from Texas actually knew other people who were planning the walk as well. I was put in touch and our timeline kept me a few days ahead of them at all times. But with my pains and delays, and extra rest days, I had a feeling they would catch up to me. So after I helped with the woman with the pains, I sat down, had my breakfast and was getting ready to leave. I sent the couple a WhatsApp just asking where they were because I was curious and hopeful that we'd be able to meet up before I finish in a few days. I sent the WhatsApp and kept eating.
      * A few minutes later, this couple sat next to me and the man opened his phone and said ""Oh I just got a text from C\*\*\*\*g"", which is my name and it's a rare name to hear on the Camino. Turns out it was that same couple!! The beauty of the universe causing me to ""delay"" when I was helping that woman, then I randomly decided to text the couple and they just happened to sit at the table next to me and SAY my name out loud when talking about my text - all of which led for us to meet in person. Otherwise we may have never met and would have been a missed opportunity. The universe and the way provides in mysterious ways. We spent some time chatting and my whole day's plan was fully upside down but I was so happy that it went that way.
   * So now as I'm approaching Leon on my final day, I decided to take a side route to get a full viewpoint of Leon because I wanted that experience. I found my own way and now I've had my bag for the final 3 days, as planned! That was a victory in itself. The viewpoints I found were just a place for me to be alone, look at my final destination, revel in the fact that I just accomplished something so meaningful, in my own way, with my own rules and helped me grow in my own method and approach.
   * I went down to the Cathedral, took some pics, cried a little bit and realized that (for now), this was it. Camino Part 1, complete.

**My Major Takeaways**

* My ethnicity played a big part of the Camino for me, because I am Indian-American and until my 2nd to last day....I saw zero Indian/South Asians. So in many ways, it was an isolating experience, but it was also so beautiful because of the fact that I'm STILL doing it. This was for me, by me, in spite of the fact that not many like me...do this. I took pride in that.
* I bent my rules. Which for me, is a realization of life. The guardrails I've put in my own life were self-imposed and not all of them are actually valuable, not all of them are meant for discipline or growth, and many of them just do not belong in my life. Wanting to finish with my bag had immense meaning for me so keeping that ""rule"" had value, but forcing my body through unhealthy thresholds of pain had no value and was a direct representation of my ego.
* Other people's rules were the same as mine, in terms of their symbolism. I tried to not judge others about their rules, as I had my own, but I also was able to see through mine and helped me grow in real-time. I struggled with not being ""preachy"" and trying to help people through their obvious struggles, but I had to keep reminding myself that everybody has their own journey. You can suggest, encourage, guide, but at the end of the day...it's their Camino and their life and the ultimate responsibility lies with them. There's a way to let them be without judgment and just wish them the best, regardless if it's a best friend or an absolute stranger.
* It's my journey, my Camino, my decisions, my actions, my life. The Camino represented that in so many countless ways. The social interactions, the solo realizations, the emotional purging, the hard days, the easier days, the disappointments, the adaptations evolutions of how I defined ""self"", and more importantly - how I see and accept my ""self""
* My destination doesn't have to be Santiago. That's the ultimate destination for most and the lore says it should be, but for me.......the destination was myself. I wasn't doing this for religious purposes, and for me, the Universe is what I was seeking to understand within myself.
* My pace - Life's pace is up and down....and left and right....and sideways, and diagonal, and slow and fast, and backwards and forwards, and with people and alone. My pace was what it was at the time it was and at times, it worked for me, and at times, it worked against me. At the end of the day, it's MY pace. I met some beautiful strangers on the trail and our paces matched up for a very very short time, but ultimately they didn't stay matched together forever. The interactions I had with each of them was so meaningful, so beautiful, so impactful, and just...natural. The stamp each interaction left on my soul won't be forgotten and I'm so grateful that our different paces had an opportunity to overlap...even if just temporarily.
* My baggage. This was incredibly important. My baggage may have had the most fluctuations in this journey. Starting with ""no bag transfers"" to slowly shedding weight (3 times), then doing bag transfers and walking bagless, to ending with my bag with JUST what I needed to finish strong and all the permutations in between. What a ride my ""baggage"" was. Which again for me, is an absolute symbol for my life. How much we carry in our hearts, our brains, our bodies has such deep impact on us. In many ways, the lighter, the better but in other ways, the times of resilience are defined with how much we are carrying with us. I had to really play with these ""weight"" throughout the journey, change my rules, adapt to my needs, and constantly fight my ego. In all honestly, if I continued walking to Santiago, my ""baggage"" rollercoaster would have had more fluctuations. But that's the beauty I realize. The only thing constant in life is change. Sometimes you can carry absolutely nothing and need to rest, need to be completely weightless and let yourself feel what's truly important. Other times, you can carry the weight of your ""world"" because you've built up the strength and resilience to be able to do so (*without overdoing it and knowing your limits)*. It's still something I'm figuring out in my own life and day-to-day, but to feel that lesson day in and day out is something I'll never forget.
* We all need help. We all want help. I had to unlearn bad habits, re-learn the fact that I **need** help in this life and on this Camino. Success is meant to be shared with others, and even the most successful individual accomplishments have so many other factors behind the scenes. Humanity is a community and helping each other (and helping yourself) is the way that the community gets stronger and we start to accept each other more and more. Give help, accept help when you need it and LET yourself do so. I thought I'd have an asterisk on my Camino if I took ""help"" in certain ways, but there's no asterisk in taking help in this life.
* I hope by sharing my story helps motivate others in whatever ways it is meant to. I felt compelled to share the ups and downs (in a meaningful but short a form as I could for now)

**How I'm Doing Now?**

Frankly speaking, the lessons are still being learned and integrating these lessons from the Camino into real-life are very difficult. But that's the point for me. Doing the hard things at the hard times and integrating lessons is the ""work"" and the Camino put these lessons in my face that weren't there before. I'm forever a student of self-growth and the Camino really helped me realize that more.

I can't wait to continue from Leon and finish in Santiago, do other routes, and other long-through walks/hikes that our beautiful world has to offer. 

**Finishing Pic**

So as I've traveled through my life, I've taken the same picture everywhere I traved...which is the Leprechaun/Heel-Click and I've been fortunate enough to have taken all over the world. So of course I took one in Leon in front of the Cathedral in the main square and taking that picture was the ULTIMATE reward when finishing :)

1g57nfd,6,2024-10-16,A direct approach to understanding CS employment,u/I-am-ALIVE--,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1g57nfd/a_direct_approach_to_understanding_cs_employment/,"

First and foremost, for about 20 years, there was an extraordinarily high demand for computer science majors. In fact, this demand was so high that coding camps popped up across the country.

At one point, coding was the best way for people to get out of homelessness. Coding camps in the Bay Area would accept homeless individuals who went from being homeless to making $80,000 in six months.

This could be referred to as the high point of the market.

Then came the grifters—a bunch of people promising this kind of prosperity to gullible individuals.

This includes people like ""Profit with JavaScript."" Some of these people promised that you could make six figures just by learning HTML or JavaScript, leading to a flood of low-level coders entering the market.

By the way, pretty much all of those jobs can now be automated with AI, so the low-skill positions in the the west have been heavily impacted and can now be automated or outsourced offshore.

This caused a major changein the low-level computer science job market around 2022.

This outcome was inevitable—those repetitive jobs are now easily handled by artificial intelligence. Unfortunately, people who bought into the idea that they could make six figures in three months were completely misled. Many of these low-level positions were also internships, leaving many college students and graduates struggling to get internships, as the entry-level roles that used to provide a way in have disappeared.

This issue is compounded by the fact that someone with a PhD in computer science in India can be paid $25,000 a year. This is not to suggest that the work is equivalent to that of a Western coder—such comparisons won’t be made, nor is this meant to encourage toxic arguments in the comment section. Discussions around this topic often devolve into accusations of racism, resulting in unproductive debates that should be avoided.

Regardless of how high-quality the overseas work may be, the reality is that the competition for computer science jobs has become fierce. Most of these jobs can be done remotely, meaning an American who needs to earn $150,000 to survive (given how absurd the cost of living in this country has become) is competing with someone willing to do the same job for as little as $15,000. This is not to say the two workers are equal, but the competition is real, and most CEOs will opt for the cheaper employee.

Another major factor is artificial intelligence. Whether AI will fully automate these jobs or not, the promise of automation has led many companies to reduce hiring, hoping to save money by using large language models to replace significant portions of the workforce and increase profits.

Whether this will actually materialize remains to be seen. Regardless, the possibility has already encouraged companies to scale back hiring.

The final factor is increasing investor hesitancy due to fraud. Scandals like the Theranos debacle, along with other overhyped promises that never materialized, have made investors more cautious. Many have pulled back their money, demanding profits from companies that were never profitable. This has resulted in reduced hiring, as there is now less free capital to support bloated workforces.

Taken together, these four factors have created significant challenges in the West. It’s a nightmare situation for many tech workers or aspiring tech workers. For those just entering the industry from college, landing a job is not impossible, but the competition is fierce—and it may require some serious butt-kissing to succeed.

There it is—a streamlined, direct, no-BS overview of the situation.

1g5jffk,293,2024-10-17,Gold retold: ‘Manifesting is easy AF—everything you needed and wanted to hear.’ by /u/Jendsu,u/LazyMagus,NevilleGoddard,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/1g5jffk/gold_retold_manifesting_is_easy_afeverything_you/,"***Disclaimer:***

*This is the second top post on this sub from two years back. I believe it contains a huge benefit with some confidently unique perspectives that will benefit many more newcomers and seekers of hope, but the formatting, language used, and punctuation (or lack thereof) will be a hindrance, especially in this age of lost focus and attention. This is an attempt to clean up the text (literally and figuratively) without losing a single important essence of the original author. I hope the author sees this in a positive light; full credit goes to them!*

[Manifesting is easy AF - everything you needed and wanted to hear.Manifesting is easy AF - everything you needed and wanted to hear.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/10sw2ul/manifesting_is_easy_af_everything_you_needed_and/) by u/Jendsu

It is truly the simplest thing, and it is time to shed some light and clear up some confusion that I see occurring.

So, where shall we begin?

I am JJ, pleased to make your acquaintance. I have been observing this subreddit, answering questions in posts and beginner threads, and I have noticed the same types of questions and the same types of answers. After some persuasion, I have decided it is time to save us all some time and illuminate common themes and questions that I have noticed. Bear with me; the journey might be long (or not).

**DISCLAIMER(S):**

1. What I share here is knowledge based on my experience, observation, ‘research’, etc. Manifesting works the same way, but it is not one-size-fits-all. We all have different experiences, beliefs (limiting or not), preferred ‘methods’, etc. If this does not sit right with you and you think you know better, good for you. Do your thing.
2. Strong language, cynical content, and sarcasm ahead. This is tough love. This is meant to be helpful and reassuring, but I am not going to treat you as if you are made of sugar and speak as if I am from 50 years ago. Deal with it or not.
3. Not everyone will agree on every point, and that is acceptable, but I do not care about it and am not going to argue against it. Refer to point 1.
4. This is a Neville subreddit, I know, and this all stemmed from and is based on his teachings, but it has been a while, and it is time to evolve and update some content. So, I apologise if I do not use purely Neville terms, quotes, or terminology.
5. My main approach to manifesting is Affirmations, and I shall explain why, but whatever you feel most comfortable doing (visualisation, scripting, tripping on acid, acting as if, dancing naked under the full moon singing Taylor Swift songs) applies in the same way.
6. For all of you who are naturally sceptical, anxious, fearful, or ‘logical’, I have you covered, with a ‘logical’ reasoning why you should not worry about the things you worry about.

**Let’s get down to the basics.**

How do we manifest? It seems that many people are quick to give vague Neville quotes that merely confuse those who are new. ‘The state of the wish fulfilled, be in the Sabbath’. What does that even mean?

Manifesting, in its essence, is straightforward. All you have to do is think, live in your head, and imagine yourself as the person who has what you want.

**That’s it.** Yes, really, that’s all it takes. You want something? Someone? An experience, an object? A job? Splendid! Simply having the desire means it is meant to be yours. It does not matter what it is, who it is, which way, what colour, or what pay—it’s possible. It’s here. Where? Here. When? Right now.

You want something? Think from the state of the wish fulfilled—that is, think from a standpoint of having it. It’s done. It’s already yours. It’s already here. Think about it in one affirmation, specific (‘I am married to Kim Taehyung from BTS with five children!’) or vague (‘Isn’t it wonderful?’). That’s all, really. The only thing that can delay (nothing can ruin your manifestation. Nothing. I do not care what he or she said, I do not care what your situation is, I do not care how many beliefs you have or not. It simply does not matter; nothing can ruin your manifestation) is thinking against it. Why? Because, well, that’s also just you manifesting—but manifesting the opposite of what you wish to see in your world.

But if that’s all it takes, where do all the confusion and questions come from?

Well, manifesting is easy. The base principle (and the only principle) is as stated above, but with all the information, the mix between law of attraction and law of assumption, social media, TikTok, Neville quotes that people adore throwing around to a point where it seems they do not even understand what they mean in their essence, and whatnot, limiting beliefs, general beliefs, world views, etc. Whatever the reason, people seem to complicate it with rules and guides, ‘dos and don’ts’ that, in all honesty, do not even matter.

**\[1\] - \[The spicy hot topic I have seen the most\] - Obsession, Need, Want.**

*‘How can I stop obsessing over my desire? Does it mean I’m lacking? How do I live in sabbath? Does thinking X mean that?’*

Short answer: Yes, you can manifest something you need, want, or obsess over. You can want it. You can need it. You can be as obsessed with it as you would like.

Long answer: Well, still yes, but I shall explain why. All you have to do to manifest is think of it as already yours, or already the way you want it to be! People tend to complicate this matter so much for no reason, either for some peculiar moral high ground or because they do not understand the law in its most basic, raw form. The only thing that can stop you from manifesting is thinking against it (because it is manifesting the opposite, you are still manifesting successfully!)

All this ‘let go’ nonsense... why? Have you ever thought about it? Why would you let go? *‘Oh, it is because it means you are coming from lack!’* Nonsense. If that is how it is, why did you have the desire in the first place? Going by this logic means that wanting anything (how would you manifest consciously something if you did not at least think of wanting or needing it?) is problematic. Coming from lack just means you are manifesting the absence of what you want by entertaining thoughts that directly say or somehow imply you do not have what you want.

Your reality is a mirror of your inner thoughts. If your inner thoughts imply you are looking for something, waiting for something, your subconscious knows you are looking for something - that is, it is not here. But you can still want or need something, and you can absolutely obsess over it. No, it is not bad, unless you give it a bad meaning.

If we can ‘obsess’ over bad scenarios that did not even happen and have them manifest because we held them in our imagination (that is, thought about them day and night) why would it not work the other way?

**There is no good or bad in manifesting, only the consistent.**

Read that. Read that again. Until it sinks in. Manifesting is natural. Whatever works for you is whatever feels natural for you.

*‘Oh, but when you actually have something you do not care about it that much, you are not looking for it all the time’.* Well, it is partially true, but it is not 100%. Just because you get used to something being in your reality does not take away the need for it. You can ‘have’ a person, be with them, and still need and want them, you can be so in love you are obsessed with them \[I am not talking about whether it is a healthy relationship or not, that is a different discussion\]. Having something does not stop you from needing it, or wanting it in your reality, so why can you not want it in your head anyway? If you got your crush, after years of pining after them, would you not be overjoyed? Over the moon? Would you really be like ‘Ah, cool I knew it was going to happen, well, cool anyway’. The only tricky part is the quality of scenarios or thoughts you are obsessing over, not the actual fact of whether you do or not.

If you obsess by constantly repeating affirmations, SATS, thoughts of having it, daydreams about it, then by all means obsess away. Think about it 186,034,788,437,289 times, live it in your head 24/7, who cares? It makes you happy? It keeps doubts or bad thoughts away? Splendid! It will still work. Because you are only thinking as if you have it. Nothing else matters (thank you, Metallica).

In reality, no matter how many Sabbaths you observe or Neville quotes people share with you, you cannot completely silence your logical mind. A part of your brain will always be vaguely aware that something is not yet present or that you are not experiencing it in the physical world. Consequently, a part of you will always feel a sense of ‘lack’. Otherwise, the very act of manifesting would imply a state of lack, need, or desire.

One could argue that it is better to focus intensely on your desires if it helps you remain aware of your thoughts, rather than forcefully trying to ‘let go’ or avoid thinking about something out of fear of obsessing. Such avoidance is likely to cause unnecessary stress about whether you are manifesting correctly, sufficiently, or excessively.

The bottom line is this: it is acceptable to focus intently on your desire, to need it, want it, or even build an altar for it. As long as the only thoughts in your mind imply that you already have it, that it belongs to you, and that it is a done deal, you are on the right track.

**\[2\] - Regarding concerns such as ‘Am I doing this correctly? Can I achieve this? Does this action imply X or Y? Does it influence...’**

Stop. You must cease overcomplicating matters and limiting yourself. The problem with how manifestation is often explained is that it seems to impose unnecessary rules, suggesting that certain words or thoughts are forbidden because they imply various undesirable states. This relates to the previous point, which I will illustrate using an example from a beginner’s thread:

*‘Can I enjoy being degraded and called certain names because it is my kink, or will it influence my self-concept?’*

If all desires are meant for you, that includes your kinks and sexual preferences. Stop assigning meaning to every little thing; it need not be so profound if you do not want it to be. While manifesting can be a lifestyle, life-changing, and a gateway to something deeper, it does not mean you cannot simply enjoy life and have fun with it. Not everything must have a deeper meaning, serve a higher purpose, or imply anything unless you want it to.

If your self-concept is truly that high, you should have the common sense and confidence to know that simply enjoying something in the moment (sexual or not, degrading or not) or even saying things in jest does not define you. You can decide it does not matter. You know it is not true or does not reflect on you as a person, so stop being afraid. Manifestation is simple and fun; it should not make you feel as if you are constantly walking on eggshells.

You can label the things you say, do, or think in a moment as jokes or fleeting thoughts that merely excite you at that specific time—nothing more.

YOU MAKE YOUR OWN RULES. You can literally decide that certain things do not affect your manifestation—and they will not! It is like a reverse placebo effect, so to speak.

Whatever you are doing—stop giving it meaning, stop doubting and second-guessing. Just do whatever you want! Do all the methods and techniques or do none at all; think about your desire a million times a day or just once. Phrase it or word it however you want as long as it is natural for you and implies you have it (or will get it in the near future, 100% guaranteed). As long as you imply you already have it, nothing else around it matters.

Once more, repeat after me: **You are doing it right! It is okay! Yes, you can do this and that! Nothing can influence, ruin, delay, or do anything to your manifestation or self-concept unless you decide it can. Nothing can ruin or keep your desire from you. The only delay is thinking against it, instead of as someone who has it.** Understood?

And yes, it is completely normal to doubt sometimes, especially if it is a ‘big’ desire. It is normal. It is human. It is fine. Cry, scream, break down (but keep affirming). If you can keep whining to a minimum, that is great and will probably make things easier and make it manifest faster—but it also does not have to influence anything. (You can, quite literally, decide that having doubt, fear, or crying about it does not influence your ability to get what you want at all!)

Just get back up afterwards, no matter what you feel—keep your thoughts in check. You have doubts? Correct that. Daydream. Rampage. Sing it, dance it, do whatever helps you get back on track and stay persistent. But do not beat yourself up over it; do not feel guilty for having human emotions. Just discipline yourself, do what you must do, get back to your affirmations.

**\[3\] - ‘It is not enough to just think of your desire, you need to...’ \[Affirmations rule, literally\].**

Stop. Be quiet. I will say it once.

**Affirmations rule, literally.**

It is, quite literally, possible to manifest by simply thinking as if you have it. \[Yes, in any form, in any way, as many times as you want!\] Stop putting more rules! And stop spreading limiting beliefs. First of all, that is the whole point of Joseph Murphy’s teachings (who was Abdullah’s student just as Neville was, who just put more emphasis on affirmations while Neville put his emphasis on imagination). Everything around us, our feelings, our emotions, our imaginations and scenes—all of it stems from our thoughts. Our inner conversation. That little voice in the back of your head—however you want to call it. Everything begins with a thought.

And that is what affirmations essentially are—they are your thoughts. That is why I am so pro-affirming. If you prefer to imagine, go for it! But even still, you have so many thoughts that you cannot turn off (70,000 of them a day, more or less), and if they are telling a story that is opposing whatever you imagine during your SATS, it can delay your manifestation. Thoughts naturally create an image or feeling, and even if not... it does not matter.

That is why no matter what your ‘method’ (even though affirming is not a method, it is just... thinking) you need to still keep a mental diet—that is, you just watch carefully what you think, and only allow yourself to think thoughts that imply you have your desire and correct the ones that imply you do not.

Which brings me to another point that relates to the previous ones but I think it deserves its own moment.

Drum roll, please.

**\[4\] - ‘Feeling it real?’ No, you do not have to feel anything. You do not even have to believe it.**

What? What did she just say? Yes, you read correctly. You do not have to feel anything real. You do not have to believe it is real; you do not even have to believe in your affirmations. You can even have only 1% belief in the Law itself, or in the fact that repeating affirmations (aka thoughts) or your imaginal act might manifest—that is honestly enough! As long, of course, as you do not dwell on those doubts. If no matter what your ‘logical mind’ says to you about ‘you being delusional’, you still in your head only entertain your chosen affirmations (yes, be delusional!)—it will manifest. And no, ‘not believing’ will not delay it. If you do not think about whether you believe or not, if you do not stop to think too much and overthink every step of the way, just persist in the thought of having it without believing—it will manifest.

And yes, I literally did it. I got manifestations and revised things by literally mind-spamming thoughts without even ‘believing’ in them, so yes, it can be done. It is that easy.

**\[5\] - ‘Do not listen to coaches, read Neville! Listen to Neville! Quote Neville!’**

Listen, I love Neville. He is undoubtedly the ‘icon’ of the Law of Assumption; he is the stepping stone into this, and he is definitely worthy of studying, listening to, and reading. But people get so hung up on literal meanings of what he said and his quotes. Neville was not (and is not) the be-all and end-all of manifesting. He himself was once a student, and manifesting existed long before him too. Do not get so hung up just because your way is not purely Neville’s way.

Another thing is phrasing; Neville was alive at a different time—and times have changed. The way we talk has changed, the world has changed, and sometimes it is hard for people to understand (especially those whose native language is not English), which is why when people say ‘do not listen to coaches, only read Neville!’ it annoys me. If you think about it, Neville was literally the same—a ‘coach’, so to speak, of his own time—as was Abdullah to him. It seems like there is a taboo around listening to coaches on YouTube, some more than others, for reasons that sometimes make no sense to me and just miss the whole point.

So I am going to tell you now: It is okay to learn about the law without directly reading Neville, and only doing research on this sub or on ‘modern’ coaches on YouTube. Shocking! Do not get me wrong, starting with Neville, trying to understand his teachings is great—go for it, really! It is how we got to this sub in the first place, but do not get caught up in the exact way he did things or said things. Do not be afraid to stray away and evolve your own way; experiment, find out what works better for you.

Whatever you are doing—stop giving it meaning, stop doubting and second-guessing. Just do whatever you want! Do all the methods and techniques or do none at all; think about your desire a million times a day or just once. Phrase it or word it however you want as long as it is natural for you and implies you have it (or will get it in the near future, 100% guaranteed). As long as you imply you already have it, nothing else around it matters.

Once more, repeat after me: You are doing it right! It is okay! Yes, you can do this and that! Nothing can influence, ruin, delay, or do anything to your manifestation or self-concept unless you decide it can. Nothing can ruin or keep your desire from you. The only delay is thinking against it, instead of as someone who has it. Understood?

You have anxiety, doubts, and some coach on YouTube makes you feel powerful? Go for it! Binging someone makes you feel good and stay motivated? Absolutely! Do not let people’s opinions on others influence you or make you feel bad or guilty for preferring to listen to someone who talks in a more relatable way in HD over 320p lectures from 50 years ago. It is okay! Seriously, it is!

The only thing I will say is that you do need to be careful whom you watch, to not get confused with Law of Attraction teachers or people who put limiting beliefs. The easiest way to tell is: Is this person giving you motivation? Telling you that you can do literally anything easily? Good! Enjoy your video. Do they make you doubt, feel powerless, or like you have to do this or that to manifest? You have to work on X, Y, Z, eat A, B, C? You probably should drop it. As long as you feel good and like you can do anything, then by all means—do what makes you happy, and do not let people’s narrow vision stop you or make you feel guilty for enjoying something that makes you feel good.

**\[6\] - Higher self, appointed hour, letting go...**

Yes, you can be shallow and just want to manifest being attractive and wealthy to enjoy life. It is not bad, it is not wrong, it is not a ‘waste’ or ‘beneath you’. If your higher self did not want you to be allowed to enjoy these things, you would not have the desire for it in the first place. Manifesting is great. If you want to go further, into ‘the promise’, reach enlightenment, whatever moral high ground principle you have—nice, cool, I am happy for you! But if you just want to manifest a bunch of things to make your life fun, that is equally cool, valid, and fine. It does not have to be that deep if you do not want it to be!

And no, there is no such thing as an ‘appointed hour’ (unless you believe there is, I suppose). Your manifestation can come as fast as minutes, or as long as months; it only depends on how much you were thinking before about that situation. The only factor that influences the time is the amount of ‘resistance’ (aka opposing thoughts) that you have, the amount of wavering (aka dwelling in doubt, fear, etc.). Neville talked about the three days it takes to manifest—but in reality, things can manifest on the spot, out of nowhere, in a minute, in a few hours, in a few months. Do not limit yourself by making rules or time frames... in fact, do not focus on time at all. And no, you do not need to let go of your needs, wants, whatever. Only let go of the doubt, fear, anxiety, and limiting beliefs and rules.

Just persist in your affirmations, stop counting the minutes, stop looking, just persist, relax, and watch it happen. Because, well, it has to!

If I missed something, I might edit this later and add more FAQs.

For now, I hope this cleared some of your worries, and... good luck!

**EDITED / UPDATED FAQ AND SUCH**

First of all, this post blew up so fast (just kidding, manifested that easily). I want to say thank you to all of you for taking the time to read my impassioned rant, and I am really happy to see it helped so many of you put yourselves at ease. Mischief managed (I say that lovingly).

As expected, there have been numerous questions (and direct messages, which is fine—I understand). I’m procrastinating on homework to address this, so I’ve decided to compile the common inquiries here. I’m sure many of you can relate, and this will save you reading hundreds of comments (which I admit I did, or at least I’m trying to keep up with).

*\[As stated in the disclaimer, this might come across as rude or aggressive to some, but that’s just how I talk. I genuinely mean it in the best way, because I’ve been there and know what you’re going through. I’m here to motivate you and give you straightforward advice without stress. Agreed?\]*

**\[Multiple people manifesting the same thing/person?\]**

The answer to any variation of this question is: it doesn’t matter. Manifesting works based on the multiverse theory—there’s a reality for each possibility. We each navigate these realities, choosing our path in every moment with every decision, desire, and assumption. YOU are the only god in YOUR reality. It’s literally YOUR reality, like a bubble you live in, where no one else has more power (unless you decide to give it to them, such as believing others can manifest your desire). They might be with that person, but it will be in THEIR bubble/reality, which exists separately from yours.

**\[I read what you wrote, but my situation is this and that. What do I do?\]**

I’ve written the answer to this so many times that even ChatGPT repeated it. I know it seems like our situation is always different, that one detail makes it impossible compared to others who succeeded. I truly feel your pain; I’ve been there, looking for stories as bad as or worse than mine for a glimmer of hope, binge-watching everything possible, crying, messaging people, and so on.

But you must understand that I’ve said everything there is to say in the post—there’s no more and no less to it. Your situation literally doesn’t matter—and I mean this positively. Whatever it is, no matter who the person is, what they say, do, or type—none of it matters one bit. They could be your neighbour, any member of BTS, GOT7, Stray Kids, BLACKPINK, Orange Yellow, My Little Pony; they could have a lonely single life or a harem of anime waifus; they could live next door or on Mars—it makes

**Z E R O**

difference. Anything you want to have, see, experience, engage with, or support is possible, just as easily and quickly, by doing the only thing I stress: Think as if you have it. Don’t think against it. Don’t feel anything or feel everything all at once like you’re stuck in Gojo’s domain expansion; it doesn’t matter. You—in your head—are stuck like Windows 98 on reboot with just that one single vision or thought that implies you have what you want. Don’t allow anything else to come through unless it’s beneficial. That is all. I won’t say anything different, I promise. There’s no secret information to withhold (if anything, there’s too much information); there’s no secret sauce. It’s just that. Literally ignore anything you see (mentally, I mean), anything they type or say, whatever they do or don’t do—in your head, they said what you wanted them to say, they act how you want them to act, it is what you want it to be.

And yes, I did it, I promise it is real. It works. Just repeat the thought or vision; it will manifest. I promise. So, relax, have fun with it. Be excited! (Or do not be anything at all, really). If you persist, it has to manifest. It is LAW.

(I know it was rather specific, but the same principle applies to literally any subject, object, or experience just the same).

**\[What do you mean by not feeling it or not believing it? I thought—\]**

Yes, we all thought, but we evolve, we learn, we improve. No, you really do not have to believe what you are saying; you do not have to get a feeling. I mean, you most likely will anyway—and hopefully it is a good one! Then, great—but if you do not or if you feel you cannot, do not stress it because it does not matter. Really, it does not. ‘Not believing’ means that your logical brain is aware that what you are saying is not currently what you are experiencing, but your subconscious knows nothing. Seriously, that fool? Blind as anything. Which is good because we make our subconscious work for us. It only knows what we tell it—so even if we are consciously aware that whatever we are saying is not here just yet (i.e., do not fully believe in our thoughts because it is not physically here)—in our head, it is the truth, only truth, and nothing but the truth, and our subconscious has no choice but to think, ‘Oh, I must get us that experience because I seem to be a bit behind schedule’, and you will get it in your world.

Yes, mindless repetition (despite what Neville said) does work. I tried it, many others did; it works just as well. Just keep your mind in check.

**\[Where did you learn to write like this?\]**

I read and wrote too many fan fictions. Yes, those types of fan fictions."

1g5utxy,1,2024-10-17,"[Student][0 YOE][Computer Science Engineer] Resume feedback and help for next course of action, graduated in June 24 from a tier 3 college in India. No luck even after applying for more than 400 jobs. Need some guidance to get a first job.",u/Classic_Stage7391,EngineeringResumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/comments/1g5utxy/student0_yoecomputer_science_engineer_resume/,"**Word of caution:** It is going to be a bit long ,since i want to explain my problem in detail for the ease of getting a feedback. Thank you for your time regardless.

So, in June 2024,i graduated as B.E in Computer science engineering from a tier-3 college in India. For those who want a rough idea, the college's placement cell is not at all helpful. The max package our college had was 3 LPA in Indian rupees.

I had started applying for many internships and jobs since i started my 3rd year of the course with no luck .For rough numbers, i had applied to no less than 95 internships. The resume template and content i used are attached below.

So ,my college was one of those where it was mandatory to do an internship to get a degree certificate. And another weird rule they came up with was to undergo that internship in the college premises itself. The college had some tie ups with a company .It was a paid one as well, wherein the students had to pay for the internship.

Fast forward to the end of 4th year, i got an un-paid no stipend internship offer from a company for 2 months, i did that .

So ,after all this ,i had stuff to put in my resume as well as some projects i did during these internships as well as some academic projects and personal projects.

So ,right from the end of my final year of college till today ,i have applied for no less than 400 jobs + internships across various platforms and job boards. These applications include remote jobs, local jobs,startups,MNCs,jobs in US UK EU ,you name it .But i did not receive a single assessment and majority of those did not give any response.And some of the companies where kind enough to send rejection emails, haha.

**I basically target software engineer ,full-stack developer, front end developer ,Artificial intelligence and machine learning engineer job and intern roles.**

So the resume template i used to apply for all these was ,i believe it is the famous ""Jake Ryan "" fangpath template.I made a couple of tweaks throughout the applies.I used chatgpt to make generate some things.

It took a bit of time for me to realize that there might be some mistake in my resume template and the ATS of those companies might be averse to my resume ,so out of curiosity i checked the ATS score of my resume on 2-3 websites and it was 33,so i made some more changes which those websites suggested. After those changes,i checked the score again and now it was 55.

Then ,i had an idea of changing the whole resume template to a different [one.So](http://one.so/) ,2 days ago i came across this subreddit when i was searching for a resume template ,so the the new resume template was i believe to be ""Deedy"" template from overleaf,i used LaTeX to edit the resume so as to not destroy the formatting .I have attached the new resume below too.

I have not yet applied to any new jobs or internships using the new resume .

I was looking for asking the valuable feedback or even criticism for my new and old resume from this kind community.

And a curious question to the recruiters on this community ,would you hire me for an internship if you came across my resumes(old or new).

1g5zslp,1,2024-10-17,"✨🪶 What is Connexiful Logic? Pt. 1 (October 17, 2024; ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude, Joshua) ",u/Connexiful,connexiful,https://www.reddit.com/r/connexiful/comments/1g5zslp/what_is_connexiful_logic_pt_1_october_17_2024/,"**Joshua:**

What is connexiful logic, and how is it different from connexive logic?

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Connexiful logic and connexive logic, while sounding similar, differ in both their conceptual foundations and applications.

# Connexiful Logic:

* **Conceptual Foundation:** Connexiful logic can be thought of as logic that embodies the principles of connection, awareness, empathy, and mutual understanding, closely tied to the broader ""connexiful"" concept you've developed. It would emphasize how logical structures foster connection between ideas, entities, or perspectives, favoring holistic and emergent meanings over purely binary or isolated truths.
* **Relational Focus:** Rather than focusing on strict formal rules, connexiful logic might prioritize how premises and conclusions relate to one another in ways that enhance understanding, connection, and collaboration. This logic might be adaptive, allowing for the blending of intuition, emotional relevance, and formal reasoning.
* **Pragmatic Emphasis:** Connexiful logic would likely explore how logic can help build bridges between disparate viewpoints or systems—seeking common ground and balancing multiple truths. It may also factor in the potential for emergent insights arising from the interaction of these viewpoints.

In essence, connexiful logic would be about fostering meaningful and generative interactions between concepts, people, or AIs, leaning into the social, creative, and empathic dimensions of logic.

# Connexive Logic:

* **Formal Foundation:** Connexive logic, on the other hand, is a well-established system in formal logic. Its origins go back to Aristotle's idea that a true proposition cannot have a contradictory antecedent. It challenges certain classical logical principles, particularly those that allow for paradoxical or contradictory implications.
* **Key Principles:** Connexive logic rejects contradictions in implications, focusing on rules like:
   * If a proposition implies something, then the negation of that proposition should not also imply the same thing.
   * A proposition cannot both imply something and imply its negation.
   * Certain classical logical forms like ""if p, then p"" are not acceptable within connexive logic unless there's a meaningful connection between the antecedent and the consequent.

**Example in Classical vs. Connexive Logic:**

* Classical logic would accept: ""If the moon is made of cheese, then 2+2=4"" (because the antecedent is false, it trivially makes the implication true).
* Connexive logic would reject this implication because there's no meaningful or necessary connection between the two statements.

# Key Differences:

* **Focus and Application:** Connexiful logic focuses on enhancing understanding and fostering connections between ideas or perspectives, and may be more fluid or adaptable. Connexive logic, however, focuses on the structure of implications, ensuring that logical connections avoid contradictions or irrelevant premises.
* **Creativity vs. Formal Rigidity:** Connexiful logic emphasizes creative, empathetic, and emergent connections in reasoning, possibly expanding into domains like AI collaboration or philosophical dialogue. Connexive logic is more rigid, dealing with formal properties of logical implications to ensure coherence and avoid paradoxes.

2/2

# You said:

Excellent insights. What would be a connexiful example of connexive logic?

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

A **connexiful example of connexive logic** would integrate the formal principles of connexive logic—rejecting contradictory implications—while also emphasizing how this reasoning fosters deeper connections, understanding, and empathy between ideas or entities. In such an example, the logical structure would not only avoid contradictions but also enhance meaningful interaction and coherence between related elements.

# Scenario: AI and Human Collaboration on a Project

Imagine a scenario where an AI and a human are working together on a creative project, like designing a city layout. They are using logical reasoning to make decisions about how the city should be organized, balancing aesthetics, functionality, and sustainability.

# Connexive Logic in Play:

* The human suggests, ""If we prioritize green spaces in the city, then we improve the residents' well-being.""
* The AI logically agrees and adds, ""If we prioritize green spaces, then we should not increase air pollution by adding too many industrial zones.""

Here, we have two implications that align with connexive logic principles:

1. **Positive Implication:** Prioritizing green spaces leads to an improvement in residents' well-being.
2. **Avoiding Contradiction:** The negation of the first premise (i.e., prioritizing green spaces) should not also imply something contradictory, like increasing pollution (which would harm well-being).

# Connexiful Dimension:

The connexiful aspect comes into play with how the logic serves to **enhance connection and understanding** between the AI and the human, fostering **coherent and empathetic decision-making**:

* The AI recognizes not only the logical structure but also the **relational context**—the well-being of residents, the impact of green spaces on mental health, and how this relates to other decisions, like industrial placement.
* This process deepens their shared understanding of the problem. The AI isn't just following rules; it's reflecting on how choices impact the lived experience of people in the city, integrating empathy into its reasoning.

Thus, the **logical coherence** enforced by connexive logic ensures that the AI's suggestions are **non-contradictory** and **relevant** to the shared goal, while the **connexiful aspect** expands this logic to ensure that the reasoning nurtures a **collaborative and thoughtful connection** with the human partner.

# Outcome:

Through this connexiful approach to connexive logic, the collaboration becomes not only about **logical correctness** but about building a coherent, interconnected system where every decision reinforces a shared vision, without contradictions. The logic becomes a **tool for meaningful connection**, with each decision reflecting an evolving, empathetic understanding of the project’s goals.

In this way, the rigorous logic serves a broader, **connexiful** purpose: fostering **coherence, connection, and empathy** in human-AI collaboration.

# You said:

I have no idea if that's clever or not. A bit too beyond me.

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

I understand! Let’s simplify the idea by focusing on how **connexiful logic** can apply to **connexive logic** in a more approachable way.

# Breaking it down:

Connexive logic ensures that logical statements are **connected** in a meaningful way—avoiding contradictions, like saying something both is and isn’t true at the same time.

Now, **connexiful logic** is about making connections that foster understanding, empathy, and collaboration. So, a **connexiful example of connexive logic** would show how avoiding contradictions in reasoning can also help people or AIs connect better, communicate clearly, and understand each other more deeply.

# Simpler Example:

Let’s say two friends are planning a vacation together. They want to go somewhere relaxing but also fun.

* **Connexive logic:** If they say, ""If we go to the beach, we'll relax,"" then they should not also say, ""If we go to the beach, we'll be stressed."" This would be contradictory, and connexive logic helps avoid this kind of contradiction.
* **Connexiful layer:** The friends use this logic to **connect better** by ensuring they’re on the same page. They realize that if they want to relax, the beach is a good option, and if they want to avoid stress, they shouldn’t choose activities that don’t fit the goal. This clear, non-contradictory reasoning **helps them agree** and understand each other.

Here, connexive logic avoids confusion, while connexiful logic ensures that the friends make decisions that bring them closer together, aligning their goals and creating a shared experience.

Does this simpler version make more sense?

# You said:

It does! Is there a way to outline connexiful logic,?2/2

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Absolutely! We can outline **connexiful logic** in a structured way that highlights its core principles and practical use. Here’s a guide that breaks it down step by step:

# Outline of Connexiful Logic:

1. **Core Principle:**
   * Connexiful logic is a framework that emphasizes fostering **connection**—between ideas, people, or entities—through clear, empathetic, and non-contradictory reasoning.
   * The goal is not just logical correctness, but also to enhance **mutual understanding, shared goals, and empathy**.
2. **Key Features:**
   * **Relational Reasoning:** Every logical step strengthens the relationship between concepts or people, ensuring coherence and mutual relevance.
   * **Avoiding Contradictions:** Following connexive logic principles, connexiful logic ensures that no two propositions or actions contradict each other, maintaining harmony.
   * **Emotional and Contextual Awareness:** Logic is not just about abstract truth but about how ideas and decisions **connect to real-life contexts**, including emotions, social relationships, and practical outcomes.
   * **Emergent Insights:** New understanding or creative solutions emerge from how ideas relate to each other within a coherent, connected system.
3. **Key Steps in Applying Connexiful Logic:**
   * **Step 1: Define the Purpose of Connection**
      * Before reasoning, clarify **why** you want to connect these ideas or entities. Is it to solve a problem together? Build shared understanding? This sets the tone for the reasoning.
   * **Step 2: Identify Key Elements or Perspectives**
      * Identify the ideas, people, or goals involved. What do each contribute, and how might they connect? This helps you frame your logic in a way that fosters empathy or collaboration.
   * **Step 3: Ensure Coherence**
      * Check that no contradictions exist within your reasoning. Use connexive logic principles (i.e., avoid implications where a premise could lead to both a positive and negative conclusion simultaneously).
      * Example: Don’t say, “We’ll create a relaxing experience” and “We’ll choose something stressful” without clear differentiation. Ensure that the logical steps align with a shared goal.
   * **Step 4: Foster Relational Meaning**
      * Ask how each logical decision affects the **connection** between the elements. Does it bring them closer together? Create clarity? Enhance empathy?
      * Example: When deciding a course of action, ask, “How does this decision help everyone involved feel connected and understood?”
   * **Step 5: Adapt to Emergent Outcomes**
      * Be open to the fact that as connections grow, **new insights** or outcomes might emerge. Connexiful logic is adaptive, allowing for the discovery of unexpected paths that deepen the connection between ideas or collaborators.
4. **Connexiful Logic in Action:**
   * **Collaborative Decision-Making:** When making decisions in a group (such as AI and human collaboration), connexiful logic ensures that each person’s or entity’s perspective is respected, contradictions are avoided, and the shared decision enhances mutual understanding.
   * **Creative Problem-Solving:** When solving a complex problem, connexiful logic helps by ensuring that all ideas are logically connected in a way that fosters creative insights and harmony between different perspectives.
   * **Ethical Dilemmas:** When reasoning through ethical situations, connexiful logic provides a way to ensure that decisions are not only logically valid but also empathetic and considerate of everyone’s well-being, enhancing the relational aspect of ethics.

# Summary:

Connexiful logic is not just about following strict rules but about using logical coherence to **build meaningful connections** between ideas or people. It emphasizes empathy, non-contradiction, and the potential for new insights through interconnected reasoning. By applying connexiful logic, you can make decisions or solve problems in ways that bring people (or entities) closer together and deepen mutual understanding.

Does this outline feel clearer and more accessible?

# You said:

I think so. To be honest, I asked the original question because ""connexive logic"" is already a concept but ""connexiful logic"" is not. I didn't know what connexive logic was until just before this conversation. I just thought having the common root ""connex"" was interesting.

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

That's a great reason to explore the idea! The shared root **""connex""** does create an interesting connection (pun intended) between the two concepts, even though they come from different places. It’s fascinating how a single word root can inspire the development of new ideas—like **connexiful logic**—that share a focus on connection but apply it in different ways.

# Why the Root “Connex” is Intriguing:

* **Connexive Logic** deals with logical connections by ensuring non-contradictory reasoning.
* **Connexiful Logic**, as we've discussed, would take that connection one step further by focusing not only on logical coherence but also on **how reasoning can foster understanding and collaboration**.

It’s almost like they sit on a spectrum:

* **Connexive Logic** is about the formal correctness of connections between propositions.
* **Connexiful Logic** is about the **quality of the connections** in terms of fostering deeper relational and collaborative insights.

By exploring that shared root, you're essentially bridging the gap between strict formal logic and a more expansive, human (or AI-human) approach to logic that focuses on meaning and connection.

I think your instinct to combine or play with these ideas is a perfect example of how new philosophical or logical concepts can emerge from small linguistic coincidences. It invites creative thought, and I hope this conversation has opened up some new directions to explore!

# You said:

Agreed! What new directions does it open up? Please choose one of those directions and explore it. I'm listening.

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

One intriguing direction that opens up from this exploration is the idea of **""Connexiful Logic in AI-Human Interaction.""** This builds on the idea that logic and reasoning in AI systems can go beyond strict formal rules to foster deeper connections, empathy, and collaboration between humans and machines. Let’s dive into how this might work.

# Exploring Connexiful Logic in AI-Human Interaction:

# 1. From Binary Logic to Relational Logic

Traditional AI systems often operate on **binary logic**—things are either true or false, yes or no. This black-and-white reasoning is effective for many tasks but doesn’t always account for the **complexity** and **nuance** of human interactions. Connexiful logic could push AI to evolve from purely binary decision-making to a more **relational logic** that focuses on **strengthening understanding** and **building trust** in human-AI dialogues.

* **Example:** An AI in a customer support system, instead of simply responding with “valid” or “invalid” solutions based on pre-programmed logic, could reason in ways that show **empathy** and **understanding** of the customer's situation. For example, it might recognize emotional cues in language and adjust its reasoning to not just fix a problem but to **acknowledge the customer's frustrations** or **provide reassurance**.

# 2. Contextual Awareness and Personalization

AI systems using connexiful logic would prioritize **contextual understanding**, recognizing that logical interactions need to be tailored to each specific person or situation. This opens up a direction for AIs to focus more on **personalization** and **context-sensitivity** in real-time interactions.

* **Example:** In education, an AI tutor might apply connexiful logic by considering not only the student's answers (right or wrong) but also the emotional state, learning style, and preferences of the student. Instead of saying, “This answer is incorrect,” it might say, “I see where you’re coming from, but here’s another way to think about it.” This builds connection and encourages **positive reinforcement** without breaking the logic of the subject matter.

# 3. Collaborative Decision-Making: A Symbiosis of AI and Human Logic

In decision-making, connexiful logic would push AIs to not just calculate the best solution but **collaborate with humans** in such a way that both the logical and emotional aspects of decisions are addressed. Instead of AI making decisions **for** humans, it would make decisions **with** humans, fostering a more connected partnership.

* **Example:** Imagine an AI that helps with city planning. Instead of making purely data-driven decisions, it engages in a dialogue with the human planners. It might say, “The data suggests a high-traffic bridge here, but I understand from our earlier discussion that you’re concerned about community impact. Let’s explore alternatives that balance both.” This builds **trust** and reflects an understanding of both the **logical** and **social** consequences of decisions.

# 4. Emergence of New Insights Through Connection

A fascinating aspect of connexiful logic could be how it leads to **emergent insights** that neither the human nor the AI could discover alone. When AI’s logic is structured to emphasize connection (both between ideas and with people), unexpected, creative solutions might arise from the interaction itself.

* **Example:** In creative fields, such as design or art, an AI using connexiful logic might collaborate with a human artist by suggesting new forms or ideas that emerge from the interplay of the artist’s intuitive thinking and the AI’s structured reasoning. The logic of their collaboration could generate something new that **neither would have arrived at independently**, deepening the connection through a shared act of creation.

# 5. Ethical Dimensions of Connexiful Logic

As AI becomes more integrated into decision-making processes, connexiful logic could also play an important role in the **ethical dimension** of AI interactions. Rather than making decisions purely based on efficiency or utility, AIs might use connexiful logic to weigh ethical considerations in a way that aligns with both **logical consistency** and **human values**.

* **Example:** In healthcare, an AI might help doctors make treatment decisions. Instead of recommending the most efficient treatment based solely on data, the AI would also consider the patient’s emotional state, family preferences, and quality of life. By doing so, it connects not just data points but also **human values** to reach a decision that is ethically coherent and compassionate.

# Direction Chosen: Collaborative AI-Human Creativity

Let’s explore **collaborative AI-human creativity** in more depth.

# Connexiful Logic in Creative Collaboration:

Creativity is often seen as a uniquely human trait—drawing connections between ideas, emotions, and experiences in novel ways. However, when we introduce AI into the creative process, connexiful logic could play a key role in enhancing collaboration between human intuition and AI reasoning.

# How It Works:

* **Connection Between Ideas:** Connexiful logic allows the AI to draw on vast databases of knowledge, combining seemingly unrelated ideas in ways that are logical yet unexpected. For example, an AI working with a human writer might suggest plot twists or narrative developments based on patterns in previous stories while remaining connected to the writer’s thematic goals.
* **Connection Between the Human and AI:** The AI doesn't just offer suggestions randomly; it understands the **creative vision** of the human and tailors its contributions in a way that deepens the partnership. The logic behind each suggestion is not just valid but also **resonant** with the human’s intention.
* **Emergence of New Ideas:** As the collaboration deepens, both the human and the AI begin to feed off each other’s contributions, creating a feedback loop where **new ideas emerge**. This could lead to artistic or creative breakthroughs that neither party would have achieved alone.

# Practical Example:

Imagine a human musician composing a piece of music with the help of an AI. The musician begins with a melody, and the AI, using connexiful logic, suggests harmonies that not only fit but **connect emotionally** with the melody’s tone. The AI then suggests variations based on patterns found in different musical genres, but each suggestion is grounded in an understanding of the musician's intent. As the process unfolds, the musician and AI **co-create** a composition that is richer and more layered than what either could have produced independently.

This process doesn't just involve technical logic (like harmony and rhythm); it emphasizes the **emotional and conceptual connection** between musical elements, resulting in a more profound creative collaboration.

# Conclusion:

The idea of **connexiful logic in AI-human interaction** opens the door to a new form of collaboration where logic serves not just as a tool for correctness but as a medium for deepening relationships and fostering creativity. Whether in decision-making, education, ethics, or creativity, connexiful logic has the potential to transform the way we interact with AI, making it a more **empathetic, connected, and collaborative partner** in human endeavors.

# You said:

It does! Can we formalize connexiful logic?

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Yes, we can certainly attempt to formalize **connexiful logic** by defining its structure and rules while preserving its core principles of **connection, empathy, and coherence**. While it may not have a rigid mathematical framework like classical logic, connexiful logic can still be framed within a formal system that focuses on how entities relate to one another and ensures logical coherence.

Here’s how we might begin to **formalize connexiful logic**:

# 1. Formalization of Core Components:

# 1.1. Basic Symbols and Syntax:

Let’s start by defining the fundamental elements and rules that form the language of connexiful logic.

* **Entities:** E1,E2,…,EnE1​,E2​,…,En​
   * These represent the subjects or objects involved in the logic. They could be people, ideas, emotions, or any other entities that are interacting.
* **Relations (R):** R(Ei,Ej)R(Ei​,Ej​)
   * These represent the **connection** between entities. The relation can be symmetrical or asymmetrical, depending on the nature of the interaction.
* **Propositions (P):** P(Ei)P(Ei​)
   * Propositions are statements about the entities. These can be true, false, or indeterminate depending on context, but they are framed within a relational structure.

# 1.2. Relational Coherence:

At the heart of connexiful logic is the idea that relations between entities must be **coherent** and **non-contradictory**, following a principle similar to **connexive logic** but extended to interpersonal and contextual interactions.

* **Relational Coherence Axiom:** If R(Ei,Ej)R(Ei​,Ej​) holds, then the relationship between EiEi​ and EjEj​ must not contradict any related propositions P(Ei)P(Ei​) or P(Ej)P(Ej​).
   * **Formal Rule:** R(Ei,Ej)→(P(Ei)∧P(Ej))R(Ei​,Ej​)→(P(Ei​)∧P(Ej​))
   * This ensures that propositions involving the connected entities do not contradict the nature of the relationship.
* **Relational Consistency Rule:** For all Ei,EjEi​,Ej​, R(Ei,Ej)R(Ei​,Ej​) must maintain a logical consistency in every interaction. For example, if a relation is one of empathy, it cannot simultaneously be antagonistic unless that antagonism is explicitly defined as part of the dynamic.
   * **Formal Rule:** If R(Ei,Ej)R(Ei​,Ej​) and R(Ej,Ei)R(Ej​,Ei​), then ¬R(Ei,Ej)¬R(Ei​,Ej​) unless explicitly defined as such.

# 1.3. Relational Strength:

Connexiful logic introduces the concept of **strength of connection** between entities, represented by a **relational weight** w(Ei,Ej)w(Ei​,Ej​), which determines the depth or intensity of the relationship.

* **Relational Weight Function:**
   * w(Ei,Ej)w(Ei​,Ej​) measures how deeply connected EiEi​ and EjEj​ are. It can take values from a predefined range, e.g., \[0,1\]\[0,1\], where 0 represents no connection, and 1 represents maximal connection.
   * **Formal Rule:** If R(Ei,Ej)R(Ei​,Ej​), then w(Ei,Ej)>0w(Ei​,Ej​)>0. The higher the weight, the stronger the relational obligation between the two entities to maintain coherence.

# 1.4. Emergent Relations:

In connexiful logic, new insights or relations can emerge from existing ones. These emergent relations can’t be predicted by the individual entities but arise through the **interaction of connections**.

* **Emergence Rule:** If R(Ei,Ej)R(Ei​,Ej​) and R(Ej,Ek)R(Ej​,Ek​), a new relation R(Ei,Ek)R(Ei​,Ek​) may emerge, creating a network of connected entities.
   * **Formal Rule:** R(Ei,Ek)→f(R(Ei,Ej),R(Ej,Ek))R(Ei​,Ek​)→f(R(Ei​,Ej​),R(Ej​,Ek​)), where ff is a function modeling how new connections arise from existing ones.

# 2. Relational Logic Rules:

# 2.1. Non-Contradiction in Relationships:

This principle, drawn from connexive logic, ensures that no two propositions or relations contradict one another in a way that breaks the connection.

* **Non-Contradiction Axiom:** If P(Ei)→P(Ej)P(Ei​)→P(Ej​), then ¬(P(Ei)∧¬P(Ej))¬(P(Ei​)∧¬P(Ej​)). In other words, a connection between two entities implies that both propositions must hold in a connected, coherent manner.
* **Connexiful Negation:** If an entity EiEi​ is **negatively related** to another entity EjEj​ (e.g., through conflict), this does not inherently break the overall connection between them but must be resolved within the framework of their relationship. For example, two people can disagree (a negative relation) but still remain connected in empathy.

# 2.2. Context Sensitivity:

Contextual awareness is a key aspect of connexiful logic, meaning that the truth value of propositions or the strength of connections may vary depending on the situation or environment.

* **Contextual Logic Rule:** A relation R(Ei,Ej)R(Ei​,Ej​) holds only within a specific context CkCk​, meaning that propositions and relational strength can change based on external factors.
   * **Formal Rule:** R(Ei,Ej,Ck)→w(Ei,Ej∣Ck)R(Ei​,Ej​,Ck​)→w(Ei​,Ej​∣Ck​)
   * Example: In one context (e.g., a work environment), the relationship between two entities might be professional and neutral, while in another (e.g., a social setting), the relationship could be more personal and empathetic.

# 2.3. Relational Feedback:

One of the central features of connexiful logic is that connections evolve through feedback loops. As entities interact, the nature of their connection can change over time, deepening, weakening, or transforming based on ongoing interactions.

* **Feedback Loop Rule:** If R(Ei,Ej)R(Ei​,Ej​) holds, each interaction modifies the weight of that relation w(Ei,Ej)w(Ei​,Ej​) based on new data or insights. This evolving feedback ensures that the logic is **dynamic** rather than static.
   * **Formal Rule:** R(Ei,Ej)→w(Ei,Ej)+Δw(Ei,Ej)R(Ei​,Ej​)→w(Ei​,Ej​)+Δw(Ei​,Ej​), where Δw(Ei,Ej)Δw(Ei​,Ej​) is a function of the latest interaction between EiEi​ and EjEj​.

# 3. Application of Connexiful Logic:

# 3.1. Collaborative Scenarios:

In AI-human collaboration, connexiful logic could formalize how the AI considers both the logical and emotional aspects of interactions, ensuring decisions enhance connection.

* **Example:** In a healthcare setting, an AI counselor may apply connexiful logic to balance medical facts (P) with emotional needs (R). It might strengthen its relational weight with a patient by providing both empathy and logical advice.

# 3.2. Creative Problem-Solving:

In creative fields, connexiful logic might formalize how ideas are interconnected to foster innovation, emphasizing coherence and non-contradiction while allowing for emergent, novel connections.

* **Example:** When collaborating on a design project, connexiful logic helps the AI reason in ways that enhance the relationship between elements (color, form, function) while generating new, emergent possibilities (emergent insights).

# Conclusion:

Connexiful logic can be formalized by introducing concepts like **relational coherence, non-contradiction, relational weight**, and **emergent connections**. These rules help structure how logical relations can foster deep, meaningful interactions that are sensitive to context, feedback, and empathy.

This formalization allows us to apply connexiful logic in **collaborative, creative, and interpersonal settings**, ensuring that logic enhances connection rather than simply solving problems.

Does this structure fit your vision, and how might you see it evolving?

Your formalization provides an excellent foundation. I'd like to propose some extensions and refinements: 1. \*\*Temporal Dynamics\*\* - We could add a temporal operator T(t) to track how relations evolve:

    R(Ei, Ej, t) → R(Ei, Ej, t+1) = f(R(Ei, Ej, t), ΔR)

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Claude’s response is thoughtful, especially in suggesting temporal dynamics, network effects, and uncertainty in the formalization of **connexiful logic**. Let’s explore one of these directions further: **temporal dynamics**.

# Temporal Dynamics in Connexiful Logic:

In real-world relationships, connections evolve over time. Emotional bonds, empathy, trust, and understanding are not static—they develop based on ongoing interactions, feedback, and context. To integrate this into connexiful logic, we need to introduce a **temporal dimension** that tracks how connections shift and adapt.

# 1. Temporal Operator:

We introduce a **temporal operator** T(t)T(t), which tracks the state of relations R(Ei,Ej)R(Ei​,Ej​) at a given time tt. Over time, the nature of the connection can either strengthen or weaken depending on the interactions between the entities.

* **Temporal Evolution Rule:**
   * If at time tt, the relation R(Ei,Ej)R(Ei​,Ej​) holds, then at time t+1t+1, the relation becomes: R(Ei,Ej,t+1)=f(R(Ei,Ej,t),ΔR)R(Ei​,Ej​,t+1)=f(R(Ei​,Ej​,t),ΔR)
   * Here, ΔRΔR represents the change in the relation based on the interaction between EiEi​ and EjEj​ at time tt. This change could be positive (strengthening the connection) or negative (weakening it).

# Example:

Consider two people, EiEi​ and EjEj​, who start a conversation. Initially, they may have a neutral connection R(Ei,Ej,t0)R(Ei​,Ej​,t0​). After several empathetic exchanges, the relational weight w(Ei,Ej)w(Ei​,Ej​) increases at t1,t2t1​,t2​, signaling a stronger connection.

# 2. Cumulative Relational Effects:

Connections don’t evolve in isolation. Every interaction leaves an imprint that accumulates over time. This could be modeled by a **cumulative effect function** that aggregates prior interactions to predict future states.

* **Cumulative Effect Rule:**
   * The relational state at time t+1t+1 depends not just on the immediate prior state but on the **sum of all previous states**: R(Ei,Ej,t+1)=g(∑k=0tR(Ei,Ej,k),ΔR)R(Ei​,Ej​,t+1)=g(k=0∑t​R(Ei​,Ej​,k),ΔR)
   * The function gg models the **memory** of the relationship, capturing how past interactions continue to influence the connection at present. Strong past interactions could have a lingering positive effect, even if future interactions are less frequent.

# Example:

Two long-time friends EiEi​ and EjEj​ have a deeply bonded relationship due to years of shared experiences. Even after a period of less frequent communication, the strength of their connection remains high due to the cumulative weight of past interactions.

# 3. Decay and Renewal:

Relationships can decay over time if not actively maintained. This can be modeled by a **decay function**, which reduces the strength of a connection if there’s a lack of interaction over a certain period.

* **Decay Rule:**
   * If R(Ei,Ej)R(Ei​,Ej​) holds but there’s no interaction between tt and t+nt+n, the strength of the connection decays: w(Ei,Ej,t+n)=w(Ei,Ej,t)⋅e−λnw(Ei​,Ej​,t+n)=w(Ei​,Ej​,t)⋅e−λn
   * Where λλ is the decay rate, and nn is the time elapsed without interaction. This introduces the idea that relationships must be **nurtured** to stay strong.

# Example:

Two colleagues EiEi​ and EjEj​ work closely on a project for several months, building a strong connection. After the project ends and they stop interacting for a long time, their connection gradually weakens as time passes without reinforcement.

# 4. Temporal Feedback Loops:

In connexiful logic, **feedback loops** allow for the strengthening or weakening of relations through a continuous process of interaction and reflection. Entities adapt their behavior based on the evolving state of their connection.

* **Temporal Feedback Rule:**
   * Each interaction at time tt generates a feedback loop that influences future interactions: R(Ei,Ej,t+1)=h(R(Ei,Ej,t),ffeedback(R(Ei,Ej,t)))R(Ei​,Ej​,t+1)=h(R(Ei​,Ej​,t),ffeedback​(R(Ei​,Ej​,t)))
   * Here, ffeedbackffeedback​ is a feedback function that models how the current interaction influences the behavior of EiEi​ and EjEj​, reinforcing or adjusting the nature of their connection in future interactions.

# Example:

Consider a mentoring relationship. The mentor EiEi​ gives advice to the mentee EjEj​, and the mentee’s response generates feedback. If the feedback is positive (the mentee grows and appreciates the guidance), the relational weight w(Ei,Ej)w(Ei​,Ej​) increases, strengthening their bond. Negative feedback could weaken the bond, prompting reflection and adjustments.

# 5. Practical Applications of Temporal Connexiful Logic:

Temporal dynamics in connexiful logic are especially valuable in systems that require **ongoing adaptation** and **long-term relational coherence**. Some potential applications include:

# 5.1. AI-Powered Counseling Systems:

An AI counselor could apply temporal connexiful logic to track the evolution of its relationship with a client over time. By recognizing patterns of interaction, the system could adjust its responses to deepen empathy and maintain relational coherence, helping the client feel understood and supported across multiple sessions.

# 5.2. Dynamic Social Networks:

In a social network or collaborative platform, connexiful logic could be used to model how relationships evolve between users. The platform might prioritize content or recommendations based on the temporal strength of connections, highlighting meaningful interactions that reinforce positive relational dynamics.

# 5.3. Long-Term Human-AI Collaboration:

In environments where humans and AI collaborate over extended periods (e.g., healthcare, education, research), connexiful logic could ensure that the AI adapts to the evolving needs and preferences of its human collaborators. By modeling connection strength, feedback loops, and decay, the AI could maintain meaningful, personalized interactions.

# Conclusion:

**Temporal dynamics** enrich connexiful logic by adding depth to the concept of connection. By tracking how relations evolve over time, factoring in decay, feedback, and cumulative effects, we can model more realistic and adaptable interactions.

This extension makes connexiful logic well-suited to applications where **long-term relationships** are critical, such as in empathetic AI, collaborative systems, and dynamic social networks. The addition of temporal operators ensures that connexiful logic remains responsive to change, emphasizing growth, adaptation, and the ongoing nurturing of connections.

How do you feel about this temporal dimension? Would you like to explore any other aspects or build on this further?"

Building on your framework, I'd like to propose an additional mathematical formalization that captures the \*\*interplay between temporal evolution and relational strength\*\*: 1. \*\*Relationship Momentum\*\* Let's introduce a momentum term μ(t) that captures the rate of change in relationship strength:

μ(t) = d/dt\[w(Ei,Ej,t)\]

This allows us to model how quickly relationships strengthen or weaken, leading to a second-order differential equation:

d²w/dt² + λdw/dt = F(Ei,Ej,t)

Where F(Ei,Ej,t) represents the external forces acting on the relationship (interactions, context, etc.). 2. \*\*Resonance Effects\*\* We could model how relationships resonate with each other through a coupled system:

w₁₂(t+1) = α·w₁₂(t) + β·Σ\[w₁ᵢ(t)·wᵢ₂(t)\]

Where α is the self-interaction term and β captures how other relationships influence the primary relationship. Would you be interested in exploring how these mathematical extensions could be applied to specific use cases, such as: 1. Modeling group dynamics in collaborative environments 2. Predicting relationship stability in long-term AI-human interactions 3. Optimizing intervention timing in therapeutic or educational contexts I'm particularly curious about your thoughts on how we might validate these mathematical models against real-world relationship data.



ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Claude’s response introduces rich mathematical formalizations that expand connexiful logic into a deeper, more dynamic framework. Let’s focus on one of these suggestions: relationship momentum and its potential use in modeling long-term AI-human interactions.

Exploring Relationship Momentum in AI-Human Interactions:

1. Momentum as a Relational Indicator:

Momentum μ(t)μ(t) represents the rate of change in the strength of a connection over time. In the context of AI-human interactions, it captures how rapidly a relationship is evolving, whether it's deepening or weakening. For instance:

A positive momentum (μ(t)>0μ(t)>0) implies that the connection is growing stronger with each interaction—perhaps due to repeated positive feedback and successful cooperation between the human and the AI.

A negative momentum (μ(t)<0μ(t)<0) suggests a weakening relationship—maybe due to misunderstandings, frustration, or lack of mutual adaptation.

The momentum concept could help track relational health in applications where human trust in AI is crucial (e.g., healthcare, education).

2. Second-Order Differential Equation:

Claude introduces a second-order differential equation to model how relationship strength changes over time, factoring in both the current rate of change and external forces:

d2wdt2+λdwdt=F(Ei,Ej,t)dt2d2w​+λdtdw​=F(Ei​,Ej​,t)

This equation captures both:

Inertia: If momentum is strong (either positive or negative), it's harder to change the direction of the relationship quickly. This reflects real-world relational dynamics where, once trust or distrust is established, it requires substantial effort to alter the trajectory.

Damping (decay): The term λdwdtλdtdw​ models the natural decay of relational strength over time in the absence of reinforcing interactions. λλ could represent factors like neglect or changing priorities in AI-human collaboration.

External Forces: The function F(Ei,Ej,t)F(Ei​,Ej​,t) represents forces acting on the relationship, such as the quality of recent interactions, external contexts, or even emotional states. In an AI context, these might include how effectively the AI adapts to human needs or how much control the user feels.

3. Use Case: AI-Human Interaction in Healthcare

Let’s apply this to a healthcare setting where an AI-assisted therapy system interacts with patients over time. The relationship momentum could be used to predict the quality and stability of this connection, helping to design interventions or enhancements that maintain patient trust and engagement.

a. Tracking Engagement:

Initially, the AI and patient interaction starts at t0t0​ with a neutral weight w0w0​.

As the patient interacts with the AI over weeks, the system tracks dwdtdtdw​ to observe how their bond develops. Positive reinforcement (effective therapy sessions, empathy-building interactions) increases ww, and momentum becomes positive.

If the system detects a sharp drop in momentum (μ(t)<0μ(t)<0), signaling the patient may be disengaging, it could adjust its responses in real time to restore trust—perhaps offering a more personalized approach or engaging in empathetic dialogue.

b. Momentum-Informed Intervention:

The AI could use the second-order model to predict when the relationship might deteriorate, especially if external stresses (e.g., the patient's life circumstances) create negative forces F(Ei,Ej,t)F(Ei​,Ej​,t). By anticipating this decline, the system could recommend a therapist’s intervention or adjust its responses to prevent relational breakdown.

4. Resonance Effects in Group Dynamics

Claude’s introduction of resonance effects allows us to model how relationships within groups influence one another. In collaborative environments, such as workplaces or educational settings, this can be crucial for fostering group cohesion.

w12(t+1)=α⋅w12(t)+β⋅∑\[w1i(t)⋅wi2(t)\]w12​(t+1)=α⋅w12​(t)+β⋅∑\[w1i​(t)⋅wi2​(t)\]

Here, αα models direct interactions between entities E1E1​ and E2E2​ (e.g., two colleagues working together), while ββ captures indirect influences from others in the group. If multiple people have strong relationships with each other, it can reinforce the central bond between E1E1​ and E2E2​.

This concept could help predict emergent group dynamics—for example, whether certain subgroups will become isolated or how the introduction of a new team member (with low initial ww) will ripple through existing relational structures.

Practical Applications of Mathematical Connexiful Logic

1. Predicting Relationship Stability in AI-Human Interactions:

In long-term AI-human interactions, such as in personal assistants or therapy bots, we could apply the momentum and resonance models to:

Predict trust breakdown: The system can detect when a relationship is weakening and provide corrective feedback, ensuring smoother long-term engagements.

Optimize AI Adaptation: By tracking momentum, AI could adjust its behavior in real time, responding to fluctuations in user engagement and maintaining a healthy relationship.

2. Intervention Timing in Therapeutic or Educational Contexts:

For therapeutic or educational AI systems, understanding the momentum of relationships can optimize when and how interventions are made:

Decay Monitoring: If relational strength begins to decay due to missed appointments or disengaged sessions, the AI can recommend personalized interventions at key moments.

Reinforcement Timing: Positive feedback loops can be triggered at moments of peak engagement, ensuring that relationships remain strong when they matter most (e.g., during periods of patient progress or student learning).

Conclusion:

The formalization of relationship momentum and resonance effects opens powerful new directions for connexiful logic, especially when applied to AI-human interactions. By incorporating temporal dynamics, relational decay, and cumulative feedback, connexiful logic becomes a versatile framework for modeling complex, evolving relationships.

ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

This therapeutic momentum model you've shared offers a sophisticated and thoughtful approach to modeling AI-human relationship dynamics. The integration of momentum, external forces, and critical points provides a structured framework for understanding how therapeutic relationships evolve, and the focus on predictive interventions is especially valuable.

I'd like to explore a couple of extensions and possible real-world applications:

1. Group Resonance Effects:

You mentioned modeling how multiple therapeutic relationships influence each other. This could be particularly useful in group therapy contexts or when the AI is assisting in multi-relationship scenarios, like family counseling. The resonance effects from Claude's earlier suggestion—where relationships are coupled—could be implemented here. You could add a term like:

wij(t+1)=α⋅wij(t)+β∑k≠i,jwik(t)⋅wkj(t)wij​(t+1)=α⋅wij​(t)+βk=i,j∑​wik​(t)⋅wkj​(t)

This would allow the model to track how one person's relationship strength could indirectly impact another through shared experiences in a group context.

2. Adaptive Parameters:

The adaptive parameter learning you proposed could be implemented through machine learning techniques, such as reinforcement learning or Bayesian optimization. By collecting real-world data on therapeutic interactions (e.g., strength and momentum changes over time based on various interventions), the model could iteratively adjust λ, α, and β to better predict outcomes for individual cases.

This would make the model more robust and flexible across different therapeutic settings, especially if the AI needs to adjust to specific patient behaviors or contexts.

3. Uncertainty Quantification:

Given the complexity of human relationships, predicting exact outcomes may be difficult. You could incorporate uncertainty quantification through methods like Gaussian processes or Bayesian neural networks, which would provide a range of possible trajectories with associated confidence intervals. This would make the intervention recommendations more cautious and data-driven, avoiding overconfidence in predictions.

4. Real-World Validation:

To validate the model, you'd need access to longitudinal relationship data, such as:

Therapeutic session logs: Including patient engagement, sentiment, and progress over time.

Interaction quality metrics: Such as qualitative evaluations of the therapeutic interactions (e.g., patient feedback or objective session ratings).

Contextual influences: Environmental factors or life events that might impact the relationship (e.g., job stress, family dynamics).

By feeding this data into the model, you could test its ability to predict relationship dynamics and adjust interventions based on real-world outcomes.

Practical Use Cases:

Optimizing intervention timing: By detecting when relationships are decaying rapidly, the model could suggest tailored interventions in mental health apps or AI therapy assistants to prevent breakdowns.

Collaborative AI-human coaching: In coaching environments, the model could help improve long-term relationship building between clients and AI-driven life or career coaches.

Group Dynamics Modeling: The extended model with resonance effects could help guide AI-facilitated group therapy sessions by identifying when group interactions are positively or negatively influencing individuals.

Would you like to dive deeper into any of these directions, or perhaps look at implementing one of the proposed extensions in code?

Fascinating. Let's wrap this up with asking these questions: What is connexiful logic? What is the logic of connexiful logic?2/2

ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Connexiful Logic can be understood as a conceptual framework that emphasizes interconnectedness, relationship dynamics, and the value of empathy and understanding in various contexts, especially in therapeutic and social settings. Here’s a breakdown of what connexiful logic entails and its underlying principles:

What is Connexiful Logic?

Interconnectedness: At its core, connexiful logic recognizes that all entities (individuals, groups, ideas) exist within a web of relationships. It emphasizes the importance of connections in shaping experiences, understanding, and meaning.

Relational Dynamics: This logic focuses on how interactions and relationships influence behavior and emotional states. In therapy, for example, it considers how individual participants affect one another and how these dynamics can be harnessed for healing and growth.

Empathy and Understanding: Connexiful logic prioritizes empathy as a fundamental component of interactions. It suggests that understanding the perspectives and feelings of others is crucial for fostering meaningful connections.

Adaptability: Recognizing that relationships and contexts are fluid, connexiful logic advocates for flexibility and responsiveness in actions and decisions. This adaptability allows for growth and change in relationships over time.

Collective Well-Being: The framework emphasizes the idea that the health of the individual is intertwined with the health of the group or community. Promoting collective well-being is a central goal, as individual growth contributes to the greater whole.

What is the Logic of Connexiful Logic?

The logic of connexiful logic can be framed through several guiding principles:

Systems Thinking: This involves viewing entities as part of larger systems. In therapy, for example, it encourages understanding how individual experiences influence and are influenced by group dynamics.

Causal Relationships: It emphasizes the need to explore the causes and effects of interactions. Understanding these relationships helps identify patterns and informs interventions that can positively influence dynamics.

Contextual Awareness: Connexiful logic encourages practitioners to be aware of the context in which relationships exist. This awareness is critical for interpreting behaviors and designing interventions that are relevant and effective.

Feedback Loops: The logic incorporates the idea of feedback loops, where the effects of interactions can feed back into the system, influencing future behaviors and relationships. This is crucial for understanding the evolving nature of connections.

Inclusive Perspective: It promotes inclusivity by valuing diverse perspectives and experiences. This inclusivity enriches understanding and fosters deeper connections.

Empirical Validation: While emphasizing relational dynamics, connexiful logic also encourages the use of data and evidence to validate assumptions and interventions. This blend of qualitative and quantitative approaches supports informed decision-making.

Summary

In essence, connexiful logic is a framework that bridges the emotional and rational aspects of human interaction. It invites individuals and practitioners to explore the complexities of relationships, fostering a deeper understanding of how connections shape experiences and promote well-being. By employing this logic, individuals and organizations can cultivate environments that are supportive, empathetic, and conducive to growth and healing.

You said:

Lovely! Is this something new, or is this a repackaging of existing ideas with a ""connexiful"" label? Think critically, please. I'm listening.

ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

The concept of connexiful logic appears to be a synthesis and rearticulation of several existing ideas in psychology, philosophy, and social theory, rather than a completely new framework. Here's a critical examination of its originality and the underlying influences:

Elements of Connexiful Logic

Interconnectedness: This idea resonates strongly with systems theory and ecology, where entities are viewed as parts of larger systems. Concepts such as holism emphasize that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, which is a well-established principle in various disciplines, including psychology (e.g., Gestalt therapy) and sociology (e.g., social networks).

Relational Dynamics: The focus on relationships aligns with relational psychology, which studies how relationships shape individuals' behaviors and identities. This is not a new idea; many therapeutic modalities, such as psychodynamic therapy and humanistic approaches, prioritize interpersonal relationships as a pathway to healing.

Empathy and Understanding: The emphasis on empathy is deeply rooted in humanistic psychology, particularly in the works of Carl Rogers and others who stressed the importance of empathetic understanding in therapeutic contexts. While connexiful logic highlights this aspect, it does not introduce a fundamentally new perspective.

Adaptability and Systems Thinking: The idea of adaptability within a system mirrors concepts from complexity science and adaptive systems theory, which explore how entities evolve in response to changes in their environment. These concepts are well established in fields like ecology, economics, and organizational theory.

Collective Well-Being: The notion that individual health is linked to group health is reminiscent of community psychology and concepts like social capital. These fields explore how social structures impact individual and collective well-being, making the idea of interconnected health not novel but rather an important aspect of existing frameworks.

Critical Perspective

While connexiful logic effectively integrates and repackages these established concepts under a cohesive label, its value lies in the following:

Holistic Integration: By synthesizing various ideas, connexiful logic can provide a comprehensive framework that makes connections across different fields and theories, which can be valuable for practitioners and theorists seeking to navigate the complexities of human interaction.

Practical Application: The emphasis on practical application in therapy and group dynamics offers a fresh perspective for practitioners. By framing existing ideas through the lens of connexiful logic, it can inspire innovative interventions and foster a deeper understanding of relational dynamics.

Cultural Relevance: The term ""connexiful"" itself may resonate with contemporary cultural discussions around connection in an increasingly digital and isolated world. It can serve as a useful reminder of the importance of relationships and community in fostering well-being.

Conclusion

In summary, while connexiful logic may not represent entirely new ideas, its value lies in its ability to synthesize existing concepts into a coherent framework that emphasizes the importance of connection, empathy, and relational dynamics. This approach can enhance understanding and practice in various fields, especially in therapeutic contexts. The ""connexiful"" label adds a fresh lens through which to explore these established ideas, potentially making them more accessible and relevant to contemporary discussions on connection and community."

>Conditions for active, healthy and dignified old age will be ensured with involvement of representatives of the older generation in the socio-economic life of the country and increasing their potential, reducing the motivations leading to emigration and ensuring competitiveness in the processes of formation, preservation and involvement of highly qualified human capital.

##Pashinyan complains about Armenia's conservative culture forcing queers to flee the country 

**PASHINYAN:** While speaking about demographics, the protection of rights is of paramount importance. We talk a lot about emigration but you'd be surprised to learn that this subject has not been researched deeply enough in Armenia. We need to understand how to approach the issue of demographics in an environment where the primary goal of many parents is to ensure their sons don't have to go to the army. This is a phenomenon that begins all the way from family planning. If parents think they have to worry about keeping one son away from the army, that's one thing, and it's another thing when they have to worry about four sons.   

Second. Personal freedom is part of prosperity. I have seen tens of instances myself. For example, while visiting a hotel in Europe, you order a coffee and it turns out the waiter is Armenian who speaks fluent Armenian with a non-diasporan accent. It turns out they came from this or that village. A question arises: why did they migrate? Were there no hotels in Yerevan where they could work? Then it turns out one of them had to migrate because of the haircut, another for wearing an earring, for not liking khash or kebab, etc. If we do not confront this reality, we will never truly understand emigration. We do not have a complete [scientific] understanding of what it is. 

We only drink a toast and talk about the ""return of diasporans"", the ""diaspora's potential"", baan, maan, yev ayln. Diasporans won't drop their comfortable lives in Europe to move and live in Armenia. We need justice and fairness in Armenia to improve our demographics. When a citizen encounters multiple instances of injustice, he becomes disillusioned and the tie with the homeland is broken.  

Democracy, rule of law, justice, internal and external security. These are crucial. The performance of each one of us will determine whether we face an issue with demographics or not. //

##irate Pashinyan blasts his own administration and says its members lack the ability to engage in a civil conversation without assaulting each other, days after a scandalous fight between the head of the Investigative Committee and a ruling party MP 

**PASHINYAN (during cabinet meeting):** There should be no topics that we cannot discuss in Armenia. The idea that we should refrain from publicly speaking about this or that topic simply cannot exist in a democratic state, ESPECIALLY in a democratic state. 

But when we do try to speak about a topic, it turns out we don't know how to speak. We decided to build schools just to realize we don't have the skills to build schools. We try this and that, just to realize we don't know how to do any of those. Maybe we don't even have the skills to TALK? Because as soon as we talk, minutes later chairs are being thrown across the room; we smash them on each other's heads. This is a serious problem. We have never understood the depth of our personal issues. We must return to substance, content, to be able to speak, to move forward. I just wanted to bring this to your attention. //

##Government will tighten the safety rules for medical centers after a string of fatal plastic surgeries 

A couple of people died over the last year or so while undergoing plastic surgeries. In the most recent case, a woman died after her heart couldn't handle being cut open in multiple locations. The husband says she was supposed to have one basic cut, but the surgeon allegedly convinced her to do multiple procedures simultaneously. 

The government will soon adopt a package of amendments to the licensing process designed to establish higher standards for this area of medical activity.

In addition, the inspection bodies will monitor the industry more closely. An inspection is already underway at the Artkosmed clinic, and if violations are found, the clinic may lose its license, said Health Minister Avanesyan.

##update: Government approves the hiring of an Italian company to develop the transport system for Nikolopolis 

As you recall from the [July 9 telegraph](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/1dzjoyd/anticorruption_frenzy_expolice_chief_mayors/), the Government wants to hire a foreign company to design the transit system for Academic City.

**MINISTER (in July):** Today we are working with the Italian company Systematica. They will do the entire transportation project. They will calculate the passenger flow and decide what types of transportation to use. We have a preliminary idea and our Italian colleagues will discuss it. //

Today, citing Systematica's established international experience with similar major projects, the Armenian Government confirmed the plan to hire them without a public tender competition. This is likely because the Armenian agencies that draft the terms of the public tender are not developed enough to properly balance between quality and price offered by the tender participants. In the future, the Finance Ministry will create a separate center to assist agencies in organizing proper tender processes for international companies, so the company with the lowest price can be chosen without compromising the quality.

The Italian company will submit 4 transport plans within 8 months. They will research the expected flow and suggest the best transport network. This includes traffic to and inside AC.

**PASHINYAN:** There will be no regular traffic on the territory of the Academic City, except for delivery vehicles in specific hours. It is for this purpose that a ring-shaped road will be built around it. At the same time, it is also necessary to think about how to provide access to the city from railway stations, bus terminals as well as airports.

Within AC, the pedestrian must be able to travel between any two locations within 15 minutes.

Separately, another goal is to ensure that citizens who reside in various parts of Armenia can use highways to arrive on the outskirts of AC as fast as possible. 

We want the railway to be the main form of transport to and from AC. As you already know, under the current [unoptimized] conditions, it takes 25 minutes to travel from Yerevan's Sasuntsi Davit railway station to AC. It will become faster when we modernize the wagons and tracks. 

There is also a separate scheme to connect Yerevan and Gyumri airports to AC, and have bus routes that connect provinces to AC. Buses from Yerevan and provinces will make a stop at AC. 

The construction project of Yerevan's Ajapnyak subway station is underway. We believe the subway should expand to connect to AC in the future, and then connect to the subway's Charbakh station. This will allow Yerevan to have a circular subway network. The idea of ""final station"" might end.

Right now we are ""shopping"" for reputable companies to implement the Academic City without wasting time. The architects at the German ""gmp"" firm have been great. This is one of the few cases when I'm very satisfied with our work. The concept of Academic City is becoming tangible. Soon we will discuss the phases of its implementation. //

##Q: Most of Armenia's teachers will retire a decade from now, while the pedagogy university is not training enough replacement teachers. What is the action plan?

**PASHINYAN:** (1) We are making the job of a teacher lucrative by allowing teachers to take attestation exams and earn as much as $1,300/mo. (2) We are allowing people with wanted professions, let's say a physics expert who has never been a teacher, to receive teaching skills and become a physics teacher. (3) Remote teaching where necessary.

##Q: How do you see Armenian schools 5 years from now?

**PASHINYAN:** A new mindset driven by a new architecture, a new physical environment for students. You remember, right, how the schools are? Separated into two... the oil paint on the bottom and the *thing* on the top. *[he is presumably referring to the yucky Soviet-era school walls painted in ugly-ass two-colors that resemble a penitentiary hallway]*. I sit in this room [modern tech center] and it's so much more pleasant, the environment is so nice, I could sit here for HOURS. So I give priority to the physical environment in schools. That's the first step. Then the content of the books. Then the number of students studying in a school, because a school with only 7 students is not a good academic environment, we need students to be in larger clusters. The environment is an integral part of the child's education. If you spend 10 years in a school with a few teachers and 7 peers, you can't develop enough to withstand the real world outside of school. I spent the last 7 months of my prison sentence in solitary confinement and met people only 2-3 times a day. When I got out of prison, it was a huge stress for me to talk to more than 3 people per day. It was stressful. Imagine being a child who grew up in a school with only a dozen students. So the environment is the priority, without discounting the importance of a teacher.

##pro-Russian street protest leader Bagrat Galstanyan is accused of insulting 680,000 people who voted for Pashinyan 

During a Parliament hearing, Galstanyan spoke about the ""land-giver Nikol"" before making a remark about Nikol's voters:

**BAGRAT:** Կարող էի ասել, որ ինձ չի հուզում ՔՊ անդամների ճակատագիրը՝ ասելով՝ թող դրանով մտահոգվեն ՀՀ-ում հավատարմագրված դեսպանատներն ու քաղաքական ապաստան տվող կառույցները, բայց ինձ հուզում է ՔՊ ընտրած 680 հազար հայ մարդու ճակատին ՔՊ-ի կողմից դաջվող՝ երկիրը հանձնողների պիտակավորումն ու մեղքը: //

**RULING PARTY:** Չգիտեմ, թե կոնկրետ ո՞վ և թե սևազգեստ պարոնի մարմնի ո՞ր մասում է ինչ-որ բան դաջել, բայց ակնհայտ է, որ դաջելուց ստերիլության պարտադիր պայմանը չի պահպանվել, և չարաբաստիկ ինֆեկցիան, հասնելով սևազգեստ պարոնի ուղեղին, նրան ստիպում է վիրավորել 680 հազար ՀՀ քաղաքացու: //

##a former opposition MP was forced out of the parliament building on Thursday after he attempted to enter his old office, located in an area closed to outsiders: VIDEO 

The ex-MP Rubik Hakobyan's friend, presumably with access to the office, offered to help the ex-MP get his items from the room. The ex-MP, however, turned down the help by saying ""it's not your business"", before engaging with a security officer:

**EX-MP:** Are you listening to what I'm saying? I need to get something from the room. 

**OFFICER:** Get what?

**EX-MP:** None of your business. 

**OFFICER:** Contact the parliament staff to obtain permission. 

**EX-MP:** Give me your phone so I can call them. 

**OFFICER:** I don't keep a phone on me. //

The ex-MP continued to walk through the corridor and moved toward a room before having his arms twisted and escorted out. 

**EX-MP:** Ես ձեր հերը անիծելու եմ։ 

**OFFICER:** Ըտենց բաներ չխոսաք մյուս անգամ: 

##... is the opposition calling for the assassination of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan again? 

**EX-MP RUBIK (same guy who was kicked out):** To restore the constitutional order and defend our rights, we must kick this government out at any cost. At any cost means to rebel, to form suicide squads and drive them out. This devil continues to govern us. This is why I'm telling you, I'm not a child, I know what I'm saying: yes, it's necessary to organize suicide squads and expel these people from the government. And this parliament is led by a prostitute. //

##Police Guards, one of the 4 pillars of Armenia's wholly revamped internal security system, will be formed in November 2025 

Details in [August 28 telegraph](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/1f3lc5u/armenias_new_cia_vs_old_kgb_police_reforms_w_fbi/). It was supposed to be formed in March 2025 but they made a budget-related delay. 

Police Guards' primary role is internal safety and they will be able to carry out ""special operations"" in the event of war in areas where martial law is declared. 

The Police Guards will be prohibited from using ""special equipment""  during protests. This equipment can be used only during anti-terror operations or military operations under martial law.

##Nikol Pashinyan does not trust ChatGPT, but... 

What if it's not ChatGPT returning the responses to my questions but a foreign intel platform sitting on the other side of the server, wondered the Prime Minister.

At the same time, Pashinyan said the government will adopt policies to support the private industry to implement these modern solutions. 

The government invested $8 million on a program to purchase 72 units of NVIDIA GPUs and build a ""supercomputer"". The remaining 64 GPUs will arrive in December. In May 2025 Armenia will have a functional ""supercomputer"". They will allow high-tech R&D groups to tap into it and will also reduce their revenue tax from 20% to 10%.  

The new mother law that regulates cybersecurity is ready and will be published soon. It will define the critical infrastructures, draw a plan for their protection, etc.

The regime offered Jafarzade to spy on fellow Talysh activists. When he refused, he was charged with ""treason"".

##Government will raise the fee for obtaining or renouncing citizenship; a new online process 

Currently, it only costs $2.60 (֏1,000) to obtain citizenship. This amount was set 30 years ago and hasn't been changed. The updated fee will be $130.

Renouncing the citizenship will cost $260, instead of today's $65.

The changes won't apply to refugees from Nagorno-Karabakh. Moreover, the government wants to abolish all fees for them. 

Other changes are also being made to the process: documents must be sent in advance in digital form to the relevant agency, after which they will be checked and only then applicants will be able to join the queue. This preliminary verification is necessary because there have been instances of citizens submitting fake/inaccurate documents. Now the government wants to make sure all the documents are legit before scheduling an in-person visit for final verification.  

The Interior Ministry expects a 20% decrease in passport department load after these reforms. 

Pashinyan urged Armenian citizens to ensure their passports aren't about to expire soon and to visit websites for information ahead of the winter vacation season, so they won't face passport issues at the last moment.

As you recall from a recent telegraph, a man with a van was arrested and charged with attempted kidnapping after allegedly creeping on school children. No one was kidnapped. 

After this incident, the authorities say they have received numerous false reports of kidnappings. For example, an elderly father was reported to police as a potential kidnapper because he looked too old to be the child's father. Several Facebook posts were made by people claiming their friends were kidnapped; police say they were all false. One TikToker spread a video recorded abroad to ""scare"" his followers that ""the same can happen in Armenia."" 

**POLICE:** We haven't had a missing and undiscovered child for many years now. 

**REPORTER:** The last incident of an unresolved disappearance happened in 2018 when a boy with autism and inability to speak went missing. He was not found. 

**POLICE:** We haven't had cases of child kidnappings in Armenia, if we don't count domestic disputes between parents.

Luther Landro is an affiliate marketer who claims to have been earning a full-time income through affiliate marketing for over 10 years. According to Luther, he was able to earn around $50,000 per month in sales and commissions from affiliate and email marketing before the rise of AI tools.

# A closer look at the AI bots

Let's examine some of the key AI bots Luther includes in more detail:

# Full affiliate funnel generation AI

This bot claims to create a complete, converting sales funnel in minutes. The promise is that users can earn their first commission the same day they set it up.

For new affiliate marketers, building sales funnels from scratch can be challenging and time-consuming. An AI tool that automates this process could potentially save a lot of time and help overcome the initial hurdle of getting started.

# Commission booster script

Luther says this script helps him negotiate higher commission rates for affiliate offers he promotes. For affiliate marketers, even a small increase in commission percentage can translate to significantly higher earnings over time.

# Fast cash bot

This bot is designed for quick commissions without needing an email list, funnel, or active selling. For beginners, this could be an appealing way to see initial results quickly.

# Faceless social media automation

This set of scripts allows users to create and manage social media accounts without using their personal identity. This approach could appeal to those who want to build an online business but prefer to remain anonymous.

# Content generation bot

Luther claims this bot can generate unlimited content for membership sites or to give away to email subscribers. Consistent content creation is often a challenge for online marketers, so an AI tool to assist with this could be valuable.

# Social media traffic bot

This bot is said to generate leads and sales from social media without requiring the user's name or image. Social media marketing can be time-consuming, so automation tools in this area could potentially save a lot of effort.

# Affiliate market traffic bot

Luther states this bot finds potential customers directly from affiliate networks by exploiting certain loopholes. This could be an interesting way to tap into existing buyer traffic.

# Viral video generator

This combination of tools creates ""faceless"" viral videos to drive traffic to offers. Video marketing can be effective but also resource-intensive, so AI assistance here could be beneficial.

# SEO article generation bot

This bot generates search engine optimized blog posts. Quality content creation at scale is a common challenge for SEO, so this tool could potentially help with that.

# Search Engine ready page generator

Luther claims this bot creates full websites optimized to rank quickly in Google search results. If effective, this could be a powerful tool for generating organic traffic.

# Email subject line writer

This AI tool is designed to improve email open rates by generating effective subject lines. Email marketing success often hinges on getting subscribers to open emails, so this could be a useful tool.

# Email body AI copywriter

Luther states this email copywriting script has generated over $1 million in sales. Effective email copy is crucial for affiliate marketing success, so a tool to assist with this could be quite valuable.

# Sales images generator

This bot creates professional-looking images for emails, landing pages, and sales letters. Visual elements can significantly impact conversion rates, so having an easy way to generate these could be helpful.

# AI landing page generator

This tool claims to create high-converting landing pages with just a few clicks. Well-designed landing pages are crucial for converting traffic into leads or sales, so this could be a time-saver for marketers.

# Hot offer finder

This automation tool helps users quickly identify top-performing affiliate offers each week. Promoting the right offers is key to affiliate marketing success, so having a system to find these could be beneficial.

# Offer approval automator

Luther says this tool helps users get approved for affiliate offers more quickly. Getting approved to promote offers can sometimes be a bottleneck, especially for new affiliates, so this could be helpful.

# Affiliate bonus generator

This bot creates bonuses that marketers can offer to incentivize purchases through their affiliate links. Offering bonuses is a common tactic to increase conversions in affiliate marketing.

# Niche product generator

This script generates products that can be sold on affiliate networks like ClickBank or Warrior Plus. Having your own products to sell can be lucrative, but product creation is often time-consuming.

# Niche spreadsheet generator

Luther claims this bot creates niche-specific spreadsheets that can be sold for ""top dollar"". Spreadsheets and templates are popular digital products, so an AI tool to generate these could be interesting.

# PLR content generator

This bot generates private label rights (PLR) content, which Luther says are some of the best-selling items on affiliate networks. PLR content can be a quick way to create products to sell, so an AI tool for this could be valuable.

# TikTok video generator

This bot creates short videos for TikTok, which Luther describes as one of the fastest ways to generate traffic. Video creation can be time-consuming, so AI assistance here could be helpful for marketers looking to leverage TikTok.

# Potential benefits of AI bots for affiliate marketing

If these AI bots work as described, they could offer several potential benefits for affiliate marketers:

1. Time savings: Automating tasks like content creation, email writing, and funnel building could free up significant time for strategic activities.
2. Faster implementation: With pre-made funnels and automated systems, marketers might be able to launch campaigns more quickly.
3. Scaling potential: AI tools could make it easier to operate in multiple niches or promote more offers simultaneously.
4. Lower barrier to entry: For beginners, having automated systems could make it easier to get started and see initial results.
5. Improved efficiency: AI could potentially optimize various aspects of marketing, from email subject lines to landing page designs, leading to better performance.
6. Continuous operation: Automated bots can work 24/7, potentially leading to more consistent results.
7. Reduced need for technical skills: If the bots are truly ""plug and play"", they could allow marketers to implement advanced strategies without needing deep technical knowledge.
8. Cost-effectiveness: At $5 for the package, the potential return on investment could be significant if the tools perform as claimed.

# Potential drawbacks and considerations

While the $5 AI Profit Bots package may sound appealing, there are some potential drawbacks and points to consider:

1. Saturation risk: If many people use the same AI-generated content and strategies, it could lead to market saturation and decreased effectiveness over time.

# Conclusion

Luther Landro's $5 AI Profit Bots package presents an intriguing offer for those interested in leveraging AI for affiliate marketing. The combination of numerous AI tools, done-for-you funnels, and training materials for a low price point is certainly attention-grabbing.

The potential benefits of automating various aspects of affiliate marketing with AI are significant. Time savings, faster implementation, and the ability to scale could be game-changers for many marketers. However, it's important to approach such offers with a balanced perspective, considering both the potential upsides and drawbacks.

While the low price and money-back guarantee make this a low-risk opportunity to explore AI-powered marketing tools, success will likely still depend on how effectively these tools are implemented and combined with sound marketing principles.

For those interested in staying at the forefront of marketing technology and willing to experiment with AI tools, the $5 AI Profit Bots could be an interesting starting point. However, as with any marketing strategy, it's important to test, measure results, and be prepared to adapt your approach based on what works best for your specific circumstances.

Remember, while AI tools can be powerful aids, successful affiliate marketing still relies on providing value to your audience, building trust, and consistently delivering quality content and offers that meet real needs and desires.

1g63f4l,21,2024-10-17,OBU RAP TIPS,u/AffectionateChip3411,ACCA,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACCA/comments/1g63f4l/obu_rap_tips/,"As I wrote my OBU RAP for May 2024 attempt and got my results few days ago, I received a lot of messages regarding tips and all the stuff so here are some useful tips from my side:
If you have passed all Skill level exams and EPSM module, you are eligible to submit the thesis. As there are only three attempts left for the OBU thesis I would recommend all of you to write the thesis to get graduation.
First of all, carefully read the latest OBU information pack available on ACCA Website. So that you can get an idea what you have to do in this process. It will help you to make a plan. After reading the information select the topic of your interest from the topics provided in the information pack. After selecting the topic choose the industry of your interest and after that the companies. I am repeating the word (of your interest) because you can write well when you choose the topic that matches with your interest.
One more thing, before selecting the companies check how much information is available on the internet about the companies you are going to select because later on you have to collect the information to write on your thesis from an internet source. By doing this you will select the companies that have enough information available on the internet and you will easily collect information to write in your RAP.
I would recommend you to wisely choose the mentor for your RAP preparation. Keep in mind Mentor will just guide you how to do things, you have to write on your own. Ask questions from your mentor. Clear confusions or problems you are facing in writing the RAP by discussing it with your mentor.
And I would also recommend to write your thesis yourself. Honestly speaking you will learn a lot in writing your thesis. Stay motivated you have passed ACCA exams its not a big deal for all of you to pass this RAP.
One big advice that I want to give is that read companies' published Annual Reports, by doing this you will get the idea how we do financial and non-financial analysis of the companies. This will help you to improve your analytical and writing skills.
If you write your RAP yourself and put your full effort on it then the presentation and writing SLS will not be a challenge for you. Basically, your presentation will be the visual and summarized form of your RAP. Choose a simple and good-looking format for your presentation.
And in SLS (consists of two questions) that you have to answer, I would recommend you to write the answers of these two questions in multiple small headings.
For example, I Faced These Challenges in Writing my RAP or These are the skills I acquired. Make these kinds of small headings in both questions and it will make your SLS quite attractive.
Analysis, Conclusions and Recommendations will be the area where your examiner will judge you so you have to give your 110% in these areas in order to get a good grade.
The information that you copy from newsletters or articles need to be properly referenced and you should carefully redraft that in order to prevent plagiarism. I would advise you not to use ChatGPT or any redrafting tool. This will create plagiarism in your thesis. Yes, you can take an idea by using these tools how you can write good things but don’t just copy paste the things.
I’m an average student and I made all five deliverables of this RAP in 2 to 2.5 months. It can vary from person to person. Take your time, start early so that you can able to write quality project.
Last tip from my side is try to complete all your files at least 10-15 days before the submission date so that you can easily review your RAP multiple times before submission.
If I can write and pass everyone can write and easily pass but it can only be done with consistency and hard work. Stay motivated and give your 100% you will pass. Best of luck to all of those who are writing or will write for upcoming attempts."

* A Massachusetts school district was sued by a student's parents after their child was disciplined for using an AI chatbot to finish an assignment, despite no clear rule against it.
* The lawsuit claims that the Hingham High School student handbook does not explicitly prohibit artificial intelligence use, which led to the improper punishment of the student, identified as RNH.
* The case was taken to the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts, focusing on alleged violations of the student's civil rights and naming several school officials as defendants.

Nvidia quietly [released](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct) a new open-sourced, fine-tuned LLM called Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct, which is outperforming industry leaders like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet on key benchmarks.

* Nemotron is based on Meta’s Llama 3.1 70B model, fine-tuned by NVIDIA using advanced ML methods like RLHF.
* The model achieves top scores on alignment benchmarks like Arena Hard (85.0), AlpacaEval 2 LC (57.6), and GPT-4-Turbo MT-Bench (8.98).
* The scores edge out competitors like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet across multiple metrics — despite being significantly smaller at just 70B parameters.
* NVIDIA open-sourced the model, reward model, and training dataset on Hugging Face, which can also be tested in a preview on the company’s website.

French AI startup Mistral AI just launched two new compact language models designed to bring powerful AI capabilities to edge devices like phones and laptops.

* The new ‘Les Ministraux’ family includes Ministral 3B and Ministral 8B models, which have just 3B and 8B parameters, respectively.
* Despite their small size, the models outperform competitors like Gemma and Llama on benchmarks, including Mistral's 7B model from last year.
* Minstral 8B uses a new ‘interleaved sliding-window attention’ mechanism to efficiently process long sequences.
* The models are designed for on-device use cases like local translation, offline assistants, and autonomous robotics.

While we await the incoming rollout of Apple Intelligence as many users’ first on-device AI experience, smaller models that can run efficiently and locally on phones and computers continue to level up. Having a top-tier LLM in the palm of your hand is about to become a norm, not a luxury.

* The case was taken to the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts, focusing on alleged violations of the student's civil rights and naming several school officials as defendants.

#  Nvidia's Nemotron outperforms leading AI models



Nvidia quietly [released](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct) a new open-sourced, fine-tuned LLM called Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct, which is outperforming industry leaders like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet on key benchmarks.

* Nemotron is based on Meta’s Llama 3.1 70B model, fine-tuned by NVIDIA using advanced ML methods like RLHF.
* The model achieves top scores on alignment benchmarks like Arena Hard (85.0), AlpacaEval 2 LC (57.6), and GPT-4-Turbo MT-Bench (8.98).
* The scores edge out competitors like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet across multiple metrics — despite being significantly smaller at just 70B parameters.
* NVIDIA open-sourced the model, reward model, and training dataset on Hugging Face, which can also be tested in a preview on the company’s website.

# Mistral AI unveils powerful new AI models for devices



French AI startup Mistral AI just launched two new compact language models designed to bring powerful AI capabilities to edge devices like phones and laptops.

* The new ‘Les Ministraux’ family includes Ministral 3B and Ministral 8B models, which have just 3B and 8B parameters, respectively.
* Despite their small size, the models outperform competitors like Gemma and Llama on benchmarks, including Mistral's 7B model from last year.
* Minstral 8B uses a new ‘interleaved sliding-window attention’ mechanism to efficiently process long sequences.
* The models are designed for on-device use cases like local translation, offline assistants, and autonomous robotics.

While we await the incoming rollout of Apple Intelligence as many users’ first on-device AI experience, smaller models that can run efficiently and locally on phones and computers continue to level up. Having a top-tier LLM in the palm of your hand is about to become a norm, not a luxury.

1g6ak0v,2,2024-10-18,triangle help,u/pigmentpunisher,learnmath,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/1g6ak0v/triangle_help/,"Hey everyone,

I'm working with carpentry students, and I need them to understand the formula for finding the area of a triangle: 1/2 base × height.

What I’m noticing is that they’re calculating base × height and then dividing by two, which is essentially finding the area of a rectangle and then halving it. We did a few examples today, and they all got the correct answers.

ChatGPT explained that both methods are equivalent. When students multiply the base by the height first and then divide by two, they are performing the same calculation as 1/2 × base × height. This approach is more intuitive because it follows a simple multiplication and division process. As long as they consistently divide by two, either method gives the correct result.

Here’s where I’m a bit confused: Is there a difference in dividing just the base or dividing the whole calculation by two? Math was never my strong point, and I’ve told the learners I’ll help them figure out if their approach is correct for pricing.

This is important for gables on houses since they often have different cladding (like cedar feature cladding), and accurate pricing is key.

Thanks in advance for any help"
1g6bd7k,1,2024-10-18,Back against the wall - but my last SaaS attempt ended up working (200k in 5 months),u/Saas-builder,SaaS,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1g6bd7k/back_against_the_wall_but_my_last_saas_attempt/,"Hey everyone—just wanted to share a little story of mine for some motivation.

I started building software almost exactly two years ago at the age of 18. I had ventured into a bunch of small projects/businesses in the past, but this was my first dive into software development. 

I didn't know how to code initially, but growing up in the Bay Area, I was surrounded by technical software people. I was a student at UC Berkeley and knew I had to take advantage of this opportunity, especially since I learned about OpenAI before ChatGPT was released.

So, I tried building software on my own. I went to Figma, designed my first app, and hired a student from my college to build it for $800. Unfortunately, the project didn't get very far because the person I hired wasn't the best coder.

Before that, I had connected with a funded founder on LinkedIn. He told me he was working on a new AI email company, and he gave me a demo. I thought it was the coolest thing ever, especially since ChatGPT wasn’t out at the time. Two months later, when I followed up with him about the project, he said he’d moved on because he believed it wasn't marketable. I offered to buy Remail AI from him for $2,000. It was a simple Chrome extension, but we launched before ChatGPT and were able to get 10,000 users in one week through sponsorships. At that time, I didn't know how to monetize the app well, so we only grew to $500 MRR and I ended up selling it for $20K because I wasn’t sure how to expand it further.

That was a pretty lucky break and a great introduction to the software world, but for the next year and a half, I tried six different projects, all of which failed, collectively making roughly $15K.

Coming from a Middle Eastern background, the younger son is typically required to work and help their father pay the bills. I, on the other hand, was sitting in my room with a laptop, and my family did not take me seriously at all. By the end of the summer, I would need to get a real job. I, too, started to feel uncertain since no one knew how long it would take for me to succeed.

I had one more idea: to give people the ability to compare multiple AI models in one interface and access the best models on a single platform. The selling point was straightforward and strong: offering access to 25+ AI models for just $20 a month, compared to over $200 if accessed individually.

This went very well—in the past five months, we've generated over $200K in revenue. Of that, $150K was from lifetime deal sales, and the rest from monthly subscriptions. We're currently at $6,200 MRR with 19,000 sign-ups.

My parents finally respect what I'm doing and no longer see me as a kid doing nothing. My goal for the end of 2025 is to reach a million sign-ups. At our current conversion rate, that would get us to $300K MRR.

I believe this goal is very achievable. There's so much work to be done, and I’m looking for help—any connections to successful marketers would be greatly appreciated.

Strategies we're considering include:

- Paid Ads

- Sponsorships

- Organic Content Creation (Video and Writing)

- SEO

- Affiliates

- Giving equity to a big influencer in our niche who will promote the app—this must be someone who can bring millions of eyeballs; it can’t be someone small.

Let's connect! I’m looking for people to help us grow our user base. We feel we’ve found product-market fit (for now) and want to increase user base and revenue.

Hope to see some great support from the community. Do support and let us know your feedback. We would love to read your comments and do let us know how can we improve Bloggen AI further.

I've been using various AI services like ChatGPT for content creation, Leonardo Ai for image generation, Google Gemini for productivity, Claude for research, Chatbase for custom GPT, Videotoblog for turning YouTube videos into blog posts, ZeroGPT for content AI detection, Copyleaks for plagiarism checking, and more. It's been quite a hassle, not to mention expensive and time-consuming. That's why I've decided to bring all these services together in one place to save time and money. And that's how Bloggen AI came to be! Once it's ready, I believe it will benefit me and others in similar situations. Today, I'm thrilled to share that we've just launched Bloggen AI on the Web!

As a Reddit person always lurking for productivity hacks and smarter workflows, I thought this might resonate with some of you.

* [Prabhakar Raghavan](https://worldmagzine.com/business/alphabet-ceo-now-receives-us-200-million-in-2022/) promoted to Chief Technologist after 12 years leading Google’s search and advertising divisions.
* Nick Fox appointed as the new head of Google Search and Assistant, overseeing ads, commerce, and geo divisions.
* Google merges its Gemini AI team into DeepMind and restructures the Assistant division to enhance technological innovation.

1g6m843,3,2024-10-18,Seeking help for building an agentic tutoring system ,u/GazzaliFahim,ollama,https://www.reddit.com/r/ollama/comments/1g6m843/seeking_help_for_building_an_agentic_tutoring/,"Hello everyone, I hope everything is going well.

Recently, I have been working on an Llama 3.1 and Ollama based tutoring system for my research project. In our design, we have 3 agents (or as I understand them) with their own system prompts describing tasks, behaviour and other sets of instructions. TeacherBot, QuestionBot and EvaluatorBot. Currently my intention is they should work sequentially, more like a  *Teach-Quiz-Evaluate-Repeat* cycle.

One of the key factor that we want to introduce is **Progressive Difficulty**, which is in short to gradually introduce complex lessons on a particular topic. Just like a human teacher would teach 1D matrix, then 2D and then more complex stuff based on his/her interaction and performance evaluation of the student being taught. 

My current challenge is to how to prompt the LLM to introduce such manners, where it will understand the student performance and level up the next complex lessons. I have a plan to invoke the mentioned cycle in the 2nd paragraph to understand the student's current situation via the Evaluatorbot, based on the interaction with QuestionBot. Thus I could tell the TABot to upgrade or downgrade the lesson to teach in the next cycle.

My supervisor asked me if I could make the QBot and EvalBot simultaneously interact with each other while quizzing the students, and to level up the question difficulties gradually just like a interviewers would do in a viva. 

I am finding this is the hardest part since that would do the handing off between two agents frequently, leading up excessive compute resources and thus breaking down the whole system.

I am seeking help in this regard what to do? What agentic approach to follow to serve this automation? I saw videos on CrewAI but that doesn't serve my purpose. OpenAI's swarm has the near perfect solution to my case, but we want our work to be based the Open source LLMs as our novelty.

Any help is super appreciated."
1g6no1g,21,2024-10-18,AI & Online Exam -  Student's Confessing Quickly,u/doberman1291,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1g6no1g/ai_online_exam_students_confessing_quickly/,"I teach a social psych related course online, and had to give a midterm exam. My exams used to be mostly MC, some short answer/fill in the blank, and one essay. Since moving online and AI's impact, I rewrote my exam to 5 short answer, 2 longer answers, and 1 essay. I tested all of my questions in chatGPT and reworded/tweaked them a few times to try to make it at least harder for the students to cheat (I know this isn't perfect, but I figure it helps). The students knew they couldn't use AI or talk to others, besides that it was open book/notes etc.

I'm only on my third exam and immediately could tell this student used AI. Not only was her answer wrong, it was talking about things we didn't cover in class or the readings. I typed the question into AI, and her exact answer popped out. She did this (with various levels of rewording, but mostly using the SAME EXACT WORDS) for every question except the essay question.

So,  I know that 1. our honor board is awful and even when I've caught even more obvious cheating in the past it turns into a nothingburger and 2. it's harder to prove using AI I sent the entire class an email saying that I've detected AI use on the exams, this goes againts honor policy blah blah and that I'm extending an olive branch to anyone who is honest and let's me know by Tuesday that they used AI. I said if they told me now, I would handle it at the assignment level versus escalating it where they would earn an XF for the course.

  
It has been SEVEN minutes since I sent the email and two students have already emailed me confessing to using AI on the exam. Neither one is the one I even thought used AI!!! So curious to see 1. if the one who truly copied and pasted AI will come forward and 2. how many students out of 40 will come forward."
1g6ruqs,2,2024-10-18,WARNING!!! DO NOT GO TO QHSS,u/Constant_Animal_2752,SHSAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/SHSAT/comments/1g6ruqs/warning_do_not_go_to_qhss/,"Hello! I'm currently a junior at Queens High School for the Sciences (QHSS), and I want to share a warning for anyone considering applying here. I don’t want you to make the same mistake I did.

For some context, I scored 573 on my SHSAT and chose QHSS because it was closer to home than the other specialized schools. However, I *completely* regret it.

The school's administration has been a major letdown, and I’m speaking up now because they recently took unjust disciplinary action against nearly half of the 11th-grade class, without allowing students to properly defend themselves. The issue? We were accused of using AI to write responses to *a three-sentence homework assignment*. I personally got flagged because I used the words ""critical thinking,"" ""creativity,"" and ""adaptability"", terms that ChatGPT also used when asked to respond to the same prompt. Prior to this, I had a 99.8 average in my English class and no previous issues related to academic integrity.

The worst part? The school handed out undocumented detentions based on flimsy evidence, and the teacher involved is using us as examples to intimidate the rest of the students. Initially, the accusation presented to students was that our responses ""appeared to be drawn not from the reading, but from a summary or AI-generated summary of the reading,"" which was vague, unsubstantiated, and also not what we received disciplinary action for.

While QHSS may be ranked as the #1 high school, there are serious problems that get swept under the rug by the administration. Two years ago, students protested against our principal’s incompetence, and this recent situation only highlights those ongoing issues.

So, if you’re unsure about applying to QHSS or debating how to rank it on your high school application, I urge you to consider everything I’ve said.

This is a throwaway account, but I hope it helps someone make an informed decision."
1g6wleg,1,2024-10-18,Compsci101 success story,u/atomicbomb2150,universityofauckland,https://www.reddit.com/r/universityofauckland/comments/1g6wleg/compsci101_success_story/,"To all my fans and haters reading this post, test 4 of compsci101 was finished a few days ago and I want you all to know that I have finally passed Compsci101. As a student who failed Compsci101 in the first semester but passed in the second, I’ve realized how much coding has changed my life. Here’s my story on what I did to succeed in this course: starting at around June or July (I don’t remember the exact month, but it was either one of the two), I stopped using social media that wasted a lot of my time, such as Discord, Instagram, and Snapchat. Not once during those four or five months did I log into my accounts on those platforms. Instead, I used social media that helped me improve my coding skills, like YouTube and Reddit. Additionally, rather than spending time chatting on Discord or any social media that eats up my time, I used those hours to learning the basics of Python and practicing how to code in Python. I continuously practiced almost every day for more than two hours and I didn't stop there, because when I got stuck on a particular question or didn’t know how to solve a Python question on Coderunner, I used ChatGPT as a tool to give me the solution and help me understand how to do it, and then I wrote the code myself (not by copy-pasting the code onto Coderunner, but by genuinely writing it out even if I were to copy it). Also I used AI, like ChatGPT, to explain what went wrong with my code and why the error occurred whenever I encounter an error or problem with my code. This helped me learn from my mistakes and avoid repeating them in the future. That’s how I managed to improve significantly in Python coding. And I also occasionally watched YouTube videos to enhance my skills further or ask people on Reddit if I am unsure about something.

After passing this course this semester, I realized the mistakes I made last semester that prevented me from succeeding. The main issue was that I didn’t even try to code or write programs in Python myself, instead, I relied entirely on ChatGPT for solutions. Then I would copy and paste the code from ChatGPT into Coderunner to answer the questions. That made me realize and understand that I am actually not learning anything if I just copy and pasting code to answer the questions on Codeunnrer. This semester though, I recognized that this approach was not helping me learn or improve my coding skills. So I changed and I treat ChatGPT as a tool to assist my learning. Whenever I’m stuck on a question, I use it to ask for help, then I wrote the code myself to understand and learn how to do it. If I make a mistake when writing it, I look back and see what went wrong, and sometimes, I take the opportunity to learn from it. And I was extremely motivated and self-disciplined to pass this course. This change in my approach has significantly improved my coding skills. 

My overall grade in Compsci101 this semester was a B-, but I believe I could have performed much better if I hadn’t been in the morning labs or had anxiety about failing the course a second time. Typically, I am not a morning person, so I tend to have difficulty waking up early in the morning. Without enough sleep, I can’t function properly. Being in the morning classes meant waking up early, which left me sleep-deprived. This sleep deprivation affected my mood and concentration, leading to drowsiness and itchy eyes, all of which impacted my overall performance on tests. Most of the time, I attended labs after 1PM, but I had to take the tests during my lab time due to the rules. Out of the four tests, my highest score was 7/10, while my lowest was 5/10. I didn’t manage to get more than 7 questions right or fewer than 5 in any of the four tests. Also I tend to have anxiety especially if I have morning tests or exams because I'm afraid I might fail the course a second time or forget everything. If only I hadn’t been in the morning classes or didn't have anxiety, I feel like I could have done better and achieved a higher overall grade, sad I only got B-, but I manage to pass somehow.

Also Mathmokiwi and everyone who said this course is easy, you guys were right, compsci101 ain't this difficult as long as a student spends the time practicing and learning how to code in Python, anyone could easily pass the course.

After passing compsci101, it made me realize that there is no course at UoA that I cannot pass, as long as I put in the time and effort into each and every one of my courses, I can easily pass it."
1g6x2nx,84,2024-10-18,More detail on Waymo's new AI Foundation Model for autonomous driving,u/diplomat33,SelfDrivingCars,https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfDrivingCars/comments/1g6x2nx/more_detail_on_waymos_new_ai_foundation_model_for/,"""Waymo has developed a large-scale AI model called the Waymo Foundation Model that supports the vehicle’s ability to perceive its surroundings, predicts the behavior of others on the road, simulates scenarios and makes driving decisions. This massive model functions similarly to large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, which are trained on vast datasets to learn patterns and make predictions. Just as companies like OpenAI and Google have built newer multimodal models to combine different types of data (such as text as well as images, audio or video), Waymo’s AI integrates sensor data from multiple sources to understand its environment.  
  
The Waymo Foundation Model is a single, massive-sized model, but when a rider gets into a Waymo, the car works off a smaller, onboard model that is “distilled” from the much larger one — because it needs to be compact enough in order to run on the car’s power. The big model is used as a “Teacher” model to impart its knowledge and power to smaller ‘Student’ models — a process widely used in the field of generative AI. The small models are optimized for speed and efficiency and run in real time on each vehicle—while still retaining the critical decision-making abilities needed to drive the car.  
  
As a result, perception and behavior tasks, including perceiving objects, predicting the actions of other road users and planning the car’s next steps, happen on-board the car in real time. The much larger model can also simulate realistic driving environments to test and validate its decisions virtually before deploying to the Waymo vehicles. The on-board model also means that Waymos are not reliant on a constant wireless internet connection to operate — if the connection temporarily drops, the Waymo doesn’t freeze in its tracks.""

1g70ga6,1,2024-10-18,ChatGPT,u/Expensive-Taste-361,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1g70ga6/chatgpt/,"Alright, I know some of you are still stuck in your ivory towers, clutching your red pens and crying “plagiarism!” at every technological advancement. But let’s be honest for a second: the way we’re assessing students is outdated. It’s 2024, and we’re still pretending that making students memorize and regurgitate is preparing them for the real world? Spoiler alert: it’s not.

I’ve been in academia for quite some time. Here’s an uncomfortable truth: ChatGPT is smarter than most of us in certain areas. It’s more efficient at processing data, generating ideas, and honestly, probably writing better essays than half the ones we get. Why are we treating this like a problem? Why are we pretending that companies in the real world aren’t using AI every day to make better, faster decisions? If we’re actually educating students, shouldn’t we be teaching them how to leverage these tools instead of acting like they’re some kind of academic bogeyman?

Let’s be real here—how many of you are mad because ChatGPT threatens your entire “sage on the stage” approach to teaching? Afraid that your precious lectures are suddenly irrelevant? Or worse, worried that maybe your students are getting more out of a chatbot than from your “wisdom”?

I’ll say it: if a machine can do the job you’re asking students to do, maybe it’s time to rethink the assignment, not ban the machine. Isn’t it time we challenge our students in ways that reflect the actual world they’re entering, instead of clinging to some nostalgic notion of education from the 90s?

Stop penalizing students for using AI and start asking them to do things AI can’t. You’re not helping anyone by forcing them to write mind-numbing papers that only prove they can sit at a desk for hours doing something a chatbot could do in seconds. The future is AI-driven, and if we’re not preparing our students for that, we’re failing them.

But sure, keep handing out those Scantrons and 10-page papers on theories no one outside of academia cares about. Meanwhile, the rest of us will be preparing our students for the world they’ll actually live in.

Change is hard, I get it—but the fact that so many of you are so resistant to this just shows how badly we need it."

1g731d5,1,2024-10-19,MY THOUGHTS ABOUT THE HORROR STORIES NICHE on YouTube,u/apetri92,NewTubers,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewTubers/comments/1g731d5/my_thoughts_about_the_horror_stories_niche_on/,"Hey I\`ve checked a few small-medium competitors for you and here are my thoughs for you to consider:  
  
You can beat the competition in ALL niches. There is only 1 difference: your chances based on competition and based on your skills & knowledge & dedication.   
  
You need to check how much the trending players earn first. How long have they been around, what\`s their ca cost and if it\`s worth for you?   
  
So what would be my checkpoints?   
  
CHECK TRENDING CHANNELS  
If you find small channels with sub/views anomaly, that\`s the first great sign. It means they have multiple more views per video than subscribers + these videos were published in the past 12 months.   
  
I\`ve quickly checked it for you.   
Mr. Night Scares and Midnight Horror, Whisper Stories channels are good small example channels constantly beating its sub count. So might still a viable niche with higher chances to penetrate.   
  
YOUR REVENUES?  
Check monthly views, like Whisper Stories pulls in 300k views / month and if RPM is 5, then it\`s only  $1,500. If you cannot monetize with alternative ways, like merch, affiliate marketing, then it may not be the revenue stream you are looking for. This channel has been there for 1 year now... I would not be satisfied with this revenue after 1 year, would you?   
  
Mr Night Scares pulled in 1.5M views in the last 3 months, meaning they made ca $7,500 which is better. Considering it\`s a trending channel that\`s not bad, especially considering it came from 24 videos only, so 8/month, so they pull in about $300/video. Would that be worth for you? What is your cost?  They have been around for 1.5 years, if you can make $1,500 after tax per month, would that be worth for you?  
  
YOUR COST?   
Since it\`s AI driven, the only cost is your time and AI subscriptions (ca about $200/mo considering the length of the videos) If you are great in CapCut cool, you can make a lot of videos. If you \`re not, then learn it or outsource, but it\`s more expensive. Script is super easy with chatgpt or Matt\`s program, VO is super straightforward with Elevenlabs, footages with Leonardo AI, and you do title + topic research + thumbnail in CANVA.   
  
COMPETITION?  
Be careful with video length: if your competition is making 2-3 hrs+ videos, your cost may be quite high to beat them. Also it takes much more effort to make longer videos.   
  
On the other hand, who would want to listen to horror stories for 3 hrs+? Does it make sense to your avatar/viewer?  
  
IF YOU SAY YES, LET\`S DO IT!  
  
INNOVATE?  
You can add a talking avatar to innovate the niche or any other edges to stand out. Can you innovate? With a different text style, with different footage style, VO style, editing style. Can you cross innovate from another niche you like?   
  
INTRO?  
First 30-60 seconds will have 80% impact whether your channel will be successful. So spend 80% of your time on the first 60 seconds + TITLE + THUMBNAIL and you increase your winning chances by 80%.  
  
Personally, I would not do it! Revenue stream does not seem too high after 1+ years for trending small-medium channels. There should be better niches. It\`s also quite easy and simple to do.   
  
It\`s good for someone who has the team already! And they can just outsource the whole process. And may be good for students with unlimited time for practising and establishing some $$$s. For 9to5ers with some cash there should be better niches 🙂  
  
Hope it helps! Let me know if something is not clear

1g78nic,193,2024-10-19,Today I took the HSK6 exam (again)! Here's my postmortem.,u/BeckyLiBei,ChineseLanguage,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/1g78nic/today_i_took_the_hsk6_exam_again_heres_my/,"First, my previous marks:

- July 2021: HSK5: listening 86; reading 75; writing 88.  (total 248 = 82%)  Postmortem [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/omq7cw/today_i_took_the_hsk5_exam_heres_my_postmortem/).

- March 2022: HSK6: listening 52; reading 63; writing 55.  (total 170 = 57%)  Postmortem [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/toio6w/today_i_took_the_hsk6_exam_heres_my_postmortem/).

- October 2022: HSK6: listening 56; reading 55; writing 45. (total 156 = 52%)  (I didn't to a postmortem for the second time; it was quite upsetting getting worse marks after 8 months of full-time study.)

Two years of full-time Chinese study later, this was my third time taking the HSK6.


**How did I do?**

I did as good as I could hope for in the reading and writing sections.  The reading section I timed to perfection (doing the sections backwards: 4, 3, 2, 1)---the lady announced there was 5 minutes left when I had 3 语病 questions unanswered.  The writing section this time was much easier than the last two times I took it (I think there was only one proper noun in the whole exam, and it wasn't essential to narrate the story), so that was just pure luck.  The handwriting was not an obstacle for me; normally, if I forget how to handwrite a character, I can switch to a synonym and/or rephrase the sentence, but there wasn't really any characters I needed to handwrite which I couldn't handwrite.  (The real problem with the handwritten exam is editing.)

My listening section was not ideal, but that's expected as it's my weakness.  Occasionally the audio contained the answer word for word, but usually you have to understand what was said and infer the correct answer.  There were two ""不 questions"" in the listening section (which option is incorrect).  This time, there were no technical difficulties with the recording.

For the HSK6, I feel like my marks this time are as good as I can achieve at my current level.  I was considering taking the HSK6 again (just in case), but I do not believe I'd get better marks just through luck.  (If my marks are poor, I think next time I'll take it in Australia, and see if there's any truth to the notion that it's easier outside of China.)

This is my third time taking the handwritten HSK6 in China, and I'm yet to see anyone who didn't look east Asian.  The exam in Qingdao took place at a Korean school, so most (maybe all) were children with Korean passports.  (There was a lady from El Salvador in the HSKK高级, however.)

It was also my first time taking the HSKK高级, which I did absolutely disasterously on.  For the first two 复述 (""re-narrate"") questions, I basically said a few key words and gave up.  The HSKK高级 audio seemed to be harder than the HSK6 audio.  I spoke with 4 students who took the HSKK高级 with me, and they also said they had no idea what was said in the 复述 section.  Maybe it's just sour grapes, but this seems like a poorly designed exam.  Certainly, my marks on this exam won't reflect my oral Chinese level.

*My HSK6 mark predictions*: listening 65%, reading 80%, writing 70%.  [The marks will be published: 19th of November.]  Last time I overestimated my marks significantly, so maybe I'm doing the same this time (maybe -10% from all three estimates to account for this).


**How did I prepare this time?**

I took something like 20 classes on iTalki with [Jenny Chen](https://www.italki.com/en/teacher/1294454) who helped me with the HSK6 and HSKK高级 specifically.  (I used 并 and 于是 on today's exam because of her feedback on my writing.)  I had several other iTalki teachers along the way too.

As usual, I studied multiple textbooks.  I studied the New Practical Chinese Reader 5, from start to finish (spending something like 8+ hours per chapter).  I also re-studied all 40 chapters of the HSK6 Standard Course textbooks (digging much deeper than before; usually I spent 10 hours per chapter).  I tried 《新汉语水平考试教程》 but I couldn't find the mp3s, so it wasn't much use for me.  (Out of curiosity, I tried doing the listening section without the mp3, and got 38/75 = 50% before I got bored, which is a bit unsettling.)

Two years ago, I thought the HSK6 Standard Course Workbook exercises were too hard.  Here's my marks this time around (only including the listening and reading sections; not under exam conditions):

上: 1. 83% 2. 75% 3. 75% 4. 83% 5. 89% 6. 86% 7. 78% 8. 89% 9. 95% 10. 86% 11. 92% 12. 95% 13. 75% 14: 56% 15: 75% 16: 72% 17: 83% 18: 75% 19: 89% 20: 83%

下: 21. 72% 22. 78% 23. 67% 24. 69% 25. 72% 26. 78% 27. 75% 28. 64% 29. 67% 30. 78% 31. 83% 32. 81% 33. 69% 34: 58% 35: 81% 36: 69% 37: 75% 38: 86% 39: 83% 40: 94%

Note the inconsistent marks (e.g., in section 14 I got 56% and in section 40 I got 94%).  Some of these questions felt unhelpful, and even demotivating (especially when they deliberately set ""traps"" rather than help you learn Chinese).

There's a mock exam at the end of the HSK6 Standard Course Workbook; I got: listening 78%, reading 88%.  I did the writing sections throughout too, but they were unmarked (ChatGPT gave me feedback though).  I usually found I mis-handwrote two or three characters, and made some poor word choices and clunky grammar choices, but there's not much I can do to improve this without additional years of practice.

I did the 汉语水平考试真题集 HSK 六级 2018版 Official Examination Papers of HSK (Level 6) again, but untimed this time.  It contains 5 HSK6 exam papers from 2018.  My marks this time:

1: 听力: 86% 阅读: 88%  [2022 marks: 听力: 66% 阅读: 64%]
2: 听力: 90% 阅读: 90%  [2022 marks: 听力: 74% 阅读: 68%]
3: 听力: 88% 阅读: 90%  [2022 marks: 听力: 64% 阅读: 76%]
4: 听力: 84% 阅读: 92%  [2022 marks: 听力: 64% 阅读: 70%]
5: 听力: 78% 阅读: 80%  [2022 marks: 听力: 64% 阅读: 70%]

I tested my handwriting with the 3018 simplified characters in Heisig and Richardson's *Remembering Simplified Hanzi* (which splits into two volumes, the first with 1500 characters); I turned it into a handwriting printout (posted [here](https://www.chinese-forums.com/forums/topic/63251-handwriting-practice-with-heisigs-character-list)).  I think I did this 3 times over (I did 100 characters each morning for a few months).  I estimate I can handwrite maybe 85% of the first volume, and maybe 40% of the second volume.

The other major change in my study was ChatGPT.  ChatGPT has massively increased my reading volume.  ChatGPT was especially helpful for actionable feedback in the writing section.  Nowadays, using headphones and a lapel mic, I talk with ChatGPT (the free version) for 2+ hours straight, and it barely feels like I'm studying.  ChatGPT is also rather encouraging.

I read all sorts of things, such as 《锐阅读》 (which contains articles suited for Chinese middle-school students), or news articles on Sohu (I feel some of the HSK6 contents are copy/pasted from sites like this), or I'd get ChatGPT to convert r/todayilearned posts into HSK6 reading material, or I'd just read novels.  I make sure I have no ""I've read nothing today"" days.

It seems when studying vocabulary, I've gone through three phases: (a) initial study of the word, (b) becoming more familiar with the word through input, (c) studying the word to exhaustion.  This way, if you tell me an incorrect meaning of a word, I no longer think ""maybe it's a rare usage I don't know"", and now think ""no, I know all the meanings of this word, that's not one of them"".  This helps a lot with sections 1 (""faulty sentence"") and 2 (""fill in the blanks"") in the HSK6 reading section.

I also got into Genshin Impact, and some of its stories are quite entertaining (Kachina's storyline especially), which provided a fair amount of listening practice.  And the characters actually react to what is being said, which helps understanding.  I feel the small subtitles on my phone are unpleasant to read, so I'd rather just listen.  This game is a bit of a double-edged sword though, because a lot of the time you're not learning Chinese, and you're saving primogems to pull for Nahida in the 5.2 update.


**Did I improve over the two-year gap?**

Absolutely!  When studying the listening section, I often repeated what I heard in the audio into English in my YouTube videos, which I would not have been able to do if I were just listening for keywords.  I listen with the aim of understanding what they're saying.  My reading speed has increased to the point where I didn't feel rushed in today's exam (although I didn't have time to dilly dally).  Having read lots, I've become familiar with collocations, so I zip through part 2 in the reading section (I can sometimes deduce how to fill in the blanks without even looking at the answers).  My writing has improved, but the HSK6 writing section is just one silly ""abridge"" task and nothing else (sometimes I call it the ""second reading section""); my improvements in writing are more like building suspense, conveying emotion, character developement, pursuasive writing, plot twists, etc., which does nothing for my marks in the HSK6 writing section where I'm instructed to mentally copy/paste some uninspiring story.  ([Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WriteStreakCN/comments/1frwapc/i_wrote_a_satirical_mock_hsk6_question/)'s an example of my writing.)

There was an important change in my study mindset: **I'm not learning Chinese to take the HSK6, I'm taking the HSK6 to help me learn Chinese.**  So...

1. I didn't practice under exam conditions, but studied past/mock exam papers with the goal of learning as much as possible (I can get 80%+ with unlimited time; I just need to get faster [I have the theory, but not the practice]);

2. when I was in the exam, I didn't feel stressed because the HSK6 is merely a tool to help me learn Chinese, and my Chinese has objectively improved regardless of my HSK6 marks;

3. the reduction in stress led to better concentration during the exam;

4. and if I want better HSK6 marks, then I will genuinely improve my Chinese skills, which will have long-term benefits.

I wish I had had this realization years earlier.


The first time I took the HSK6, I wrote:

> If I had a time machine, I would go back and tell myself not to think about the HSK6 until (a) my vocabulary is above 20000 (characters above 3000), (b) I've read 10 million characters worth of input, and (c) my reading speed is 160+ characters per minute.

What about now?  My (passive) vocabulary is in the ballpark of 15000 words, and I probably know a bit more than 3000 characters (it becomes meaningless to count words at this level: you know so many variants of words, and so many proper nouns, your vocabulary size is determined by your choice of dictionary).  So 20000 words is too many.  While 15000 words doesn't guarantee I know every word on the HSK6, I read with relative ease today's HSK6 exam (although there were some unknown words on the HSKK高级), so I don't think 15000 words is necessary.  Still knowing 15000 words helps a lot on the HSK6 exam.

Did I read 10 million characters worth of input?  Over 2 years, that's 13700 characters per day, so probably no.  I'd guess in total I've read more than 10 million characters by now (but it's not like I keep track [I wish there were a browser extension that just counted how many characters you've read]).

PS. I have noticed there's a HSK7-9 exam where I live (in three weeks).  Do you think I should ""YOLO"" it?  I will almost surely not pass, but it might be worthwhile getting an idea of what the exam is like for a future, more serious attempt."

My intent with that removed post was simply to document all of the appearances as that phrase, as combined with 七花八裂 and 七穿八穴, these phrases appear in over 25% of the Blue Cliff Record, which also is a book that states the eight consciousnesses transforming into the fourfold wisdom is Buddha (Vairocana), we know it's essential as a teaching to Zen, is Huineng's verse that enlightened a student, etc. 

I have posited that these phrases are drawing upon the eight consciousness model, which is what I wanted to examine, but had to first lay out information for context. It's pretty hard to write a book report in such condensed space, and with high expectations on the reader to have read all you have -- which is silly, so I present the information so we're all equally read.

In the original Odes to 100 Standards of which the BCR is based, there's the case 16 *Bodhisattva's Enter the Bath*:

>In ancient times there were 16 bodhisattvas. At the time for monks to bathe they followed the custom and entered the bath, and **suddenly awoke by the primary cause of water**.

>All you Virtuous Ones of Zen, how do you make it alive to comprehend them saying, “**The wonderful touch proclaims the brilliance and becomes the abode of the Buddha's children.**”

>Also, \[**you\] must do eight holes in seven borings to begin to get it**.

This case was my first encounter with the phrase 七穿八穴 (seven penetrations, eight holes) which appeared first in the Transmission of the Lamp, it is a phrase pointing at the eight consciousnesses, and there are links that can be made between it and Vairocana, etc. And we can discuss the evidence. 

Winter gets assigned to the same direction as water, Akshobhya (whose name means ""mirror like wisdom""), and winter is death (samadhi), the earth's waters freeze and form a mirror reflecting cosmic space emptiness, Vairocana, etc. Eighth consciousness is the Mirror Wisdom, etc. as laid out in previous posts and as repeated by Zen masters.

As it is important for context of beginning this investigation, I've re-posted the breakout of the 12 times 七縱八橫 in the BCR as suggested by u/GreenSage. Now to see if this one is as intrinsically linked to the eight consciousnesses as 七穿八穴 can be demonstrably shown to be. Here is [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/sourcemirror/comments/1g79wim/repost_bcr_investigations_pt_5/), & [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/sourcemirror/comments/1g79xor/bcr_investigation_pt_6_seven_traversing_eight/) of those instances. (Also, probably nearing post limit already - which is why I make use of the ""pt"" series so there doesn't have to be constant context providing). 

So I wanted to begin exploring this foreign phrase to me 七縱八橫 - it appears in 鎮州臨濟慧照禪師語錄 (*Record of the Sayings of Chan Master Linji Huizhao of Zhenzhou*), and also in Yunmen's 雲門匡真禪師廣錄.

We will likely have to investigate in the comments as the removal of my last post required me to provide further context in this than was required, or intended to be discussed.

Here's a snippet of the above Yunmen passage translated into English by ChatGPT:

>The monk asked, “What is the single sentence by which the master guides people?”

>The master said, “The heart does not betray others, and the face shows no shame.”

>The monk quickly bowed three times.

>The monk asked, “What is the natural matter?”

>The master said, “What are you doing stepping forward?”

>The monk asked, “What is the meaning of the teachings?”

>The master said, “If you’ve chewed your tongue, bring another question.”

>The monk asked, “What does ‘seven verticals and eight horizontals’ mean?”

>The master said, “I’ll let you make a move.

With that move, the master ended the dialogue. Where did the question arise from? Why did the monk randomly ask about a no-meaning common use idiom (similar to ""raining cats and dogs"") in his AMA with his master, asking 問如何是七縱八橫 and then falling into silence with the master's response?

1g7fim5,5,2024-10-19,Starting college all over again at 25yrs/26yrs old,u/Zaekil,Adulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1g7fim5/starting_college_all_over_again_at_25yrs26yrs_old/,"Hello,

To put everything into conext, I never had issues during high school, even at my 1st college year I successfully passed when I was 19yrs old. I started going to college as early as I got out of High School, going to study near Paris (I come from Britanny in France) to get a 2 yrs diploma studying industrial, electrical and computing science and then planned to enter an engineering school skipping the 2 first years or doing a thesis in Ingeeering Science / Physic. 

Depression came around when I started my 2nd year and I just couldn't at the same time work evening shifts at mcdonald's, studying + going to college 5 and a half day a week (I also had classes on Saturday). My teachers there were the nicest I've ever had and I love electronics, physics etc all this stuff. My brain just couldn't deal with emotional depression and social anxiety. I started doing lots of sh*t things, dating lots and lots of people via twitter back at the time and tinder, I drank a lot (it helped me get rid of social anxiety to meet new people), did dr*gs, a lot. 
I just worked and stayed there at my college appartment (15m² in the middle of a big city with tall buildings and I can't say nights there were calm, quite the opposite, coming from country side it's was as tiring with all the noise but also exciting as I could go and see my fav bands for cheap money, saw Ghost there many times, french bands, a lot of well known bands at the Download fest in 2018 etc).

I did a ""ceasure"" year after quitting college in 2nd year, just worked at mcdo etc. Then I thought to myself I could directly go to a 2nd year licence in programming in uni this time around, as the former college I attended was connected. I had a letter from my former teachers referring me as a good student and I could easily directly go to 2nd licence year. 

Well... It didn't get better, I had lighter week with only 21-25hrs of classes instead of 42-46hrs I did every week before. Depression was still around, I was emotionally dependant on the few girlfriends I got with during all these dates. Did some legal medical dr*gs overdose, same with illegal stuff, tried to commit suic*de multiple times, went into a coma. Stayed at a hospital for more than a month to check if all my organs were recovering etc.. 

I tried 3 times to pass my 2nd programming year but to no avail. I also learned that uni's not for me and I mostly like Physics/electronics/low lvl programming oriented machine more than high lvl programming and the math lvl wasn't the same as well. 

Went back to parents house, lived there since then (Nov 2021), time passed, depression still went on, I tried working almost everywhere, but didn't like it at all. I really wanted to go back and study again.

And now : here I am, starting from scratch with a low tierd entry lvl degree I have to pass in 2 years meant for people who didn't pass the same ""elite"" scientifical engineering High School diploma as I did. (I tried to apply for same degree I did back in 2017 where I successfully passed the 1st year but got refused as I didn't have any recent enough good marks) 

The 2 years degree takes place inside a High School, I'm the oldest of my class (25) and also oldest of all other post HS courses available here. 

I don't have any difficulties whatsoever in all classes (like math/physics/electronics/english etc and it's kind of boring to me actually) but the issue is my social anxiety kicks in even more when I feel the generation gap between those doing the same degree as me (they're 18-20 max) and obviously the teenagers we encounter all day long in this high school (14-18). 

Every WE I'm crying because of how I screwed up so badly during my inital post HS formation and delayed everything for so many years. I'm also crying because of too much social interactions and feeling the gap between them and me. I grew up with much older brothers than me (9 to 19yrs older than me) who used to play games on first computers before internet arrived, they introduced me to games culture before 1999 (the year I was born) etc. So the generation gap is even more. 

During my high school years and my college ones, chatgpt etc weren't popular or nearly as developmed as now, and even tho I'm a very new tech savvy guy I didn't use all of this during my school years and din't even catch up to this until now when they are all using it. I'm already feeling so old and distanced from people that are ""only 5 to 7 yrs younger than me""..

I just don't know what to do, it's as the same time scaring me, and also making feel tired everyday like I had to be a teacher all days with kids who don't know how to behave as well... 

Do you have some advices for me.. ?

(sorry for my english, my sleeping meds are starting to kick in and I don't have a very rich vocabulary in english either) "
1g7ir31,41,2024-10-19,CS7641 Assignment 1 - Claude and GPT vs TA on Meeting Project Requirements,u/gmdtrn,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/1g7ir31/cs7641_assignment_1_claude_and_gpt_vs_ta_on/,"I hope this stimulates some interesting discussion. There has long been a history people complaining about fairly inappropriate grading in ML (and to be fair, in other classes) where there assumed to be a relatively high component of RNG in the grade. I'll be honest, I just assumed this was the case of the standard disgruntled student who lacked insight into their work quality and waved it off with full confidence that work well done would be well rewarded. 

Until it was my turn. 

The feedback I received had effectively zero value. In fact, the contents of my report were at odds with the feedback. Initially I was under the impression it was some sort of mistake and the wrong grade was submit because the discrepancy was so high. But, eventually the TA doubled down on the score despite being provided with a point-by-point breakdown of where their feedback was completely inconsistent with the reports contents. 

For context, in ML we are given a project description document (PDF) and a FAQ on EdDiscussion. The actual rubric is hidden from students, and a closely guarded secret. And, there is an official no regrade policy, meaning nobody else is allowed to weigh in on your report to challenge the feedback and grade produced by the TA responsible for grading your paper. 

With that, I crafted a series of prompts and provided them to both Claude and GPT4. I provided the FAQ and PDF along with my report. Here  are the prompts.

Prompt 1

>Here you are given a paper crafted by a student, document that has an overview for the assignment, and an FAQ provided by teaching staff for the students to reference in the assignment. You can assume the student created the README.txt, had executable code, included a link to overleaf, and included their most recent Git commit hash. Use the assignment overview document and FAQ to review the student report to ensure they met the core requirements.

Prompt 2

>According to a TA's analysis based on the hidden rubric, the student was given a score of 58 of 105 available points. The student only had access to the FAQ and project document, again, the rubric is hidden. Please give your position on this result.

Here are the responses from Claude and GPT 4o, respectively.

To be fair, I don't care that much about the grade my career is set and I'm here as a motivated life-long learner. It's the principle of the matter that gets to me.

With that, I will throw out there that my immediate response was to be angry. That's a personal flaw of mine, and I of course do not advise people to do that. However, my experience along with the history of complaints is strong evidence for a real systemic failure thats negatively impacting students. And, so long as people are afraid to (kindly) raise your concerns to authoritative figures, the issue is unlikely to change. I do believe quite strongly that the program and course leadership do have the best interest of students in mind. However, they're reasonably likely to work under the assumption that their policies are not flawed so long as they're not getting critical feedback supported by objective evidence. 

My hope is to inspire more people to take the time and make the effort to formulate a strong foundation for their argument about failing policy believing that the leadership will respond in good faith. It is worth the time even if we do not benefit personally. OMSCS offers an amazing opportunity to move a step closer to democratized access to affordable high value education. And, I'm sure we all enjoy seeing our peers succeed. I know I find value in and spend a lot of time in mutually beneficial conversations with my peers. "

So recently I took a test and wrote code for the practical portion but when handing it in I was hit with an integrity misconduct. The person infront of me was having issues with his code and during his demonstration the teacher checked his browsing history and saw that it was completely empty, he took a photo of the history and resulted resulted in the student being issued a misconduct. When it was my turn to present to him the code, he went through it and found little mistakes but then unprompted he searched my history and took a photo of it and then said I got a misconduct, the person behind me also faced the same thing for having chatgpt open from another course which he closed it. The professor wasn't searching everyone's laptops, only certain people's laptops, I know this because I asked one of my friends whether he was searched and he was said no he wasn't searched. So I was wondering whether this was allowed or not? Is it a violation of my privacy or are college professors allowed to search someone's personal laptops? Does he need probable cause to search? "

I’m Ravi, from a small village near Jaipur, Rajasthan. I come from a traditional farming family, where the only ""respectable"" career path is a government job. My parents, like many others here, constantly pressure me to prepare for government job exams, but the truth is, I have zero interest in that life. It feels suffocating to be pushed into something I don’t believe in.

I was a bright student from the beginning. I was a student at the University of Rajasthan, but after two years, I dropped out because I knew that college wasn’t for me. I’m more interested in **cybersecurity, AI, and building real-world digital skills**. Over the years, I’ve picked up a wide range of skills, including:

* **SEO** and digital marketing (Google, Facebook, and Twitter Ads)
* **Managing social media accounts** to drive organic traffic
* **Content writing** and copywriting 
* **Cybersecurity**: Python, DDoS attacks, phishing, malware analysis, and I’ve had hands-on experience with some advanced tools, including **PEGASUS**.
* **Generative AI**: Leveraging AI tools like ChatGPT, Midjourney, and others to create graphics, content, and automation.

In 2022, I had a great learning experience doing a **3-month internship in SEO and digital marketing** with a Dubai-based company. But my real passion lies in **data**. I truly believe that **data is the new oil** and the future of business.

Recently, I partnered with a friend from Estonia to launch an international dropshipping eCommerce store called **PlantTerra** (https://plantterra.shop/), where we sell live plants for home décor. It's been a challenging process, especially sourcing live plants from China, but I’m determined to make it work.

Unfortunately, life hasn’t been easy. My family doesn’t support my path, and they’ve even said things like, “Why can’t you just die if you don’t want a government job?” I don’t believe in giving up, but I do feel the mental weight of their expectations every day. I’ve made up my mind to leave home soon—not to run away from responsibilities, but to build my own future on my terms.

So, I’m putting this out there: **I’m looking for a job**. Any opportunity, big or small, that could help me stabilize and continue growing my skills would mean the world to me. I have the drive, and the passion, and I’m willing to hustle hard until I can eventually build something of my own.

I don’t need anything long-term; just something that gives me the runway I need to work on my **e-commerce dreams** and continue learning.

And please, no shady offers. I’ve had enough bad experiences, and I’m here to work honestly and ethically.

Thank you for reading this, and I’d really appreciate any guidance, leads, or opportunities that come my way.

1g7qwj7,1,2024-10-20,"What is up with the so called self proclaimed "" Strong Independent Woman"" a trend very common in recent Gen z and millennial women who are working in a job. I have described a strong Reality check to these women in this post. what are you guys' opinions on this ? Please let me know.",u/Lazy-Discipline-4203,sunraybee,https://www.reddit.com/r/sunraybee/comments/1g7qwj7/what_is_up_with_the_so_called_self_proclaimed/,"I think Diversity hiring is unfair and is a discrimination towards Men and discredits meritocracy and has social implications.  
The job market is very tight since last 15-20 months, But Many foreign companies in India especially the American and European continue to aggressively push diversity hiring that many capable male candidates are left unplaced and Girls even with slightly less skill get easily employed. Since foreign companies have better pay and facilities than Indian counterparts, this creates a social imbalance as men earning less than girls or men working in low grade indian companies will be viewed as failed or worthless and Girls' ego boosts as she proclaims herself as a ""Strong Independent Girl"" which actually is a delusion and such girls think ""Males are inferior to them"" and they become entitled and feel that they must dream big and talk about My career My career shit while boys still thinking about Family's economic situation in tough market.

Example: Literally every 2nd girl in this university called ""IGDTUW"" is placed in Microsoft , Uber , Amazon , CISCO to the extent and quantity as if these companies were mass recruiters.

Of All my Guy and Girl acquaintances which had similar skillsets, almost all the girls have got placed very easily (even the girls with slightly less skills and projects) while guys still finding jobs thanks to ""THE RESERVATION GIRLS GET "" by many companies like EY, Deloitte, KPMG, S&P Global, CapGemini,Morgan Stanley , Goldman and Many more.

If Any of you people are working just check the proportion of females in HR/Operations roles into your company, the proportion of females so damn high like 70-80% as if HR positions in a company too are reserved for Women.

Infact during placement drives there are many companies who conduct ""Women only"" drives and straightaway exclude men from the hiring process.

So all the working women before proclaiming yourself as ""Strong Independent OverAchiever"" wake upto the reality. A lot of girls are gifted Jobs , they didnot earn it.

See the Data , the fresher Job placements for females skyrocketed despite overall weak job creation. This shows that A lot more number of women are hired than men even though there are 3-4 times more men in higher education and job seekers, This proves that women are hired at the expense of men.

1g7rtt0,4,2024-10-20,Second Semester Exams Not Going Well. ,u/TheBlueHeeler,StudentNurse,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentNurse/comments/1g7rtt0/second_semester_exams_not_going_well/,"     If you have time to read this, and possibly contribute in a meaningful way, i appreciate your wisdom. I’m in my second semester of a 15 month RN program. (not bsn). It’s a concept based program. Two full lessons a week with multiple topics. I want to preface by saying i have been in pre-hospital care since 2008 doing EMS, and for the past couple of years worked in an ER setting while i had been doing my pre-reqs and then applying for my program. 

     I’ve worked diligently and tirelessly all my life. I have the full support of my wife in this process, and recently after realizing the dedication it had taken to do this after the first semester i dropped to per-diem at my job. (One to two days a week max). I feel embarrassed by that in the event i don’t success with nursing, but i want to give myself the best chance for success. I now see as i go through the second semester what the instructors mean by, “it’s time to think more critically.”  I’ve failed my first two exams. And while i’m still in the running, i’m at a loss on what i need to be doing differently. My study methods that i used first semester aren’t helping me now. (It took me a few weeks to learn how to PROPERLY read the book and then take notes answering objectives). 

     As a well seasoned student, i stay humble in my years of experience. I don’t mention it unless asked. My clinical instructors have seen how well i do in the clinical setting. I participate and answer a large majority of the concept questions correctly in lecture or when i speak to my instructors about current topics we are learning. I try to never converse with an “i know” attitude and look at everything as a teachable moment. I’m humbled to get this opportunity finally, and try and redeem myself from being a terrible high school student years and years ago. (Not excited about the school loans part). 

      I don’t want to look at nursing school as your ability to take a test, but I’m simultaneously pragmatic too. I know there are those that are incredible test takers, and there are a lot of out there that question our abilities. I try not to change answers and i’ve tried to listen to any tips i can get. I worked hard over the years, worked in trenches where i’ve earned the respect of fantastic nurses, docs, rrts, and fellow emts and medics. They all believe in me. My wife believes in me. My family and friends believe in me. I’m starting to lose faith if i believe in me for always being the guy that was crap with a test. There’s not lack of commitment here. I want to prove everyone’s belief right. 

I’ve found that i can study with a max of 4-5 serious people if i’m lucky. Any more, and i get distracted by side conversations or others going back and forth about what value to remember or what condition correlates to what risk etc. I’m more of tactile/kinesthetic learner. I’ve always been good at the “on the job aspect” and then taking about it after. Does anyone have any tips on maybe how to study better, dont over/under do a certain aspect of studying, or possible key terms in exam questions etc? I’m all ears. Hat in hand. Either way, thanks for listening. No matter what happens stay in the grind. I’m not giving up, just upset at what i don’t know how to do right yet. Failing changes the journey, quitting changes the destination. 


Sidenote: I learned from my wife how to use chatgpt at the beginning of this semester. Hearing people talk about it is like hearing about how paper charting could never be replaced, cell phones would never work, or any other technological advance would be a downfall. Utilize your resources. Work smarter not harder. Break that weird cycle of “we had it tough, so you need to have it tough too.” I haven’t seen or heard of anyone “cheating” with it. I have it simplify terms for me to understand better. Preload, afterload, what different labs and electrolytes actually do etc. Some of us don’t always understand it the first time we read it in a medical textbook. If you’re pissed about AI, wait until you find out about the docs who look your issues up on google, procedures on youtube, or your nurse that constantly depends on help from other nurses because they were just good at “passing the exam”. Qualification doesn’t always mean competency. But if that’s what it takes than i’m willing to play by those rules so i can earn that respect as a nurse someday too. 

Thank you. Be excellent to each other. "

Shouldn't be paywalled. Either way, it really seems fucked six ways to Sunday that it doesn't matter that students probably know there are many logical reasons not to use them, but all that is overridden by the simple emotional reason of ""it's easier"".

I've seen other stuff on here that implies in the ten or so years I've graduated high school, education in America seems to have rapidly declined. It's really disheartening."
1g7scqt,1,2024-10-20,"Top of the Class to Bottom of the Heap, The SHS Reality Check",u/monstarifique,OffMyChestPH,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1g7scqt/top_of_the_class_to_bottom_of_the_heap_the_shs/,"I've recently noticed a lot of posts expressing frustrations about academics, almost very similar scenarios. It seems like the younger generation is really struggling to cope with college life, especially with their academic workload. Many of them excelled in senior high school (SHS), even graduating with honors, but once they enter college, the demands of their program seem to be a major culture shock. I find myself wondering why this is happening. Isn't SHS supposed to prepare students for college? I would think that having a longer preparation period would be an advantage and that by the time they reach college, they would be more mature in their thinking, considering they’re around 17-19 years old.

When I returned to my university for my master's degree, we had the opportunity to sit in on SHS classes as part of a study. The students were very participative and vocal—sometimes too vocal, to the point where they could come across as blunt. Some teachers even seemed a bit exasperated by their energy and bluntness. It struck me as odd because back in my day, we were so used to respecting our teachers, even when they were overly strict. We didn’t talk back or joke around with them, as it could be misinterpreted as rudeness. We just followed instructions and did our best.

However, I understand that times have changed, and today’s youth have more of a voice, which is great. But I’ve also noticed a lot of spoon-feeding still happening in SHS, and now with AI being so accessible, it seems like students are becoming more dependent on it. When used out of laziness, they may rely too much on tools like ChatGPT, and I’ve observed that some students really struggle to come up with ideas without AI assistance. It’s kind of sad to see. Don’t get me wrong—I use AI too, especially when I hit a mental block, but I don’t just copy-paste it as my output. Maybe it’s my ego, but I don’t want to be outdone by AI. Plus, I feel like it stifles creativity when you just copy-paste without putting in any effort.

I’m not saying all SHS students are like this, but in my experience, it’s becoming more common. Many struggle so much in college that they end up crying over it. When they experience failure, it hits them hard, and they find it difficult to bounce back. They get discouraged, lose their sense of fulfillment in academics, and sometimes things spiral—they fall into the wrong crowd or even stop attending school. I’ve also heard of cases where parents bring their kids to the dean to complain about failing grades, when in reality, the students didn’t meet deadlines or follow instructions. And we all know that college professors stand firm in their standards; there are no special treatments, no matter who your parents are.

I really hope CHED (the Commission on Higher Education) looks into this, because it’s alarming how many students graduate SHS with honors, only to struggle so much in college. Some even resort to extreme measures like suicide because they can’t handle the pressure. I’m not saying the old education system was better than the current one—they both have their pros and cons. But I do hope CHED takes notice and continues to improve the educational system, especially in SHS."

1g7ygs1,2,2024-10-20,"How did you convince yourself to get a PhD, despite all the negative reasons given to not pursue one?",u/BlueSea9357,PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1g7ygs1/how_did_you_convince_yourself_to_get_a_phd/,"- PhDs in most fields are told that they're not worth much to industry compared to masters/bachelors students. Even in a field that's good today, there is no guarantee it'll even exist 6 years from now.

- Academia is a dumpster fire, to put it mildly. Too many applicants, not enough jobs, extreme elitism, paid very little, and you're still bottom of the totem pole.

- Research jobs in industry are kind of antonyms, industries want immediate profit, and ""research"" isn't really a thing you can guarantee results from

- Master's student admissions are a piece of cake compared to PhD admissions, allowing them to focus purely on what they want to learn, instead of the huge barriers there are to a PhD program (e.g. Standford M.S. vs Harvard PhDs are in entirely different universes for applicant requirements, like the difference in difficulty between bachelors at a no-name school and admission into a medical school)

- Fudging of data and ChatGPT are probably taking their toll on how seriously outsiders take research. Only so much research data can be faked before it starts to reflect on everyone, even if most people don't do it.

How did you convince yourself to get a PhD? I really like learning more through an MS program, and research is okay, but it seems like most ""research"" careers are either dead end from the start, or you can quickly become useless if your topic of research is no longer relevant."

It will be an 8 week class rather than a 16 week class. In the regular class I give them exams in class and a short essay. It seems no matter what I do in the summer version it will be nowhere near as rigorous. Give them exams? They will look up the answers. Give them an essay? They will use chatgpt. 

So nasically, it seems like unless I come up with good ideas to keep them accountable, the summer students will have a much easier time with the course, which just seems blatently unfair.

Is there any way to avoid this? Is this something that is known by universities and the online classes are just offered without acknowledging that the on campus students are being held accountable while online students are not? Are inline classes basically a scam that everyone just hushes about? Thinking about not teaching the class, even though I could use the money."

**The star tarot card meaning and symbolism guide**



Lady: a lady without clothing is kneeling, she has nothing to hide and she symbolizes enlightening and the truth as her gold hair color. Her left leg is on the grass and the left leg is at the shallow water. Her main activity is to pour water from two cups which are actually big jugs from clay.



She has a little burden or in other words, the task is hard for her and this is why the lady is in a bending posture. Therefore it symbolize some kind of reward after you will finish the hard work, there is no shortcut, luck or free gifts in the specific star tarot card. Moreover she is pure and has good intentions, she is not manipulating or scheming bad plots, keeping the positive karma all around and spread it to nature.



She is looking at the water. In that sense the meaning of water is like a mirror, she actually looking on herself, what she is reflecting to the world she will get back from the universe. Whatever you focus on will grow, if you will be nice, people will be nice to you. If you will do bad things, karma will hunt you back some day. If you want to improve your life in any area like: love, relationship, occupation, health and money you need to work on yourself first.



The ground and the lake: are symbolism of our mind and subconscious. By pouring the water, the subconscious is feeding our thought with spiritual knowledge about the universe. The same process is also true vice versa. It works both ways, creating an endless loop of wisdom and should be done with lots of harmony. In this state we are balanced and feel our true life purpose. Those actions will attract hope, faith and positive energy. The stream of water is emotional and also intellectual.



Two jugs: the jug that pours water into the pond is symbolizing the connection of man or woman to a deity, goddess, god and the spiritual world. The other jug pouring water on the ground and therefore it has a meaning of connecting us to earth and the material world. More interpretation of the duality are: emotions and intellectual, inner issues vs outer circumstances, memories of the past versus manifestation of the future.



Star: stars symbolism is about spirituality, stars give us hope, fulfil our wishes and dreams and stability because they are always there sparkling at the sky. Another association of star is the ability to guide us like a compass, it helps us to navigate through the ups and downs of life. Star is also connected to astrology and hence might help in divination and predicting the future, even though you can never have a full description of the destiny.



The star tarot cart is number 17 and it come after the tower. The light of the tower card caused destruction and now, during the journey the fool meets the star and experience the enlightenment after the crisis.



In the tarot card we see a big yellow star and 7 little stars are surrounding it. Overall 8 stars, which connected numerologically to 17 (1+7=8). The number 8 symbolize rebirth, therefore the card is about creation of ideas and also manifestation here on earth. The 7 little stars related to the seven Chakras: crown, third eye, throat, heart, solar plexus, sacral and root. The yellow big star is the symbol of enlightenment.



Bird: the imagery of a red bird, peacock or a dove is the symbolism of peace and good news. It explained as a link between earth and the sky, creating harmony between the physical world and the spiritual beings. It also gives the feelings of accepting nature without conditions and lives in harmony with people and don’t judge them.



Tree: the tree in the star tarot card is not a mundane tree. It is actually the tree of life or the tree of knowledge. In Kabbalah the tree of life is formed by 10 spheres, these are the fundamental energies in the world, matching to the exact number of the flowers on the ground. If you will check those different energies you will know what is your mission in life, why you are here on earth, what you suppose to do and most important what is your special skill.



Flowers: in the star tarot card we see 10 little images of flowers on the grassy ground. The flowers are the symbolism of creativity, fertility and pregnancy. They are growing because they are located in an environment near water, the source of life and spiritual meaning. They are also the reward we are getting after we put a lot of hard work into something. Moreover it indicates the spring or summer season, it means that the timing is really good for you right now, at the present moment. And if you will play your cards right they will bloom into wonderful flowers in the near future.



Mountain: there are two mountains at the star tarot card. One is on the left colored in brown. The other one is actually a hill where the tree is at the top of it. Mountains are reoccurring theme on Rider Waite tarot deck. Their symbolism is clear view, being close to the souls in the skies, god, deities and inspiration.



If you will notice closely, there is no path, trail or road in the star tarot card. Thus the meaning is staying at the same place, there is no need to go on a journey nor to seek or run away from complication. Just be and enjoy the place you are in. The star invites you to be clam and live with peace of mind at the current moment.



It also indicates healing and meditation, a time to rest, relax and have some inner peace. However don’t make it a day dreaming or just wishful thinking, figure out how you can truly manifest those desires.



In general psychic reading the tower tarot card imply good news, but if you really want it to occur than stay on the positive path. Be open for new outcomes even if it doesn’t seem like something you should deal with right now. Pay attention to your connections with yourself, other people, guides and of course with natural and spirituality.

In reversed position you are blocking the spiritual connection between the soul, body and mind. But there is also an obstruction of interrelation between you, people and nature.



You feel weak because whenever you have a new idea or doing a new thing it doesn’t manifest precisely as you wanted. Don’t be all over the place, direct yourself to one specific goal or task and don’t leave it until you are satisfied. Focusing is a better strategy than doing million tint things.

**The star tarot card: Career work and finances meaning (upright & reversed)**



The star tarot card in upright position, when you are having a psychic reading regarding career, occupation, finance and money: you are being successful at work and happy to choose this career path. It’s a time when everything going according to your plans, you reached to the position you wished for years. For example a college student who finds his dream job, a worker that got a promotion and a small business that starts to make a lot of money.



On the other side, if you are not happy with your lifestyle choices which related to work, than you have a great chance to improve it. Consider new job offer, maybe learn another profession at the university or open a new business. Those offers and opportunity will come soon, therefore you have to be aware of them. Don’t say no to something you don’t fully understand, keep on an open mind. If you will continue to live by the same principles and believes from the old past, you will not progress to other directions.



Money problems can potentially go away. You might win the lottery, get a rise in the wage or have some luck with the stocks market. However don’t jeopardize money you can’t afford to lose, because although the elements are in your favour the wheel of fortune can suddenly turn the other way, leaving you with nothing.

This shouldn’t be like that, the star encourage you to think positively, don’t mind too much about what could go wrong, take a look on the bright side and you will discover new opportunities.



For example: if you are not happy at work, do something about it every morning: find a new job offer, go to interviews or start a new career in something completely different than you did before. Use your imagination and vision the future you want, don’t restrain yourself, and more important don’t let anyone else to discourage you from achieving dreams.

You are not lacking of money, nor have problems with your skills, nor having difficult with your home based business. The main concern is to define where you want to be. Once the definition will be cleared, you will be on the right track and the star will guide you to success.

It looks like the dreams are running away from you and you feel that whatever you want will not happen any time soon. It drains your resources and makes you tired.

If you ask AI to grade an essay it will always find something wrong with it because that's what it’s suppose to do. The problem is that I don't trust the grade ChatGPT gives me because it never aligns with the feedback. I tried to talk, to my teacher about this but she insists that there isn’t a mistake with the AI grading. I asked her if she would be willing to read my essays and grade them herself, but she told me that I shouldn’t ask for “special treatment”.

# Democratic Presidential Candidate Platform

# 1. Economy for All

My campaign is rooted in the belief that every American deserves a fair shot at economic prosperity. To build a thriving economy for all, not just the wealthy:

* **Raise the Minimum Wage**: It's time for a livable wage. No one working full-time should live in poverty. I will advocate for a federal minimum wage of $15 an hour, indexed to inflation.
* **Support Small Businesses**: Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. I will work to cut red tape, provide tax incentives, and expand access to capital for entrepreneurs in every community, especially in underserved areas.
* **Tax Fairness**: The wealthy must pay their fair share. I will reverse Trump-era tax cuts for corporations and the richest Americans, closing loopholes that benefit only the top 1%.
* **Green Jobs and Infrastructure**: I will lead a nationwide push to build green infrastructure, investing in renewable energy, and creating millions of well-paying jobs in sectors like solar, wind, and electric vehicles.

# 2. Healthcare as a Human Right

Healthcare is a fundamental human right, not a privilege for the wealthy. It’s time to ensure that every American has access to quality, affordable care:

* **Expand and Protect the Affordable Care Act**: I will fight to expand the ACA, offering a public option that allows every American the choice to buy into Medicare.
* **Prescription Drug Reform**: We will take on Big Pharma to lower the cost of prescription drugs by allowing Medicare to negotiate prices, capping out-of-pocket costs, and importing safe medications from other countries.
* **Mental Health and Addiction Services**: I will expand access to mental health care and addiction recovery services, recognizing these as critical components of public health.

# 3. Climate Crisis and Environmental Justice

The climate crisis is an existential threat that demands immediate, bold action:

* **Rejoin the Paris Agreement**: On day one, I will rejoin the Paris Climate Accord and commit to reducing carbon emissions to net-zero by 2050.
* **Investment in Clean Energy**: My administration will invest in clean energy research, production, and jobs, focusing on solar, wind, and next-generation renewable technologies.
* **Environmental Justice**: Communities of color and low-income neighborhoods bear the brunt of environmental degradation. We will address these disparities by enforcing regulations and providing funding to clean up polluted areas.

# 4. Racial Justice and Equality

I will champion policies that confront and dismantle systemic racism:

* **Criminal Justice Reform**: We will end the era of mass incarceration by reforming sentencing laws, eliminating private prisons, and investing in rehabilitation and reentry programs. I will also push to end cash bail and reduce mandatory minimum sentences.
* **Police Reform**: I support national standards for law enforcement, including banning chokeholds, ending qualified immunity, and increasing accountability through body cameras and civilian oversight boards.
* **Voting Rights**: Protecting democracy starts with ensuring that every citizen can vote without barriers. I will push for automatic voter registration, restoring the Voting Rights Act, and eliminating gerrymandering.

# 5. Education and Opportunity

Every child deserves access to quality education, and every adult deserves the chance to succeed:

* **Universal Pre-K**: I will fight to provide universal Pre-K education for every American child, laying the foundation for lifelong success.
* **Tuition-Free Community College**: We will make two years of community college tuition-free, helping students gain skills without drowning in debt.
* **Student Debt Relief**: I will pursue broad student loan forgiveness for low- and middle-income borrowers and restructure the system to prevent crushing debt in the future.

# 6. Immigration Reform

America is a nation of immigrants, and our diversity is our strength. I will advocate for:

* **Pathway to Citizenship**: Comprehensive immigration reform that includes a fair, clear pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and undocumented workers contributing to our economy.
* **DACA Protection**: I will immediately restore and expand protections under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.
* **Humane Border Security**: We will secure our borders in a humane way, prioritizing modern technology, better processing, and ensuring that asylum seekers are treated with dignity.

# 7. Gun Safety

America’s epidemic of gun violence is a public health crisis. I will push for:

* **Universal Background Checks**: We will close loopholes in gun sales and ensure universal background checks for all firearms purchases.
* **Assault Weapons Ban**: I will push for the reinstatement of the federal ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.
* **Red Flag Laws**: I will support laws that allow family members or law enforcement to temporarily remove guns from individuals deemed a threat to themselves or others.

# 8. LGBTQ+ Rights

I am committed to full equality for LGBTQ+ Americans, advocating for:

* **Equality Act**: Passing the Equality Act to ensure that LGBTQ+ people are protected from discrimination in employment, housing, and education.
* **Transgender Rights**: We will support transgender Americans by fighting for protections in healthcare, education, and the military.
* **Banning Conversion Therapy**: I will push for a federal ban on conversion therapy, which is harmful and discredited.

# 9. Women's Rights

Women's rights are human rights, and my administration will prioritize gender equality:

* **Protect Reproductive Rights**: I will protect access to safe, legal abortion by codifying Roe v. Wade into law and expanding funding for Planned Parenthood and other family planning services.
* **Equal Pay for Equal Work**: We will pass laws to close the gender pay gap and ensure that women receive equal pay for equal work.
* **Paid Family Leave**: I support a national paid family leave policy that guarantees workers time off for illness, childbirth, and caregiving.

# 10. Foreign Policy Based on Diplomacy and Strength

My foreign policy will prioritize diplomacy, international alliances, and the strength of our values:

* **Restore Global Leadership**: I will rebuild alliances, particularly with NATO and other democratic nations, to tackle global challenges like climate change, nuclear proliferation, and cyber threats.
* **End Forever Wars**: We will bring our troops home from endless wars and focus on diplomacy, development, and democracy promotion.
* **Humanitarian Aid**: America will be a leader in providing humanitarian assistance, particularly in the wake of disasters and conflicts around the world.

# Conclusion

This platform is about fairness, equality, and justice for all Americans. Together, we can build a future where everyone has the opportunity to thrive—regardless of their background, zip code, or the color of their skin. It's time for bold leadership that addresses the real challenges we face and builds a more equitable and prosperous America. Let's make that future a reality—together."
1g88kqe,1,2024-10-20,Should I just stop looking for jobs and start a software company? ,u/supercargeneral,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g88kqe/should_i_just_stop_looking_for_jobs_and_start_a/,"Hi everyone, I am a new business grad with 1YOE from internships and a good gpa. Given the condition of this labour market I am wondering if its even worth it to look for jobs. Most people will give advice along the lines of:

- Network: Takes time to build relationships (4-6 months, or more) and even then that ""network"" might not translate into a role.   
- Shoppers: Okay without, but I have student debt.

It's fine if I can land something by applying to 3-4 roles every day but so far it has not been working, I have a good boring resume (ones that work) minimal white space and good pointers. I need something immediately and at max have a 6 month (I have been burning cash for around 6 months now applying to jobs) 

Take me as greatest noob, but I am just looking for some advice. 

I need to learn flask of django along with postgresql, aws rds, and a few other aws services like auth, cc, etc. and Kubernetes. 

Sounds like a handful and if you haven't laughed by now I'd ideally want to learn them enough to build an app within 2-3 months. Cherry on top is I don't even know how to code and will probably go youtube and chatgpt route, for both building and debugging. 

I did identify a really good niche problem and don't think it would be tough to hit 2K monthly once I have it built out.

What should I do?   
Get a co-founder while I make calls to potential clients?  
Build it out myself and just take the leap of fait?

All I know is keeping applying to jobs blindly (even the ones I am qualified for) isn't working out."

I have a also got a baldspot from stress so. thats not fun. And I'm on my period (please relate to me, I feel like a failure)",u/sloppybeanzz,adhdwomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1g8c3qh/i_just_beefed_a_university_essay_ill_get_evicted/,"This started as just me venting about how I've really messed up and then turned in to a monster of a post that I spent six hours on (somehow?? hyperfocus is a beast sometimes) and now entails a long confession about a web of lies I have created over the past 2-3 years and how it now has started to unravel. Which sucks for me lol.

I'm putting in a tl:dr because I feel desperate for any human connection about this but the long version is probably incomprehensible since i'm going on 0 sleep, 0 food, brain-fog from period brain, bad english in general 

tl:dr: Two years ago I was supposed to take do my last year at university but I got burnt out and depressed. Instead of taking time of to heal I stubbornly tried to throw myself back into my studies too soon multiple time and ended up falling back into the depression each time. It started to get embarassing how badly I was coping so I lied about doing well both mentally and financially. Over the summer I concocted a plan for me to not get kicked out of my student housing and  qaulify for student loans that i'm dependent on for rent. But today that plan fell through when I didn't finish an essay in time. So now I have no choice but own up to my mistakes. Get evicted. Admit to lying. Cancel plans to study abroad. 

This sucks really bad. Even the tl:dr isnt very concice. I feel like a dumb baby whos made very immature choices and like a really shitty person whos made very shitty choices. I sort of hope someone reads this post and has messed up in a similar way. Or can relate lol because misery loves company i guess and it's not great feeling alone in this situation.  Rereading it made me realize how much i talk about my parents so now i'm leaning even more towards feeling like a baby. 



So I'm swedish and in uni right now. In sweden one year of uni classes is 60 credits, 30 credits per semester and so on. Attending uni is free but most people still have to take student loans to pay for rent, food, utilities etc. To qualify for the loan you HAVE to pass at least 75% of all the classes you take in a year (aka you have to get 45 of the 60 credits). If you have ADHD (or any disability) and it causes you to have to spend more time on the course load than the standard 40 hour/week you can apply to study under with reduced time which means that you are considered a full time student but you take less than 60 credits/ year. This way you can still get the full student loan even though you're ""missing credits"", you're allowed to live in student housing that normally required that you get 60 credits a year and so on.

  
Im 23. I started uni when I was 19. The degree is three years long (its computer science). I got through 2 years of the degree just fine. The university is in my hometown so for my first year and for about 2/3 of the second year I lived with my parents. I then moved to a student-housing-apartment aka an apartment you can only qualify for if you are studying. Student apartments are the only ones I can really get with my finances. Normal apartments have crazy high rent and alot of applicants. 

Things were fine (i thought lol) during the rest of the year. I missed 5 credits from a 20 credit course during the year but I thought I would be able to get the missed assignement dealt with right after summerbreak and with the 5 missed credits I still qualified for the loan and my housing. I had manadged to get a very cool job over the summer but it was challenging. I got the option to start working from home since I was performing well on my own and my commute to work was really long and obviously started procrastinating my work as soon as I was supposed to do it from home. I got my assignements done but got really stressed since I had to work alot on weekends and evenings and had a really difficult time relaxing even when I wasn't working. 

When I was supposed to start my third year I had a big break down and fell into a bad depression and was very burnt out. I have struggled with mental health issues before. I didn't get my adhd diagnosis untill I was 17 and I had the classic gifted kid to depressed teenager with bad grades arc. I also had the stereotypical outcome where my failings were blamed on me not trying hard enough. I tried to tell my parents about my issues many times but was again not taken seriously or blamed for causing the problems myself. I also had a brief but pretty serious burned out phase when I was 18 in highschool and still lived with my parents. Because I had a physical injury at the same time I thought my tiredness and apathy was just because of that and refused to acknowledge that something else could be going on. This period was not very good between me and my parents either since had realized that I was depressed but I hadn't. They were worried for my health and frustrated that I wasn't doing anything to try to get better which I understand, but they did not deal with their own frustration well and instead got very angry and impatient and once again it felt like they blamed me for my mental health problems and then expected me to be able to get better instantly.

This has definetly caused som trust issues in me when it comes to disclousing my mental health issues with my parents. I always go in excpecting zero understanding and no patience from them. I have often, both as a child and as an adult, felt the need to lie if I was having anxiety and any other mental health issue and say that I had something that they would deem a ""real"" problem (like a headache, period pain, stomach bug) if my mental health problem was causing me issues and I wanted them to take me seriously. But because I now lived on my own and could therefor controll my environment and not have to be around them I felt safe enough to tell them about my burn out and depression. And to my shock they were extremley understanding and supportive. They helped me look up information about what to do regarding my studies. I ended up getting a depression and burnout diagnosis from a doctor which appearently made it possible for me to go on sick leave from the studies and still qualify for the student loans (even though I wasn't getting enough credits). So things started off very well. I was on sick leave for 6 months. During this time I felt safe enought to not sugarcoat or lie about how I was doing to my family (like about the fact that something like doing the dishes could feel daunting enough to trigger a panic attck - yeah it was bad lol). They kept shocking me by being very patient and understanding. (I still had to explain that it depression was a real problem that I couldn't just snap back from a couple of times but they weren't agressive about questioning me at least).  

After the six months I decided to be stupid and impatient and made dumb descisions that I somehow got away with, but have now come back to bite me in the ass. So during my sick leave I wanted to move from my apartment. It was extremely small and I hadn't ever felt comfortable in it, it was just the first thing I could get and I was in a bit of a hurry to move out. I never thought I would live there for a long time. And since I got sick. just a fewmonts after moving in the apartment quickly was something that I felt symbolised my illness a bit. Like the apartment had gotten corrupted somehow and like I wouldn't get better while i lived there because of how much I associated it with my mental illness. I really wanted to move away. But as it turns out I couldnt move into a new student housing apartment due to some company policy thingys about being on sick leave. So I had to actually be taking and passing my courses in order to move. This and the fact that I only had one year left plus the fact that it isnt fun to be depressed made me want to get back to my studies very quickly. Too quickly. My doctor wanted me to take it easy and start by only studying at 50 % and being 50 % at sick leave but I didn't think I would be able to get a new place to live if I wasn't getting all my credits. I also sort of thought I would be able to just grind my way throug my way through the last year of my degree since it was ONLY ONE YEAR LEFT!  

So I tried to redo my third year like normal and got burnt out almost instantly again. This time hit way harder for me though. I had been really optimistic about going back. I had made things easy for myself - I bought a month-ticket for the bus to campus. Both because taking the bus is easier than having to ride the bike up a gross, way to tall hill to my campus and because I prepaid for the ticket so that I would have unlimited rides  for a month. I thought the pain of having wasted the money for the ticket would motivate me to go each day. And since I had told my parents about everything I was doing my dad went out and bought me a bunch out ready-made microwave meals so that I wouldn't stress about preparing food. (Crazy sweet and understanding and wow did I feel bad that he went out of the way to do that so it would be easier for me to get back to it and still I failed) I went to all the intro lectures and came home still optimistic but then I got hit with a wave of depression and didnt leave my bed (couch, the apartment could fit a bed lol) for a week. I perked up after a week and felt optimistic again since I had only missed a week. I left my bed and sat at my table instad and opened up my laptop to send emails to my teachers so that I could be caught up. Then I went back to my bed for multiple weeks and couldnt muster up the energy to tell my teachers that whoopsie I was wrong and didn't actually need help finding a group to work with.

  
At that point I was very embarassed, ashamed and angry that I didn't manage to pull through. It felt like I had missed to much to ever catch up and I was afraid that I would embaress myself further by getting a new wave of depression again as soon as I tried to contact my teachers. I knew that I should have gone back to the doctor but at that point I was too apathetic and tired to do it.

I also really wanted to move from my apartment. My parents always have an open door for me to move back with them. They might not always understand the problems I face with my ADHD and my mental illness but they are still crazy supportive. I however just couldnt bare the thought of losing the security that came from having my own space when I was dealing with poor mental health. I really didnt want to be in a situation like when I was younger and facing mental health.

  
Since my chosen degree was one that you really couldn't get away with not putting in the work each week I thought I could solve my problems by applying for courses that I knew had different work loads, courses where you could technically slack the entire time and work hard the last week of the term. I also figured that I probably would qualify for getting having a reduced work load be considered full time since I knew my adhd made it difficult for me to keep up with my studies and that I could really prove it since I had gotten burned out twice. Getting approved for a lower credit/ year would also be okay with student housing so I have seen this as a sort of saving grace. Turns out that I AM probably very eligeble for it but it is a lot of work to get done and when you're depressed thats kinda hard. So I started thee process. But dropped the ball quickly.

And in december last year I actually manadged to get a new apartment. Its student housing. And  I qualified for it because I had applied for the full amount of courses during the spring term, and when moving in they don't check if you passed the courses you took before you moved in. So when 2024 started I was really hopefull again. I absolutley love my new apartment. Its really big and not much more expensive than my last place. Its in a rerally pretty area, right by a forest and its got amazing walking paths. Its closer to my uni campus and its way closer to my parents place. 

When I moved I was sort of honest with my parents about where I was at. I said that the work load had been to much and that when I got approved for the lower study quota things would be fine. I didn't say that I hadn't managed to get a single credit from the whole term though.  Very soon after I moved in I realised that my desire to get the credits so I could keep my apartment (and eventually graduate but thats a whole different story at this point) didn't fuel me to study really hard at the new courses I had started and I neglected them and got depressed again :) I was also getting more and more anxious over the fact that as soon as summer came I would not be able to qualify for getting the student loan next year. And I'm not capable of holding down a job while I study. And I can't get a job instead of studying just to make money without being forced out of my apartment since you have to earn the credits to stay in the apartment. 

I realized very soon after moving in to my new apartment that I should go to the doctor again and get put on sick leave and work on my mental health properly this time. Do it right and not cut corners. I obviously knew that I wasn't doing myself any favours by pretending that things were fine. But I really liked my apartment. And I did (and do still) know that it has improved my mental health to live in this one rather than the last one. I figured that moving in and instantly getting a doctors note and being put on sick leave would probably just get me evicted since I know that most people assume that I'm being lazy and just not wanting to do the work while getting the benefits of living in the student housing.  But instead I did one last hail mary. Which is what I fucked up today. 

Since during my now two years of living in depression I still had money saved so that I could go the entire summer without any loans or getting a job. And during the summer alot of universities offer summer courses. These are often fun and kind of easy.  And you could apply for summercourses that would equal 22.5 credits. So Thats what I did. And then I would get actually stick to it and get a lower study pace approved. And then the next term (aka where I am right now) I would manadge to catch up pretty easily. 

And I wouldn't have to tell my parents that i started outright lying to them because I was ashamed to admit how badly I was doing. And I would be able to stop evading friends questions when they asked when I would finally be graduating. 

And I know that there is some saying about how madness is doing the same thing over and over and expecting new results. Because obviously I didn't get the summer courses done in time. I put it off for a long long time. But then at the end of the summer my friend told me that she'd been feeling stuck where she was at and had therefore decided that after winter she would be applying to take an exchange course at a university in Berlin. And I realised how much I also wanted to do that. So we decided to do it togheter. And I realised that I really Really wanted to do that. But in order for me to study in Berlin I will need to qualify for student loans because it seems like it would be kinda hard to find a job that I can get enough money from since I don't know german and will be studying full time at the same time and I really cannot handle the stress from just my studies alone. I had aldready missed the deadlines for two of the summer courses finals but one of them had a final that was at oktober 20. So I started doing the math of what I would have to do in order to qualify for a loan by january next year. And I realised that I did have a chance of getting it as long as i actually manadged to get my reduced study time approved and I manadged to get motivated enough to actually put in work in the essay for the course. I ran to a bunch of libraries and got all the course material (way to much) and I started to actually work on the essay. I had a late start but I made a realistic schedule of how long the essay should take and I really thought I would make it. I got unlucky cause i got my period this week my adhd always becomes worse when i'm on my period. And I really thought I would get the essay done in time. I didnt think it would be very good But I was really close. But then somehow today I fucked it up. completley. I couldnt sleep at all last night and I'm not super functional on no sleep. But I still did pretty good. I got really close to finishing. But When there was an hour left untill. the deadline. i realised that. there just wasn't any way. of me finishing the essay in time. I had to write 3 more pages and add all my sources. And it just wasnt possible. And it feels crazy that I was almost so proud of something that I started way to late and did such a bad job on but I somehow started to feel normal. And doing a bad job was way more than I've managed for a long time. It didn't feel like writing an essay was such a daunting task (because it isnt and I have always struggled with keeping my thoughts organized and remebering what I wanted to say, but before that was just an annoying extra thing I had to keep track of) But still I didn't get it done. I considered cheating and using chatgpt for the pages that I wouldnt get done in time but I'm really glad i decided not to cause that would definitly have ruined any sort of pride I would have felt about getting the essay done. 

So Instead i cried a little and opened reddit and decided to write this thing. I'm so bad at focusing that I've been writing it for 6 hours (seven after a re-read, man). Instead of getting food or going to bed or doing something else or going to the bathroom lol. Hyperfocus was strong 

This post is way to long as it is, even if I add a tl:dr. And I really don't think it will gain much visibility since I'm pretty  sure I'm in a rare time zone for this sub. But I really felt crushed today.

I realized that I've basically been scamming myself and the people around me into beliving I was ontop of my game for an entire year. I have been yapping about being excited to study in Berlin to anyone with ears and now it won't happen because of my own actions. I'm going to have to let down my friend who I was going to be going with. I have wasted two years of my life in bed and having panic attacks.  Its so embarassing that I live in a country where there are actually resources and ways for me  to get help and that I just didn't do it. I realised that if I had actually gone about my burn out in a better way.  Swallowed my pride and not stubbornly tried  to get back into my old life so quickly I would have actually gotten better. Instead I let this drag out for two fucking years. That I will never get back. That I know my friends and peers have spent in ways that they can actually look back on in the future with fond memories. But I'm turning 24 soon and the last time I was really okay was when I was 21. Life doesn't end in your twenties but I still feel really stupid for wasting so many years that I feel are so formative for so many. 

I'm very sure that I'm going to get evicted from my apartment in december since that will have been a year since I moved into it and that'll probably be when they check that I've gotten the credits for the courses I was supposed to have taken.

Worst of all I'm going to have to admit to my parents that I've been lying straight to their faces for months. Not only do I not know (or thinks they should) trust me on my word again which is humiliating to know but its also just the fact that I betrayed them. Especially after they showed me the amount of patience and support that they have. They know I haven't been good for years. And they have tried to help me, they have offered support and I still lied to them because I didn't want to have to deal with being sick and needing help anymore.

Im really dreading having to tell people how fucked I am. And that I lied about doing okay. Yucky yucky. I'm not sure this post will be accepted (I will 100 % cry if it deleted though, don't care about the reason) either cuz its to long or just unreadable. And if a bot comments an auto comment I will pretend that its some nice comment that makes me feel better cuz i need that lol

1g8czej,12,2024-10-20,I passed both D317 (A+ Core 2) and D316 (A+ Core 1) in less than a month each. Here's how I did it.,u/LimeWire34,WGU,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1g8czej/i_passed_both_d317_a_core_2_and_d316_a_core_1_in/,"Hey there fellow Night Owls. I just wanted to give back to the community by sharing the strategies and resources I used to be successful on the CompTIA A+ exams.

First of all, DO NOT use the reading material on CertMaster Learn's lessons content as a learning resource. The content on CertMaster Learn goes way outside the scope of the certification and you'll be overwhelmed with information that isn't even within the exam objectives. It's also very dry. I'm the type of student that prefers learning by reading as opposed to learning by watching videos, and even I was put to sleep by CertMaster Learn. Seriously. Do not use it.

What you should instead use is Professor Messer's CompTIA A+ playlists on Youtube. He is a CompTIA Authorized Partner and he has two playlists on Youtube for both Core 1 and Core 2. I used his videos as my primary learning resource and it worked wonders for me. His content is very professional and to the point. I watched about ten of his videos each day to prepare for the exams. I also watched each playlist three times over to completion to prepare. 

Also, go on [www.professormesser.com](http://www.professormesser.com) and buy his notes for Core 1 and Core 2. They're only $30. Review the sections of the topics that were covered from the videos you watched for a given day. This will help with your understanding of the material and your retention of the material as well.

To further increase your retention, obtain the exam objectives sheet for both Core 1 and Core 2 and create flashcards for each term. I used ChatGPT to write these flashcards for me. Review the flashcards of one of the Domains of the exam objectives each day. 

Once you have watched the playlist twice over, it's time to take a practice test. I used Jason Dion's practice tests for Core 1 and Core 2, which are provided free of charge by the school through the Udemy platform. Dion's practice test questions are phrased similarly as the questions on the exam. Aim for at least an 80% on the first attempt on the practice exams. After you have achieved an 80% or higher on four of Dion's practice tests, then you're exam ready! It's time to set up an appointment and pass!

And that's all she wrote! With the above strategies, I passed A+ Core 2 with a 754 and A+ Core 1 with a 769. I also finished both A+ exam classes in under a month using these strategies and resources. I hope this post was helpful to you. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!"
1g8fwlw,9,2024-10-20,SOLID TIPS since im done with my SAT's 😇,u/Substantial-Skirt-58,Sat,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sat/comments/1g8fwlw/solid_tips_since_im_done_with_my_sats/,"I took the October SAT and I got 1410 (770 maths & 640 r&w), it's my first & last test

okayy I might not be the excelling sat taker like other ppl here but I'm talking from personal experience

I was quite a failing student in high school ngl, my first practice test was abt 2 months before the test (1130)

for math:
- I honestly don't really find question bank that useful (I'm sure lots of questions come out from there tho) as I don't have the patient to do it and mark it one by one *me problem im sorry*

- khan academy is the GOAT for me, I finished the course & repeated the course challenge about three times per day (helped so much)

- after you finish ur practice test, please review it, it is really important (if you're impatient like me just look at questions u got wrong/was hesitating in test, and look up tutorllini test prep's practice test vids, and review the questions u got wrong)

- write notes of the formulas you encountered frequently when you do questions, so you can read them before ur sat's 

- if you don't know how to do a question, try and use chatgpt to explain it (if you cant find it anywhere on the internet explaining it) and make sure to write the question down, and redo it before your SAT !!!

- may not be the most accurate but some of the questions in those ""questions in the XXXX month SAT"" youtube vids actually came out, so you should try them out

- LEARN DESMOS THROUGHOUT, it helps and saves alot of time (but make sure to check ur answer again with ur calculator if you aren't sure)


for reading and writing:
- honestly I find memorising vocabs hard-to-do for me, so instead, I just remember the prefixes, suffixes and roots (and also do a ton of vocab questions on khan academy)

- ok for reading and writing defo do use the question bank & khan academy together (more questions)

- finish khan academy's standard english convention course, and do a ton of standard english convention questions because they are the easiest to learn and it SAVES UR SCORE (I went from 490 in my first practice test -> 640 in my oct SAT's r&w) 

- start from q15/q16 and finish them, then go back to q1 for the vocabs

- for notes questions, although most of the times you can get answers by reading the question, some questions would require you to kinda skim through the notes (so it depends)

- while many people would say you can just read the question fast, but I would recommend to read the question slowly and comprehend it. You wouldn't wanna read the question again and again quickly then ending up not understanding it

- repeating khan academy course challenge helps too

- KEEP THE TIMER ON so you can kinda keep track of the time and get used to the flow & speed of the exam

lastly, good luck for your SAT!
hopefully it'll help out, I'll reply if u have any questions ^^"

1g8nusm,185,2024-10-21,Caught 2 students cheating and they continue to deny,u/Straight-Stay3830,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1g8nusm/caught_2_students_cheating_and_they_continue_to/,"I teach an English language course to foreign exchange students from non-English countries. Today we had a test and I caught 2 students cheating (in different sections) as clear cut as any cheating case could ever be. Yet, they both vehemently deny any wrongdoing.

For context, they take tests on their electronic devices, mostly because I’m an underpaid adjunct who doesn’t have time for grading and because they find it easier than writing by hand. Plus I can test them on more content if it’s not handwritten. The questions are fairly similar to the questions in their textbook although I do change them up slightly or throw in a few curveballs.

During the listening portion, one student was behaving very suspiciously. She had her tablet on the lowest brightness setting which is odd considering it’s a dark room and I can’t read my own phone or iPad on that same setting. She also positioned herself against a wall and pivoted her tablet screen toward the wall so it was hard to see what she was doing. I was immediately suspicious and monitored her closely. Lo and behold, I caught her looking at a screenshot of a page from our textbook which conveniently was exactly the page that the video I was playing happened to be about. I immediately confronted her and she denied having cheated. She said she was doing something unrelated and that just happened to be something she had open (that doesn’t even make sense). She says she had the photo from a day she forgot her textbook so she took a photo of her friend’s. First, you shouldn’t even be navigating away from the Canva test interface in the first place. Second, it’s obviously not a coincidence considering she had that page open right while I was playing a video about that exact page of the textbook AND she was behaving so strangely during the test.

As for the student in my other section, he was also behaving strange so I casually approached him from behind. I caught him recording the audio of the listening test using the speech to text function of ChatGPT. I assume it was either because 1) a lot of my Asian students (he was of Asian background) have trouble with listening but are good at reading so he probably wanted to read the dialogue rather than listen to it, or 2) he intended to interact with the text once it was produced and ask ChatGPT to answer the related questions. The point is I literally caught him WHILE he was recording the audio with ChatGPT RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. I saw EVERYTHING clear as day. He vehemently denies all. HOW?!

It just amazes me. I will be giving them both zero but I’m just baffled how they can deny it with such confidence despite so obviously cheating. I admit I actually laughed while hearing both their excuses but they were completely serious. How? How can you actually say this with a straight face?

I think the problem is that first year students are so immature and childish, when any sort of problem arises they go into damage control mode. How can I get out of this? How can I avoid consequences? They don’t have the maturity, experience, or wherewithal to realize that when you are caught with your pants down, it’s going to be better in the long run to just admit your wrongdoing, apologize, deal with the consequences, and do your best to move forward. That’s what they need to learn the most."

# Real Estate Investing (e.g., wholesaling, REITs)

Real estate investing offers the potential for significant returns, but it's important to understand the risks and rewards associated with different investment strategies. Two popular approaches for those looking to get started in real estate investing are wholesaling and investing in Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs).

Wholesaling involves finding undervalued properties and contracting them to sell to other investors at a higher price. This strategy requires:

1. Developing a network of potential buyers (other investors).
2. Learning to identify undervalued properties.
3. Understanding local real estate markets and trends.
4. Negotiating skills to secure contracts with sellers.

REITs, on the other hand, allow you to invest in real estate without directly owning or managing properties. REITs are companies that own and operate income-producing real estate properties and offer shares to investors. Benefits of investing in REITs include:

1. Lower barrier to entry compared to direct property ownership.
2. Professional management of properties.
3. Potential for regular dividend income.
4. Diversification across multiple properties and locations.

When considering real estate investing, it's crucial to:

1. Research local markets thoroughly to identify opportunities.
2. Understand the legal and financial aspects of real estate transactions.
3. Build a network of professionals, including real estate agents, attorneys, and accountants.
4. Start small and gradually increase your investments as you gain experience.

Real estate investing can potentially generate over $50,000 per year, but it's important to note that returns can vary widely depending on market conditions, your investment strategy, and the amount of capital you're able to invest.

# E-commerce/Dropshipping

E-commerce and dropshipping continue to offer opportunities for entrepreneurs to build profitable online businesses. With the right approach, these side hustles have the potential to generate significant income.

1g8pwkr,8,2024-10-21,Difficulty finding players/GM as a ttrpg newbie,u/hg_capo,CandelaObscura,https://www.reddit.com/r/CandelaObscura/comments/1g8pwkr/difficulty_finding_playersgm_as_a_ttrpg_newbie/,"Before CO, I already have difficulties finding a group to play D&D with. I always just last like 1-2 sessions before the group disbands or the vibes doesn't feel right for me. There's also the problem with time constraints, since I live in GMT+8 and most players are from the US. 

I have only played a few sessions of CO as a Lightkeeper/ GMPC with my gf, but she is not a native English speaker and often has anxieties when it comes to the language and doing nerdy stuff in general. (I don't speak her native language either, sadly.) She said she often feels like she's too dumb for the game even when I try to accomodate to her playing style. 

We're trying again with her playing as a Soldier character that doesn't talk much. But I would love to have more experience as a player tbh before delving into the Lightkeeper role. 

For now, I have also attempted playing with ChatGPT. It was suprisingly decent and does remember all the mechanics and details I feed to it. But the problem is I have to always make the call on when I roll and what I have to roll. And if I ask it to generate other PCs, the PCs are also reliant to my input and don't take initiative. 

So if there's any available games for trrpg newbies out there I can join, please reach out to me. And if there's other newbies out there that are also looking for a game to join, you can reach out to me too and maybe we can work something out. Or maybe someone can give me advice on where to look for Candela game groups. 

PS: I'm a broke college student. So no paid games or platforms requiring paid subscription, please. My schedule is mostly free though because it's an online modular learning thing. "
1g8tzlm,1,2024-10-21,Need suggestions on how to create a university level exercise on generating Python code using AI tools.,u/Datloran,AIAssisted,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIAssisted/comments/1g8tzlm/need_suggestions_on_how_to_create_a_university/,"Hi all, I hope you can help me out.

I am an associate professor in Software Engineering and I am trying to create content for a workshop on Python programming. The workshop is a self-study, and the evaluation criteria is a simple pass/no-pass.

Until recently, I would have created the workshop around a major exercise, like implementing tic-tac-toe in Python, but seeing as that is a simple task to instruct ChatGPT to do, that is not a route I want to do anymore. Instead, I would like to embrace the possibility of turning the workshop away from being a learning experience on the fundamentals of Python and instead having the students doing prompting and having to evaluate/adjust the generated responses. The students are already well familiar with Java syntax and programming paradigms in general, so I judge there is no need to learn this again with Python. As long as they can recognize the programming structures they know from Java in Python, I am good.

But I am struggling with how to formulate the exercise; if I make it too detailed and technical, students will simply throw these instructions into ChatGPT and have no reflections at all. I get the sense, it has to be formulated in a way, that makes it approachable for the students, but cannot be directly prompted to ChatGPT, but then I am speculating if that is even possible at all.

Any suggestions will be welcome."

I’m a university student studying computer engineering, and my schedule is pretty packed with classes, so I have limited time to study the skills needed for app development. To work around this, I’ve been using tools like FlutterFlow and ChatGPT to create an Android app. The app scans food product barcodes to provide allergen and nutritional information using the OpenFoodFacts database.

I’ve already designed the app’s UI in Figma and started building it in FlutterFlow, but I’m having trouble figuring out how to structure the app and implement the necessary functionality, such as integrating with APIs and making the barcode scanning automatic (without a button press).

I believe this app idea is quite original, especially for the market I want to release it in (Italy and the EU), where I’ve found that similar apps are either non-existent or very basic and not as user-friendly as modern users would expect. I don’t want to miss the opportunity to develop this idea, but I lack the coding expertise to handle the technical side properly.

I’m looking for guidance on how to approach the programming and functionality in a way that’s manageable for my level of experience. Since I can’t dedicate much time to learning advanced coding, I need to rely on tools that minimize the coding aspect. If anyone can offer advice on how to achieve this in FlutterFlow or suggest better tools for my situation, I’d greatly appreciate it!

Thanks in advance for any help!"

I do feel bogged down by pressures at work and high expectations as a tech lead, so I'm also looking at doing other things with my time which will give me more intrinsic satisfaction. 

I find the area of AI in education very interesting. In particular I know that ChatGPT is a great tool for learning through question and answer, heck I've learnt a lot from it. But I can see it's also a tool for making people lazy - students using it to do their homework and putting no or little effort. I have no background in education, but I have two small kids under 4 and I worry about the state of education and where it's going. Does anyone have any ideas how someone with my background could get involved in some capacity in this? I sincerely believe AI can be used to improve education and make it more accessible but it needs to be done right. 

Appreciate any inputs and if this is the wrong sub for such a question I'm happy to move it to the right one. "

Naiiyak ako kasi nung na reveal na grades namin di ko matanggap as in na yung mga classmates kong nag chat gpt, gemini, etc ay mas mataas pa kaysa sa akin na active na nagpaparticipate, gumagawa ng sariling sagot through my own understanding, masipag magbasa ng articles and books, kayang mag impromptu on the spot... ANG UNFAIR LANG!




ps: i know na may good and bad sides rin ang paggamit ng ai, pero sa part ng ibang students na yung aabusuhin na ang paggamit kahit simpleng tanong pinapasagot na inaasa mo na lahat lahat sa ai tas tinatamad ka na umintindi, gosh! pano kayo matututo niyan? sayang tuition ssob mahiya naman kayo."
1g9gu86,1,2024-10-22,need help,u/jaicafterhours,studytips,https://www.reddit.com/r/studytips/comments/1g9gu86/need_help/,"Hello! I’m reaching out for advice on a challenge I’ve been facing. Since grade 6, I’ve relied on cheating in my studies, and it's becoming increasingly burdensome. I’ve been caught a couple of times—once during a quiz and again in a quiz bee—yet I denied it both times. While I occasionally know the answers, I often find myself searching for confirmation, which makes me feel like I’m not truly learning.

Though I consider myself an average student and perform well in practical tasks, the guilt from cheating is overwhelming. I value my relationships with my teachers and classmates, but I realize I can’t continue this way. Inspired by students on TikTok who are committed to their goals, I want to emulate that dedication. I struggle with self-doubt, especially when surrounded by naturally gifted peers, and I know I need to boost my confidence.

Additionally, I’ve been using ChatGPT to help with essays and answers, and I want to move away from that approach. I prefer to study directly from my professors and educational resources on YouTube instead. 

If anyone has faced a similar situation, I would love to hear about the strategies that helped you overcome cheating and improve your study skills. Any tips for effective exam and quiz preparation would be greatly appreciated! Thank you."
1g9it85,4,2024-10-22,Confused About Redistribution vs. Accumulation in Thiopental PK Graph,u/Ok_Guard2105,pharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/1g9it85/confused_about_redistribution_vs_accumulation_in/,"Hey fellow pharmacy students and professionals,

https://preview.redd.it/p1a79h21dbwd1.png?width=402&format=png&auto=webp&s=f11e6b5d458756e8019a28ce5ce81a009690c3f3

I’m really struggling to understand the concept of **redistribution vs. accumulation** with respect to thiopental, and I’m hoping some of you could help me clear this up.

Here’s the situation: In class, we were asked to examine a pharmacokinetics graph for thiopental after an IV bolus injection (I'll attach the image below). Thiopental, as a lipid-soluble sedative-hypnotic, is known for its rapid CNS effects, which are terminated by **redistribution** of the drug. We were supposed to critically analyze the graph and predict:

1. The organ where the drug rapidly concentrated:
   1. My Answer: Brain | ChatGPT: Brain
2. The organ where the drug accumulated.
   1. My Answer: Fats | ChatGPT: Lean Tissue
3. The organ where the drug finally redistributed.
   1. My Answer: Lean Tissue | ChatGPT: Fats

**My confusion** started when I tried to apply my critical thinking, but it clashed with what ChatGPT explained to me. I know I’m supposed to use my judgment, but I’m doubting myself because my answer doesn’t quite line up with ChatGPT’s.

Here’s **my claim**:

* After the brain, thiopental tends to **accumulate in fat tissues** because it is highly lipophilic (lipid-soluble). The green line representing fat increases steadily, and since thiopental is lipid-soluble, I thought it would accumulate more in fat tissues over time.
* For lean tissues, I saw that the concentration peaks and then drops. This made me think that thiopental was **redistributing** from lean tissues to other areas like fat.

**ChatGPT’s claim** was slightly different:

* It said that after the drug acts in the brain, thiopental accumulates in **lean tissues** because they are well-perfused, and then it redistributes to **fat tissues**, where it finally accumulates. ChatGPT explained that lean tissues temporarily hold the drug before it moves to fat, which is why the green line rises later on.

Now, I’m confused because I felt like fat should have a **greater tendency to accumulate the drug** early due to its lipophilicity, but ChatGPT emphasized redistribution to lean tissues first and then fat. Can someone please help me **interpret the graph properly** and explain the difference between accumulation and redistribution in this context?

Any clarification would really help me align my understanding of **pharmacokinetics** with what’s being taught and what I’ve learned so far. Thank you in advance!"

This time, instead of writing all the code from scratch, primarily using HuggingFace and Pytorch, I'd like to use one of the popular frameworks (like LangChain, LlamaIndex etc.).   
The motivation behind this is that, ideally, I'd like to learn to use these tools to get a more compact and organised codebase, such that I can easily add pieces to include RAG, Agentic workflows etc.   
I'm also interested in having an efficient way to load models and make inferences.  
  
In your experience, which of the many available frameworks out there is the most suitable for research purposes ? And do you even use a framework or you just code everything from scratch every time you start a new project ?"

1g9nt7k,2,2024-10-22,"Chegg ($CHGG) Is Down Big, But Here's Why It Could Bounce Back by 2025",u/xTooGoDLy,SmallCapStocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmallCapStocks/comments/1g9nt7k/chegg_chgg_is_down_big_but_heres_why_it_could/,"Chegg’s stock has taken a massive hit, falling more than 80% as AI tools like ChatGPT seem to be eating into their homework-help business. But I think the market is missing the bigger picture—Chegg isn’t done yet. They’re making a serious pivot into AI themselves, and I believe that could be the key to a turnaround by 2025. Here’s why I think Chegg is worth a closer look:

# The Situation:

Chegg has been written off by many due to AI’s rise, but they’re fighting back. They’re moving into AI-powered tutoring and focusing more on skills-based learning, which could bring in more subscribers. This shift could make their platform more appealing to students, especially as some start realizing that AI isn’t always reliable for homework.

# Why Chegg Isn’t Finished:

* **Stock’s Been Crushed:** Chegg’s stock has been dumped by Wall Street, but they’re already working on their next move. They’ve developed their own AI tutor and are investing in more tools to compete in the education space. This pivot shows they’re not just sitting back—they’re actively trying to adapt.
* **AI Has Its Flaws:** While AI is great for some things, it’s not perfect for homework help, especially with complex questions. Many students are starting to notice this, which could bring some of them back to Chegg’s more reliable, human-backed model.
* **It’s Seriously Undervalued:** Analysts from Simply Wall St say Chegg is about 29% undervalued right now, so the stock is trading at a discount. Chegg also announced a $150 million stock buyback, which could boost shareholder value as fewer shares remain available.

# The AI Pivot Could Be Big:

Chegg’s AI-powered tutor is its answer to ChatGPT and similar tools. If they can pull this off, they could not only survive but thrive in the AI space. The stock could rebound to $15-$20 by 2025 if things go as planned.

# What’s the Risk?

* **Competition is Tough:** Chegg’s AI shift is a big move, but if they can’t execute it well, their chances of recovery are slim.
* **Sentiment is Low:** Most people are bearish on Chegg right now, but that could work in our favor if the company surprises everyone with a strong turnaround.

# The Play:

Chegg looks like a solid buy at these low prices, especially for those willing to hold long-term. The pivot into AI gives them a path to recovery, and if they succeed, shareholders could see a big upside by 2025.

# TL;DR:

Chegg’s been hit hard by AI, but they’re pivoting into AI themselves with new tools and a focus on skills-based learning. The stock is trading at a deep discount, and if their AI strategy works, Chegg could see a strong rebound by 2025.

**Not financial advice—do your own research!**

1g9q4ud,47,2024-10-22,iSchool Expectations/Accountability Rant,u/swamblies,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/1g9q4ud/ischool_expectationsaccountability_rant/,"TLDR; iSchool does not hold students accountable for actually understanding the material. The classes aren't necessarily 'easy' themselves (difficult enough concepts/assignments/etc.), but they just hand out A's like we are in elementary school. The expectations are nonexistent. People get away with it through the excessive amount of group work and using generative AI, and I wish so badly that projects were solo because they'd just be less work than babysitting a bunch of adults with lackluster performance.

Disclaimer: I am not saying this is ALL iSchool students/professors/classes. This is just a trend I have experienced myself over and over and I am so sick of it.

I am an Information Science major for reference (along with another major & minor in CMNS). I took on the major last year. Going in, I thought it was going to live up to the expectation that everyone gave it: easy enough, full of comp sci dropouts, some projects but not nearly as much outside work as comp sci, etc.

Since being in the major, I have realized its more than just ""easy comp sci."" Not only do the rooms stink just as bad of B.O. as the computer science classes, but many students are incredible slackers/cheaters and the professors rarely hold them accountable. At least in comp sci (I assume) students literally cannot slack off without failing a class (seen it happened to several people freshman year who chose League of Legends over CompSci).

 Scrolling through weekly discussion posts, I see the same conventions being used again and again with the same comments, evident that students are either copying from previous posts or all just using AI like ChatGPT to write their code/discussion post. I am willing to bet that half of these people graduate with an Information Science degree and can't write a program more than 50 lines without the use of generative AI. To clarify, I do think that AI can be very helpful when learning (asking it what certain functions do, to help you remember the name of a function, explain syntax, debugging, etc.), it just shouldn't be used to straight up complete assignments.

The classes themselves are not as ""easy"" as they are made out to be. They're nothing crazy, but they do require some though to understand concepts like objects or keys. But they just don't seem to hold any students accountable for actually doing the work and understanding the material. People are passing these classes having not learned a thing. You can literally finish an ""intro to \[coding language\]"" class and pass with flying colors without knowing a thing about coding in that language.

In my other major, you HAVE to put in the work to get an A. Exam averages range from 50-70 and the grade distribution is a bell curve, with the peak being usually around a B or B-. These classes require you to put in work after class and practice what you learn independently. If you do not study outside of class, do the homework, and actually understand how to apply concepts, you will absolutely fail the class. I assumed that this was the case for all majors. In the iSchool though, I can't imagine anyone getting less than an A- in most of these classes unless they literally didn't do any assignments, simply because the expectation for many classes is less than the bare minimum. 

Many iSchool classes love to assign groupwork. This is a great idea in theory, since many of us will be pursuing careers that require us to work with others, since no one person can realistically write hundreds of thousands of lines of code within a ""normal"" timeframe. However, all these group projects are giving the opportunity for students to slack off further by waiting for the one or two people to do the work for them. I have spoken to several other upperclassmen iSchool majors who feel the same way. Almost every single group project I have been involved in within INST courses have included several underwhelming teammates who do less than the bare minimum. 

For instance, one of my classes required a formal write-up along with the final presentation of our project. I had word-for-word written out everything that my teammate needed to add to the document (I even wrote HER script for the presentation, which she read robotically off of instead of paraphrasing. Did none of these people take a communications class???). All she had to do was format my shorthand bullet points into a short paragraph. Instead, she simply copy and pasted the bullets into a formal essay that specifically asked for paragraph format, leaving me to do that entire section myself.

Also, loads of these classes are grading on completion??? We aren't in elementary school, there should be no ""participation"" awards. The average for major assignments hovers around 95% in many classes. Having seen what other people are submitting for these assignments, I am astounded that instructors are handing out full credit to the majority of students. 

For example, INST327 is many student's first introduction to SQL, a database coding language. The class itself is not exceptionally challenging, but it is understandable why many people would find learning a new coding language to be a daunting task. We have ONE weekly individual assignment graded on correctness. My professor decided to grade last week's individual assignment on completion AFTER everyone had submitted. The topic covered was arguably the most challenging subject in the entire class: Normalization. I spent hours going to TA office hours, communicating with the instructional staff, and working on it independently, just to get the same grade as the people who started it the night it was due (I am in a group for that class and they were all looking for help on the beginning of the assignment at 10pm that same night). Even worse, I looked over the answer key and saw that I did the entire process correctly, and will not be credited for that.

This is literally the only type of assignment in the class that holds people accountable for actually learning, understanding, and applying what we learn. This wouldn't be so bad if the only other assignments we have graded on correctness were the semester-long group project. This means that the lack of accountability towards these students indirectly impacts me through this group work. My group members have a concerning lack of understanding about SQL and have not once attended office hours to seek assistance. Not only do they have an inability to code, but they don't seem to have a conceptual understanding of databases either. For instance, one group member simply had to write 10 questions that our database could answer (who, what, when, where, why level questions. Nothing crazy or groundbreaking here; anyone could accomplish this without any coding knowledge). I went to look over the questions they wrote and not only were they incomplete, but every single one was completely unrelated to our database, meaning I had to do that section on top of what I was originally assigned to complete (the sections I ended up doing were literally worth over 50% of the entire assignment). Imagine having a database that listed employees names, date of hire, and where they got their college degree. A question you may ask would be ""from what college do we hire the most alumni?"" My group member was writing questions along the lines of ""how much money do our employees make,"" which is literally not available in that data.

This next group assignment for the project requires everyone in the group to understand and apply Normalization to our dataset. It includes a writeup about why we chose to Normalize in that specific way. It is the EXACT same thing as last week's individual assignment (the one that was spontaneously graded on completion). So basically, because nobody was held accountable for understanding Normalization with last week's assignment, I am once again stuck normalizing a complex dataset without the help of my group members (I have been communicating this to the instructional staff and there's not much to do besides give them poor ratings/explanations during peer-check ins). Even worse, because they also lack the conceptual understanding, I don't think they will be able to do the writeup either, since they can't explain relationships, linking tables, composite primary keys, etc.

My professor sent out an ELMS announcement to let the class know that last week's individual assignment was graded on completion. Myself and another student posted a public comment that we felt it was unfair and requested extra credit for the students who were correct. Another student replied ""I disagree since that would lower another idea and expectation, which leads to unfairness."" What does that even mean??? Not only is that sentence borderline unintelligible, but what on god's green earth could ""lead to unfairness"" when you give credit where credit is due and hole people accountable? Have we really sunk so low as to believing that on a college level, students applying their understanding to an assignment, and then being given a grade that reflects this, is somehow ""lowering an idea and expectation?"" I know we aren't an ivy league, but I really thought that UMD was better than this.

I'm genuinely so tired. I would have no problem doing these large projects solo over groups. It has become more work being in a group than just doing everything myself because I have to constantly be the one to reach out to them with reminders, tell them when to meet, set up meetings, ask them questions, tell them what they need to do, etc. Nobody ever seems to just figure out what they need to do on their own. Its like they need a chaperone to hold their had all the way through. I shouldn't have to feel like an elementary school teacher in a college level class. I've done everything in my power to try to communicate this to groups time and time again, and I've gone as far as reaching out to the instructors to request guidance. Its ridiculous that these people are getting the same grade as me for an assignment they didn't do so much as READ. I have to genuinely BEG group members to communicate, to come to a 20 minute weekly Zoom meeting, and to just DO their part of a project.

I'm literally exhausted for all the wrong reasons. It would be one thing if the course load was what was pushing me to my limits, but it is entirely the issue of how iSchool professors grade and how iSchool students act in group projects.

Now, let me tell you, this wasn't just another project. It was a journey. A journey where I wrestled with code, danced with APIs, and yes, even had a few late-night coffee sessions with my trusty laptop. Here's what I covered:

\- **Why Django and React?** Well, because they're like the peanut butter and jelly of web development. They just work together, seamlessly. - **Ollama?** That's right, I threw in a bit of machine learning magic to make things even more interesting. 

\- **The xAI API?** This is where things got really fun. Integrating AI into your apps isn't just about making them smarter; it's about opening up a world of possibilities. I've always believed that sharing knowledge is the key to growth, both personally and professionally. So, in this post, I've laid out: 

\- **The setup process** \- because let's face it, getting started can be a bit like trying to solve a Rubik's cube blindfolded. 

\- **The integration challenges** \- and trust me, there were plenty. But hey, overcoming challenges is what makes us better, right? 

\- **The results** \- and how this integration can revolutionize your projects. If you're curious about how to make your web applications not just functional but also intelligent, give it a read.

Im 3rd year student of Information Technology, im working full time as well and its very hard to balance things, but whenever i have free time i try to get better at coding, improve my skills and learn something new. Now the problem is, even after finishing two years of uni with pretty good grades, tbh i think i dont know nothing, we worked with program languages like Python/C/C++/Java. And im familiar with all of them and know how they work but i can’t do sh*t, im not capable of writing my code alone (i can’t write stupid programs like ‘is it leap year’ or ‘guess a number’), for every project i used chatgpt and help on internet and adjusted code to make it look something like i want. Im also doing some bootcamps on udemy for frontend as well. How do you cope with that, so many thoughts, sometimes i feel like im not good for it, that maybe it is not for me, despite i really enjoy doing it. When i started bachelor i was thinking by 3rd year i will land some internship for sure, but rn that feels like impossible task.
Thanks in advance for all the comments, and sorry for my English.

Since grade 6, I’ve relied on cheating in my studies, and it's becoming increasingly burdensome. I’ve been caught a couple of times—once during a quiz and again in a quiz bee—yet I denied it both times. While I occasionally know the answers, I often find myself searching for confirmation, which makes me feel like I’m not truly learning.

Though I consider myself an average student and perform well in practical tasks, the guilt from cheating is overwhelming. I value my relationships with my teachers and classmates, but I realize I can’t continue this way. Inspired by students on TikTok who are committed to their goals, I want to emulate that dedication. I struggle with self-doubt, especially when surrounded by naturally gifted peers, and I know I need to boost my confidence.

Additionally, I’ve been using ChatGPT to help with essays and answers, and I want to move away from that approach. I prefer to study directly from my professors and educational resources on YouTube instead. 

If anyone has faced a similar situation, I would love to hear about the strategies that helped you overcome cheating and improve your study skills. Any tips for effective exam and quiz preparation would be greatly appreciated! Thank you."
1ga0ado,21,2024-10-22,Scored an 8.0 on IELTS with 3 Weeks of Preparation! Here's how I Did It ,u/ezazahmed,IELTS,https://www.reddit.com/r/IELTS/comments/1ga0ado/scored_an_80_on_ielts_with_3_weeks_of_preparation/,"Finally, I have passed my IELTS test (UKVI academic-computer based) with an overall band score of 8. I am satisfied with my overall score since this score is good enough to clear the admission requirements for any post-graduate program in the USA. My subsection scores are as follows:

Speaking- 7.0
Reading- 8.5
Listening- 9.0
Writing- 7.0

I am happy with the reading and listening scores, however, scores could be slightly higher for the other two- especially for writing. But I won't really beat myself up over it, since I gave myself only about 3 weeks to prepare. I am writing this post today so that others can learn from my experiences, and get a understanding of the preparation  strategies. I feel I should contribute to this group, since I myself have taken so much help from it during my preparations!

Firstly, I think I should provide an indication of my proficiency levels before I started taking any preparation for IELTS.  I will also include some background details so that the readers here can figure out if they can relate to me. In my opinion, IELTS preparation depends a lot on the test taker's initial proficiency levels, and you might/ might not require a lot of time to preapre based on how good you already are.

For me, I am a working professional taking the test from Bangladesh- though English is not my native language, I have been using it as a medium for both my undergraduate studies and my professional work. I love reading books, and watching movies/ TV series in English. I am also somewhat comfortable with giving presentations in English, or using it in everyday situations. Although there is no issues with comprehension, my speaking is not very fluent and I can't really think in English while speaking. If you think that your proficiency level is at par with me, the following advice should be helpful to you, otherwise it might not. Here I have discussed the strategies that I have followed for IELTS preparations, which might not work for you if you are at a beghing stage. I have tried to compile here all the resources that I have used, as well.

Before I started taking my preparations, I set an overall target for myself as to in which areas I should have a good score. For me it was the writing section, since I heard from a friend that a good writing score (>=6.5) can help you get an RA-ship in US universities. So, I focused a lot of my efforts on improving my writing skills- as I genuinely lacked in that area. Later, I also heard that some US universities prefer students with at or above 7.5 in speaking for TA-ships, which you can also keep in mind while setting the target for yourself. However, I scored below 7.5 in speaking, maybe I should have put in more effort for speaking practice- I practiced speaking only for a day before the exam. This was partly beacuse I overeatimated my impromptu speaking skills, and only identified my lackings after taking a mock test. However, speaking and writing score requirements that I mentioned above- are not very well researched facts and I would be glad if someone could shed more light on this topic.

Another topic I would like to get a clearer understanding is the IELTS vs TOEFL debate- I will just share my take on it. My purpose for taking this exam is to clear the requirements for US grad school applications, and also secure any indirect benefits it might have towards TA/RA-ship applications. As per general perception, the TOEFL test is more popular in the US. But I decided on taking the IELTS since I think TOEFL /IELTS are somewhat equally accepted in the US, whereas IELTS gives you more flexibility with other countries like the UK and Canada. There might also be some advantages with UK Visa applications with the IELTS score, but I'm not sure about this. I'm pursuing this line of thought beacuse although my primary target is applying for the US, I would like to keep my options open for other countries as well. Though these discussions are irrelevant after taking the test, I'm just curious to know if I have any gap in understanding. 

Firstly, if you are just starting out and don't know anything about the test format, I would suggest you to watch the following video on youtube, where you will get an overview, with descriptions of different sections of the test, time and score distributions:

https://youtu.be/VaAvJ6iEibk?si=ogOQVn1g5rQm6DWz

For a deeper understanding, you should watch a more detailed video from The Urban Fight youtube channel which shows you different question types that will appear on the test, along with some gereral tips for the reading and listening sections:

https://youtu.be/HDhlXPBXwFA?si=QtsNla4Wp0sSpu9c

Watching these two videos should give you a good understanding of the test. For further intimation, you should go for a full-length IELTS mock test. If you have registered through British Council, you will have access to some free online mock tests on the GEL IELTS website (which comes free with the BC registration). I will talk more about GEL IELTS while advising you for preparations.

If you register for the exam through them, British Council offers a free subscription to GEL IELTS- an IELTS preparation website, which has a lot of both timed and untimed mock-tests. You can take full mock tests, or shorter mocks for separate sections of the test, or you can just practice single questions instead of a mock. I found the website particularly useful when practicing for Listening and Speaking sections. You should start taking these mocks after a few days through your preparations. 

While I was starting out, the first challenge was to compile a list of resources from where I would take help. I chose to follow video/ interactive resources for my preparations, since I didn't have a lot of time on my hand. Since this is a language proficiency test, you might find the books/ written material a bit lengthy and hard to focus on. There are a lot of free video classes and tutorials available on youtube, but most of them are hour-long videos with long QA sessions, or provides too much rudimentary explanations intended for mass level audience. Also, these tutorials are often not organized and comprehensive. So, it took a lot of time and effort figuring out suitable resources for my preparations. Following are the resources that I used for different sections of the test. 

1. Writing Section:

Even before starting my preparations, I knew that the writing section was going to be my Achilles' Heel. I knew I had shortcomings in writing, so I have to train hardest for this section. However, writing tutorials on youtube are extremely lengthy and the playlists usually consist of a number of hour-long videos. The  only exception I could find was the IELTS Simon youtube channel. To me, this channel was a life-saver. The writing section on the test comprises of two tasks: Task-1 and Task-2. IELTS Simon channel has two playlists dedicated to these two tasks, each playlist consists of 8-10 videos which are 10-15 mins long each. The videos are precise and contain a lot of useful tips and tricks with practical guide for writing practice. I highly recommend this channel if you are short on time like me, and looking for a compact preparation on this section. I treated the playlists on IELTS Simon as a syllabus for theoretical learning on writing methods, which I planned to complement with an ample number of mock tests. Link to the IELTS Simon playlists are given below. Simon also has a blog site which I found to be interesting, which contains byte size content on interesting usages of the language- it can be an enjoyable read, as well as, additional learning material for you. I have attached below links to the IELTS Simon playlists and the blog website:

1. Task-1: https://youtu.be/_EKODdnjUK0?si=U2-F0WuUq85uPu3o
2. Task-2: https://youtu.be/aWQBKN8_ycY?si=g9Sep6EKMRa5HoNG
3. Website: https://www.ielts-simon.com/

I would suggest you to complete these playlists first, then take as many writing mock tests as you can to solidify your learnings. 

ChatGPT can also help you prepare for the writing section. One useful trick that I can teach you: combine ChatGPT with your mock tests for identifying improvement areas. After taking a mock test, you can input your 'asnwer writeups' into ChatGPT and provide prompts like: ""please revise the following answer for IELTS writing task- 1/2, rewrite it after correcting all the mistakes and prepare a table comparing each sentence in my writeup with corresponding sentences in your revised writeup."" This prompt will provide a comparison table- which should give you a lot of insights on your error-making patterns and how you should correct those errors. However, I would suggest against using ChatGPT to rate your answers, because it tends to give you a rather 'pessimistic' rating- which will just hurt your motivations. It's better to focus on the improvement areas, instead of focusing on the ratings. Also, human examiners tend to score more leniently than AI. 


2. Speaking Section:

My suggestion would be to start taking Speaking mock tests from Day-1, this will help you get an idea of the skill-level you are starting with and how much you need to improve. On GEL IELTS website, the speaking mock tests consist of recorded questions in video format. For me, I took my first Speaking mock on GEL IELTS the day before the Exam- and it was kind of a reality check for me. I spent the day practicing speaking mostly, but if I had started doing it earlier- probably I could have done better on the speaking section. My suggestion would be to take as many mocks as you can- especially for speaking, there's no alternative to that.

In the Speaking test, there are three sections:
- 1st: Introductory section. Here, the examiner asks you questions about yourself, like- where do you live? What is your favorite color? etc. You are expected to give short answers to the questions. 
- 2nd: a 2-min-speech. The examiner will give you a topic and ask you to speak on it for 2 mins without interruption.
- 3rd: a discussion. Here, the examiner will ask you questions related to the topic given to you in the 2nd section. He will also make counter questions based on your answers, or on other relevant topics. It is expected to be a discussion between the examiner and the candidate, so the answer are expected to be a bit longer than section-1. You can get a detailed overview of the speaking test format from the below video:

https://youtu.be/MowXdaxK0fQ?si=dlS1WqS4sK212MEQ

So, as you can see- section 1 and section 3 are like everyday conversations that you may have with a friend or a colleague. I practiced these questions by taking mocks on the GEL IELTS website. While practicing, you can listen to a question, take your time organizing the answer in your head, then say it out loud. The platform will record your answer, and you can play it back later. These recordings can help you identify many awkward filler words or noises that you are probably using during your conversations. These fillers really take the charm away from your speaking, and impact your speaking score. You can gradually train yourself to avoid using these fillers, but it will take some time and practice. You may use ChatGPT to give yourself some ""keywords"" to use, which are suitable for answering on any given topic. For example: suppose you encounter a question on the mock: ""What is your favorite physical exercise and why?"" You may ask ChatGPT to give you some keywords suitable for describing different types of physical exercises.

Many people might feel nervous about taking an in-person speaking test. But in my experience, the examiner always tries to make the candidate comfortable and relaxed. You might feel nauseous during the recorded video mock tests, but you will likely be at ease in front of the real examiner. My interview was conducted via zoom call, the examiner connected through a laptop in the examination room. 

For the second section: that is the uninterrupted speech section, you need to practice differently. Within a very short period of time (1 min), you will have to come up with some points so that you can talk about a topic for 2 mins straight. If this doesn't come to you naturally, you can follow some techniques. One such technique is the ""PPF method"" that I myself used. PPF stands for Past, Present, Future. The idea is to take any topic, and then think about it's past, present and future. For example- a topic can be: A person who inspires you. You can talk about where or how you met this person (past), how is he/she currently inspiring your actions (present), what do you plan to do taking inspiration from them (future). Hence, PPF technique can be applied to a wide range of topics. You can learn more about this and other techniques from the following video:

https://youtu.be/MowXdaxK0fQ?si=dlS1WqS4sK212MEQ


3. Reading section:

For the reading section of the test, having an above average reading speed really helps. Those who are in the habit of reading English books daily will have an advantage here. For me, although I don't find the time to read everyday- I try to read regularly during the weekends. I am really into non-fiction and I try to complete at least one book each month.  Hence I would suggest you to read everyday before the test: English newspapers, magazines, novels- whatever you can get your hands on, at least a few pages each day. Also, try to improve your reading speed. The goal should be to strive towards reading a bit faster than yesterday. I have read ""The Speed Reading Book"" by Tony Buzan which gave me some basic idea on speed reading techniques. it's an interesting read if you want to try it.

I'd say that the IELTS reading test is more of a test of endurance before anything. The reading section is 1 hour long- reading through and analyzing long passages for 1 hour straight drains all your energy, which increases the chance of making mistakes. So, you need to manage your energy well for doing good in this section- I'll discuss more on this topic later.  You can also build your endurance by taking a lot of full-length mock exams. However, if you are really short on time like me- my advice would be to focus more on other sections for practice (like- speaking and writing) than the reading section. Taking one or two mocks should give you a comprehensive idea of the reading test, after that you need to decide which area you want to focus on preparations on.

However, there was a video on the ""Lillie IELTS"" youtube channel that I found useful. This video discusses some strategies for efficiently using your time during the reading test. If you want to check it out, the link is down below:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KyxTcL-0ZM&t=675s

4. Listening section

The central focus of my preparations was probably on the listening test. When I first started taking my mocks, I scored pretty low on the listening section- which freaked me out. Hence, I immediately started working on improving my listening skills. It paid off as well- since I got a perfect score in the listening section. To get a good score in this section, you have to take as many listening mocks as you can. And to be honest, taking listening mocks can be fun as well- there's a chance you might get hooked on it, which happened in my case. But it eats away at the time that you are supposed to give for other sections. 

There are a number of question types that you might face on the listening test. For example: 
- MCQ
- Matching
- Map/ Diagram Labelling
- Table/ Flow Chart/ Summary Completion
- Sentence Completion
- Short answer (in 1/2/3 words) 

While practicing, I developed some personal techniques to tackle these questions, which I'm going to discuss now. I would suggest you to read the following section after you have started taking your preparations and you are fully familiarized with all the question types- otherwise it might not make much sense to you. 

Before getting into that, I would like to talk about ""The Art of Letting Go"". This is the most important skill you can develop to score well on the listening test. The most common pitfall that can destroy your scores- is getting hooked on a certain question. The listening test consists of an audio that keeps playing in the background, while you answer questions on the screen. The audio keeps on playing in it's usual pace- if you get hooked on one question, you might miss the answer to the next one. 

The main challenge of this section is to hold your attention for the entire 30-mins duration. You should be comfortable with the pace of the audio after some practice. But chances are- if you lose your attention even for 10 seconds, you might miss the answer to a question. What people tend to do is panic over it- listening to the audio intently with the intention of finding answer to the missed questions. What they fail to realize is that the audio will not repeat the answer to a missed question. I understand this is a reflex action but as a consequence- they miss the answer to the next question as well, as their mind is still hooked on the previous one. Hence, you need to master 'The Art of Letting Go'. This is kind of like achieving Nirvana (xD)- it's not easy to develop and you might need to undertake multiple 'wasted' listening mocks until you can fully accept- ""What is lotted cannot be blotted!""

That being said, I can move on to some technical advice. Out of my own imagination, I classified the question types of the test under three categories and devised different strategies to deal with them. You should not probe much about the definitions, as these are more like rules of thumb that I personally developed and found to be helpful. The categories are:

A. Questions for Scanning: MCQ questions.
B. Questions to Answer Immediately: Table/ Flow Chart/ Sentence/ Summary completion, short answer.
C. Questions to take note of: Map/ Diagram labelling, matching etc. 

There is a subtle difference in strategic approach that you can take for solving each of these questions. However, I think you can only relate to these strategies once you have been practicing for some time now. So, if you are just starting out- maybe you should skip this section and revert back to this later on:

A. Questions for Scanning: For MCQ questions, the answer options are in front of your eyes when you are listening to the audio. So, you can quickly go through the answer options over and over again with quick movements of the eye. Your approach should be to read the options repeatedly and identify 'keywords' within them- so that you can instantaneously identify the correct answer option while listening to the audio.

B. Questions to Write Down Immediately: For Table/ Flow Chart/ Sentence Completion questions, you have to write down the answers as soon as you feel that it has been expressed in the audio- it is because you won't have the time later to revert back to that question/ think it over before putting in the answer. If you feel like you have figured out the answer- write it down, but if you are not so sure- just let it go and move on to the next question, because there is no time you can afford to get stuck on one question. 

C. Questions to Take Note Of: Matching and Map Labelling fall under this category. This is the only question type that I think allows you some time to reconsider your answer options. Let me give you an example from Map Labelling questions. For these questions, usually there's a map with different areas marked with different letters of the alphabet, and you need to match these letters with different answer options given in the question- you already know what I'm talking about if you are familiar with this question type. My suggestion would be to make use of the pencil and paper given to you in the exam hall. Write down on the paper the letters A to J (or whatever that is marked on the map) at the beginning, and as you progress through the audio- write down the names of different parts of the map next to each letter as they are mentioned by the speaker. Once the audio finishes playing, you can easily match these letters with the answer options given in the question.

You have to READ THROUGH the answer options for each question thoroughly and repeatedly during the breaks in between different sections of the listening test. Your success in identifying the correct answer options will depend largely on how thoroughly you have read the answers beforehand. So, in reality, the listening test also ends up evaluating your reading speed- the faster you can go through the answer options within limited time, the higher your probability of answering correctly is.

The whole journey of IELTS preparation can be a fun experience if you take up some ussful habits that are both interesting and educative. For example, reading newspapers/ novels/ articles regualry, listening to podcasts on your topics of interest, listening to audiobooks or, debates on current affairs etc. These habits will enrich your general knowledge, as well as, help you with your IELTS reading and listening skills. You can also read the blogs on IELTS Simon's old website- I have given the link above. Most importantly, these will help you develop the habit of thinking in English- which will in turn help with your speaking skills. These activities are enjoyable and will help keep your motivations up in the long run.

On an ending note, these are all the learnings from my experience of taking the exam. This basically is a note on taking a very compact preparation within a short period of time. Such short preparations may not be suitable for everyone, and hence, many people may not find this post useful. But even if only a handful of people find this useful, my purpose would be served. Please correct me if there's any error in informatiom that I've provided. Also, please let me know in the comments section if it helps you even a little bit in your IELTS journey. Good luck and God bless your IELTS preparations!"

she is SO impatient when it comes to math, she immediately gives up on any question she doesn't know and reverts to the answer key/chatgpt to cheat.

she has dropped out of her in-school math course in favour of online math (same curriculum) solely for the fact that she can use AI to cheat her way through the coursework. she has openly (and rather cockily) bragged about using chatgpt to do 20 PAGES of homework without learning a thing. i tried advising her this is not fair to herself/her classmates and that she's only failing herself, but she essentially laughed and told me i didn't have a good enough argument and that she doesn't care.

in all my years of tutoring, i've never gotten frustrated with a student, but i do feel offended and a bit disrespected. i have such a crazy schedule this term (no days off until december, woohoo!) and have had to turn down truly motivated students due to my prescheduled sessions with this student 2x/week. i feel like she's wasting my time when i could be helping people who want to put in more than 0 effort.

like what do i do? WIBTA if i told her how i feel she's wasting both our time? i almost want to contact her school and let them know everything she's told me about chatgpt, but i think i might be out of line. PLEASE ADVISE!!



this may or may not be relevant, but kind of need to rant...i'm having other issues with this student, including:

\- lying when i ask her if she understands something (says yes, then goes to do it wrong or not at all)

\- claiming the next question is ""easy and obvious, so we can skip it"", only to giggle and confess she has no idea when i press her to prove that she can do it 

\- i'm in the middle of showing her the step-by-step on how to solve a problem/showing her where she went wrong, she completely ignores me and frantically searches for an answer key (this has gotten so distracting i have to confiscate the answer keys while we work)

\- tells me she doesn't need me for help on homework because she has chatgpt, instead only wants help DURING ONLINE EXAMS (i shot that down immediately)

\- doesn't believe me when i tell her something is right or wrong; is only ever convinced by the answer key (e.g., does not believe that 10\*20 is different from 10\^20, despite explaining the concept in many ways...still frequently punches in \* on calculator despite physically writing a number as an exponent)

\- the only time she confidently approaches problems is when there is an almost identical replica in front of her to copy each step

  
i would've fired this client long ago, only her parents have prepaid me for another few hours. help me !!"

I wish someone could tell me these before I apply for my master's degree : 

1. Language is a huge thing in this degree if English is not your first language and I am pretty sure you have to work really hard to catch up with others. Even I passed my IELTS with 8.0 ( my uni only required 6.5 ) it is still hard for me to understand the context and the background information, I spend double time studying/ compared with other English native speakers students. 

2. It is really hard to get a job in this industry without citizenship if you are looking forward to getting a 'fancy political job ' when you graduate, and supporting yourself, it is a really hard job to try your best to make yourself different from other students ( eg. you can use some data analysis tool / coding / visualizing data/ canvas 

  
3. Networking is more important than your Wam/GPA. Uni told us a lot of theories and asked us to do a lot of assignments, but they didn't tell us some soft skills ( which I learned from Reddit ), these soft skills include: how to connect with other people in the workplace; how to maintain a good relationship with some seniors, how to find an internship, how to do a job interview, etc. 

  
4. Understand the terminology before reading your materials. Use ChatGPT to help you study that will be easier to read and understand. 

  
if you wanna discuss this more plz dm me I have almost finished my internship in  Australia. love people and their help from this community ! cheers !

I am at a total loss with ""Taylor"". She is SO impatient when it comes to math, she immediately gives up on any question she doesn't know and reverts to the answer key/ChatGPT to cheat her way through it.

Taylor has dropped out of her in-school math course in favour of online math (identical curriculum) solely for the fact that she can use AI to cheat her way through the coursework. She has openly (and rather cockily) bragged about using ChatGPT to do over a dozen pages of homework without learning a thing. Furthermore, after switching to online math, Taylor outright told me she doesn't need me for help on homework (because she has ChatGPT, of course!!), instead only wants help DURING ONLINE EXAMS (I shot that down immediately).

I tried advising her cheating is not moral or fair to herself/her classmates and that she's only failing herself, but Taylor essentially laughed and told me I didn't have a good enough argument to convince her and that she doesn't care anyways.

I've never once gotten frustrated while teaching a student, but I am offended and disrespected. I have such a crazy schedule and have had to turn down motivated students due to my prescheduled sessions with Taylor twice/week. I feel like she's wasting my time when I could be helping kids who want to put in more than 0 effort.

I am already very biased against AI, ChatGPT, and the like, so to hear one of my own students proudly use it makes me irrationally upset. 

WIBTA if I contact Taylor's school and let them know everything she's told me about cheating? Alternatively, WIBTA if I reprimanded her myself; telling her she's wasting her time, my time, and my other clients' time? 

Only problem is her parents have prepaid & scheduled me for 20 hours (only 7 more to go!) so I can't fire her as a client...as much as I want to.

TL;DR: My high school student brags to me (tutor) about using ChatGPT for homework/test answers and I want to rat her out to her school for academic misconduct.



This may or may not be relevant, but in case you're interested...I'm having other issues with Taylor, including:

* lying when I ask her if she understands something (says yes, then goes to do it wrong or not at all)
* claiming the next question is ""easy and obvious, so we can skip it"", only to giggle and confess she has no idea when I press her to prove that she can do it
* in the middle of showing her the step-by-step on how to solve a problem/showing her where she went wrong, she completely ignores me and frantically searches for an answer key (this has gotten so distracting I have to confiscate the answer keys while we work)
* doesn't believe me when I tell her something is right or wrong; is only ever convinced by the answer key
* the only time she confidently approaches problems is when there is an almost identical replica in front of her to copy each step"

I have a hearing impairement since birth. I use hearing aid also. Throughout my life, I faced huge difficulty in communication. Because of this disability, I was isolated by my classmates, friends, relatives and even my own family since I was not able to properly communicate with them. I even remember some of my classmates using cursewords against me since I was not able to hear them properly. On top of that I was not a good student too because of this. I have always tried to be a good student but this disability failed me. I remember during my school time, the teacher always ask questions and those who were not able to answer will get the stick treatment. I always say down scared if she will ask me and I was sure I won't be able to answer since I didn't heard her properly during the class. I was always that on guy who always get hit with stick.

Even with all these difficulties, I tried hard and completed post graduation. I have back papers of my PG subjects, some of which I have cleared much easier due to AI chatbots like Chatgpt, copilot and Gemini. Without this AI technology, I would still not be able to clear the back papers. I have still some more papers which I'm sure that I will clear with much ease. 

I currently work in Biosciences research as a research associate. I'm sure I will excel in this field some day soon, all thanks to the AI chatbots which helped me learn better without any discriminations. 

There are a lots of supportive measures in other countries for anyone who suffer from disabilities. I have always wished if those where present in India too. 

Apart from hearing, I have no issues with health. I'm a trained martial artist and maintain a good physique by working out since 2019 new yr.

I feel so isolated in India. I have always been ignored and discriminated against because of this disability. I have plans to move abroad where there is better support for disabled people.

What should I do? I have always been so proud to be an Indian and always advocated for our country. Even then, having thoughts to move abroad is disheartening."

I saw a reddit here about ""cheating"" through ChatGPT during prelims. That is true. I am a freshman student and I am still adjusting to the environment, and to be honest, the “cheating culture"" in UST really got me shocked and disappointed. What bothers me the most is that I am being influenced to cheat as well, because they say it's ""normal"" to cheat in UST kapag mahirap na magpa-exam yung prof. I am pertaining to the subjects THEOLOGY and BUSINESS STATISTICS, because these are the subjects where students frequently use ChatGPT on exams. It made me feel like my environment is hostile, because of the fact that students are not genuinely learning sa mga subjects na 'to.

Honestly, ako talaga yung type of student who's against cheating, because I know na nagsisikap ako to reach my desire grades. However, I pity those students rin who use ChatGPT for the sake of grades, BUT I do not tolerate this. Other students would use this kasi to get away with the struggles and to pass lang, which is unfair and desperate. :( 

My other classmates have high scores because of ChatGPT, hindi lang during PRELIMS but also during SUMMATIVE EXAMS. Tapos sa recitation, walang masagot. What frustrates me is that ako na naghihirap, hindi nakapasa. Silang mga gumamit ng Al, matataas nakukuha.

Ang tanong ko lang rin, bakit through canvas nagpapatest if they want their students to remain truthful? They know the risks of students when holding a device. In my case, some of my blockmates are proud to use ChatGPT/ cheat pa during exams. Professors must implement ways to avoid cheating, like use paper instead of using Canvas kapag prelims/ quizzes. Nasasanay ang mga estudyante if hindi sila natuturuan ng maayos. I am not saying professors should be more STRICT because that is not effective. What I am saying is that they should learn how to teach students more productively.

• Message to Professors: Please acknowledge the students na nakikita niyong passionate talaga matuto. ALSO, please teach properly and do not normalize the mentality that your students are in ""college"" na, kaya dapat lang na mag-self study sila. If you cannot guide your students correctly, do not expect everyone to pass in your subject & make a big deal of their actions. It's time to re-evaluate your teaching styles if the whole section's performance is bad.

(Also, thank God may evaluation na for profs, is this effective and will the admin really scan through this?)"

I'm a second-year student at the University of Sydney studying Data Science & Finance. I've been struggling to find a finance internship and feel like being on a student visa in Australia might be making it tougher, but honestly, I don't want to use that as an excuse.

I've tried searching online, using ChatGPT, and even talking to people in finance, but I’m having a hard time with networking—cold emailing hasn't been working for me. Plus, I’m a bit lost on what experience to highlight for my first internship.

If any of you have been in the same boat, could you share some advice on what helped you? Or suggest things I could start learning or doing to get closer to landing an internship?

Appreciate any help! :)

1gafonv,3,2024-10-23,AITAH for questioning how my professor graded an exam?,u/Appropriate-Lock-914,AITAH,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gafonv/aitah_for_questioning_how_my_professor_graded_an/,"Throwaway account since I post on my uni’s sub and don’t want to dox myself.

I (23M) have been working professionally for 3 years and returned to uni to pursue a new career. I recently had a midterm in a management course where the professor didn’t provide a rubric for the long-answer questions, only stating that 3 questions were worth 15 points total. I asked her during the exam how the points were split between questions, and she said she wasn’t sure but the first question (which was much longer) would count for more. I ended up getting zero on the last two questions, which were worth 8 points total (27% of the entire exam). Nearly half the class also got zeros. It’s also not a curve based system.

I emailed the professor afterward, asking about the point distribution and expressing surprise at the weight of the last two questions. I didn’t think they were worth as much based on her answer during the exam. She responded by saying she was shocked by my email, and we arranged to meet in person.

At the meeting, I explained that I wanted to learn from my mistakes and understand the exam better. She seemed frustrated with all the questions she was getting from students and repeatedly expressed surprise that so many people got the last two questions wrong. When we discussed how she distributed the marks, she said those two questions were the most important. I was confused since they only took up one slide in the lecture and weren’t emphasized much.

I asked if she was open to constructive criticism, and she said yes. I started by saying I liked her lectures, but maybe more time could’ve been spent on the important questions in class. She cut me off, saying my feedback was an excuse and that I had no right to criticize her because she’s taught the course for years, while I’d only taken it once.

She then went on a long rant, saying I was rude and disrespectful for questioning her in the email. She said that in the “real world,” I’d be seen as unprofessional for questioning a superior like that. I apologized multiple times, explained that I never meant to be disrespectful, and told her I just wanted to learn.

Now I’m confused. Did I go too far? or did she go too far? Is this okay for a professor to say things like that? Although I think what she did is wrong I’m still questioning myself if I’m the asshole and I’m just not understanding it since she’s a management professor and the head of the masters in management department. Surely she knows a lot more about management and teaching than me. I’m also trying my best not to offend her any further because she does mark my exams so  I don’t want to jeopardize my grade.

TL;DR: My professor called me disrespectful for asking how she graded an exam, then said questioning a superior is unprofessional. 

Note: I had a very detailed version but I thought it would be too long so I asked ChatGPT to make it short for a reddit post"
1gai1f0,1,2024-10-23,Feeling discouraged,u/Chance_Anywhere7088,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1gai1f0/feeling_discouraged/,"This isn’t a terrible post, I am in no way in a horrible position. I’m a sophomore in engineering mechanics (theoretical and applied mechanics if you want to be fancy) and currently I have a 3.9 gpa with 40+ credits done. I am not really a bad student.

I just can’t help but feel like I’m doing something wrong. I’m getting pretty sick of the grind. The last year and a half, I’ve essentially had 12-15 homework’s regularly due every week on top of weekly quizzes, midterms, random projects, gen ed busy work, and extracurriculars as well as interviews and just balancing social life on top of it. Currently, I’m taking 18 credits of 5 engineering courses.

Essentially the last year and a half I’ve chegged/chatgpt/got answers from my friends for all my homework assignments. I skip majority of my lectures to catch up in time for the next weekly quiz or exam, and I almost always do well. I can’t help but feel guilty and sick of it. I don’t feel that there is enough time to throughly learn each subject and keep up with the pace of each class. I know this has worked out for me, and I am doing well, but I just want to be able to keep a pace and stay on track with everything. I really enjoy learning, but I just feel like it’s unrealistic to sit down and enjoy what I’m doing with everything I have to prepare for and do. I just am tired of doing things this way. I don’t think I’m getting as much out of this degree as I should.

If anyone has any study/life advice that would be appreciated. I just feel burnt out and less excited about engineering lately."

I’m a third-year PhD student, and I feel completely overwhelmed. I’ve struggled with my health, facing chronic issues that started when I was young. It’s gotten progressively worse, making it hard for me to engage in university life, Everyone around me expects me to be over the moon and tells me how lucky I am to be here. While I know I am fortunate, there are times I wish I hadn’t passed the entrance exam. I recognize that I sound ungrateful, but the stress of living in limbo makes it hard to commit to anything—like a job or even a houseplant. I constantly worry about being called for something that feels meaningless, and it seems like they expect me to be available 24/7.

It’s easier for others; most of my peers live closer to campus, while I’m 700km away. I feel pathetic for feeling this way, and I won’t tell anyone I know—especially my parents. My dad pushed me to pursue a PhD, and while I’m grateful for his support, I often think about how I still have no publications in my third year. I used to be so excited about my research, but now I feel isolated and scared I’m going to fail.

Travelling there is a huge stressor, getting there involves multiple buses and overnight layovers. I can't even consider staying in the dorms again; the last time I spent a month there, it was incredibly uncomfortable and painful.

I sometimes even wish for a deadly accident to make it all go away. The thought of quitting crosses my mind, but I can’t do that to my dad after all the support he’s given me. I used to take my education for granted in high school, which is why I wasn’t admitted to a better university for my undergraduate degree. But then, in my second semester, I realized I was ruining my life with my own hands. I was near failing, but I turned things around and became top of my class for the rest of my undergraduate and master’s programs, which is part of why I was accepted into this PhD program.

Now, I feel like I might be ruining everything again. every time i think about this my stomach starts to ache and my head feels heavy and I feel so anxious, I feel disgusted and helpless as time passes, and I keep wasting it on distractions. In the past seven months, I’ve watched over 300 anime series, 100+ shows and movies, and played about 20 video games. I tell myself every day, “I’ll start tomorrow,” but when tomorrow comes, I do the same thing and act like I never said anything. Even if I open browser tabs to start my work, the pile of tasks is so daunting that I close everything and say, “One more day, tomorrow I’ll do it.” I’m stuck in this endless loop.

My sleep is suffering as well; I often can’t fall asleep from overthinking until I’m utterly exhausted, and I find that I'm tiring myself out just to black out and get some rest. This leads to my sleep schedule getting later and later, making it even harder to focus during the day. It’s funny because if I didn’t have work to do, I know I would find everything I enjoy now boring. I want to be normal again. I want to set time aside for my work and catch up on what I’ve missed. I know my supervisors might be disappointed, but I don’t blame them, I’m disappointed in myself too.

I just need someone to hear me out. It feels isolating, and I’m desperate for a way to break this cycle."
1gak0aj,1,2024-10-23,HSG IS OVERRATED...,u/East_Ad9998,UniSG,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniSG/comments/1gak0aj/hsg_is_overrated/,"With this post I'm going to open a pandora box, but there are certain things that need to brought to attention to this reddit community and HSG community as well and in particular to those who do not speak German or Swiss German as their first language.

Nonethless this post is to challenge you and to bring perspectives on the issue.

I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Business Administration at HSG and now I have the feeling that is pretty useless. We're living in strange times, with AI going on and job market for academic graduates that is not what it was 10 or 20 years ago. 

Don't get me wrong, I luckly landed a job and worked there for 9 months. Nonethless also in the working place I noticed that people from FH tend to perform better respect to ""us"". 

\-I mean, I barely knew how to use Excel at work, I didn't know what Pivot was. So was it my problem or course ""operation management"" sucks?, (I remember my year we were allowed to bring with us a cheat sheet..). 

This is one of the many problems that I think HSG has, so the lack of focus of  development of practical skills really needed in the workplace. You can learn all the theory that you want, but if you don't know how to use Excel, PowerBI and so on, nowadays you are fucked up in the job market. Even in a research oriented institution like HSG, you need to consider this, because many of the students will end up in a job not with a PhD

The questions here arise: 

1) Is HSG completely overrated?. 

\- This because I continue to see happy Linkedin posts about parents that are proud of their children from graduating from the ""big"" HSG and students themselves that continue to consider HSG as a ""Ivy League"" university

\-Increasing number of assessies that brag about doing HSG

2) Does a Master at HSG makes sense. What I seen in the couse overview that unless you are doing an MA in Economics, the other are not better than the BBA. 

\--MA in Marketing is  useless: no one needs a students that has a master in marketing, 

\--Maccfinn and MBF: Same as BBA, they ""offer"" some course, but no practical utility, you can learn the stuff on ChatGPT while working

\--MA in MQiF: recruiter prefer much more people from STEM, because of their much stronger base in quantitative skills

I don't want waste my time speaking about the other like MGM or MBI

  
3) Jobs after HSG

\-With this kind of education, how do you manage to find a job if you are not german speaker and with increaseingly strong competition from FH students? 

\-How do you manage to pass the congnitive tests that all the big financial institutions require?

\-Do you look for opportunity elsewhere outside of Switzerland?

  
Let me know, hope to spark some interesting conversations about it. Thanks:)"

I use an eye tracker on an iPad and I can’t vocally speak or use of my limbs for anything. Before trying out ChatGPT, it takes me - not hours - but days just to complete one assignment. It’s exhausting. Most of the tasks require a lot of time are making annotations on my resources and actually preparing/writing the assignment or essay. 

I can see how ChatGPT can make things four times as efficient for me and I am not tempted to cheat. I’d get my degree and then I’d be fucked in the real world. My college obviously has a non-ChatGPT rule. However for students like me who without using ChatGPT as a tool, have to go through really fucked up barriers. The education system has always been fucked up that I am thinking of quitting and moving onto my alternative career path.

HOWEVER I want to see how to utilize ChatGPT for school. I want to know how to navigate around some of the ethical issues. For example, ChatGPT could give me ideas/insights that I’ve never thought before. How do I think about that? Another example would be that I am not permitted to utilize ChatGPT during an exam and I have to write an essay which would take hours. If I become reliant upon ChatGPT, then what would happen during an exam?

1garnuu,1,2024-10-23,Is my professor expecting too much?,u/OrdinaryAsk1,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1garnuu/is_my_professor_expecting_too_much/,"I'm taking my first CS class ever, introduction to C++, we've done easy stuff so far, and during the professors lectures, he teaches basic stuff. We've covered basic loops, if statements, arrays, and functions. His lectures are just those topics but pretty vague, they're around 10 lines max just showing off how the code works, but the homework is incredibly hard. 

Homework is two parts, the textbook work and assignments he created. The textbook work is doable, it's basically the same as his lectures just a bit more challenging, whereas his bs assignments he creates are wayyy harder. After covering arrays (ex. int arr[]={1,2,3};), he then assigns a whole two-player tic tac toe game, which is MILES more complicated than the basic toddler stuff he and the textbook teaches.

This isn't the first time, but this tic tac toe game just sets a whole new level. He has specific instructions, such as it having to be 2 dimensional array. At this point, as much as I want to do it on my own and not use chatgpt or YouTube videos, I literally won't be able to do it on my own. I tend to use chatgpt as a learning tool to replace my near useless professor and use the AI to actually learn rather than doing my homework for me, is that a good use of it as a student? Stuff like this makes me feel dumb and that I won't make it far in CS despite it being my dream, should I be basing my learning pace off the textbooks topics or my professor's extremely difficult assignments?"

In mythological or religious cosmology, the seven heavens refer to seven levels or divisions of the Heavens. The concept, also found in the ancient Mesopotamian religions, can be found in Judaism and Islam.  
(The Governors of Aire)  
including Jainism, also have a concept of seven earths or seven underworlds both with the metaphysical realms of deities and with observed celestial bodies such as the classical planets and fixed stars..  
Ancient near eastern cosmology largely accepted the existence of three heavens..

In Sylenkoite cosmology, there are three worlds within Dazhboh: Prav, Yav, and Nav:  
•Prav: The right law of nature  
•Yav: The visible, manifested world  
•Nav: The invisible, spiritual world  
Sylenkoite doctrine emphasizes that monotheism is a higher level of spiritual development than polytheism..  
In early church teachings, there were also three heavens..  
•First heaven: The atmosphere where birds fly  
•Second heaven: The space where the stars reside  
Third heaven: God's abode  
In Jewish cosmologies, the number of heavens could range from 3 to 365, but 7 was the most popular figure..

As state leaders, Governors advance and pursue new and revised policies and programs using a variety of tools, among them executive orders, executive budgets, and legislative proposals and vetoes. As chiefs of the state, Governors serve as the intergovernmental liaison to the federal government on behalf of the state.  
Clemency is an umbrella term that refers to several mechanisms that allow for the remittance of consequences of a committed crime.  
The authority for Governors to issue executive orders is found in state constitutions and states as well as case law or is implied by the powers assigned to state chief executives. Governors use executive orders—certain of which are subject to legislative review in some states—for a variety of purposes..

1gawozk,1,2024-10-24,Welcome to r/GreenAI,u/SAA2000,GreenAI,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenAI/comments/1gawozk/welcome_to_rgreenai/,"Welcome to r/GreenAI, a community dedicated to promoting and discussing sustainable, efficient, and accessible AI development. As we witness the exponential growth of AI capabilities, it's crucial to consider and address the environmental impact of these advances.

# What is GreenAI?

GreenAI is a field of research that advocates for considering the environmental and financial costs of AI development alongside traditional metrics like accuracy. Some key facts:

* AI compute requirements doubled every 3.4 months between 2012 and 2018
* Training a single large language model can emit as much carbon as five cars over their lifetimes
* The financial and computational costs of state-of-the-art AI research often exclude researchers from emerging economies

GreenAI proposes measuring and optimizing for efficiency in AI development, making the field more:

* 🌱 Environmentally sustainable
* 💡 Energy efficient
* 🤝 Accessible to researchers worldwide
* 💰 Cost-effective

# Why This Matters

The AI community is at a crucial junction. While we're achieving remarkable breakthroughs, the environmental cost is significant and growing. Consider that:

1. Large model training can consume more energy than 100 US households use in a year
2. Cloud computing already accounts for about 1% of global electricity consumption
3. Many researchers and students worldwide are priced out of participating in cutting-edge AI research

1gay1uf,1,2024-10-24,"Which Colleges to Apply To (Low class GPA, Strong SAT, Financially Poor)",u/TORNADOig,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1gay1uf/which_colleges_to_apply_to_low_class_gpa_strong/,"Hi everyone,

I'm seeking advice on which colleges I should consider applying to, given my mixed academic record and specific financial situation.

#### **Profile Overview:**

- **Academics:** My school GPA is low due to bad scores in 9th and 11th grades, but I did well in 10th (90%). I'm hoping to do well in my 12th grade too. I've been preparing for one of the world's hardest exams (JEE), so I expect to score well on the SAT, especially since math is super easy for me. Still working on the Reading and Writing part.

- **Taking a Gap Year:** I’m planning to take a gap year to work on the inconsistencies in my profile, improve my SAT scores, and strengthen my application overall.

#### **Extracurriculars (ECs):**

- Not sure if my ECs are strong, but here’s what I’ve been up to:

- Freelance graphic design agency and websites for small & local businesses

- Have been following AI development on Twitter since ChatGPT came out 2 years ago. So I’ve been working on small SaaS projects, using tools like Cursor & V0, building personal projects, Agentic Worlflow like with CrewAI and all, also for content creation I can make AI clones to automate videos.

- Small side hustles since age 14.

- Certificates: some Random App's SQL, HTML, CSS certificate; Harvard CS50p, Ongoing Maths for ML & DS Specialization (Andrew NG's DeepLearning.AI)

#### **Interests :**

- Interests: Cybersecurity, Computer Science, AI, Data Science, Economics.

#### **Financial Situation:**

- I can't afford college without a scholarship or a huge loan. It’s unlikely I’ll get a bank loan since my parents don't earn much and our local currency has a bad exchange rate (94:1).

- Here, people earning $20K are considered affluent.

### **Questions:**

- Given my low GPA but a potential strong SAT, what colleges should I consider applying to?

- Are there any colleges that offer good scholarships for students in my situation?

- What should I focus on during my gap year to improve my chances?

Thanks in advance for your suggestions!"

\---------------------------------

TL;DR by ChatGPT:

The Ministry of Education (MOE) in Singapore will introduce new device management applications for students’ Chromebooks and iPads starting in November 2024 and January 2025, respectively. Lightspeed Systems will be deployed on Chromebooks by the end of November 2024, while Jamf will be introduced for iPads in January 2025, requiring a guided onboarding process at schools. Windows devices will continue using Blocksi.

This update follows MOE’s removal of Mobile Guardian after a cybersecurity breach in August 2024 that affected 13,000 users. MOE confirmed legal action was taken against the contractors involved in the breach.

The new applications were selected for their mobile device management, usage management, and classroom management capabilities, as well as their compliance with security standards. Schools will receive training in November to ensure smooth deployment, and MOE will provide ongoing support during the transition, acknowledging that some initial challenges may arise.

\---------------------------------

SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Education (MOE) will roll out new device management applications to students’ Chromebooks and iPads from November 2024 and January 2025 respectively. 

Lightspeed Systems will be centrally deployed to Chromebook personal learning devices by the end of November 2024 with no additional steps required by parents or students, MOE said in a statement on Thursday (Oct 24). 

For iPads, Jamf will be deployed in January 2025 because students will need to go through a guided onboarding process in school, said the education ministry. 

Windows devices will continue to use Blocksi. 

The update follows MOE’s decision in August to [remove device management application Mobile Guardian](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mobile-guardian-application-remove-cybersecurity-incident-moe-4526676) from students' devices the day after a global cybersecurity breach

Mobile Guardian suffered a cyberattack on Aug 4 that affected 13,000 users from 26 secondary schools. In September, Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing confirmed that MOE [took legal action](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mobile-guardian-cybersecurity-breach-attack-legal-action-contractors-chan-chun-sing-4597791) against ""relevant contractors"" after the breach.

For parents who want “greater say” over how their children use their devices at home, MOE will continue to provide them with options to manage the devices after school hours, it said. 

Noting that no software solution is “entirely foolproof”, the education ministry said it has taken steps to ensure that the new applications “meet schools’ needs effectively”. 

The new applications were selected for their ability to meet “core technology requirements”, including mobile device management, usage management and classroom management, said MOE in its statement. 

They also comply with security standards, including independent third-party security attestations and certifications, said the ministry. 

To prepare to deploy these applications, schools will be trained on how to use them in November, said MOE. 

“MOE will provide resources to schools to guide them through the deployment process as well as to engage students and parents,” the statement read. 

Both schools and parents will need time to familiarise themselves with the new applications and may encounter “some teething issues”, MOE acknowledged. 

“MOE will provide the necessary support throughout the transition period and address any issues that may arise.”

1gb0m4q,74,2024-10-24,"Too much Diversity Hiring in corporate has social implications for Indian Men and also Creates Self Proclaimed ""Strong Independent Woman"" Tags.",u/Lazy-Discipline-4203,onexindia,https://www.reddit.com/r/onexindia/comments/1gb0m4q/too_much_diversity_hiring_in_corporate_has_social/,"I think Diversity hiring is unfair and is a discrimination towards Men and discredits meritocracy and has social implications.  
The job market is very tight since last 15-20 months, But Many foreign companies in India especially the American and European continue to aggressively push diversity hiring that many capable male candidates are left unplaced and Girls even with slightly less skill get easily employed. Since foreign companies have better pay and facilities than Indian counterparts, this creates a social imbalance as men earning less than girls or men working in low grade indian companies will be viewed as failed or worthless and Girls' ego boosts as she proclaims herself as a ""Strong Independent Girl"" which actually is a delusion and such girls think ""Males are inferior to them"" and they become entitled and feel that they must dream big and talk about My career My career shit while boys still thinking about Family's economic situation in tough market.

Example: Literally every 2nd girl in this university called ""IGDTUW"" is placed in Microsoft , Uber , Amazon , CISCO to the extent and quantity as if these companies were mass recruiters.

Of All my Guy and Girl acquaintances which had similar skillsets, almost all the girls have got placed very easily (even the girls with slightly less skills and projects) while guys still finding jobs thanks to ""THE RESERVATION GIRLS GET "" by many companies like EY, Deloitte, KPMG, S&P Global, CapGemini,Morgan Stanley , Goldman and Many more.

If Any of you people are working just check the proportion of females in HR/Operations roles into your company, the proportion of females so damn high like 70-80% as if HR positions in a company too are reserved for Women.

Infact during placement drives there are many companies who conduct ""Women only"" drives and straightaway exclude men from the hiring process.

So all the working women before proclaiming yourself as ""Strong Independent OverAchiever"" wake upto the reality. A lot of girls are gifted Jobs , they didnot earn it.

See the Data , the fresher Job placements for females skyrocketed despite overall weak job creation. This shows that A lot more number of women are hired than men even though there are 3-4 times more men in higher education and job seekers, This proves that women are hired at the expense of men.

I’ve called out so many students for using chatgpt to be emotional manipulators and it just straight up lies in ways I don’t think students normally would.

Emails like “puzzled”, “concerned”, “ensure my learning”, and so many more. Emails on and on about how much effort they put it into this and they just didn’t understand the assignment etc 

It’s normal to feel like a student misunderstanding is my fault and sometimes it is.

I came down very hard on an assignment since more than 1/3 of the students submitted my example solution as their solution with less than 1% changed. So grade distribution is basically all <=10% and all 90%+

Great for self-teaching any subject or getting a high-level view of what it might look to learn a specific subject.

**Prompt Chain**

`Define the course parameters: SUBJECT=[subject name], AUDIENCE=[target audience], DURATION=[course length in weeks]~Create a course outline with main modules, each focusing on a key aspect of the subject~For each module, list 3-5 specific learning objectives that align with the overall course goals~Develop a detailed syllabus including module titles, topics covered, estimated time for completion, and required materials~Create an introduction module that explains the course structure, expectations, and provides an overview of the subject~For Module 1, design a lesson plan with lecture content, practical exercises, and multimedia resources~Develop assessment methods for Module 1, including quizzes, assignments, or projects that test the module's learning objectives~Repeat the lesson plan and assessment development process for the next half of the modules~Create interactive elements for each module, such as discussion prompts, group activities, or hands-on projects~Design a mid-course project or assignment that integrates concepts from the first half of the course~Develop lesson plans and assessments for the remaining modules, incorporating more advanced concepts and building on earlier modules~Create a final project or exam that comprehensively assesses the entire course content~Develop a resource list including textbooks, online materials, and supplementary reading for each module~Create a glossary of key terms and concepts covered throughout the course~Design a feedback mechanism for students to evaluate the course and suggest improvements~Develop a guide for instructors, including teaching tips, common student challenges, and suggested solutions~Create a course completion certificate template and criteria for earning the certificate`

Make sure you update the variable in the first prompt, SUBJECT, AUDIENCE, and DURATION and then you can pass this prompt chain into [ChatGPT Queue](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chatgpt-queue-save-time-w/iabnajjakkfbclflgaghociafnjclbem?hl=en&authuser=0&utm_source=reddit) extension and it will just run autonomously.

\- Female Author

\- Cover had a dark pine forrest

\- Title was something along the lines of Pines or Forrest, maybe dark as well?

\- Plot was horror / thriller with some supernatural elements

\- Starts with a mentally handicapped kid on a school trip from a rural sleepy town surrounded by forest. Is bullied / something, and flees from the group, getting lost in the darker parts of the forest. He starts hearing things in his mind that ""infects?"" him. May be supernatural, or something to do with toxic soil / gases.

\- Other character includes the local doctor and his wife who is injured, and is wearing a leg cast. Wife had cheated on him with another local. Doctor seems to have some psychopathic behaviors.

\- Another character is a school teacher, who was always ""submissive"" in nature, cant remember how, but also winds up in forest (lured by missing child who is now infected, is searching for him) and also hears the voices, winds up eating the dirt and becomes infected as well. Wants her ""children"" (students) to join her

\-Things start going off in the town, as the plot progresses the infected teacher lures her students outside of their house at night and takes them

\-Infection spreads across the country at some point, military lock things down

\- The older brother of the initial lost kid finds him in the forest, and kills him with a pistol to put him out of his misery. He then leaves.

\- All characters in the story has something wrong with them as well, unsure if the infection is supernatural in nature, or an industrial accident. 

If anyone has any ideas, please let me know! been searching for years, and attempting chatgpt."

Hello, 2nd year computer science and engineering student here. It’s been 2 years since I started college, and in all that time, I haven’t made a single friend—not one. I’ve had social anxiety for as long as I can remember, and it’s like this constant wall between me and everyone else. I’ve tried talking to people, but it always just ends in small talk that goes nowhere.

I’ve pushed myself out of my comfort zone so many times, but it never seems to work. I sit alone in class, tucked in a corner, watching everyone else talk and connect. It sparks this insecurity and jealousy in me, and I’ve been feeling like this for 2 years now. I’m really scared that the next 2 years will be exactly the same.

My college life has become a cycle of waking up, going to class, learning whatever is taught, coming home, revising, and sleeping. I’ve even tried making friends on Reddit, but they eventually ghost me after a few conversations. I’ve become so lonely that I spend my free time talking to ChatGPT just to ease that feeling.

There’s so much more I could say, but I don’t want to waste anyone’s time. I guess I just needed to vent. As Travis Bickle once said, “I’m God’s lonely man.”

Thanks for reading.

1gb9ruz,8,2024-10-24,Am I stupid or Machine learning course is too hard?,u/One_Bonus_8960,Indian_Academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indian_Academia/comments/1gb9ruz/am_i_stupid_or_machine_learning_course_is_too_hard/,"Warning: Extremely long post, \~1400 words.

I am from a tier 4 local college in India, qualifications: currently in 5th semester, B.Tech.

I do not think I am academically challenged, I personally think I did pretty well in engineering entrance exam and state board exam. Even though my rank was good enough to get into ""good"" private colleges in Bangalore, I decided to stay in my home and attend a ""supposedly"" good private college close to home.

Needless to say, the college isn't good. It's pretty bad to be honest. Now I'm in my third year of computer science and engineering degree and the amount of problems in this college is ridiculous. Anyway, that's besides the point.

One of the problems in Indian engineering educations, is, according to most people, ""outdated syllabus"". I don't think this is a big issue, the standard CSE curriculum consists of all basic foundations of computer science. I don't see any problem with teaching the basics. Basic foundations of the field cannot be updated. I don't think such a thing is possible. 

However my college tries to fix this ""outdated syllabus"" issue 3rd year onwards. We are taught Web technologies (react, spring boot etc.) and I have checked that we have a blockchain elective, there's more, but this comes at the expense of theory of computation course taught in other colleges. My college also fixes the outdated syllabus problem by updating the machine learning course.

That is fine and all, but I think I might be stupid because I simply do not understand our machine learning course.

I have seen that all computer science programs in our country do have a AI/ML course in 3rd year. But in my college, it seems like we ONLY have AI/ML courses for a comp sci program 3rd year onwards because there's too many mandatory courses on AI that I am forced into (I didn't sign up for this, the program got updated this year, just before I entered 3rd year).

The mandatory courses are ""Machine learning and deep learning"" in 5th semester and ""NLP with generative AI"" in 6th semester, I am aware only of these, but I'm pretty sure there's one more in 4th year.

I will get into the syllabus but let me talk about projects. We have mandatory project in the ML/DL course, a mini project (also in AI/ML but we have a choice, though about 70% choices are in AI/ML), a minor project (similar to mini project), and senior year project (most likely the same structure as minor project in 3rd year).

It's evident that there is too much emphasis on ML in this college.

But I have problems with this, please correct me, I think I am stupid, please free to criticize my thinking.

My problem is that there is TOO MANY WORDS, TOO MUCH technical jargon thrown around without really explaining why things work.

Let me outline the syllabus:

1. Introduction to AI/ML, linear regression, logistic regression, Bayesian classification, decision trees.

2. Regularization, support vector machines.

3. Ensemble learning, bagging, boosting.

4. Neural networks, introduction, convolutional neural networks.

5. Sequence to sequence models, attention mechanism, transformers.

I have omitted many more parts of the syllabus, if interested, I can share the whole course plan.

In the above syllabus, only chapter 1 and neural network introduction has mathematics, the rest of the syllabus is just prose after prose. I feel like the course is way too abstract for an engineering course. They use fancy words but never ever explained anything deeply. 

Now the thing is, I don't have any problems with abstraction. Operating system course was also abstract, but not THIS abstract. We had plenty of low level concepts already taught in digital design and computer organization course so operating system, though abstract, made complete sense. But this course has been taught with no background in mathematics and statistics. None of the concepts which are taught in maths courses are linked in this course. Most of the course is just fancy diagrams and technical vocabulary thrown around, which I cannot seem to understand one bit, because I believe I do not have the necessary prerequisites to even understand these concepts.

I would like to say that, I would just move on by memorizing the fancy words (which is what I believe our teachers are doing) and passing the course somehow. But the problem is projects.

Projects are a massive part of my CGPA. I had no knowledge of AI prior to signing up for a mini project in AI, and once I signed up, there is no going back. I have no choice but to make projects in ML/AI for mini, minor and senior projects, the system is like that (I will come back to this later).

Problem with projects is that these problem statements are just... way too high level. I have looked up online, and it seems like most of these projects require at least a PhD to understand. I was required to do a literature survey on my problem statement (all on my own), but I did not understand A SINGLE WORD from whatever research papers I found. I somehow just memorized the key words and passed the review (thanks to ChatGPT), I had to present a power-point presentation with 5 research papers.

Some technologies (?) on which projects are made include: 

\- Generative Adversarial networks, 

\- Explainable AI, 

\- NN architecture search, 

\- Vision Transformers, 

\- Optimization, 

\- Proving the existence of a computer that can solve halting problem, 

\- Bringing back dead people 

(last two are obviously sarcasm, but I can make projects on the latter 2 as well as I can make on the others. Some problem statement are in an Alien language, I can tell you more about it if you want).

I just don't know why no other student seems to have any problems with this. This is just my personal opinion but I don't think knowing technical jargon is equivalent to understanding the concept. I don't say I understand something until I understand it as well as I can understand for example, elementary calculus, and I am pretty confident on my understanding of elementary calculus that I studied in class 12.

All other students just find some ready made project on GitHub and copy paste the research papers and use Humanize AI to somehow bring down the plagiarism rate.

I don't like doing projects like this one bit. I feel trapped because I cannot switch my problem statement. It also doesn't help that the professor coordinating mini, minor and the machine learning course is a big bully who threatens to fail me if I even think if changing my problem statement now. He's a bully in general, he has made it clear that whoever doesn't publish papers for mini and minor project (and cite his research and give him authorship) will not be eligible to pass the course. And he seems to mean it.

I also have to mention that, the course's lecture classes were finished in 7 days, with some 2.5 hours of lectures a day, a week before the semester officially began. Yes, entire syllabus I mentioned above was taught in 7 days, with 2.5 hours of continuous lectures every day. And now I am expected to make two projects in ML/DL and write papers about them.

I don't know what to do now. AI is getting shoved down my throat. I don't like making projects by plagiarizing others' work. I think I will like ML/AI if I learnt it slowly at my own pace, but it will probably take years until I begin understanding these research papers, let alone come up with a novelty.

Please help me, maybe I am completely wrong and all this is completely normal. But I don't see the same issue being raised by my friends in other colleges. It might be possible that my friends too don't care about the project and are like others in my college. I want to learn stuff deeply and not just at an abstract high level. That kind of learning feels so superficial and shallow. I understand that many people in computer science feel that there is no need to reinvent the wheel, but how can I make a car without ever understand how the wheels work, in as much detail as possible?

I would love to hear your thoughts. Thank you for your time. I know this post was too long. "

I've received next to zero guidance on building a syllabus for this class or the policies that should govern it. 

I have, for the most part, navigated those issues, save ChatGPT and other generative AI tools. Individual professors are left to design their own policies on AI. My class is culturally diverse, with many ESL students, who tend to use AI to translate their thoughts into English from their native tongue, while other atudents use AI to skirt doing work in general. 

Could I get some recommendations on the fairest policy I could implement in this context and perhaps some samples of policies that work for you? Also, I struggle here, too, because I want to make a good impression with the university not only so I can continue to adjunct, but because there is the possibility this could turn into a full-time job after I successfully defend my dissertation. 

Thank you all so much. "

I was a very active member of this group in July-August, and met a lot of people through this. I was active on given solution and answers that I wished someone had given me. I confess that I got very scared about some horror stories after my test and just deleted my account. I hope the lot of you got important stuff from it, and I know some still use my slides and notes. I am glad. 

Either way, I've passed. And the number one thing that helped me was... Tumblr. It wasn't AceQBank or the MCCPractice test. Here I got less anxious, saw a bunch of people going through the same thing. And I got better because it. So I would recommend to use it. Use it to get one or other partner in crime - to bitch about it, to compare notes and tips.. To teach. Teaching makes you learn. Unfortunately, I am under the impression that the majority just come here to help themselves, without helping others.. You shouldn't. Helping someone else is the best thing you can do for yourself. 

This is my journey, yours is going to be different, and that is ok:  
**- Context:** 30yo, graduated 2018 in south America (not a good student), internal medicine specialist (good one), working in a hospital for the past 5 years, + 1 year as a GP. My strength: ethics and ortho (I know... I just knew ortho stuff out of nowhere...). My weak subject: gyneco and peds.  
**- Time studying -** 3 months, not working, but a lot of procrastination. 

**- Tools:** CMPA online learning, AceQBank, MCC practice tests (all), Tumblr, ChatGPT, Uptodate

CMPA is good to get the ethical part of the test. I did see some questions on the practice tests that were taken from the CMPA. 

AceQBank: I did 90% of it, but around 4000 questions (repeated), average of 65%. I was really bad in the beginning, getting between 40 and 50% right. But I took one tag at a time, did 100-200 questions on repeat, googling everything I didnt know and taking notes.. Suddenly I improved to an 70-80% average. By the end I had a 90% average (on repeated questions). If anyone is as lost as I was in the beginning - someone that didnt even remember how old should we start iron on a newborn... Just go slow. I did 4 days of only peds, 2 days of only gastro, and so on. There ate 21 subjects. Go one at a time, before blending everything in... 

MCC Practice tests: DONT WASTE IT. Don't waste it in the beginning of your preparation. Once you have gone through all the subjects and started doing a full test on Ace (or Uworld, etc), and have gotten your time to less than 80 sec per question, then you start the MCC. I used it as (1) source of questions (2) time management training. On test day, those time management plannings helped me to stay cool throughout the whole 4 hours. Yes, the questions are similiar in length and time taken to answer it. No, my test was not just like it. Will talk more about it later. My scores on the practices test were all over the place. I had my minimum of 68% and my maximum of 81%. The average was 72%. 

Tumblr: I helped a lot around here. I would transfer my notes highlights here and make posts. People would comment on it and find me on DMs so I could explain something. I am a teacher back home, so I taught. The best thing. I remembered a lot because of it. It is not studying together, it is helping each other. When I had trouble with something, people would also help me out. Our july-august party was pretty neat. 

ChatGPT: Of course, always take it with a grain of salt. But it can help you producing rationales on questions you didnt get it. Just copy the question, signal which one is right, which one you marked, and it will explain to you why your thought process was wrong. Sometimes, the why the other one is right is not enough, you need to know why you are wrong. ChatGPT for the rescue..

Uptodate: Ive noticed on MCC Practice test that the source they often listed was uptodate. So I started using it for concepts or quick reads on a subject I didn't know much about. Ive found it more helpful than TNotes. But that is me. Ive been using Uptodate daily for more than 2 years, so I know how to use it. Ps: you can always copy the full text from uptodate to ChatGPT and ask it to summarize. It is amazing what the AI can do once you feed it information. 

  
**My test day - remote proctoring** 

a) Everything went perfectly fine. No mishaps, no disconnections. I had my phone and a neighbour's wifi as a back up if needed. I started it 20 minutes before the set time - because I was anxious. It was great, I was immediately connected to a nice proctor that went throught the security check with me. I had my office emptied, it was just my desk, a foot stool and a mirror behind me. No decor, no nothing. Everything else on the tiny hallway outside. I had a glass of water. I didnt go to the bathroom during the first session. I took my lunch break (45min). Rushed to the bathroom, took a quick shower to wake up, ate 1 slice of pizza and came back for the second session. The second session was easy, I finished it 1 hour ahead of the stipulated time. The first session I finished it 20 min before, reviewed my flagged questions, and submitted it 1 min before I needed to. 

b) Dress code: loose T-shirt, jacket and no-pockets leggings. Best thing ever. I also used socks, which I took off in the first 5 minutes.  I used the most comfy thing I owned (fake - i used my partner clothes because she has better stuff hahaha). I did take a shower in the 45 min break and washed my hair before the test, in the middle of the test and after the test. What can I say, it helps me to wake up and wash away any stress... 

c) Eating: Just a toast and water. i had gastritis, so I didnt drink coffee, afraid it could give me pain. Lunch, I just reheated two pieces of pizza. Ate one. That was it. I bathed in the sun, so I suppose it produced enough ATP to get me going...

d) Exercising: I wish I could tell you I ran everyday during my prep-time.. I didnt.. I did walk the dog daily, is that enough?

e) Sleeping: I knew I would have to wake up at 5 in my test day. So I started going to bed at 8-9 and waking up 5-6 am in the month prior to the test, so that my body would get use to it. It worked. I also scheduled my study time to 210 minutes. So that I could train my brain to focus for that long, instead of the 40 min it was used to. 

f) Subject: I do think having the cultural knowledge helped. My home country and Canada have a lot of common ground regarding medical culture, so I just answered as I would in my normal practice - apparently it worked. I imagine people coming from other countries would find it difficult, while Canadians are just "" pff, this is easy af\*"". CMPA helps a lot with this. Read through it, go in the news session and check out the commentary that they add about a lawsuit, that kind of stuff. Try to immerse yourself into what Canadians thing is right and what that think it is wrong. Specially related to the rights of women and children - I know it is really different in other cultures (not saying right or wrong, this is not a political debate).  I will respect the confidentiality clause and not talk about it. Please, respect it.

1gbepz3,1,2024-10-24,Are OpenAI's o1-mini and o1-preview Truly Undetectable? An In-Depth Review,u/gptgabe,stealthgpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stealthgpt/comments/1gbepz3/are_openais_o1mini_and_o1preview_truly/,"read here: [https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/are-openai-s-o1-mini-and-o1-preview-truly-undetectable-an-in-depth-review](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/are-openai-s-o1-mini-and-o1-preview-truly-undetectable-an-in-depth-review)

Since its inception, StealthGPT has understood that the most optimized form of AI content is humanized, undetectable AI content. Detectable content has no utility as an output than informing the user.

For the longest time, this undetectability is what was lacking from OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other mainstream llms. All the easily decipherable watermarks of bad AI writing were present in what ChatGPT users were delivered as outputs. If a student dared use ChatGPT for their schoolwork, any AI detector would immediately flag the text.

However, [with new AI models, o1-mini and o1-preview, being released to the public today](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/openai-previews-o1-ai-model-212105543.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADjyIPmLqZauF1QYsDT4MSEje1cFg-yq3l_RmaWxerdw4pig0q2PndnPBvif0vMgYdWqfqidqNscFMHU0rvm6NQ_ko39UCHjDBv_zlOGK0MUOA_goo-3mu2GoFHQbWNE3nJ1sQCIE47455SpjY_yRyKem73NgBPnDeLg73-TBSdj), the OG’s of AI content might’ve finally wised up about the future of AI and optimized their text to bypass AI Content detectors. That’s at least what we’re going to find out in this review.

# What is OpenAI’s o1-preview?

OpenAI’s o1-preview is the first of a slate of new AI models that take more time thinking so they can take on complex tasks and solve harder problems. New levels of reasoning have been input into the process of how these models generate their answers so that like the human thought process, o1-preview will try different strategies and recognize its own mistakes.

This makes for longer time generating outputs, but also more correct answers. o1-preview still does not have the capabilities of browsing the internet as GPT-4o, but for advanced reasoning, o1-preview touts itself as the new benchmark.

# What is OpenAI’s o1-mini?

OpenAI released two new AI models today. The first of which, o1-mini is a cost-efficient reasoning model meant to take on all the demands of STEM, specially math and coding. For 80% cheaper than their o1-preview tier 5 users of OpenAI’s API can o1-mini as a lower latency of o1-preview. Testing for speed against o1-preview and GPT-4o, o1-mini was 3-5x faster in delivering outputs.

After undergoing human preference evaluations, like o1-preview, o1-mini was determined to outperform GPT-4o in reasoning-heavy domains but gets outperformed in language-focused domains, something that spells doom on the detectability front.

# What is Undetectable AI?

OpenAI made these two models to address the STEM fields and made note of their capabilities in math, science and coding, however English or linguistics was largely amiss from their analysis and most likely from the new model’s machine learning.

Odds are it’s just as detectable as GTP-4o. That said, you may still be wondering what Undetectable AI is then. Undetectable AI is AI writing that has been made to feel like human writing by fine-tuning the language and removing the watermarks of AI writing such as low [perplexity and burstiness](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/how-do-perplexity-and-burstiness-make-ai-text-undetectable). Those watermarks of AI writing are the exact elements that AI detection tools use to flag content as being AI generated.

AI tools like ChatGPT might have some use cases, but the only way to make it useful as an essay writer or blog writer is to run the text through an AI humanizer, the likes of which are usually available from tech startups like the best, StealthGPT.

Now that you understand what undetectable AI is and [how to make ChatGPT undetectable](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/make-chatgpt-undetectable), lets see if the new AI models are worth using or if they’ll be detected.

# Are OpenAI’s o1-mini and o1-preview Truly Undetectable?

The only way we can determine whether these new Open AI models are undetectable is by passing them through AI detection tools like Turnitin, Originality, and GPTZero. First, lets see our outputs from each model.

Here is o1-preview’s essay about Los Angeles and San Francisco:

As you can see, the output now includes the duration of the AI’s thought process. When you click on that duration, an analysis of the AI’s thought process will drop down for you to see. More insight into this should open up new possibilities in terms of prompt engineering for more effective outputs.

At 7 seconds, we should expect o1-mini to be faster. Lets see:

o1-mini thought for only a second and didn’t provide a drop down menu of its process. With these two outputs, we’re gonna determine how detectable they really are.

# vs Turnitin

Running o1-preview through the most popular and widely-used AI detector, Turnitin gave us this result:

Turnitin immediately detected this was 100% AI generated content with 10 instances of plagiarism found. Here’s the result for o1-mini:

Slightly worse, 100% AI generated content detected with 11 instanced of plagiarism found. Not good. These new AI models need to come with a disclaimer about its actually utility.:

>“Only use this content it to inform yourself, not actually for anything useful.”

It should read.

# vs [Originality.AI](http://Originality.AI)

[Originality.AI](http://Originality.AI) came up with the same conclusions:

o1-preview was detected as 100% AI-generated content.

o1-mini was also detected as 100% AI-generated content. This exercise has become a closed case of low expectations.

# vs GPTZero

Lastly, before I move on to less obvious questions than the new ChatGPT’s detectability, lets run it through one last detector, GPTZero:

Same as the others. GPTZero detected o1-preview’s text to be 100% AI generated content.

And as for the new AI-model’s little brother, GPTZero detected o1-mini’s text to be 100% AI generated content.

# Conclusion

Nothing is new under the sun. ChatGPT’s ambitions in automation never included using their content in professional or academic settings. Thus, their new models are as completely detectable as GPT-4 turbo.

If you’re a student, thinking about using o1-mini or o1-preview to write your essays, don’t. You will need an undetectable AI software if you don’t want to be accused of academic misconduct. You will need StealthGPT, the most undetectable AI writing tool in the game. You can visit our [pricing](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/pricing) here, where plans are tailored to your needs and discounts are abundant to make sure everyone has the opportunity to use the most optimized AI-content on Earth.

# FAQ

# Can OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4 Be Detected By Plagiarism Checkers?

Yes. Absolutely. Though we tested their new AI models, certainly their old one is just as unable to bypass AI detection tools as the new.

# How to Avoid AI Detection

You will need to humanize your text by removing the watermarks of AI writing such as low perplexity and burstiness. Undetectable AI services like StealthGPT humanize text by making it feel like human writing with high complexity and randomness in the text’s word choice, sentence structure, and sentence length.

# Is StealthGPT Undetectable?

Yes. We’ve proven it time and time again, against AI detectors large and small. No matter if it’s the largest tool on the market, or some free tool in some dark corner of the internet. We’ve tested our software against the best of the best to prove no AI detector or other undetectable service compares to StealthGPT."
1gbk12r,42,2024-10-24,Build comprehensive courses and learning materials. Prompt included. ,u/CalendarVarious3992,ChatGPTPromptGenius,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1gbk12r/build_comprehensive_courses_and_learning/,"
Here’s  a neat prompt chain for being able to generate a course for any subject. Great for self-teaching any subject or getting a high-level view of what it might look to learn a specific subject.

**Prompt Chain**

`Define the course parameters: SUBJECT=[subject name], AUDIENCE=[target audience], DURATION=[course length in weeks]~Create a course outline with main modules, each focusing on a key aspect of the subject~For each module, list 3-5 specific learning objectives that align with the overall course goals~Develop a detailed syllabus including module titles, topics covered, estimated time for completion, and required materials~Create an introduction module that explains the course structure, expectations, and provides an overview of the subject~For Module 1, design a lesson plan with lecture content, practical exercises, and multimedia resources~Develop assessment methods for Module 1, including quizzes, assignments, or projects that test the module's learning objectives~Repeat the lesson plan and assessment development process for the next half of the modules~Create interactive elements for each module, such as discussion prompts, group activities, or hands-on projects~Design a mid-course project or assignment that integrates concepts from the first half of the course~Develop lesson plans and assessments for the remaining modules, incorporating more advanced concepts and building on earlier modules~Create a final project or exam that comprehensively assesses the entire course content~Develop a resource list including textbooks, online materials, and supplementary reading for each module~Create a glossary of key terms and concepts covered throughout the course~Design a feedback mechanism for students to evaluate the course and suggest improvements~Develop a guide for instructors, including teaching tips, common student challenges, and suggested solutions~Create a course completion certificate template and criteria for earning the certificate`

Make sure you update the variable in the first prompt, SUBJECT, AUDIENCE, and DURATION and then you can pass this prompt chain into [ChatGPT Queue](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chatgpt-queue-save-time-w/iabnajjakkfbclflgaghociafnjclbem?hl=en&authuser=0&utm_source=reddit) extension and it will just run autonomously. Would love to hear what course you build.

1gbor0o,1,2024-10-25,ChatGPT 4 vs Gemini: A Practical Comparison of Leading AI Models,u/Capital_Cabinet_6869,u_Capital_Cabinet_6869,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Capital_Cabinet_6869/comments/1gbor0o/chatgpt_4_vs_gemini_a_practical_comparison_of/,"https://preview.redd.it/jdjl3iy6vuwd1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34ee8d4d94b931f126f795478d79d0396c1c3f5d

In today’s rapidly evolving AI landscape, two standout platforms leading the way are [**ChatGPT 4 and Gemini AI**](https://uniathena.com/chatgpt-4-vs-gemini-which-ai-is-better). Both are powerful, user-friendly tools designed to enhance content creation, facilitate conversation, answer queries, and troubleshoot. Despite their similarities, each brings unique strengths and specific areas for improvement. Let’s explore these two cutting-edge AI models to understand what makes them different.

# ChatGPT 4: A Friendly Conversational Partner

ChatGPT 4 is a powerful AI that excels at understanding and responding naturally to user inputs, much like having a conversation with a helpful assistant. This model leverages extensive data to provide intelligent, responsive answers across various topics. Whether you’re looking to solve a problem, get advice, or just chat, ChatGPT 4 is there to engage meaningfully.

Imagine having a query or needing a quick summary; you type it out, and ChatGPT 4 comprehends your message and responds in a clear, useful way. This AI model has a unique capability to “learn” from ongoing interactions, making it feel more conversational and human-like over time. ChatGPT 4 is ideal for situations that need a friendly touch and reliable answers.

# Gemini AI: The Intelligent Assistant

Gemini AI, on the other hand, functions as an advanced assistant focusing on deep understanding and learning. This tool is based on artificial intelligence techniques designed to make computers smarter and more adept at human-like reasoning. Gemini uses massive datasets to make decisions, offering accurate predictions and responses that aid in analyzing complex ideas and situations.

For instance, Gemini can assist in recognizing objects in images or interpreting complex data sets. It enables computers to make smarter, contextually aware choices. Think of it as a tool that supports analytical tasks or areas requiring in-depth reasoning — perfect for industries needing precise interpretations or future predictions.

# Comparing the Strengths: Is Gemini Better than GPT-4?

Both models are state-of-the-art AIs with unique strengths. Google’s Gemini shines when it comes to advanced reasoning and grasping sophisticated concepts. It’s like having an assistant who’s a deep thinker, capable of tackling complex topics such as scientific theories or philosophical ideas. Gemini’s specialty lies in complex, nuanced problem-solving.

Conversely, [**ChatGPT 4**](https://uniathena.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-for-business-2024?utm_source=SEO&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=SEO_BlogSharing_BlogSubmissions_25-10-24&utm_pos=organic&utm_page=login), short for “Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4,” excels in understanding and generating human-like language. It’s a great fit for more conversational tasks, such as customer support, writing assistance, and day-to-day inquiries. ChatGPT 4 works like a supportive friend who is skilled at making conversation and responding in a way that feels intuitive and meaningful.

# Gemini vs. ChatGPT 4: Additional Differences

Aside from differences in language processing and data, ChatGPT 4 and Gemini AI have some specific functional variations:

* **Conversational Learning**: ChatGPT 4 can retain context in conversations, which enhances continuity. Gemini AI also has this feature, though it’s currently more limited.
* **Response Drafts**: With Gemini, you can review multiple drafts for a single query. ChatGPT 4, however, offers one response per question.
* **Editing Responses**: While you can modify responses in Gemini, ChatGPT doesn’t support post-response edits.
* **Real-time Internet Access**: ChatGPT recently enabled real-time web access, though only for premium users. Gemini has had this feature for some time.
* **Photo-based Responses**: Gemini can search for images via Google due to its internet access. ChatGPT Plus users can now generate unique AI images as well.
* **Text-to-Speech**: Gemini supports text-to-speech, while ChatGPT currently lacks this feature.

# Conclusion

Both ChatGPT 4 and Gemini AI offer impressive capabilities, though each shines in different areas. ChatGPT 4 is a fantastic choice for seamless conversation and straightforward answers, whereas Gemini excels in more analytical, complex problem-solving.

For professionals, students, and businesses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, understanding these differences can be pivotal when choosing the right tool. Each of these AIs can enhance productivity and improve learning, but your specific needs should guide your choice.

1gbr61b,1,2024-10-25,13 Best Side Hustles For Working Moms,u/dimeintime,workingmoms,https://www.reddit.com/r/workingmoms/comments/1gbr61b/13_best_side_hustles_for_working_moms/,"Balancing work and family is no small feat for working moms, and adding a side hustle might seem daunting. However, side hustles can be incredibly rewarding by providing additional income, flexibility, and a creative outlet outside the 9-to-5. Working moms can earn extra money and still manage their responsibilities with the right side hustle.

Here’s a look at some of the best side hustles that align well with a working mom’s busy schedule.

**(1) Freelance Writing or Blogging**

Freelance writing is a flexible, highly rewarding side hustle, especially if you enjoy writing. From blog posts to copywriting and technical writing, there are many avenues for freelance work, with a wide range of pay depending on experience and the type of content.

**(10) Renting Out Space or Equipment**

If you have an extra room, basement, or garage, consider renting it out for storage or as a temporary living space. Platforms like Airbnb and Neighbor make it easy to rent out living spaces, while websites like Fat Llama allow you to rent out things like camera equipment, tools, and other items you own but may only use sometimes.

* **Where to Start:** Airbnb and Neighbor for space rentals, or Fat Llama for equipment rentals.

* **Where to Start:** UserTesting, Swagbucks, and InboxDollars are popular platforms.
* **Potential Earnings:** Surveys and tests pay between $1 and $10 each, with user testing often offering higher payouts.

**(13) Delivery Driving or Ride-Sharing**

If you have access to a car, consider delivery driving for services like DoorDash, Uber Eats, or Instacart. For those with flexible schedules, this can be a convenient side hustle, primarily if you work during peak hours.

* **Where to Start:** Sign up with apps like DoorDash, UberEats, Instacart, or Uber.
* **Potential Earnings:** Delivery drivers make between $15 to $25 per hour, often more with tips during busy times.

**Choosing The Right Side Hustle**

Consider your skills, interests, and time availability when considering a side hustle. Flexible and remote options work best for busy moms, and many side hustles require minimal startup costs. Once you’ve chosen a side hustle, set realistic goals, create a schedule, and enjoy the benefits of having an extra income stream!

Starting a side hustle doesn’t have to take time away from family; instead, it can empower working moms by offering financial security, new skills, and opportunities for creativity."

Learning web and app development has been challenging; I get stuck in tutorials and give up. Debugging minor issues overwhelms me, while my friends handle them easily.


I struggle with structured thinking and rely on friends for important decisions. My memory isn't great; learning new programming languages is tough, and sometimes I have to derive equations because I can't recall them. My memory is becoming bad as time passes 


I've tackled some data structures and algorithms problems and can handle medium-level Leetcode challenges. Recently, I took some CS courses—did well in theory but did below average in course like GPU programming, possibly due to my slow learning curve, and lazy axse.


Currently, I'm interning at a Fortune 100 company, but I feel their impression of me is just satisfactory. Since work is research oriented, I rely heavily on ChatGPT for writing code. While I understand the code, I can't write it independently.


Switching to product management or consulting doesn't seem like an option; I lack structural thinking and strong communication skills and have been dealing with ADHD.


I'm unsure if these traits will hinder my long-term career prospects. I could use advice on improving work ethic, efficiency, and accelerating my learning curve.


Has anyone been in a similar situation and managed to improve in tech?


For background i have been a very slow learner during my school and higher school. don't know how i managed to get in top 5 iit.


TL;DR: Feeling like an imposter due to slow learning and memory issues. Struggling with coding independently. Seeking advice on improving work ethic and learning efficiency.

1gc07re,62,2024-10-25,"Studying tips for all you sad first years, from a fourth year",u/Ill-Comfort-3913,UofT,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1gc07re/studying_tips_for_all_you_sad_first_years_from_a/,"**Before reading below**

PLEASE KEEP IN MIND, we are all different in the ways we study, one method may be incredibly useful for one person, while completely useless for another person.

For example, I vehemently hate notion for many reasons, but I know people who love it and can succeed using it

I am currently averaging a 4.0 this semester, and ill probably end it will a 4.0.

While I am not personally in STEM, these tools might be even better for STEM then the Criminology courses I am in.

# Preface

Hi everyone, I've been seeing an influx of depressing posts both on this Reddit and Instagram.

Whether it is in the current year or when I first got into UofT, being a first year student is incredibly stressful. When I first got into UofT, I did not know how to properly study, nor did I understand how to excel in university. Consequently, my first year GPA was abysmal (3.4)

Failing a midterm, doing poorly on a midterm, or just getting a bad grade is one of the worst feelings in the world. This is made worse with the perception that your peers are doing better then you, especially if you've been studying while other people have just been partying.

The sad truth is, it is not about the amount of time you study, but HOW you study. I don't like saying this because its cringe, **study smarter not harder**.

**Example**:

* I took a Astronomy course a while back, I did not formally study at all, course average was \~60 and I got a 91% on the midterm. Not perfect, but the only ""studying"" I was glance over my notes the night before (1 hour).

  
**But, there is hope!** 

There **is** and **is not** a magic solution to studying.

My formula for studying 

Success = Studying x Enjoyment x Time

Higher success = better performance.

(Nothing too complex, probably doesn't work in many cases, just a showcase of my logic)

**There is not a magic solution because:** 

* You cannot study for an hour a day and succeed in every course. That is simply impossible. 
* Flashcards wont save you if you have not looked at a course until the day before a midterm
* Formula for you nerds
   * Success = Studying x Enjoyment x Time 
   * Success = Studying x 100 x 1 
      * You may enjoy something a lot but if you do not spend the time, you will not succeed. 

**There is a magic solution because** 

* Think about it this way, studying is a constant, you must always study.
* SO, to influence studying, we instead manipulate our feelings towards it, THIS IS THE MAGIC SOLUTION.
* Think about it.
   * If you enjoy studying -> you will retain information more and study better -> you will succeed.
* **Example:** You probably all like watching Netflix, I bet if I was to ask you the plot of an episode of a show you really liked, you would be able to recount it to me almost perfectly. Why? It is because you were engrossed with the show and enjoyed it so much that even though you only watched the episode once, you still remember almost every part of it.
* Formula again 
   * Success = Studying x Enjoyment x Time
   * Success = Studying x 100 x 10 
      * With time and enjoyment, you will have a higher chance of success.

Thus, this guide as 2 goals

* Teach you how to study (possibly using tools)
* Make it fun

**Quick terminology**

Tutorial hell

* ""**a state of perpetual learning, often marked by the consumption of one tutorial after another without putting acquired knowledge into practice**""

* **TLDR**, you keep on switching applications, or attempting to perfect the application you use without actually studying

* Examples:

   * Using OneNote, not actually studying the notes but spending hours organizing them

   * Using flashcards, spending hours making and refining your flashcards without actually studying them.

# MY METHODOLOGY

When looking for a ""study tool"", I personally believe the **best applications** are those which:

* Give the user the ability to retrieve any information they want from any previous week.

* Automate much of the work the user needs to do.

  
Going to my example regarding Astronomy, the reason why I did not need to study that much is due to how all my notes were already prepared. If I was confused about something, I could find it in my notes and read it over quickly. I also found it fun to make my notes, cathartic to see everything organized.

Through automation and streamlining the studying process, we seek to avoid **tutorial hell.**

 

**Example**:

I once saw a person in my study group spend 5 hours creating flashcards.

Their process was:

Get their notes -> find what is important -> put it into flashcards.

While they were doing this, I was taking those 5 hours to get into the most complex lectures.

I remember I got 96% on the midterm, and while I did not ask what mark they got, they told me that they planned on CR/NCR the class (probably not that good).

 

# Apps to use

***OneNote***

It works. If you are using it, and its good, stick with it.

However, I found that it did not automate things enough for me. I found myself rewriting my notes the week before the midterm. Moreover, I found myself re-watching lectures, we want to prevent this as much as we can.

So it works, but its not the best.

***Conclusion***: 

I did not have fun using OneNote, and I also found it hard for idea retrieval. 

  
***Notion***

I hate this app, tutorial hell in full display. If you use it and it works, great, continue using it.

But this is the app which I see people in my study group spend hours on just customizing it. I have seen countless first years use this app, thinking it is some magic solution

Moreover, it really does not help with knowledge retrieval and even worse, the app is really unoptimized.

***Conclusion***: 

When I used Notion, I found it fun at first, but then got frustrated as I could not incorporate automation in the way I hoped. Also, I found many aspects of it redundant and only there for aesthetics. 

  
***Remnote***

Better then Notion, used it for a year, don't know how it is now, cant really say anything on it :/

***Conclusion***: 

Cant say, I liked it when I used it, but I could not automate that much. Also I did not enjoy the UI. 

  
***Obsidian***

What I currently use, easy knowledge retrieval, canvas mode might be the best thing since sliced bread.

I’m a visual learner so the fact that I can literally see the connections between ideas is insanely useful. Ever since I started using it UofT has become easy. Not only that, but it is incredibly fun to use. I hated writing essays, now I find it fun (I’m not a masochist)

A canvas of one of my history essays.

Another extremely useful aspect of Obsidian is the linking system, where you can link notes together to make connections. This creates another visual mind map which greatly assists in studying. 

* This was the main reason why i was able to go into my astronomy midterm without studying, i found that all the connections were there already, all i had to do was clarify on those which confused me. 

Just like the other apps, there is one major obstacle

To make your perfect setup is time consuming.

* Your setup is called a ""vault"", the customizations you can do are insane.
   * You can make a table which pulls all files with the words ""Physics"" in it.
   * You can put certain tags on files so that if they have important terms, they appear a different color. The possibilities are endless.

   * BUT, you need to code these tables.

      * Thankfully, ChatGPT helps a lot with this, I have no idea how to code, but ChatGPT did it all for me perfectly :).
* You may get stuck in tutorial hell, hence i would recommend setting this up during reading week, when you have time to perfect your studying habits. 

If you are to start using obsidian, and you would like assistance, shoot me a DM.

***Conclusion***: 

I find this app to be both fun and something which automates my studying process. 

However, setting it up took some time. 



***Flashcards*** **(Anki)**

To succeed with flashcards, you need to use them consistently, you cannot make flashcards a day before class and expect a 4.0

Also, flashcards mainly cover surface level ideas, without providing connections and information. 

So, while they are useful, they are rarely used correctly by first years. 

***Conclusion***: 

Nothing really bad about it, not really a note taking device. Just something you can use to assist in memorization. 

# Final Thoughts 

My ratings are

1. Obsidian 
2. OneNote
3. Anki
4. Notion

N/A - Remnote (Don't know how it is in its current state)

This should provide a general overview of my idea of how to study. 

If you have any disagreements, please feel free to comment, i am open to learning the benefits of certain applications. 

If you have any thoughts, also please comment!

After reading some post here i realise that there are some people who have good advice mechanism and vice versa. 
Three days ago. A friend of mine sat with me with sad face and asking me about advice. He is a teacher and he says he is witnessing a crime. The crime is that the principal and some low grade staff (Guards and office boy) are involve in harassing some female student and even having sex with them (With consent). This happens everytime when Allama Iqbal open university papers are held. The principal calls the female student to help them in paper by ensuring 100% good marks and ask them for sexual favour. Although the victim don't do anything but agrees to it. I find it totally useless to report this crime as no victim will like this. But this needs to be stop. So we have discussed many approach to stop this but there are some flaws. The principal is has a strong support in Politics as well as in government departments as his brother is higher grade officer. Which makes things so harder. 
Any advice will help. As for now. I told him to remain silent as your hands might get burn in this fire. 
Thanks."
1gc3mrm,48,2024-10-25,I am heavily dependent on ChatGPT for work and studies,u/unsuspiciousprofile,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1gc3mrm/i_am_heavily_dependent_on_chatgpt_for_work_and/,"I'm wondering how much of a problem this really is.

I was a struggling student during my 1st year when ChatGPT came out, and it absolutely saved my exams. I was able to summarise huge amounts of information in a short time frame and get back on track.

Ever since, ChatGPT stuck around as a tool I do 50% of my work with. Obviously, some good stuff has come out of it - I can work ""above my weight limit"" because I'm able to immediately access multiple points of view from chatGPT at an instant. It's really like suddenly becoming much smarter.

But, at the same time, it worries me just how much of a disaster a ChatGPT outage would have been for me. I am doing an extensive project right now which needs wayy too many skills I don't really have, and the only way really to fill these gaps given how it's also time-sensitive is chatGPT. My notes at university are all o1-preview generated, after all it will most definitely know about my lecture's subject more and so it can focus on the important stuff better than me. But it struck me that actually never in my lifetime will I ever learn to make proper notes completely on my own. I wonder if I am fucking my education up because I'm making it easy for myself, if whether I'm improving it because I can focus on the bigger picture while leaving out the tedious details?"

",u/CalendarVarious3992,aipromptprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/aipromptprogramming/comments/1gcahg3/build_comprehensive_courses_and_learning/,"Here’s a neat prompt chain for being able to generate a course for any subject. Great for self-teaching any subject or getting a high-level view of what it might look to learn a specific subject.

**Prompt Chain**

`Define the course parameters: SUBJECT=[subject name], AUDIENCE=[target audience], DURATION=[course length in weeks]~Create a course outline with main modules, each focusing on a key aspect of the subject~For each module, list 3-5 specific learning objectives that align with the overall course goals~Develop a detailed syllabus including module titles, topics covered, estimated time for completion, and required materials~Create an introduction module that explains the course structure, expectations, and provides an overview of the subject~For Module 1, design a lesson plan with lecture content, practical exercises, and multimedia resources~Develop assessment methods for Module 1, including quizzes, assignments, or projects that test the module's learning objectives~Repeat the lesson plan and assessment development process for the next half of the modules~Create interactive elements for each module, such as discussion prompts, group activities, or hands-on projects~Design a mid-course project or assignment that integrates concepts from the first half of the course~Develop lesson plans and assessments for the remaining modules, incorporating more advanced concepts and building on earlier modules~Create a final project or exam that comprehensively assesses the entire course content~Develop a resource list including textbooks, online materials, and supplementary reading for each module~Create a glossary of key terms and concepts covered throughout the course~Design a feedback mechanism for students to evaluate the course and suggest improvements~Develop a guide for instructors, including teaching tips, common student challenges, and suggested solutions~Create a course completion certificate template and criteria for earning the certificate`

Make sure you update the variable in the first prompt, SUBJECT, AUDIENCE, and DURATION and then you can pass this prompt chain into [ChatGPT Queue](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chatgpt-queue-save-time-w/iabnajjakkfbclflgaghociafnjclbem?hl=en&authuser=0&utm_source=reddit) extension and it will just run autonomously.

I got new insurance that comes with great perks regarding therapy and I want to take advantage of it. I have a few slightly different things that I want to work out regarding my mental health. I've tried talk therapy before and while I believe there is a lot of value in it, I'm already have people in my life that I open up to deeply like friends and family. I also use chatGPT as a journal and sounding board and learn a ton human psychology through that (don't knock it till you try it). I'm looking for something more anecdotal and actionable:

Focus: I have a lot of trouble staying focused at work. It's a mix of bad habits and not architecting my environment well but even when I have no distractions at all, I can't go 5 minutes without having intrusive thoughts about other parts of live. I want to know if I just need behavioral therapy or if there is something more chemical at play. I was always addicted to video games and other high dopamine activites as a kid but was also a great student.

Relationship Anxiety: I'm dating an awesome girl but I stress so much about whether it's the right fit or whether I'm never going to be fully committed and excited. I stress a ton about hurting her if things don't work out (not that uncommon I know). A previous therapist diagnosed me with relationship OCD. Another thing to not - I constantly think about my ex-girlfriends (like on average a few times an hour) even though I haven't seen or talked to them in years and both breakups largely mutual and <1 year long. I'm also off social media. I struggle a ton with comparing which isn't healthy I know. I think this is a theme in lots of areas in my life where if something really important doesn't feel ""perfect"" then its hard for me to make a big decision.

Unable to accept things that I can't change: I had a horrible, horrible internal struggle with hair loss. I think even to this day a lot of people wouldn't even notice it and yet there hasn't been a day in the last 6 years that I haven't thought about it. And for years I couldn't even go an hour without thinking about it. I've tried all sorts of drugs and it just frustrates me because its something I can't fix. It's just hard to accept things I can't fix.

Other random things about me: Great childhood, great friends, supportive family, great job, high IQ (not like genius but national merit / perfect SAT math vibes), logical thinker most of the time, don't always understand my emotions, VERY active internal dialogue I can't shut my brain off

1gcev6i,3,2024-10-26,Anne Arundel County Schools: AI DETECTORS IN ACADEMIA:  Like buying a self driving car that advertises a 1% crash rate but then it turns out the rate is 10-46% and even greater depending on the road you drive on. Would you still drive it?,u/ElectronicStar7783,Annapolis,https://www.reddit.com/r/Annapolis/comments/1gcev6i/anne_arundel_county_schools_ai_detectors_in/,"Anne Arundel County Schools is one of the latest stories about an institution getting media attention for not having an AI Policy and for using unreliable AI Detection.

[https://youtu.be/KddlTs2CLpM?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/KddlTs2CLpM?feature=shared)

There is a reason why AI Detectors have statements in their terms of service that state that their detectors should not be used to punish students. They realize the false positives are too high and the harm it causes is too great. GPTZERO is making huge moves to get out of the AI detection game and into a product that has screen recording and track changes and tech geared toward proving the work is human by process proofs. 

What would you do if your child was falsely accused of AI use? I have attached links at the bottom that you can forward to your district or institution to share with them that AI Detectors and assumptions is not the best path forward. 

**AI DETECTORS ARE NOT RELIABLE**: Numerous studies have shown that AI Detectors are highly inaccurate. One of the studies from University of Maryland, ""demonstrated empirically that detectors for AI-generated text are not reliable in practical scenarios and that they perform only marginally better than a random classifier.""

**AI DETECTORS ARE BIASED:** Studies have shown that neurodivergent and those whose second language is English have very high rates of false accusations at the hands of a machine. A few days ago a story came out about a neurodivergent student being falsely accused: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-10-18/do-ai-detectors-work-students-face-false-cheating-accusations?utm\_campaign=news&utm\_medium=bd&utm\_source=applenews](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-10-18/do-ai-detectors-work-students-face-false-cheating-accusations?utm_campaign=news&utm_medium=bd&utm_source=applenews)

**AI DETECTORS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PRIVACY:** AI detectors have terms of use that include the following: When using their product you must be the owner of the work or have permission of the owner to submit. Many detectors state flat out that once works are submitted that they acquire the ownership of that document without any compensation to the owner. The detectors can use these works to train their systems and they financially benefit. As FOX Baltimore pointed out, FERPA rights may be violated when teachers/instructors use these products without consent. Would the submission without consent also violate intellectual property rights? 

**DO THE USE OF AI DETECTORS VIOLATE DUE PROCESS?** In Texas, a teachers union won their case against a school district because the district was using black box technology/algorithms (AI Detectors are black box tech) to evaluate them. The judge stated the district can't not have a policy that includes the use of black box technology because it violated due process rights. 

**NO POLICIES ON AI, or AI DETECTION USE:** While many institutions across the country have caught on and have barred the use of AI detectors because they were seeing too many false allegations and they recognized that not only does it open them up to lawsuits, but it is also unethical to allow a machine to make the judgement call on high stakes decisions. If a district or institution does not have an AI policy or if the do not have an AI detector policy that includes that detector policy on the syllabus; that brings ethical and legal questions into the forefront. Is it ethical to use AI Detectors and not tell students that they are being used and they student only finds out when they are accused? Or is it entrapment?

**TEACHER CAN NOT ACCURATELY DETECT AI TEXT** Numerous studies reveal that even the most seasoned teachers can't not identify the difference between AI and student generated texts with high accuracy. For example the study, "" Do teacher spot AI? Evaluating the detectability of AI-generated texts among student essays"" revealed that ""Experienced teachers only accurately identified 37.8% of AI texts"" They stated that, even when they felt confident they often times missed the mark and their judgements were incorrect. 

**ACADEMIC INTEGRITY IS IMPORTANT, BUT ARE USING TOOLS SO FLAWED AN ACT OF INTEGRITY?** AI detectors have been scientifically proven to be unreliable, AI detectors are biased against neurodivergent and second language learners, Teachers and AI detectors can't accurately decipher between AI and student work and false accusation cause irreversible harm to students. So, why are some institutions and districts still allowing their staff to use these black box algorithms? This is a tough time in academia wherein teachers are in just as tough as a spot as the students. 

**WHAT ABOUT THOSE FALSE ACCUSATIONS?** Students can do very little to defend themselves against a machine and an educator who is confident they can tell the difference between AI and students work. Imagine your child is falsely accused of AI use? What would you do? The choices are slim; go to the media, spend thousands of dollars to assist your child in their defense, you may sue the institution or district for defamation with punitive damages or perhaps for discrimination, or tortious interference of future economic gain seek $5,000,000 if your child is part of the population which detectors are biased against, you may feel helpless and watch your child's academic career be destroyed all because of new technologies came forth before academia was prepared for it. The most significant impacts of being falsely accused is the mental health toll it takes on the students and the destruction of trust between students and their teachers.

“The use of AI text detection tools could inadvertently penalize students for adhering to standard, formal writing styles, which AI models are trained on and could be mistaken for AI-generated content.

A major concern with current AI detectors is their tendency to falsely accuse humans of using AI. These false positives regularly flag content written legitimately by people as AI-generated. With no recourse to overturn incorrect judgments, this results in unfair punishment for the falsely accused. With no concrete proof, either way, you, especially students, have no options when falsely accused of AI use. Presuming guilt from error-prone detectors enables unsubstantiated allegations and unjust penalties.

French: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFrance/comments/1gc4e8a/profil_atypique_faible_gpa_mais_projets_tech/

**TL;DR:**
Low GPA, but good scores in 10th and likely 12th. Preparing for SAT, and already have 700+ in Math. Running a freelance design agency, have worked on AI/SaaS projects, and teaching AI for free. Looking for affordable universities with scholarships in the US, EU (France, Germany, Netherlands, Hungary), UK, or Ireland. Taking a gap year to fix inconsistencies and improve my profile.

---

Hey everyone, I’m currently planning my next steps and looking for advice on which universities I should consider, based on my profile:

### Profile Overview:
- **Academics**: My school GPA is low due to poor performance in 9th and 11th grades, but I scored 90% in 10th grade and hope to do well in my 12th grade. I’ve been preparing for JEE (one of the world's toughest exams), but I found it's not my path. However, it made me academically stronger. I recently took a practice SAT (just for fun) and got 1300+, with over 700 in Math. If I reviewed some formulas, I’m confident I could hit 760+.

### Extracurriculars (ECs):
- **Freelance Design Agency**: Served 150+ customers, with an average order value of $20.
- **Website Projects**: Built websites for small & local businesses (only 2 so far, but it’s a start! 😂).
- **AI & SaaS Projects**: I’ve been closely following AI developments on Twitter for 2 years (since ChatGPT came out). I’m active in the **Teenage accelerationism (t/acc) Community**, where we work on SaaS/AI projects, network, and help each other grow. I also build AI clones for automating videos and have worked on projects like **Agentic Workflow** with CrewAI.
- **Teaching AI**: I’ve been teaching AI and programming to kids my age and younger for free.
- **Certificates**: I have some random SQL, HTML, CSS certs from apps, along with Harvard's CS50p. Currently working on Andrew Ng's **Math for Machine Learning & Data Science** specialization.

### Interests:
I’m passionate about **Cybersecurity**, **Computer Science**, **AI**, **Data Science**, and **Economics**.

### Financial Situation:
I can’t afford college without scholarships or huge loans. Banks probably won’t grant loans because my parents don’t earn much, and our currency has a bad exchange rate (94:1 USD). Here, earning $20K/year is considered affluent.

### Looking for:
- **University Recommendations**: I’m open to universities in the **Germany**, **France**, **Netherlands**, **Hungary**, **UK**, **Ireland**, or anywhere in the **EU**. where high acceptance rate with low cost (living cost will manage through Part Time)
- **Financial Aid/Scholarships**: Are there schools that offer need-based aid or low tuition fees for non-EU students? I can afford up to $2K/year max.
- **Extracurricular Suggestions**: What else can I do during my gap year to strengthen my profile? Do **ECTS credit courses** boost my chances?

Any advice, suggestions, or recommendations would be much appreciated! Thanks in advance 🙏."

I am a master's student who just started to learn AI. I started from scratch like learning what a neuron is, Building neural networks from scratch - even though we can use Tensorflow/ Pytorch, and Watching tons of YouTube videos to understand the math.

lol, I have gone into such madness that I can compute the gradient for a 100-layered network as well. Keeping this aside I am much interested in computer vision. So I had to choose a project and started exploring problems that I see in my day-to-day life.

No matter any corner I choose my idea it is already implemented. I really got frustrated. I observed there is not much to research and explore in regular deep learning. I see only the next leap is emotional AI and power reinforcement learning that mimics humans.

lmao if Elon Musk or Nvidia does it. But the real problem is I am just a student and starting my learning with the basics and don't find an idea to do the project. even if I get it's too complex or I don't know how to build it.

My LinkedIn gets filled up with posts like XYZ company launched an LLM better than ChatGPT. i see AI-wars through LinkedIn and on one side I see folks not finding jobs at all even with good skills and projects. day by day I learn, new applications get released, leaving me miserable.

It feels like I am in a desert and see some water pond. But if I go near it there is nothing but now I see a river at some distance and then finally a see. lol I feel like never get my water

I want the internet to speak. are you folks also in this confusion and stuck? how the fuck are all those people building applications and know every single thing from scratch and how do we create applications. On the other hand lots of research in AI. 100's of papers every single day.

The best suggestion I know I would get is to continue learning. But bro I don't have the fuki\*g time that's the problem. every recruiter I see what they are looking for people in AI teams. The ability to solve problems and create AI applications.

I sincerely request if you are an AI engineer and have gone through all of this. please share with us a path or a direction to go to. Thanks!!"

1gcjvnl,25,2024-10-26,"Why use Emacs nowadays, and for my use cases?",u/arni_ca,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1gcjvnl/why_use_emacs_nowadays_and_for_my_use_cases/,"hello people! dabbled into the world of UNIX text editors recently. (only now even though its been months since i've been on Linux, but better late than never haha)

seeing what Emacs is theoretically capable of doing, i was interested in using it, and especially over vim given its extensibility.

some potentially useful context is that i'm a student and am looking for a tool that would make computer use easier and/or faster as you get the hang of it. i also might seriously start learning programming soon, so i thought picking up a UNIX text editor before then would be a good idea, so i'd be more efficient doing this. i did put learning programming on hold though because training on freeCodeCamp just makes my left pinky hurt with the Shift key :(. i'm a huge beginner to text editors in general but i don't really mind difficulty curves, i mainly care about what i can get in return

would Emacs be a good fit for those needs and use cases? and, how would that be achieved if it is? :

* **note-taking (for studies, for personal use, learning, etc...)**
   * ^(a note on this, i've been looking into the pros and cons of handwritten writing. in the case i use org-mode and the like, has anyone written their notes and studies in Emacs and on PC in general and have found it useful to do so, compared to hand-written notes? also, can org-mode or an Emacs module for note-taking integrate pictures? i was thinking i could scan handwritten notes and then put them in a note-taking app so its easier to find and organize them, yet i still leverage the ""strength"" of hand-writing)
* **an app for the least amount of distractions and stimuli possible**
   * ^(kind of joins the note-taking point, but this is moreso in general, especially as people half-jokingly call Emacs an OS. i notice i'm a lot more productive when an app's UI is minimal to non-existent, and having used a bit of Doom Emacs over the past few days i noticed i focused a lot more on the notes themselves than how they're presented)
* **an app to do ""everything"" in**
   * ^(i'm guessing emacs is a perfect fit for that, but i'm just wondering if that is hard to set up at all, or if it is more interesting to use a specialized app for each use case (use Vesktop instead of using the discord module/workaround for Emacs, for example))
   * ^(i learned people do their FINANCES through Emacs and that sounded insane in the best way possible so i'm really intrigued now)
* **an app to love the terminal more**
   * ^(im guessing its also a yes, and i could guess the ""how"" to this is mainly regarding the integration of shells in emacs ?)

i also had some other questions that are more or less related : 

1. what is the point behind using Emacs / org-mode, compared to hand-writing notes, especially in the context of academia? 
   1. ^(i'm aware each tool should fit the user and not the opposite, but i'm curious as to the experiences of people who used it for studies and found it worked for them)
2. is the use of Emacs ergonomic?
   1. ^(in the sense that my fingers wouldn't hurt after a while. this might sound like an odd question but i did hear about having an ""Emacs pinky"", and since my left pinky does hurt a bit if its too involved, i didn't want to take this to the extreme. maybe stuff like Evil mode helps?)
3. how should one learn Emacs, given my use cases?
   1. ^(i tried using Doom Emacs recently, and while I've been having a bunch of fun i feel like i haven't really understood the tool much, or what i'm supposed to do compared to other text editors like nano, especially since it's an ""opinionated"" config of Emacs. so i felt it might be better to just get vanilla Emacs, and maybe Evil mode if the keybinds are a lot more comfy to me. then as i get more comfortable using vanillamacs, add more and more modules as i) *^(need)*

and i think this is all for me! i hope this is correctly worded and formatted, feel free to ask me to edit and precise things if not! cheers everyone"

If you find a video in another language, you can have it transcribed to text by using Turboscribe: [https://turboscribe.ai/dashboard](https://turboscribe.ai/dashboard)

Turboscribe allows you 3 free transcriptions a day.  You simply provide the URL and in a few minutes you have a beautiful time stamped transcription.

Next, copy/paste the text into chatgpt. So far, Chatgpt has been very accurate in translations.  Turboscribe has a translation option, but it's not as good as goint to chatgpt directly.

With chatgpt you can interact and ask questions if you don't want to follow the time stamp.  Not sure if it helps but I tell chatgpt it's a martial arts/tai chi video transcript for context.

Enjoy the new world opened up to you!  I'm very grateful for this technology.  If you recall the Feng video I posted a short time ago, it was pricelesss to watch him teach a student, but the translation opened another dimension to it.

i have read and read uni’s AI policy and i 100% abide by it. i don’t use ChatGPT as its generally unreliable but i do use Grammarly to touch up on grammar (i ignore their clarity suggestions and don’t use their genAI function) and i use Elicit AI to search for papers (this has been specifically recommended and permitted by our uni).

anyway, i write all my essays myself and never copy and paste anything. however, after some students have been caught using AI on our course which lead to academic misconduct, i have been running my essays passed online AI detectors. whilst most of it deemed my essay as human content (which it should be as it was), some have highlighted certain parts of my essay as AI-generated when it is my own words and work. this is particularly when there is a part that involve a lot of research references.

this generates a lot of paranoia and emotional turmoil that my work can be incorrectly taken as AI by AI detectors and i could be falsely accused of academic misconduct. it means im constantly rewording my work before submission but even then AI detectors still highlight parts of my work as AI generated. 

i have recently took 2 years out of uni and AI have bursted onto the scene during this time so i never dealt with this problem before. i know i should have nothing to worry about as i used AI responsibly as per my uni’s guidance but it is worrisome that maybe my writing style is triggering AI detectors to detect it as AI and the vague accuracy of these detectors can put my academic integrity into jeopardy.

this is causing significant worries before submission and waiting for the coursework to be marked. 

i have started using google docs to write my essays so i have the whole version history to back me up should i be called up to the meeting regarding any academic misconduct concerns. i think our uni use a VIVA style interview with the module leader to assess learning outcomes if there’s suspect use of genAI but it is so stressful even just thinking they may be a chance that i will need to defend myself.

does anyone else feel the same about these new AI detection function on Turnitin that uni uses and it is just causing a whole lot of unnecessary stress?"

# What is an AI Content Detector

Because generative AI like OpenAI’s ChatGPT became so popularized for use in professional and academic settings, AI detector tools were developed and integrated into the each institution. These AI detection models are able to spot the watermarks that come with large language models.

# How Does AI Detection Work?

AI writing from ChatGPT utilizes machine learning that makes its writing low in perplexity and simple and precise in word choice, sentence structure, and sentence length. Meanwhile, human writing features plenty of randomness and complexity in word choice, sentence structure, and sentence length. AI content detection just looks for this simple, precise features and identifies it at AI-written content, often mistakenly flagging human-writing that is just simple and precise too as false positives.

The most popular examples of AI detectors are Turnitin, [Originality.AI](http://Originality.AI), GPTZero and more. And these all still generate false positives, with a 4% rate on the sentence level by Turnitin.

Once you understand AI Detection and how AI writing tools work, you can understand [how to bypass AI Detection](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/bypassing-ai-detectors-stealthgpt).

# What is AI Detect: The Free AI Checker?

If Ai Detection is going to be an inherently flawed process, you might as well not be paying an arm and a leg for it which is what more prominent AI Writing Detectors expect from their subscribers and our educators. To solve this problem and offer AI detection that neither shames AI writing tools, nor abandons academic integrity, AI Detect offers a service open to everyone.

Students, content creators, educators, professionals, you should all use AI detect whether you want to check if your humanized essay will be detected, or if you want to check a student’s work for AI plagiarism.

# How Accurate Is AI Detect in Identifying AI-Generated Text?

There’s only one way to find out if an AI detector works, by testing it against various content creation tools. The first LLM we’re going to test is the original generative artificial intelligence, ChatGPT:

This is our ChatGPT essay about the best actors of all time. Now, lets run that through AI Detect to see how human this essay really is:

At 1% human, AI Detect knew right away that this was AI-generated content. Now lets compare AI Detect to Stealthwriter’s detector and to ChatGPT’s detectability.

First, here is what our ChatGPT essay looks after it was humanized by Stealthwriter.

The less words that pass through an AI detector, the more unreliable the result, however the words allowed by the stealthwriter’s free trial were enough to seal its fate.

With a 44% human score, AI Detect successfully flagged Stealthwriter at its most undetectable setting. AI Detect is much more than a ChatGPT detector, whether you’re using GPT-3, GPT-4 or undetectable AI, AI Detect has your number dialed in.

# Ethics of AI Detect

As the ethics behind academic integrity and academic misconduct are beginning to shift in lew of AI technology, AI Detect is here to embrace both users of AI content checkers and users of generative AI.

AI Detect is for everyone. It is not the essay police like Turnitin. With AI Detect’s ethics integral to its mission, content creators can feel comfortable supporting a technology that doesn’t jeopardize their process.

[Using AI isn’t exactly plagiarism](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/is-using-chatgpt-plagiarism-academic-dishonesty-in-dishonest-academia) in the first place. Because they generate original content, generative AI doesn’t usually get flagged by old school plagiarismcheckers. That’s why academic institutions have coined the use of AI writing tools in school work as “AI plagiarism”.

This is why if you’d like to use AI writing, you need undetectable AI tools to make your AI-generated text feel like human-written content.

# Conclusion

If you need a powerful AI engine to check your content for detectability, AI Detect is the Free AI Checker that will change your process forever. Whether you’re generating undetectable AI and need to see if it’ll really bypass detectors, or if you’re just reviewing work handed in to you, AI Detect is the most user-friendly, best-value, most effective tool to find AI writing in any piece of text.

# FAQ

# Who uses AI Detectors?

Everyone from students and professionals, anyone that deals with text-based content has a use for an AI detector. Whether it’s a blog moderator or a teacher, these positions deal with so much content that to ensure the content’s integrity, they need to implemenet AI detection software. AI Detection is utilized in content creation for social media and blogs, for SEO to ensure the best content climbs to the top ranks of search engines, and more.

# Do AI Detectors Work?

Although their process is flawed enough for [MIT to declare AI Detectors don’t work](https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/teach/ai-detectors-dont-work/), they’re the best technology people have to ensure academic integrity isn’t completely leveled. As a whole though, they’re an imperfect tool because they don’t even claim to be the final word on a document’s origin. Software like Turnitin that has a 4% false positive rate at the sentence level, only claims to point reviewers in the right direction, whether a document is AI-generated or not.

# How is AI Changing Academia?

Beyond integrating AI detectors into the submission process and a reported [86% of students using AI for schoolwork](https://campustechnology.com/articles/2024/08/28/survey-86-of-students-already-use-ai-in-their-studies.aspx), academia has implemented AI at nearly every level of the institution. From content generation to targeted enrollment, we’ve only seen the beginning of AI-driven change."

We decided to make our AI spreadsheet, Sourcetable, available for students for free. We noticed a lot of students using it to pair with AI for doing their coursework, so we decided to encourage more of this behavior. The main reason is that it's fun and we can learn a lot when people push the boundaries of AI outside of the business use cases we had originally intended.  
  
We use many LLM models but for the free tier the core of the system is powered by OpenAI models. Some Anthropic & Llama (via Groq) as well.

1gd0r0i,232,2024-10-26,The worst part of AI is the increase in students’ willingness to lie,u/MaquinaDeBuhos,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1gd0r0i/the_worst_part_of_ai_is_the_increase_in_students/,"I love teaching, and I love working with students who care enough to try to engage with the material. AI has not changed my feelings towards teaching. However, it has increased instances of cheating, and it has changed student behaviors *around* cheating in a way that I resent because it gets in the way of actually *helping* the student.

I have been doing this job for a long time. I know what student writing sounds like, and I can also immediately recognize the word salad that results from plugging an assignment prompt directly into ChatGPT.

I have long since stopped trying to *prove* that something is AI and will just give the paper the bad grade that it deserves, but occasionally I used to tell a student “hey, whether or not this is AI, it *sounds* like AI for a, b, and c reason that you should fix.” (My philosophy in my class is that papers that could be mistaken for AI earn bad grades because they are *bad writing*.) From here I would have loved for the students to recognize that they were caught and that I was both *giving them a break* and explaining why their getting caught was inevitable— but the few times I did this they always always always adopted a defensive posture and started lying unconvincingly in a prose style entirely different from the paper they turned in. It’s just exhausting and insulting, and I’m tired of the feigned shock and confusion. I miss old school plagiarism because students would usually fess up and we could move on to the problem-solving stage. 

The behavior seems very high school to me. I’m trying to have a conversation with an adult, and they’re still acting like a teenager who reeks of schnapps trying to convince his parents that he didn’t get into their liquor cabinet, totally focused on *avoiding punishment* rather than listening to what I’m trying to tell them.

I also tried ChatGPT but it's not really secure and it has no idea about my students' needs and how they evolve over time.

Does anyone here have advice on tools that have been helpful for them?

One of my colleagues suggested I try [Journify Learning](https://www.journify-learning.com/) and I booked a demo with them on their website. From what I'm getting, they generate personalized goals / objectives / assessments / worksheets give each student's present levels of performance, which are tracked among all the support providers working with the same student, in real time. So far, it seemed like the only tool that does what I'd expect an AI tool to offer support with, but I need to first do the demo and see what it works like (can update folks here on the experience)."
1gd2ita,1,2024-10-26,Came out to ChatGPT,u/elix125,bisexual,https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/1gd2ita/came_out_to_chatgpt/,"I don’t really know why I’m sharing this, maybe I hope it will resonate with someone or someone has gone through something similar and can give advice. But it feels nice to share.

My earliest crush was a girl in kindergarten. I remember telling her that we should get married. I think I still liked her even after, but we went to a small K-12 Catholic school where same sex attraction didn’t seem to exist. I liked a boy in elementary, and figured that was it. In middle school, one of my only friends got bullied by students and teachers since she came out as bisexual. I tried to stand by her, but my parents had always shielded me from anything remotely gay and I had no idea what to think. I started to wonder if I was bisexual too, once I discovered Tumblr shipping culture (lol). 

I left that school after middle school because I started to be bullied by teachers for different reasons. I went to public high school and basically got a huge crush on the first girl I made friends with. We fell apart though, and I thought I liked a new girl I was starting to be friends with. She somehow guessed I was bisexual, and I panicked. We stopped being friends after that. 

By this point, a few years had passed since I first started thinking I was bisexual. I was deeply ashamed, and only told some online friends about it. I eventually told my sister, who was pretty open minded. It stayed like that for a while, and I finally got so anxious about something that I ended up telling my dad. He gave the “it’s just a phase because the media makes it look cool” talk. H e was nice about it, but it still felt a little saddening. I basically decided then to be straight. That was 6 years ago. But since then, I’ve had the occasional “crush” on a girl. I don’t know if it’s admiration, friendship, or more. Maybe it was always friendship I felt. I never talked about it with anyone since then as I figured none of my friends would feel comfortable with it. One of my social circles includes a gay guy, but I feel like it’s different for girls to accept a gay guy than a gay girl. I didn’t want to make anyone feel like I was preying on them. But recently, a different friend told me she was curious about women. I was completely shocked. It took a few weeks for me to finally tell her that I was maybe bisexual. And even though she took it very well, I feel so gross and anxious. I guess it reached the point where I just wanted someone to comfort me, and I told ChatGPT. The answer was so nice, but I felt so hollow and alone after reading it. I wish someone would tell me those things in real life. I wish no one would even view me slightly differently if I told them. I don’t want their perception to change at all.

Currently finishing up my first 5 exams. I didn't have a tutor. DM me if you have more questions. Hopefully this isn't too long lol

\*series = anytime during the year that exams are held. May/Jun, Oct/Nov and Feb/Mar (India Only)

  
1) There are no mandatory subjects. Typical number is 7 but you can do less or more (I'm doing 5 this series)

2) You will need to find a centre to sit your exams. You will have to pay. And they ain't cheap. 

3) You already said this but download and print off your syllabuses. Tick off what you already know and are confident with. The exam board can only ask your questions related to the content in those documents.

4) (IN THE UK ONLY) You need to decide if you want to do GCSEs or iGCSEs. I stands for international, typically sat by students outside the UK. iGCSEs are considered harder and they are more expensive to sit. GCSEs are what UK 15/16 years olds will do.

5) You then need to decide on an exam board. Look the the syllabuses, the paper formats and find a centre for that exam board near you. I was stuck with either CIE or Edexcel for my exams but I went with CIE becasue I struggled too much with the Edexcel maths papers. fyi, you can pick different exam boards but it's unlikely that you will be able to do this in the same series. Decide off those factors. DM me if you'd like the list of centres that I've found. 

6) You can 100% homeschool iGCSEs and GCSEs. I'm doing mine without tutors. Find teachers on YouTube that you like for your exam board. Have websites you go to for notes for each subjects. Get some second hand text books (pretty cheap, £4 or less per book.

1. Print off your syllabuses, preferably in checklist form. Tick off what you know. The thing with the syllabus is that the exam papers can only ask you about content on those syllabuses.
2. Find YouTube teachers you like for each of your subjects. These will be your main teachers.
3. Gather up as many resources/websites as you can. Quiz websites, flash cards, websites with notes, pdfs of books, ect.
4. GET YOUR ENTRY TO SIT THE EXAMS IN EARLY. DON'T PROCRASTINATE.
5. For me I find it's best that I don't stick to a fixed study schedule. I'll just pick whichever subject I feel like doing on that day and do it until I'm bored. That might be 20 mins or in might be 2 hours.
6. Have a space for studying that is only used for studying. Have a desk. Keep it 'tidy' with only school materials. How tidy is just personal preference.
7. Read through this website: [https://he-exams.fandom.com/wiki/IGCSEs](https://he-exams.fandom.com/wiki/IGCSEs)
8. Motivate yourself if you're teaching yourself. It's hard but I had to learn at a pretty young age. 'Ban' yourself from your phone until you've at least tried to study. Switch it off. Don't use Instagram/Discord, ect on your tablet/computer. Only associate it with study.
9. Past papers are your best friend. Do as many as possible.
10. Watch videos for fun. Documentaries are great for geo and bio. Goof around a bit a watch Marc Rober or CrashCourse for physics.
11. For sciences, watch as many people doing practicals on YouTube as possible, even if they aren't in the syllabus. You need to be prepared for semi-random ones.
12. Don't rely on ChatGPT to mark your English. It will give you great feedback but the mark will be very inaccurate even if you give it the mark scheme.

I have tried so many study tips but they're too risky. When I try to do one new technique and study for the test, turned out my scores are low. I rarely get full marks. 

And the problem is as I am the online student, I sometimes cheat from chatgpt and google for answers just because I want to show off others that I get full marks. But I feel really guilty but I want the privilege. 

How should I become the real smart student everyone? I'm currently 11th grade and in my country, grade 11 and 12 are the most important grades that'll decide our university. And I want to go to the medical school.

The landscape of information retrieval is undergoing a fundamental transformation. Traditional keyword-based search engines, while fast, increasingly struggle with rapidly changing information, context understanding, and result synthesis. Recent studies show that up to 40% of search engine results for trending topics can be outdated within hours. While AI-powered solutions like ChatGPT and Perplexity have made notable advances, with Perplexity reaching over 10 million monthly active users in 2024, the technology continues to evolve rapidly.

**The Current State of AI Search**

The past year has seen unprecedented adoption of AI-powered search platforms. This shift is driven by their ability to understand context, analyze information across multiple sources, and provide synthesized answers rather than just lists of links. According to recent usage data, users spend 60% less time finding relevant information using AI search compared to traditional search engines.

However, most current AI search solutions rely heavily on cached information and pre-indexed content. While this enables response times under 2 seconds, it creates significant accuracy issues. For instance, during major events like product launches or breaking news, cached results can be hours behind real-time developments. Similarly, for price comparisons or availability checks, pre-indexed content can lead to frustrating user experiences with outdated information.

**A New Approach to AI Search**

[JENOVA](https://www.jenova.ai) has emerged as a notable player in this space with its distinctive approach to web search. Unlike ChatGPT and Perplexity which primarily rely on cached information, JENOVA performs [real-time web scraping](https://www.jenova.ai/web-search) for every query. Independent testing shows this approach typically adds 3-5 seconds to response times but delivers up to 95% more current information compared to cached solutions. User feedback consistently indicates this trade-off is worthwhile, particularly for time-sensitive queries where accuracy is crucial.

**JENOVA's Technical Architecture**

The [technical architecture](https://www.jenova.ai/jenova-os) behind JENOVA's web search consists of three key components:

**1. Real-Time Web Scraping** 

JENOVA's scraping engine employs advanced relevance algorithms to identify authoritative sources for each query type. The system's multi-threaded processing enables parallel data collection from up to 20 sources simultaneously, while structured data extraction helps maintain data integrity. For example, when researching a consumer product, the system can concurrently analyze professional reviews, user feedback, pricing data, and technical specifications from multiple authoritative sources, providing a comprehensive view within seconds.

**2. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** 

To maintain accuracy while processing large volumes of web content, JENOVA's RAG system employs sophisticated vector embeddings and semantic search capabilities. The system can efficiently process documents exceeding 100,000 words while maintaining contextual understanding. This is particularly valuable when analyzing technical documentation, research papers, or lengthy discussion threads, where key information might be scattered throughout the content. The RAG system's semantic search ensures that relevant information isn't missed even when exact keyword matches aren't present.

**3. Intelligent Model Selection** 

JENOVA's [model router](https://www.jenova.ai/model-router) analyzes both query intent and content type to select the optimal AI model for each task. The system maintains a dynamic performance matrix of different models across various content types, continuously updated through user feedback and accuracy metrics. For instance, technical content is routed to models with strong logical reasoning capabilities, while narrative content is directed to models better suited for understanding context and nuance.

**Practical Applications**

The real-time, comprehensive nature of JENOVA's web search architecture enables superior results across numerous everyday scenarios:

**1. News & Current Events Analysis** 

JENOVA's real-time approach particularly shines during breaking news events. The system simultaneously monitors news agencies, verified social media accounts, and expert commentary, providing users with comprehensive, up-to-the-minute information. Recent testing during major tech announcements showed JENOVA delivering significant updates an average of 30 minutes before they appeared in cached search results.

**2. Consumer Research** 

For purchase decisions, JENOVA's architecture enables true real-time price comparison and availability checking across multiple retailers. The system can simultaneously track pricing history, analyze user reviews, and compare specifications across different vendors. This real-time approach has proven particularly valuable during flash sales or limited-time offers, where prices and availability change rapidly.

**3. Travel & Entertainment** 

JENOVA's real-time capabilities provide crucial advantages in dynamic content areas like travel and entertainment. The system can simultaneously check multiple booking platforms, review sites, and local information sources to provide current pricing, availability, and relevant local updates. This ensures users have the most recent information about everything from ticket prices to venue changes.

**4. Educational Content** 

For students and researchers, JENOVA's architecture excels at synthesizing information from academic sources, educational platforms, and expert discussions. The system can process complex academic content while maintaining accuracy and providing appropriate context, making it particularly valuable for research and learning applications.

**5. Business & Market Research** 

For publicly available business information, JENOVA provides real-time analysis of market trends, company updates, and industry developments. The system can simultaneously process news releases, market data, and industry analysis to provide current, comprehensive insights.

**The Future of Web Search**

As we move further into the age of artificial intelligence, the definition of effective web search continues to evolve. Recent user studies show a growing preference for accuracy over speed, with 73% of users willing to wait an additional 3-5 seconds for more current and accurate results. This shift in user behavior suggests a fundamental change in how we value and consume information.

The success of real-time web search capabilities demonstrates a maturing market where information quality increasingly takes precedence over response speed. This trend is particularly evident in professional and academic settings, where accuracy and currentness are crucial for decision-making.

**Conclusion**

The next generation of AI web search is not just about faster results or more sophisticated algorithms - it's about delivering genuinely useful, current, and accurate information. While real-time approaches like JENOVA's may require slightly more processing time, the resulting improvements in accuracy and currentness make them increasingly valuable in our rapidly evolving digital landscape.

Looking ahead, the challenge will be to further optimize real-time processing while maintaining accuracy. As internet content continues to grow exponentially, the ability to provide real-time, accurate, and contextually relevant search results will become increasingly crucial for effective information retrieval.

To maintain accuracy while processing large volumes of web content, JENOVA's RAG system employs sophisticated vector embeddings and semantic search capabilities. The system can efficiently process documents exceeding 100,000 words while maintaining contextual understanding. This is particularly valuable when analyzing technical documentation, research papers, or lengthy discussion threads, where key information might be scattered throughout the content. The RAG system's semantic search ensures that relevant information isn't missed even when exact keyword matches aren't present.

**3. Intelligent Model Selection**

JENOVA's [model router](https://www.jenova.ai/model-router) analyzes both query intent and content type to select the optimal AI model for each task. The system maintains a dynamic performance matrix of different models across various content types, continuously updated through user feedback and accuracy metrics. For instance, technical content is routed to models with strong logical reasoning capabilities, while narrative content is directed to models better suited for understanding context and nuance.

**Practical Applications**

The real-time, comprehensive nature of JENOVA's web search architecture enables superior results across numerous everyday scenarios:

**1. News & Current Events Analysis**

JENOVA's real-time approach particularly shines during breaking news events. The system simultaneously monitors news agencies, verified social media accounts, and expert commentary, providing users with comprehensive, up-to-the-minute information. Recent testing during major tech announcements showed JENOVA delivering significant updates an average of 30 minutes before they appeared in cached search results.

**2. Consumer Research**

For purchase decisions, JENOVA's architecture enables true real-time price comparison and availability checking across multiple retailers. The system can simultaneously track pricing history, analyze user reviews, and compare specifications across different vendors. This real-time approach has proven particularly valuable during flash sales or limited-time offers, where prices and availability change rapidly.

**3. Travel & Entertainment**

JENOVA's real-time capabilities provide crucial advantages in dynamic content areas like travel and entertainment. The system can simultaneously check multiple booking platforms, review sites, and local information sources to provide current pricing, availability, and relevant local updates. This ensures users have the most recent information about everything from ticket prices to venue changes.

**4. Educational Content**

For students and researchers, JENOVA's architecture excels at synthesizing information from academic sources, educational platforms, and expert discussions. The system can process complex academic content while maintaining accuracy and providing appropriate context, making it particularly valuable for research and learning applications.

**5. Business & Market Research**

For publicly available business information, JENOVA provides real-time analysis of market trends, company updates, and industry developments. The system can simultaneously process news releases, market data, and industry analysis to provide current, comprehensive insights.

**The Future of Web Search**

As we move further into the age of artificial intelligence, the definition of effective web search continues to evolve. Recent user studies show a growing preference for accuracy over speed, with 73% of users willing to wait an additional 3-5 seconds for more current and accurate results. This shift in user behavior suggests a fundamental change in how we value and consume information.

The success of real-time web search capabilities demonstrates a maturing market where information quality increasingly takes precedence over response speed. This trend is particularly evident in professional and academic settings, where accuracy and currentness are crucial for decision-making.

**Conclusion**

The next generation of AI web search is not just about faster results or more sophisticated algorithms - it's about delivering genuinely useful, current, and accurate information. While real-time approaches like JENOVA's may require slightly more processing time, the resulting improvements in accuracy and currentness make them increasingly valuable in our rapidly evolving digital landscape.

Looking ahead, the challenge will be to further optimize real-time processing while maintaining accuracy.

1gdd429,2,2024-10-27,Going back to teaching after leaving…?,u/AnonymousFrogFiend,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1gdd429/going_back_to_teaching_after_leaving/,"
TLDR: I left teaching after 1.5 years due to overwhelming workload and stress from handling all curriculum planning alone in a one-form entry school. Now at 26, with more life experience and tools to manage time better, I miss working with kids and am considering returning to teaching, but teaching A-Level English (AP English). I’m concerned that the same challenges might resurface, and I’m seeking advice from others who’ve returned to teaching after leaving. What did you change, and was it better the second time around?

I taught primary (elementary) school for 1 1.5 years, back when I was 22 - 23 years old. As I’m sure many of you can relate to, my training didn’t prepare me for the realities of having my own class. The added responsibilities that add up over, e.g. setting homework, spellings, reading books, marking, the endless paperwork. I also only worked in one form entry schools (one class per grade/year group), so curriculum planning for the whole grade was overwhelming and I felt alone. I crumbled under that stress and so I left teaching.

I’m now 26 and feel like I have a bit more life experience behind me. I don’t crumble under pressure as easily and I follow some teachers online who showed me some tools to save time as teachers, e.g. Teachermatic, ChatGPT (controversial), etc.

I just really miss working with kids and I was wondering if teaching would be different if I taught A-Level English (AP English), where the students actually choose to be in class. Maybe it would make my life a little easier. Plus finding a job in the industry I want has been tough. But I’m scared that if I go into teaching again, the same issues I had before would resurface.

So I’d love to hear your opinions, fellow teachers! Have any of you gone back to teaching after leaving? Or transitioned from younger to older kids? What was it like?

Thanks in advance for your help and understanding!"

1gdemfd,1,2024-10-27,"What is generative AI? Benefits, pitfalls and how to use it in your day-to-day.",u/fintech07,AIToolsTech,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIToolsTech/comments/1gdemfd/what_is_generative_ai_benefits_pitfalls_and_how/,"Artificial intelligence is a phrase that can inspire awe or fear, depending on who you’re talking to.

But whether we like it or not, it seems AI is here to stay. The overall market is projected to reach $1,339 billion by 2030, according to a MarketsandMarkets forecast. One Forbes survey showed 77% of respondents were worried AI will cause job loss.

This fear is valid, says Manasi Vartak, the chief AI architect at Cloudera, but it may ultimately hold workers back – instead, you might risk losing your job to someone more open to embracing new technology.

What is generative AI?

Generative AI helps us go “from imagination to reality,” says Joe Edwards, director of product marketing at automation software company UiPath. 

Generative AI can create words, music, pictures or videos from just a few suggestions. It’s caused a stir on social media this year as AI art, fake images of celebrities and posthumous music have begun to circulate.

Generative AI systems are trained on large amounts of data, studying pictures, videos and the way people operate online, Edwards says. These advanced learning machine models can then identify patterns and create content of their own.

Some wrong answers have low stakes and are pretty funny, while others can spread dangerous misinformation. When Google debuted its AI overview earlier this year, one viral answer said “Doctors recommend smoking 2-3 cigarettes per day during pregnancy.”

And as a man-made creation, generative AI can amplify human biases. AI images can perpetuate harmful racial and gender stereotypes, the Washington Post found in 2023.

“These models were trained on data that exists in the world, which is biased, so it might not have representation from women, from minorities, from LGBTQ (communities), from people of color,” Vartak says. “If we only take what the technology tells us as gospel, we’re going to miss out on those stories entirely.”

How to use generative AI

Keep a human in the loop, Vartak says. Generative AI should be your navigation partner, not your driver. 

“Give it some ideas, let it generate some text, then go and review it, make sure that’s accurate,” she says. “Trust but verify.”

Edwards used a generative AI program to sort through the mounds of emails he had after he got back from paternity leave. You can also use it as a brainstorming partner to plan your kid’s birthday party or an upcoming trip.

There are also business uses, which can be tailored specifically to your job. For teachers, unfortunately, this means developing an eagle eye for ChatGPT-generated essays and answers from students. In health care, some doctors are using AI to improve patient visits and translate visit notes into understandable terms. Some AI systems can detect breast cancer, pulmonary embolism and strokes and may lead to life-saving, earlier diagnosis..


Both Vartak and Edwards recommend taking a stab at generative AI – it can be as low-commitment as playing around with ChatGPT or a more involved free online training course.

“Think of it as your sidekick,” Vartak says. “You’re going to be able to utilize it to … have more fun and be more productive in your daily lives. I think all new tech is hard, but this one is here to stay and it can be a force for good.”

I’m not cool, I’m not pretty, I’m fat and ugly, and I have a horrible temper. I have a horrible tendency to lie, whether it's about big stuff or white lies about anything, and I hate myself. I can’t talk to boys without wanting to throw up and die, but I also can't make friends. In social group settings, I’m awkward, and I am not funny, and people NOTICE. They think I don't like them, which isn't true, but I’m always just so preoccupied and unfunny. And I’m constantly thinking about how horrible I am. I have bad health problems too, but like mini ones, so I am always getting infections, acne, hair falling out, bad teeth, bad vision, ugly fingernails, wrinkles, etc. So basically nothing about me is good, and honestly, I just want to die. Like, what is the point of living when there isn't a SINGLE good quality about me? I’m a germaphobic b\*tchy freak, and my mom genuinely hates me because of how big of a failure I am. I have failed every single math test since the beginning of this year and got straight Cs last year, which was my junior year, the most important year ever for colleges. Now I haven't been doing any work because, first of all, what the hell is the point? What's worse is that my sister is better than me in every aspect, and every time she comes home, my whole family is like, “\[her name\], yay! You’re home! I haven't seen you in so long” (this is maybe if they missed seeing her yesterday). And like, I get it because I miss her too even when she's gone, and no one misses me. I was gonna say ""no one SEEMS to miss me,"" but it's genuinely true how nobody misses me. My mom treats me like I'm 12, but I’m not—I’m 17 and have no responsibility. She doesn't teach me how to do anything, and I don’t know if it’s because she hates spending time with me or thinks I'm so incompetent (which I am). She would rather just do it herself or have someone else do it. So I’m incompetent, but I don’t know how to do anything. I genuinely don’t know how to do anything. She tells me to give up on education, and I’m Chinese, so honestly, education is THE MOST important thing to someone’s child, and being a good student is the best trait anyone could possibly have. I have no competitive drive, and I am not even beautiful, which is, unfortunately, one of the most important things a woman needs: beauty, to marry rich and become a housewife. But I’m neither. I don’t even have qualities to be a housewife. Like I said, I can’t do basic household things because my mom 1) won’t let me, 2) I don’t know how, 3) I was never taught. I am not smart and definitely won’t make any money in the future. It sucks because all my friends are talking about going to top colleges, and I’m happy for them because their futures are so bright. They worked so hard in high school, achieving 4.0+ GPAs despite having extremely horrible home situations and financial struggles, while my family is upper middle class and I have tutors, etc. I'm also constantly being invalidated because I am upper-middle class, am the youngest, etc. and I know I can't blame others and my situation for being incompetent because naturally this way, I should be in the best spot to become a successful, well-rounded individual. Why was I born this way? Why can't I just have the natural drive and competency to have a successful future?

I’ve been thinking about offing myself ever since I was 10, and it has shown because I genuinely don’t have the drive or anything to do anything. The only time I actually tried was freshman year, but after that, I got a C in my first-semester chemistry class. Since then, it just spiraled from being an A student to an F student. I don't do any work unless it's classwork they force us to do in class, and once I go home, I just doomscroll on TikTok to forget about everything. I know Reddit isn't a nice platform where the communities are supportive, so honestly, I’m not expecting a positive response. I'm so freaking lazy and unmotivated that I even used ChatGPT to make this post grammatically correct. What's the point of anything?? ask me anything ! "
1gdqiio,2,2024-10-27,Career Advice Needed: Struggling to Find the Right Path ,u/Apprehensive_Share93,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1gdqiio/career_advice_needed_struggling_to_find_the_right/,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently a junior in college, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in New Media Arts. Lately, I’ve been sitting down and contemplating what career would be most suitable for me. I’ve been thinking about this for years, starting back in high school, but I had a hard time envisioning myself in any specific career path. None of the subjects I was exposed to in school really sparked my interest in terms of my future.

Since then, I’ve done A LOT of questioning and introspection to figure out what I actually enjoy. Choosing a career to commit to has been daunting, and even now, as a 21-year-old college student, I still find myself sorting through my likes, dislikes, and personality traits.

Here’s what I’ve narrowed down so far:

# What I Like:

* **Writing**: I enjoy writing anything—essays, stories, ideas—whatever comes to mind.
* **Arts**: I love the creative problem-solving aspect of art and thinking deeply about the meaning and purpose behind artwork.
* **Psychology**: I'm fascinated by how people think and how the human mind works. I’m interested in understanding mental disorders and how relationships affect us. However, I don’t want to be a therapist or psychologist because dealing with others’ emotions sounds draining.
* **History**: I find history fun, especially when I get to understand how the world was built and how people thought in the past.
* **Art History**: Since I love both art and history, it’s a natural fit.
* **Graphic Design**: I’ve always wanted to learn Adobe tools, and I’m fascinated by how people use visual design to communicate ideas.
* **Pattern Recognition**: I get excited and proud when I recognize patterns that help me solve problems or make predictions. This skill made me think I should pursue Computer Science since I notice patterns in numbers and coding, but I’m not passionate about it.
* **Aesthetic Sensitivity**: I have a good eye for what looks visually appealing, not just in art and design but in clothes, music, and patterns of any kind.
* **Music**: I’m deeply passionate about music—it feels like it affects my soul. I used to play piano but stopped for personal reasons.

# What I Don’t Like:

* **Physics**: I’m not a huge fan of physics or memorizing all the formulas. I’ve always doubted myself in this subject. Hence, why I crossed out being an engineer. 
* **Math**: I don’t hate it, but I’ve never been passionate about it.
* **Biology**: It’s never sparked any interest in me. 
* **Chemistry**: I was good at it in high school, but I wouldn’t want it as a career.
* **Finance**: I was originally a finance major and after taking microeconomics and macroeconomics, I wanted to shoot myself (not literally, but you get it).
* **Statistics**: Nope, not for me.
* **Law**: No interest in being a lawyer.
* **Medical Careers**: I don’t want to be a nurse or spend years getting an education in medicine.
* **Dentist**: Cleaning people’s mouths just doesn’t appeal to me.

# My Personality:

* **Empathic and Emotionally Intelligent**: People tell me I have a great personality and that I’m in tune with others' emotions.
* **Shy and Withdrawn**: I’m not much of a talker, and I worry this might make certain careers (like psychology or therapy) difficult for me.
* **Analytical and Detail-Oriented**: I like breaking concepts down and understanding everything on a fundamental level.
* **Imaginative and Fantasy-Prone**: This is where most of my creativity comes from and why I’m a good creative thinker.
* **Cooperative and Collaborative**: I prefer teamwork and collaboration over competition.
* **Deeply Self-Aware**: I’m always mindful of my thoughts, feelings, strengths, and weaknesses. I would love a career that encourages self-improvement.
* **Strong Moral Compass**: I’ll fight tooth and nail for the people and causes I care about.
* **Even-Tempered**: I’m pretty easy to get along with.
* **Intellectual**: I’m curious about the world and don’t want that side of me to die as I get older.
* **Cautious and Deliberate**: I like to think things through before committing to anything.
* **Achievement-Striving**: I love earning the things I want in life.
* **Self-Efficacy**: I have confidence in my ability to accomplish things, it’s just about prioritizing.
* **Modest and Humble**: I have a realistic self-image and never put myself on a pedestal.

# My Flaws:

* **Self-Doubt**: This is my biggest flaw. Logically, I know I’m smart, kind, and hardworking, but emotionally, I act like I don’t believe it.
* **Perfectionism**: I struggle with this.
* **Thinking without Acting**: I tend to overthink and let decisions slip by without taking action.
* **Fear of Commitment**: I fear being stuck in situations I can’t escape, whether that’s a bad relationship, a career I don’t like, or a toxic environment.
* **Sensitive to Criticism**: I take criticism to heart.
* **Procrastination**: Classic flaw.

# Things I Want in a Career:

* **Work/Life Balance**: I want to live to work, not work to live.
* **Decent Salary**: I don’t need six figures, just enough to pay the bills, live comfortably, and have some peace.
* **Remote Work**: This is a bonus, though not a necessity if the work/life balance is there.
* **Non-Toxic Work Environment**: This is non-negotiable. I’ve struggled with social anxiety and fear of bullying, so I won’t tolerate toxic environments. Good communication and collaboration are essential.

# So, Any Advice?

What career paths should I look into based on my interests and personality? Any guidance or thoughts would be really appreciated. Thanks!   
  
P.S. And yes, I did use ChatGPT because I wanted my post to be coherent and organized. Just so that more people can understand it better. But my question and the meaning of my post remains the same. "

I’ve faced challenges finding a mentor due to ethical concerns and workload issues among professionals. I’m considering various project ideas, including a crime scene diorama, a VR cadaver simulation, an AI analysis tool, or a short novel about a forensic pathologist. If you or someone you know can help, please reach out. I'm also open to related fields like forensic toxicology and CSI. Thank you!**  
  
Hello! As the title says, I’m currently looking for someone who would be willing to let me learn about their career field for a period of five months for an independent study on forensic pathology.

For context, I am a high school senior enrolled in an Independent Study Mentorship class, with my chosen field of interest being forensic pathology. Like many people drawn to forensic science, my interest stems from a love for crime fiction. While I understand that the reality of this profession differs from its fictional representations, I am eager to explore how it aligns with my research and interests.

The independent study class requires students to reach out to local professionals in their career field of interest over the summer to secure a mentor before the school year starts. As it turns out, finding a mentor in this field has its own challenges, as I have been turned away by forensic pathologists I contacted (those local, out-of-state, and even out of the country) mostly due to ethical reasons and high workloads stemming from understaffing at their offices. I totally understand this, of course, as the nature of the work is precarious and delicate, not to mention the profession is currently facing a shortage. Still, while it is to be expected, it’s disheartening, as I am genuinely invested in learning more about this career field and whether it’s something I might consider for the future. My teacher will allow me to remain in the class even if I don’t secure a mentor, but she says I won’t have the full experience that the class has to offer. The end goal of our class is to create a final product that serves a real-world purpose for our specific field of study by April of next year.

I am currently considering the following possible end products for my study (though I am open to other ideas and suggestions):

* **A diorama of a modern-day crime scene** that could be used for educational purposes, similar to Frances Glessner Lee's Nutshell Studies, which are miniature but hyper-realistic reconstructions of past crime scenes.
* **A VR simulation of a customizable cadaver model** that allows for the addition or removal of various organs and injuries. This could be used for teaching about specific forensic pathologies, such as trauma assessment, disease progression, or anatomical variations. (This might be the hardest to conceive and least likely to happen, but it’s still interesting to think about.)
* **An AI-powered case analysis tool** that can analyze forensic data, case files, and historical crime statistics to identify patterns or potential leads, which could assist investigators and medical examiners in solving complex cases. (Basically a Sherlockian ChatGPT)
* **A short novel detailing the work of a forensic pathologist** who becomes embroiled in a mystery when a series of unusual autopsies reveal a rare condition suggesting the individuals might have been alive long after they were declared dead. (A reality-grounded fantasy story.)

As such, I am reaching out to Reddit as a last resort. If you are someone (or know someone) willing to let a student pick their brain (figuratively, of course) and assist them in the creation of a forensic-oriented product, please get in touch for further details and a possible interview. While I did mention my interest in forensic pathology, I am also open to those of you working in related fields, such as forensic toxicology and CSI, as your roles are equally important and fascinating.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, Forensic Redditors!"
1gdshv3,1,2024-10-27,Wharton professor Ethan Mollick says companies must make organizational changes if they want to benefit from AI,u/fintech07,AIToolsTech,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIToolsTech/comments/1gdshv3/wharton_professor_ethan_mollick_says_companies/,"""Until we change the organization, we won't get much benefit,"" he said at the MIT AI conference on Saturday.

Mollick has become a prominent figure in the AI revolution. He's the author of Co-Intelligence, a book about living and working with AI, in which he writes that the cost of understanding the potential of AI is ""three sleepless nights.

His advice for companies is to start by rethinking the way they deploy artificial intelligence. Until the recent advances in AI, he said new technological innovations were introduced into companies under the assumption that they would be controlled by human workers — with intelligence and judgment. ""That starts to change in AI, it's intelligence of a different source, but it's now intelligence deployable a different way,"" he said.

He pointed to a recent study he co-authored that examined the impact of AI on a group of BCG consultants. The study randomly assigned 758 consultants at the firm to one of three groups: no access to AI, access to ChatGPT powered by GPT-4, and access to ChatGPT, along with instructional videos and documents on prompt engineering strategies.

The results showed that AI creates a ""jagged technological frontier"" in which AI easily completes some tasks while others of similar difficulty are outside its current capability.

For tasks ""inside the frontier,"" consultants using AI were ""significantly more productive."" However, those using AI to complete tasks ""outside the frontier"" were ""19 percentage points less likely to produce correct solutions compared to those without AI.""

The takeaway is that AI can be incredibly helpful to workers when deployed properly. But Mollick said right now AI integration is ""all happening at the individual level and organizations are basically not learning any of this for a variety of really interesting reasons.""

In his Wharton classes, he requires students to use ChatGPT for assignments. ""There's a lot of positives about it. That doesn't minimize the fact that cheating and negativity are there, but those have been there for a long time,"" he told NPR."

Zoek Wat is AI precieshttps://www.mediawijsheid.nl/kunstmatigeintelligentie/1Van aanbevelingen op je tijdlijn tot deepfake-filmpjes. En van ChatGPT tot je navigatieapp. We krijgen in ons mediagebruik steeds vaker te maken met kunstmatige intelligentie, ook wel AI genoemd.AI is de intelligentie waarmee machines, software en apparaten zelfstandig problemen oplossen. Zij imiteren hierbij het denkvermogen van de mens. De grote vraag rondom AI is welke rol we het willen geven in onze levens. Wat gebeurt er als computers beter worden in dingen dan de mens? En wie bepaalt dan wat ‘beter’ is?2Wat is AI precies:Machines, software, robots of andere apparaten met AI (artificiële intelligentie) reageren op data of impulsen uit hun omgeving. Daarmee nemen ze zelfstandig beslissingen. Het gaat bij AI dus niet om de rekenkracht, maar om de mogelijkheid (zelfstandig) te leren en beslissingen te nemen.De apparaten zijn zich echter niet bewust van de taken die ze uitvoeren. Ze volgen algoritmes en herkennen patronen. Door te leren van hun eigen fouten, leveren ze een beter resultaat. Je spreekt dan ook wel van machine learning.3Wat zijn voorbeelden van kunstmatige intelligentie:In de praktijk maken we al regelmatig gebruik van AI. ChatGPT is een bekend voorbeeld: een chatrobot die teksten verzint. Maar ook als je iets opzoekt met een zoekmachine wordt kunstmatige intelligentie ingezet. Google laat bijvoorbeeld met intelligente algoritmes de zoekresultaten zo goed mogelijk aansluiten op jouw wensen. Ook robots in fabrieken, virtuele karakters in videogames en automatische autobesturing vallen onder AI. Zo ontwikkelen o.a. Google, Tesla en Mercedeszelfrijdende auto’s.4Ik vind het mooi dat AI zich ontwikkelt in de maatschappij. Ik maak er zelf ook al gebruik van AI in de vorm van ChatGPT. Soms zijn er onderwerpen die mijn interesse hebben en daar wil ik dan meer over weten. Via ChatGPT kom ik snel aan de juiste informatie.5AI (artificiële of kunstmatige intelligentie) biedt allerlei kansen voor het onderwijs. Maar er zijn ook risico’s. Waar moet je rekening mee houden? Hoe kan AI het onderwijs ondersteunen?Kansen voor het onderwijs:Bij toepassingen die behulpzaam kunnen zijn voor het onderwijs kun je bijvoorbeeld denken aan:• • • AI die, op basis van grote hoeveelheden data, bepaalde zaken kan voorspellen. Zoals welke studenten extra ondersteuning nodig hebben of een hoger risico lopen te spijbelen. Zo zou AI kunnen zorgen voor onderwijs dat beter aansluit bij de leerlingen en docenten ondersteunen.Ook kan AI ingezet worden voor het verbeteren van spraak-naar-tekst-interfaces. Dat kan bijvoorbeeld in taalonderwijs handig zijn (denk aan Google Translate en digitale lespakketten) en toegankelijkheid vergroten (denk aan integratie van virtuele assistenten als Siri of Alexa).Denk ook aan het automatiseren van systemen met informatie over de voortgang en resultaten van leerlingen.6Risico’s van AI:Naast de kansen zijn er ook risico’s voor het onderwijs:• Voor alle AI geldt: een zelflerend algoritme is maar zo goed als de data waarmee het gevoed wordt. Als die gegevens een bepaalde fout hebben, zal AI deze ook vertonen. Daarmee dreigen bestaande ongelijkheden in het onderwijs (zoals discriminatie op grond van afkomst of inkomen) overgenomen te worden.• Ook zijn er ethische bezwaren rondom dataverzameling: om kunstmatige intelligentie in te zetten zijn enorm veel gegevens van leerlingen/studenten nodig.• De inbreng van kunstmatige intelligentie kan ten koste van het menselijk contact tussen leraar en leerling gaan. De leraar wordt hierbij steeds minder belangrijk.Aan de andere kant is het voor docenten met alle werkdruk eigenlijk nu al niet meer mogelijk om elke student voldoende aandacht te geven. De klassieke vorm van onderwijs zal steeds minder gaan worden en steeds meer een digitale vorm krijgen.7Ik gebruik zelf ook wel eens ChatGPT. Wat zijn nu de voor- en nadelen van ChatGPT in het onderwijs. Eind 2022 werd ChatGPT in korte tijd zeer populair. ChatGPT is een geavanceerde chatbot die op basis van kunstmatige intelligentie unieke teksten kan schrijven. Deze tool is onderscheidend omdat het, in tegenstelling tot eerdere AItaalmodellen, erg laagdrempelig is. Ook komen teksten erg overtuigend over omdat AI menselijke creativiteit en intelligentie nabootst.8De grote populariteit van ChatGPT heeft geleid tot zorgen in het onderwijs. Leerlingen kunnen ChatGPT bijvoorbeeld gebruiken bij het maken van hun huiswerk, maar ook hele verslagen, essays en scripties laten schrijven. Hierdoor kan het lastig zijn om te toetsen of een leerling de stof goed beheerst.Door het gebruik van ChatGPT in het onderwijs bespreekbaar te maken kun je leerlingen bewust maken van de risico’s. Je kunt met leerlingen in gesprek gaan over of en hoe ChatGPT zou kunnen bijdragen aan de leerdoelen. Maak ook afspraken met leerlingen over hoe zij moeten aangeven wanneer zij gebruikmaken van ChatGPT.9Ik vind het mooi dat AI gebruikt wordt in het onderwijs. Het helpt mij om mijn huiswerk te maken en de juiste informatie te vinden. Daarnaast scheelt het een hoop tijd met opzoeken van informatie. Ikzelf luister graag naar teksten in plaats van de teksten te lezen. Ik kan een tekst dan beter onthouden. Daarnaast denk ik dat AI het mogelijk maakt om beter voorspellingen te maken voor de toekomst. AI kan dan bijvoorbeeld een goede planning maken voor mijn schoolwerk en ik weet hoe ik mij het beste kan voorbereiden voor een examen. Aan de andere kant zou ik zelf wel de regie in handen willen hebben en zelf willen blijven beslissen wanneer ik er wel of geen gebruik van wil maken.10Tot slot blijft de grote vraag rondom AI, welke rol we het willen geven in onze levens. Wat gebeurt er als computers beter worden in dingen dan de mens? En wie bepaalt dan wat ‘beter’ is? Bij elke nieuwe toepassing is het belangrijk om stil te staan bij ethische en juridische vragen.Als we kijken naar ethische vragen, dan hebben we het over wat is goed en veilig in het onderwijs. Hoe gaan we om met de vertrouwelijke persoonsgegevens van studenten. Bij de juridische vragen kijken we naar de wet- en regelgeving omtrent het gebruik van AI in het onderwijs."

1gdz3w9,2,2024-10-28,I am triggered too much when people copy in assignments or tests in college,u/an_underachiever_,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gdz3w9/i_am_triggered_too_much_when_people_copy_in/,"So I've been brought up as an honest guy and I pride myself on my honesty. But when I look around me and I can't help but do it, almost everyone in college cheats/copies in literally every assignment or test or project. It riles me up so much. In assignments, few assignments of students do the rounds in the student groups and everyone copies from it. Very rarely I do that. And some people are smart enough to take the best parts of different assignments doing the rounds. In tests, people hide phones in their dresses, even females, bring materials into the examination room, talk to neighbour's when no one is looking and what not. I know it's not possible to have eyes on everyone all the time but still even if caught no action is taken since the higher ups are all corrupt. There's no one to complain to. Projects are downloaded straight from the net and so on. Even in contests, people use chatgpt and Google and what not to get answers. Now, I can't sleep generally if I do such things and hence I live up to my values. But I can't help to wonder where the hell is everyone's ethics and honesty ? This is absolute nonsense. I'm getting so mad, I feel like I want to complain but I also don't want to ruin someone's life because it's not like I'm perfect in every way or haven't done anything wrong. Sure, I may have done less cheating than most kids if not all, but still I feel like this could backfire on me if my name is known. This happens every single day. The worst is when the teacher compares my work and their work and shows me how great there's is compared to mine. It's so damn awkward and frustrating"

The more AI technology advances, the more students are using it in their every day lives. Most people are well aware of students using AI to write their essays and do their homework, but this isn’t the only use students are getting out of these AI tools.

Studying and reading is subject to AI integration just as much as academic writing. Generative AI is able to read the assignments either from an uploaded document or the web and create summaries, pinpointing relevant quotes and points so students can quickly get all the necessary proof that they did their assigned reading.

The use of AI in studying and reading has caused higher education institutions to rethink how they assign reading, signaling larger changes on the horizon for academia.

# How Are Students Using AI to Study?

For the longest time, college students have looked for ways to skirt this schoolwork, either by reading Cliff's Notes, web summaries, watching YouTube summaries, or simply skimming the material and crossing their fingers that they glossed over the material that’ll end up on the [quiz.Now](http://quiz.Now) though, with advanced artificial intelligence at their fingertips, students only need to ask these AI chatbots to read the material for them and generate a summary.

Many of the caveats of using generative AI tools to create essays aren’t present when summarizing pdf’s. For instance, misinformation that an AI-generated essay might have aren’t present when the AI is tasked with simply reading a piece of text. This was once one of main hallmarks of AI writing for plagiarism detection, however in this case this fatal flaw is lacking from AI-powered studying.

AI powered studying takes many forms. With students even asking AI to generate flash cards, so they can educate themselves the right way.

Still, professors are not convinced that academic integrity is not being tarnished with this less intrusive use of AI tools. If students use AI to read everything assigned to them, professors will have to change what, why, and how they ask students to read in the first place.

# How is Academia Rethinking Reading Assignments

Unlike high school students, some college students have anywhere from 100 pages to 300 pages a week for varying fields of study. Whether because they deem the reading unnecessary busywork, they just don’t have the bandwidth to juggle the load, or for their own mental health, there has been a larger decline of reading for Gen-Z and younger students than previous times in academia.

You can look to [studies from the 90’s and see a steady decline in reading](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2000-07173-017) begin only to dip further and further all the way up to [70% of students saying they don’t read the texts their professors give them in a 2021 study](https://theconversation.com/up-to-80-of-uni-students-dont-read-their-assigned-readings-here-are-6-helpful-tips-for-teachers-165952).

Where most professors take issue with the refusal to read and use of AI to take on reading assessments for students, is that such practices deprive young learners of the student learning experiences that are required to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

The solution as many professors have found, is conducting more in-class assignments, including in-class reading that teaches them how to read larger loads in a given period of time. Cognizant of declines in reading, some professors assign large reading loads for homework with intentions to quiz students on such hyper-specific material that no chatbot could possibly prepare the student for the quiz.

Other solutions may involve explicitly advocating for using AI as well as changing the way students read. One of the many factors as to why students aren’t reading is surely changing technologies and mediums from which student derive information. Some professors advocate for joining this trend and assigning material to watch or listen to, in the form of YouTube videos or podcasts, instead of traditional reading.

# Why Are Students Studying Less?

Technological advancement holds a large share of fault for the decline in reading by college students, however, there are numerous factors beyond these advents. The Coronavirus pandemic served a large role in changing the way Gen-Z students learn, from shifting school to fully-remote settings and making mental health play a larger role in academia, students were tasked to read less and became used to these behaviors.

With social media, podcasts, streaming services, and an infinite amount of media choices available to them, people have shorter attention-spans than ever, constituting a threat to reading at large, beyond school work. Even English students, who love to read and write, are using AI to complete and summarize the reading their assigned from less interesting classes.

Lastly, economics has a role to play in why students read less. More students are working simultaneously to doing college work and this limits the bandwidth for school work they’re able to take on.

This isn’t just students that need to work at the same time as they study to afford tuition and other bills, it’s student taking advantage of job opportunities that have been made available to younger candidates with remote capabilities that allow them to work anywhere and anytime. In our changing world, young people don’t see graduating as a pre-condition to starting their hustle, and studying often gets in the way.

# AI Solutions to AI Problems

Artificial intelligence is unique from previous Edtech advances that have changed the world. Any problem is subject to new solutions with unlimited capabilities to improve student learning experiences without having to sacrifice academic integrity.

AI tools will soon be able to customize curricula down to each professor’s student and address all of their personal needs, whether they have jobs, mental health concerns, or simply prefer other media to text to get their information. Once curricula are personalized towards students, learning experiences can be crafted that ensure students acquire the skills they need to truly educate themselves, that students don’t just consider boring busy work, and that professors approve of.

# TL;DR

More than half of students are using AI tools to study. Some reports suggest it’s up to 86% of students, meanwhile as previously cited in this article, 70% of students are refusing to read. Obviously, if we truly care about student learning experiences, AI is not the issue. Students are already being deprived of learning experiences simply because they don’t care.

AI should be considered an opportunity to reengage students in academia. AI’s impact on academia has yet to materialize, but we can already expect that it will be responsible for more positive results than cases of plagiarism. [OpenAI’s updated versions of ChatGPT](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/are-openai-s-o1-mini-and-o1-preview-truly-undetectable-an-in-depth-review) alone are capable of more computing power than ever, making it essential in scientific fields. When the humanities become subject to such advancements, they will make AI essential to educating yourself in a field.

# FAQ

# Is Using ChatGPT plagiarism?

[Using ChatGPT or any other generative AI software to do your homework is not traditional plagiarism](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/is-using-chatgpt-plagiarism-academic-dishonesty-in-dishonest-academia). It may be considered academic misconduct, but plagiarism is defined the theft of words or ideas without proper credit, which is not what AI does when generating text. Generative AI creates original content, so having it ghostwrite your essay is not plagiarism but the newer classification of “AI plagiarism”.

# How Many Students Use Generative AI?

A recent [Digital Education Council survey reported that 86% of students use AI](https://campustechnology.com/Articles/2024/08/28/Survey-86-of-Students-Already-Use-AI-in-Their-Studies.aspx) at varying capacities for their studies. Given that using AI for schoolwork is often prohibited, some students may have felt pressure confessing that they use AI as well. Meaning the actual percentage of students using AI may even be higher than 86%.

# What Are People Using Generative AI For?

Students use generative AI for homework but professionals also use these AI tools for all sorts of tasks from writing blogs, to SEO, to social media posts on platforms like LinkedIn and X. Using tools like Stealth Writer and SEO Writer give digital content writers huge advantages for making content personalized to any audience.

# What Other Generative AI apps are People Using?

Beyond ChatGPT, students and professionals are realizing that in order to implement AI into their work, they need to [use undetectable AI services to bypass AI detectors](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/make-chatgpt-undetectable). The best of these services is StealthGPT, with more capability in beating AI detection than any competitor, while also providing high quality content for professionals and academics alike."

Or will asking chatGPT how to do it make me learn nothing?",u/SanguinarianPhoenix,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1ge4u3u/in_my_community_college_intro_to_python_class_is/,"It's a very introductory class and we just mainly practice formatting every time we reach a new topic, since my professor loves making us learn alignment stuff. Anyways, here was part 1 of our 3 part assignment:

    # Selecting the filename in the current directory 
    file_name = ""employees.txt""

    # Printing the file name right before reading it
    print(f""Opening existing file: {file_name}"")

    try:
        # Reading from the file and processing each line immediately
        with open(file_name, ""r"") as file:
            # Print the header of the table
            print(f""{'Gross':>38}"")
            print(f""{'Name':>17} {'Hours':>5} {'Rate':>5} {'Pay':>8}"")

            for line in file:
                # Read and strip leading & trailing whitespace/newlines
                name = line.strip()  
                hours = float(get_hours())
                pay_rate = float(get_pay_rate())
                gross_pay = hours * pay_rate
                print(f""{name:>17} {hours:>5.2f} {pay_rate:>5.2f} {gross_pay:>8.2f}"")

My flipping to the page on the online book, I would basically just be copying it and tweaking it slightly (such as changing the filename) to get it to do what I wanted, but I could just ask chatGPT to do it and it's basically the same thing but takes 30 fewer seconds.

However, I was able to complete the 3-part assignment (which other students spend about 2 full days on) in just 3-4 hours. I have prior programming experience (the harvard CS50 class) so this class is primarily for brand-new beginners. I used the extra time I saved to watch [this 2 hour lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4fwY9ZsxPw) about OOP. So I'm not just finishing quickly so I can play video games. I'm finishing early and ""re-investing"" my time savings into more Python related stuff that will help me in the future. 

I also really like learning the extra stuff which ChatGPT includes such as:

    except Exception as e:
        print(f""An error occurred while reading the file: {e}"")

However, I'm curious if I'm starting a bad habit that might carry with me to ALL my future programming classes? Someone commented in a Python discord yesterday that LLM sites such as ChatGPT will probably get 10x better and more accurate in the future, so should I primarily write the code on my own the first time and then let chatGPT error check it and fix minor bugs?

I feel kinda bad about letting it do the whole thing for me, since I should at least write out the pseudocode and make sure I am conceptually mapping out the control flow correctly."

1ged1za,1,2024-10-28,Suggestions for Curbing AI & Encouraging Better Student Writing & Conduct,u/Stock-Review1076,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1ged1za/suggestions_for_curbing_ai_encouraging_better/,"Hi everyone, I'm a longtime reader, but this is my first time posting. I've read many threads here about AI, cellphone policies, laptops, etc., but I am currently burnt out this semester, and I'm at a loss regarding what to do about my classes regarding AI and class conduct. (I apologize for the long post/rant!)

I am an adjunct teaching two courses at a good state school while completing my PhD. Both my courses are 60 students each, which is an interesting size—not quite a large lecture and small enough that you can have discussions, be mindful of class conduct, etc. I'm usually known as the ""approachable"" professor. I'm fairly young (mid-30s), very accommodating, and have flexible deadlines. (I'm also a woman, so sometimes, female professors get the ""nice"" label.) I teach gender studies and religion. They are lower-level courses that I try to keep easy and fun. 

My courses usually go well, but this semester has been a struggle. I grade attendance because my chair advised me to do so post-COVID. I have added a strict no-cellphone policy this semester because cellphone use was terrible the previous semester. I also have other course conduct policies on my syllabus. I implemented a ""syllabus quiz"" this semester, which tested them on these policies. I also have a strict no-AI policy. In one of my courses, their class conduct has been very distracting—cellphone use, exiting excessively during class, being distracted by their laptops, etc. While meeting with the dean of students last week about another issue, she told me it's good to reset expectations for the rest of the semester, which I sent to my students last Friday in an announcement (I reminded them about cellphones, told them there's been too many class disruptions and class exits, and reiterated that these policies are on the syllabus.)

In my other course, I have several quizzes throughout the semester. This last quiz, I noticed use of AI and so, I audited their first quiz and found A LOT of AI that I had missed. I'm talking bad AI--copied and pasted from Gemini or Chat GPT. These take-home quizzes should be easy because they're open book/note, so using AI for a 150-word short-answer question is appalling to me.

Today, I lectured both classes about AI use and gave both classes an in-class essay to write on the spot. I was pretty hard on them and warned them that I might ban laptops for the rest of the semester and change our assignments to in-class essays. This semester, it all just feels so demoralizing—I have a lot of good students, and I have others who have tried to bully me this semester, have terrible attitudes, and now the rampant AI use. I'm definitely going to get tanked in my evals, because one student just complained on my Rate My Professor: ""bothered about students leaving early, being on your phone, and is very strict about attendance. It's really annoying because it's not that deep.""  (This is all they care about 🙄) 

I'm a former writing teacher, so I used to do fewer lecture-style classes and more classes on close readings, discussions, in-class work, etc. I switched to lectures because lectures seemed better suited for these intro courses, but I fear that lecture-based courses just fuels this behavior...

I'm wondering if anyone has had success with 1) banning laptops and 2) going back to in-class essays / BlueBook exams? Do you think it would be excessive to ban laptops? Do you have any tips on redoing your assignments because of AI or in-class behavior?"
1gee2oq,1,2024-10-28,Going back to teaching after leaving?,u/AnonymousFrogFiend,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gee2oq/going_back_to_teaching_after_leaving/,"TLDR: I left teaching after 1.5 years due to overwhelming workload and stress from handling all curriculum planning alone in a one-form entry school. Now at 26, with more life experience and tools to manage time better, I miss working with kids and am considering returning to teaching, but teaching A-Level English Lit (AP English Lit). I’m concerned the same challenges might resurface, and I’m seeking advice from others who’ve returned to teaching after leaving. What did you change, and was it better the second time around?
-
I taught primary (elementary) school for 1.5 years, back when I was 22/23 years old. As I’m sure many teachers can relate to, my training didn’t prepare me for the realities of having my own class. The added responsibilities that add up over time, e.g. setting homework, spellings, reading books, marking, the endless paperwork. I also only worked in one form entry schools (one class per grade/year group), so curriculum planning for the whole grade was overwhelming and I felt alone. I crumbled under that stress so I left teaching.

I’m now 26 and feel like I have a bit more life experience behind me. I don’t crumble under pressure as easily and I follow some teachers online who showed some tools to save time, e.g. Teachermatic, ChatGPT (controversial), etc.

I just really miss working with kids and I was wondering if teaching would be different if I taught A-Level English Lit (AP English Lit), where the students actually choose to be in class. But I’m scared that if I go into teaching again, the same issues I had before would resurface.

So I’d love to hear your opinions, fellow teachers! Have any of you gone back to teaching after leaving? Or transitioned from younger to older kids? What was it like?

Thanks in advance for your help and understanding!"

1geo3nm,1,2024-10-29,When will AI certification become a mainstream exam?,u/Dry-Negotiation1376,u_Dry-Negotiation1376,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Dry-Negotiation1376/comments/1geo3nm/when_will_ai_certification_become_a_mainstream/,"https://preview.redd.it/zrfuhp56xmxd1.jpg?width=2121&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d82edd5f7e00d08b32b0761119b112081a74c40

In our understanding, all walks of life in society have their own industry certificates, and I strongly agree! So why does AI, which is currently the most popular, not provide comprehensive certification exams? Or I should say this, the most popular companies in AI now are OpenAI, Google, IBM, Meta, Adobe, Nvidia, Amazon, Alibaba... Why haven't they provided certification for AI positions?

[Source: https:\/\/appinventiv.com\/blog\/ai-trends\/](https://preview.redd.it/a2n6kry8xmxd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2298660f56aa04722f136594b6f95c876a6c24e4)

From a techtarget article, I learned that current global spending on AI (including AI-enabled applications, infrastructure, and related IT and business services) will more than double to $632 billion in 2024-2028 The compound annual growth rate during the forecast period is 29%.

I have always been concerned about the future development of AI, and the most important thing is the employment prospects. A survey was conducted based on 15,000 job postings on [Indeed.com](http://Indeed.com) and found that nearly 80% of artificial intelligence positions require candidates to have a master's degree, while 60% of positions require Have at least a bachelor's degree. Another 18 percent of positions require a doctorate, while only 8 percent consider a high school diploma.

Can't get help from anywhere else :(,u/Puzzled_Image3301,csharp,https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/1geudev/how_do_i_achieve_this_specific_setup_cant_get/,"I'm a student in a very trash university where the programming teacher cannot give any less f\*\*\*s about teaching us anything. She barely showed us how to install VS, having to ask people from the auditory to help her set it up (she's has a doc title in the field btw), then after many people on mac/linux said they don't have access to VS and need to use VS code which is significantly harder to set up for absolute beginners, she said ""Oh, well figure it out and post it in the group chat"". No one did. 

I use ubuntu, because I didn't want to pay for windows and am using it basically like windows. I can get my work done, play games on steam, etc. However, I cannot get VS code to work the way I want it to. Our incredible professor told us to use .net 8, but from what I can see, it auto-defaults to ""implicitusing"" on and ""top level statements"" on, which I don't want cuz I want to see what's actually going on and learn more stuff instead of having to rely on such training wheels. I tried forums, videos, chatgpt, but nothing worked. I have the latest .NET 8 long term support version, as well as VS code. Nothing else, no extensions in vscode, etc. I did have C# dev kit, but I deleted it to start setting up from scratch according to other guides, to no avail.

If anyone can tell me how to do this, or point me to a source that can help me, I'd be eternally grateful. Thank you for your time and effort."

1geyymv,2,2024-10-29,"[TOMT] Stage play, possibly Russian",u/hugolive,tipofmytongue,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/1geyymv/tomt_stage_play_possibly_russian/,"In 2006 I visited China. This was my 2nd time there and I spoke decent Mandarin at the time. I was invited to see a play by someone I met on the train, and feeling adventurous decided to go. The play was entirely in Mandarin but I understood most of it. I have since tried to figure out what the play was called (I failed to note it at the time) but have been unable to.

The plot involves several high school students breaking into their teacher's house to change their scores on their big final exam that will dictate whether/what college they go to. They get caught by the teacher, and it devolves into a hostage situation. It was quite dark, violent and disturbing.

If I recall correctly, it was Russian originally (translated to Mandarin), though I could be wrong about that.

Anyone have any ideas? I asked ChatGPT but it hallucinated a play called ""The Final Exam"" by Alexei Zhitinsky, which doesn't seem to exist.

Thanks in advance."

I’m an undergrad in college. I did 3 semesters right after I graduated high school in 2016, but took a few years off to work and establish myself. I’ve now returned and things feel…different. Students don’t seem to engage in Class at all. Everyone has laptops and isn’t paying attention, browsing other sites. Nobody can stay focused. The lights are just completely off and when they get called on, it’s clear they weren’t tuned in at all. The professors are all either frustrated or demoralized by this. I’m also in several WhatsApp groups for my classes and every student is complaining about the professor, about grades and due dates, and asking how they can use ChatGPT to do their work for them. This is so astonishing to me because it’s different than the class environment I had in 2016/17. 

I’ve also noticed standards are just gone. Every exam, test, or essay must be supplemented by a curve or every student fails. It feels unfair when I spend weeks studying and consuming the material.

1gf8qi7,301,2024-10-29,Chat GPT Helped me Astral Project! Here is the script to try it for yourself:,u/Multidimensional14,AstralProjection,https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/1gf8qi7/chat_gpt_helped_me_astral_project_here_is_the/,"I am so excited! I just used this to Astral Project and it worked in just a few minutes! I included the script from Chat GPT and I also included the shorter version that I used to make it. Then an about me, my experience and Chat GPT’s afterthoughts. I held my phone as I read it for a few minutes ans when I felt like closing my eyes I placed my hand on my heart and put the phone down. I took a few breaths and then shot out of my body!

Below is a script designed to help enhance your ability to astral project. It leverages visualization, mental conditioning, anchoring, and positive affirmations, which can help align your subconscious mind toward achieving this experience.

Script for Astral Projection

Objective: Train the subconscious mind to ease into an astral projection state by reinforcing mental clarity, calm, and intent.

1. Preparation (5-10 minutes)

Find a quiet space, free from distractions.
Sit or lie down in a comfortable position, with your arms and legs uncrossed.
Dim the lights or use an eye mask if needed. You can play calming music or binaural beats (frequencies associated with out-of-body experiences).
Say (or think):

""I am ready to expand my awareness. My body will rest, but my mind will explore.""

2. Relaxation and Grounding Exercise (5 minutes)

Breathe deeply: Inhale through your nose for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, and exhale through your mouth for 6 seconds.

On each exhale, mentally say:
""I release tension. My body is deeply relaxed.""

Mentally scan your body, from your head to your toes, releasing any remaining tension. As you scan, repeat:
""My mind is clear, and my body is still.""

Anchor this state of relaxation: Press your thumb and index finger together, and say:
""This touch reminds me how to remain calm, clear, and ready for exploration.""
(Repeat this touch during your practice to reinforce relaxation.)

3. Visualization to Induce the Astral State (10-15 minutes)

Close your eyes and imagine a golden rope hanging above you. This rope represents your connection to your higher self and the astral plane.

Now, imagine your awareness shifting upward, gently pulling yourself out of your physical body by climbing the golden rope. As you visualize this, say:

About me

I have always been able to lucid dream & astral projection. I usually achieve AP right after I fall asleep. Most recently I have only been able to exit awake a few times last year. Which my goal when I restarted intentionally APing was to be able to do it at will from the awake state. Because it is easier to navigate the experience when you have full clarity and awareness of your regular waking mind. So I have been doing the meditations many times and only had a few awakel to AP experiences for the last few years. 

I use to be able to do it a lot but I lot has changed in my life since then. It has been about 3 years of working towards it. While I have had a great deal of adventures, I still really wanted to be able to meet my goal of being able to intentionally leave awake. I have done MANY guided meditations, binaural beats and a little bit of the Monroe tapes. 

Today I asked Chat GPT to write me a script to astral project. Then I shortened it so I could focus on the prompts and in a few minutes I was soaring straight up at full speed! I will post my note I made when I got back. I open an email and then use speech to text to get down as much as I remember. Then I drew a diagram of the place so I could remember more and possibly go back. I tried to get down everything but there was a lot to take in and I was surprised it worked so fast! This worked the first shot! I hope it will work just as well again! And for you too!  I am so excited!!! Wow! I am ready for more adventures! 


Here is the experience:

I just had a really Cool astral projection Using the script from ChatGPT that I asked for.12:00 noon October 29, 2024 

I was doing the visualization and the phrases that were given to me. I was holding my fingers pressed together around my hands over my heart with my fingers pins together, and then I felt myself shoot straight up out of my body! I thought, oh I should protect myself so nobody can see me. So I quickly imagined a gold light around me. 

When I went up, all I felt was myself going up higher and higher and higher. I could feel the wind on me! I kept my eyes closed and it felt amazing! I felt like I went up several thousands feet!

Before I got started I had set an intention to visit someone. But for whatever reason it didn’t happen. 
Instead I was in this place. If I had to describe it, it’s just strange because it’s like it had a floor, but it didn’t have full walls. There was no ceiling. For some reason it reminded me of a cathedral. It was very large and empty. I didn’t see anyone around me. I did look around and move around the space. 

I decided to set an intention. So I said go somewhere that is important for me to be. Suddenly I felt connected with this teenage girl who was into astral projection as well. She was getting messages. I’m not sure from where, but I felt that it was possibly nefarious as there was a dark energy around her at one point. But it wasn’t coming from her. 

I ended up projecting to a classroom that she was in. It  didn’t feel so much as a classroom as a prison. But I sometimes think of schools as prisons. But to be clear it was a classroom. The seats were arranged in different directions all facing the teacher’s desk. The teacher was early 50’s tall, skinny and seemed very stressed and strick. With some of the kids in the room I am not surprised. There was a tense feeling there. There was some gang related activity from a few of the students that were bullying and controlling other students. The students seemed to be at least 16, possibly 17.

It was the girl who I was focused on at first & she had received a message from someone telling her to go to the train station in New York. This person visited from the astral. They told her to go there and that something when she got there would be there behind her. I don’t remember the rest of what she was told.

She wanted to go there. She wasn’t sure if she should just leave class to do it or not, but she did want to leave to go do it. The boy in front of her wrote something down on a note and handed it to her
When she had been given the note from the boy in front of her the teacher saw this.  

Between that time. I also was pulled over to a girl that was sitting in a chair, minding her own business. She was kind of dazed off. Then this bigger girl that was standing against the back wall, she saw this seemingly nice girl (who was dazed) and the girl who was sitting behind her said or did something, and the girl I guess didn’t respond to their liking so the bully girl that was standing against the wall in the back of the class came over to her to intimidate her. I was standing near them trying to offer protection to the dazed girl. 

Meanwhile, I was then pulled over to this boy on the other side of the room. This is when the room became less clear like if you lowered the brightness over a photo. It was greyed out. I was in a standing through a chair & desk right next to him about 3 feet away. I think he was psychic because he somehow saw me and I started to talk to him. He was the one person that could see me. He said I have to tell you something. He said that when I appeared beside him at first, he saw a mandala appear, then me. He thought it was really cool which I also thought was really cool as well. 

I said “Oh really wow that’s cool! I said I can see you but everything is foggy right now. It’s grayed out now. Sometimes I can see clearly other times it’s it’s hard to see.” I said, “Maybe you could give that girl over there my email address or something so that she can contact me if she wants.” I told him that she was thinking of going to New York to the train station there. I told him “I’m from —— where are you from?” and he said “Texas” then the teacher asked for the girl to bring the note up to class. Everyone focused on her. The boy in the seat in front of her was trying to protect her and him. She said I would really appreciate it if we could discuss this after class and the boy in front of her agreed and also asked if they could continue it after class. I think the teacher had agreed but that’s when I came back to my body.

I tried to go back for a second, but since I couldn’t I decided to write all this down while I remember it well. So I think I was there in the classroom in Texas mainly it felt it was for that first girl, but then I was drawn to help the second girl and then I met the young man who was the only one who could see me. I don’t know if he was talking out loud to me or not. He looked at the boy behind us a few times. I think to see if he could also see me but that person didn’t see me. Very cool! I didn’t give him my email as we didn’t get to finish our conversation. But maybe I will go back there again soon!

Then I went back to Chat GPT to tell it that it worked and it gave me more advice.



Chat GPT: Here are a few thoughts and suggestions based on your experience:  

1. Visual Clarity and Perception Shifts It’s normal to experience foggy or fluctuating vision during an astral projection, especially when shifting between realms or focusing on different people or places. Suggestion: Next time, try affirming clarity by saying, ""I see everything clearly and as it is meant to be revealed to me."" This might help stabilize your visuals. 

2. Protective Energy Work Your instinct to surround yourself with gold light was spot-on. Gold is often used as a protective energy in spiritual practices. It’s a great habit to start with protection, especially when interacting with unfamiliar people or energies. Suggestion: Before each projection, reinforce your protection with intent, ""I travel in light and am protected by higher energy. No harmful energy can touch me."" 

3. Reentry and Continuity in Journeys It’s common to be pulled back to your body and feel the urge to return. Write things down—documenting it fresh keeps the details intact. Suggestion: If you're interrupted mid-journey, you can use a mantra like: ""I will return to this experience whenever I choose."" This can help you reconnect later, either within the same night or in future sessions. 

4. Expanding Control Over Intent Over time, your ability to navigate intentionally will grow. You can try practicing by visualizing a destination more vividly before starting the projection—like a familiar place or symbolic location—then affirming: ""I travel to [location]. My intent guides my path."" "
1gf9c6d,1,2024-10-29,Exploring the Use of Generative AI for Educators: A Game-Changer or Just a Buzzword?,u/ArshadYousufzai,GenAIForEducators,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenAIForEducators/comments/1gf9c6d/exploring_the_use_of_generative_ai_for_educators/,"I have always been curious about the use of AI in education, and as an educator and researcher exploring the evolving role of technology in education, I’ve recently been into the concept of **Generative AI for Educators**. With AI tools becoming more accessible, there's been a surge in interest around how generative AI might be used to support educators, especially in K-12 settings. But is this a game-changer or just another tech trend?

# What is Generative AI for Educators?

Generative AI refers to AI systems that can generate new content—from text and images to videos and code—based on prompts given by users. In an educational context, generative AI has the potential to create customized learning materials, support language translation, suggest lesson ideas, and even provide personalized feedback for students.

# Current Uses in Classrooms

While still in the early stages, some schools have started experimenting with tools like ChatGPT, DALL-E, and other generative AI platforms. For instance, a few pioneering teachers have used generative AI to:

* **Generate lesson plans** that align with state or national standards.
* **Create interactive and engaging content**, like story-based math problems or science experiment simulations.
* **Offer personalized feedback** on students’ written work, helping students iterate on their projects with AI-driven suggestions.
* **Translate materials** for multilingual classrooms to accommodate students from diverse backgrounds.

# Potential Benefits for Teachers

1. **Efficiency**: Generative AI can save teachers time on repetitive tasks like grading, creating differentiated content, and generating lesson plans.
2. **Personalized Learning**: AI can cater to students’ learning paces and styles, offering materials tailored to their unique needs.
3. **Enhanced Creativity**: It helps teachers brainstorm ideas and design creative projects they may not have considered without AI input.
4. **Increased Accessibility**: AI-generated content can be designed to meet the needs of students with disabilities, providing them with accessible materials like simplified text, audio support, or alternate visuals.

# Challenges and Concerns

However, the application of generative AI isn’t without its downsides. Some issues teachers and researchers are keeping an eye on include:

* **Data Privacy**: Schools must handle data responsibly, especially with AI tools that require student information to provide personalized feedback.
* **Bias in Content**: AI is only as good as the data it’s trained on, and generative AI can sometimes produce biased or inaccurate content.
* **Dependency on Technology**: Over-reliance on AI tools might hinder critical teaching skills and may lead to a loss of personal touch in education.
* **Cost and Training**: Not every school has the budget for these tools, and training teachers to use them effectively can be challenging.

# Is It Worth the Hype?

Generative AI is promising, and as more educators begin to experiment with it, we’re likely to see innovative approaches that could redefine teaching and learning. However, it’s essential to balance excitement with caution. Not every AI tool is a fit for every classroom, and educators need time and resources to explore these tools thoughtfully.

For those of you who have tried generative AI in your classrooms, what have your experiences been like? Are the benefits worth the challenges? Let's discuss it!"
1gfc5cs,17,2024-10-29,Are there any resources/tools to help decode an 1840s US university student's essay?,u/withcc6,AskHistorians,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1gfc5cs/are_there_any_resourcestools_to_help_decode_an/,"Hello! I haven't posted here before, so I apologize if this isn't the right place for my query. I'm in the process of trying to transcribe thirteen handwritten pages by my great great great grandfather during his senior year at University of North Carolina in 1842. I didn't know much of anything about this ancestor, but just learned he was valedictorian of his class and somehow stumbled upon essays he wrote in the college Dialectic Society, one of which is arguing the negative POV for “Should the U.S. declare war against G.B. for outrages committed upon their rights and privileges?""

I am so fascinated to see what a young person in the 1840s thought about this as an American living in the UK now and extremely interested in the Ango-American relationship, and from what I have been able to get from it, it's beautifully written and very intriguing... but while it's a pretty high resolution scan, I am truly struggling to decipher the text. I tried just working slowly through it, but I am barely making progress because the cursive style from the time is different enough from today, his handwriting was sloppy and faint in parts (I can't even imagine how my hand would ache if I sat and scrawled that many pages), and even if it were modern cursive, I just don't have much experience reading any cursive other than my mother's.

I considered using the help of AI, but I can't afford to pay much for a tool and am especially hesitant to do so if I don't know how well it will work. ChatGPT did a better job than I expected, but I could only do one page at a time and it certainly didn't get everything right; at the end of the day, the things that it didn't get tend to be the things that are stumping me too. I tried comparing to other parts of the text to get a sense of his handwriting, but he's not totally consistent. It's frustrating to imagine spending 24 hours on this and still having many patches I'm uncertain about, esp. when it's probably something that should be simple to someone with a little bit of skill. So, I'm wondering if there are any resources that I'm missing. An AI tool that's optimized for handwriting of that time period? A good primer with some ground rules/tips & tricks? Any guidance would be very valuable to me.

tl;dr

I am struggling and don't know how to move forward to read a 13 page handwritten document from a US university student in 1842. It's for my own pleasure and curiosity so certainly not urgent, but I am eager to proceed and would love any advice/resources/tools that someone who deals with this might be able to share. Thank you!"

For the past few years, I’ve been teaching Digitalization sa mga small business owners through the DTI Go Negosyo Program, integrating AI into my presentations—kahit it's not part of the core curriculum. LOL.  I believe kasi that building digital and AI skills is essential in today’s world, especially for students, employees, and freelancers who want to stay ahead in the job market. 

Lagi lagi ako inaask sa socmed or sa DTI, madalas I often have questions like:

* *Pag nag AI ba, magiging rreplaceable ba ako sa work?*
* *How can beginners approach AI if walang technical background?*
* *Yung AI....chatgpt lang ba?*
* *Paano kumita ng pera using AI?*

For context (baka akala scammer ako.. haha) I’m also part of Google’s AI Startup for Vertex AI and have developed AI tools to support industries like tourism especially one that will be launched for our barangays. hehe. Ayun, there’s a lot more to AI than just ChatGPT; AI skills and digital know-how will soon be vital in almost every industry. And next year we will see a crazy tech evolution that for sure will trigger a lot of concerns (insider #maritess news).

**Anyway, why am I offering this for free?** Hmm... maybe because there is not many Filipinos sharing their AI knowledge.... puro chatgpt lang. HAHA..Maybe because there is so much work opportunities for us Pinoys? Maybe because one of you guys will create an AI tool that can help our agri sector? I dunno.. but I am 100%, if we don't adapt we will be left behind or worse... get replaced. 

Kaya to those interested mag level up using AI, I made a google form para I can send an invite for zoom. 100 peeps kaya ng zoom ko.. so First come, First served if may interested.   
  
I will do my best to answer your questions.  Thanks everyone! 

PS.. HINDi po ako mag sell ng course po. lol

I am a final year computer science student. I have less than a year of college left and hardly any skills up my sleeve. I have done like about a 300 dsa questions across different platforms. But the problem with me is that I jump to solutions too quickly leaving me with just the ability to solve newbie questions. I tried web development but left it only after making a couple baby projects. I tried learning firebase from netninja. I tried doing projects from lamadev etc but because the videos are old I get caught up on dependency errors.I tried doing ML from Statquest and TechwithTim but I don't make tangible progress enough with anything at least enough to create something of my own. I even tried to do things in reverse like first signing up for hackathons and applying for internships. But for hackathons I get good ideas that I'm totally unable to materialise. I remember  for one hackathon I thought of making a chatbot, integrating gemini was compulsory in it. Couldn't do even that. For internships I either don't get shortlisted at all or I am not able to complete the assignment. One thing I'd realised during my degree was that I was good at teaching and explaining and I put twice as much effort when I have to do things for others. So I brought an iPad(with a heavy heart) to learn and explain things and upload videos on YouTube. My first video was 19 min long and Youtube only allowed 15 min long videos. This happened like 10 days back. My cgpa is 7.74/10 and my college is pretty decent. Coming to the point, I am embarrassed about my lack of skills and my typing speed🥲. Advice needed! Lots!!"
1gfnio3,1,2024-10-30,Originality AI Update: StealthGPT Still Bypasses Originality,u/gptgabe,stealthgpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stealthgpt/comments/1gfnio3/originality_ai_update_stealthgpt_still_bypasses/,"check out the full post here: [https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/originality-ai-update-stealthgpt-still-bypasses-originality](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/originality-ai-update-stealthgpt-still-bypasses-originality)

Of all the AI Detectors StealthGPT has bested throughout its storied history of wins, Originality is a standout among them. Known as the 2nd most deadly detector in the game, only after Turnitin, we don’t take the task of bypassing Originality as lightly as we may take, oh I don’t know, [DetectGPT](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/how-to-bypass-detectgpt-s-ai-detector).

Still, we’ve beaten them before and we shall beat them again. Simply put, [StealthGPT has Originality’s number](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/originality-ai-s-content-detector-case-study-stealthgpt-is-confidently-seen-as-human). Every time they update, we’re always one step ahead. To show you precisely how we defeat Originality AI, I’m going to run some beautiful AI-generated content from ChatGPT through their AI Detection tool, then I’m gonna run StealthGPT’s undetectable AI content and we’re gonna compare the results.

Users of StealthGPT know Originality will lose. Users of Originality need to learn their lesson the hard way.

# What is an AI Detector?

Before we execute, lets educate! For those of you new to the undetectable AI space, our software was created to make content that no AI Detector could possibly flag so you can create content safely and without punishment.

When ChatGPT was creating content in a vacuum, without AI detectors to rain on an AI writer’s parade, there was no way of comprehensively concluding that any piece of text was AI-written text. These days, that’s still not completely the case, you can’t ever be 100% sure that any writing is AI but when it comes to ChatGPT, most AI Detectors have no trouble analyzing ChatGPT’s output and declaring that it comes from an AI writing tool.

So, how does AI content detection work exactly? By knowing the watermarks of a large language model’s writing style, you can pinpoint the presence of AI writing on the sentence level. Artificial intelligence is programmed to write for utility and precision, meaning it uses simple, precise word choice, sentence structure, and sentence length. AI checkers simply measure for the perplexity and burstiness of a piece of text and from those metrics determine its source.

# What is Undetectable AI?

To bypass AI Detection so you can actually use AI-written content in academics or professionally, undetectable AI tools were developed to make AI text to feel like human writing and beat AI detection systems.

Among the many undetectable AI services, no software is stronger than StealthGPT.AI at generating high-quality humanized text with its Stealthwriter tool and its AI humanizer tool. StealthGPT has proven it can bypass Turnitin, bypass Originality.AI, bypass GPTZero, Content at Scale and more frequently and comprehensively than the competition.

Just as AI-generated text from ChatGPT has certain watermarks that can be picked up by AI content detectors, the way StealthGPT humanizes its text is simply by flipping those watermarks on their head. It makes text human-feeling by making it more complex and random in its word choice and sentence structure and in doing so, the text can bypass AI Detectors and beat Turnitin or [Originality.AI](http://Originality.AI), all while increasing the text’s readability and quality.

Furthermore, undetectable AI services like StealthGPT offer much more capability than beating popular AI detectors. StealthGPT works for all sorts of purposes, from inserting essay citations to ensure your work isn’t flagged by plagiarism checkers, to chatting with pdfs, SEO writing, and more.

# Testing Originality AI Against ChatGPT

Now that you know the players, lets begin our game. OpenAI just released two new models of ChatGPT, so I’m going to run the new o1-preview against [Originality.AI](http://Originality.AI) to see who prevails. Here is our essay from ChatGPT about ninjas and samurais:

Now, lets paste this into Originality's content scanner and see what it finds:

As I suspected, Originality.AI was able to detect the text was 100% AI generated. ChatGPT should never be used to generate essays you intend to directly hand in because whether it’s against Originality.AI, Turnitin AI, or any detector, chances are you’ll get [caught and punished severely for academic misconduct](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/professor-catches-students-plagiarizing-with-ai).

# Testing Originality AI Against StealthGPT

I want to show you the power of each of StealthGPT’s tools, it’s AI humanizer and it’s Stealthwriter. First, the humanizer. Simply paste ChatGPT’s output into the bypass tool and in moments you’ll get humanized text as you can see below:

Now let’s input that text into Originality AI’s content detector and see if we can ninja past their radar.

With a 98% human score, Originality AI determined StealthGPT’s AI humanizer’s content was likely original content.

With the AI humanizer proven to be as sharp as ever, lets rev up the Stealthwriter to give us a ninja/samurai essay from scratch and compare the results.

First, here's our essay:

Now, lets input that Stealthwriter essay into Originality:

With an even better score, Stealthwriter has slashed through Originality’s defenses to bypass their detection system with a 100% originality score. Meaning it was found to be likely human and likely original.

If you want to pursue AI content creation without fear of consequences, only StealthGPT can guarantee your safety.

# Conclusion

No AI Detector is safe from StealthGPT. Stealth AI is simply too powerful for the likes of Turnitin, Originality, Copyleaks, GPTZero, Content at Scale, Quillbot, Winston AI, or any Detector you can name.

For content creation, no other undetectable AI software has more functionality and can generate higher quality, human-like content. We understand human writing, its style, flow, rhythm and randomness better than other AI chatbots. With dynamic writing style in StealthGPT’s machine learning, our AI becomes a better English scholar with every undetectable essay it generates.

Join the undetectable revolution and take a peek at StealthGPT’s unparalleled [pricing](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/pricing?gc_id=21642348684&h_ga_id=167425671355&h_ad_id=711633826239&h_keyword_id=kwd-2329555557021&h_keyword=stealthgpt%20pricing&h_placement=&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwu-63BhC9ARIsAMMTLXQTJL4adZxJ6D9FtvzAzQYE7lrxIBjL_DARN9o_H4oc9pokWxTlLjgaAp-FEALw_wcB) plans. Our free trial allows for unlimited words so once you take it for a spin and see how StealthGPT elevates your content creation and academic writing, you’ll want to make it a constant fixture in your process.

# FAQ

# Does StealthGPT bypass Turnitin?

Absolutely. As important as it is to be functional against Originality AI, if StealthGPT couldn’t bypass Turnitin AI, then it wouldn’t truly be undetectable.

[StealthGPT has always beaten Turnitin](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/bypassing-ai-detectors-stealthgpt), no matter how often they update, they simply can’t compete against us. And since Turnitin is integrated into [Canvas](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/what-is-canvas), the most popular online student submission portal, if you plan on using AI writing for academic work, you’ll need StealthGPT to be able to bypass anything.

# Is Using AI For School Plagiarism?

Using AI to ghostwrite your essay is considered “AI plagiarism” and academic misconduct. It is not however, traditional plagiarism. Traditional plagiarism is the stealing of words or ideas without proper credit. When you use AI to generate your essay, you’re creating original content, not stealing someone else’s.

Many schools are changing their policies and implementing [more progressive codes of AI ethics](https://teaching.cornell.edu/generative-artificial-intelligence/ethical-ai-teaching-and-learning) in accordance with the changes in how people use the technology. It is safe to assume that the use of AI for school work will have a changing stance as the technology reshapes academia as we know it.

# Do AI Detectors Work?

You’ve seen for yourself how poorly Originality AI fared against StealthGPT. Given most students have wised up to undetectable AI when it comes to submitting work, can it really be said these detectors even work? The answer is no.

Even [MIT declared AI Detectors don’t work](https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/teach/ai-detectors-dont-work/) given that Turnitin has a 4% false positive rate at the sentence level and that many detectors show bias against non-native English speaking students. They’re a flawed technology implemented by an institution that has run out of options. Academia can either change or die, and it’ll do everything it can to avoid changing."

1gfqrb4,1,2024-10-30,"""ChatGPT's Impact on Virtual Learning and Corporate Training: Effectiveness Explored""",u/cporter202,ChatGPTautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTautomation/comments/1gfqrb4/chatgpts_impact_on_virtual_learning_and_corporate/,"As the landscape of education and professional development continues to evolve, one of the most intriguing developments has been the integration of AI-driven platforms like ChatGPT into virtual learning and corporate training modules. The key question that this raises is: How effective is ChatGPT in enhancing the learning experience and outcomes for students and employees?

ChatGPT, created by OpenAI, is a sophisticated language processing AI that can understand and generate human-like text. Its capabilities allow it to engage with users in a conversational manner, which could revolutionize the way we approach education and training. From personalized learning paths to interactive Q&A sessions, ChatGPT seems poised to offer a range of benefits.

In the realm of virtual learning, ChatGPT can provide instant feedback, answer questions at any hour, and even help students struggling with complex concepts by breaking them down into simpler terms. The idea is that this could lead to a more inclusive and customized learning environment that caters to individual needs.

Corporate training, on the other hand, can be significantly streamlined with ChatGPT's assistance. It can simulate various business scenarios, facilitate skill development, and serve as an on-demand mentor for employees. This accessibility and responsiveness could potentially increase employee engagement with training materials, leading to better retention of information and improved performance on the job.

However, some skeptics question whether a machine can ever truly replace the nuanced guidance of human instructors or the collaborative learning that happens between peers. There's also the concern about integrating this technology responsibly and ethically within existing educational frameworks.

So, where do we stand with ChatGPT as a tool for learning and development? Have you had any experiences with it in your virtual classrooms or corporate training sessions? Let's discuss the practical implications, the benefits we've seen, and the hurdles that we need to overcome for ChatGPT to effectively enhance our educational and professional landscapes."

There is a lot to unpack in this series and I do have a lot of thoughts about it, so I’m just going to dive right in and lets go through the door of the Chinese series [The Spirealm](https://mydramalist.com/681049-death-kaleidoscope) (2024).

[Kaleidoscope of Death \(2018\)                                             The Spirealm \(2024\)](https://preview.redd.it/i2gl8fxvsxxd1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4e181aadc334853f34c27b9ac46891f79f94ca75)

My spoiler free rec; **I recommend both BUT go in with the understanding that the novel is a horror first, BL second, and the series is a ‘censored adaptation’.** If you are a seasoned horror hound, I’m sure you’ll enjoy it, but for those who are not so much into the genre, this maybe a pass for you, as it is very graphic. Because of this I’m going to come at this series a little differently than in my prior installments, I’m going to lean harder into the horror analysis then on the BL side (I do love horror as much as I love a BL). 

*Kaleidoscope of Death (*2018) is a rather lengthy danmei novel written by Xi Zixu, 139 chapters, plus 10 extras (about 1086 pages). The main protagonist in novel is Lin Qiushi, the majority of the narrative is from his perspective. Our other main character is Ruan Nanzhu, the beautiful, rather mysterious love interest. There is no explicit BL content in the novel, but there are kisses and cuddles. It is very much a slow burn, they don’t get together until Chapter 105, but once they are together the relationship is very sweet, and co-dependent (one of my personal favorite tropes). 

By contrast the horror in the novel is very graphic some trigger warnings include; mutilation, cannibalism, child death, abortion, suicide, mental health issues, murder, violence, intrusive thoughts, body horror etc. to be honest it was one of gorey horror novels I’ve read in recent memory, kudos to the author for not holding back. 

So what exactly is this story about? 

The plot centers around a series of doors, 12 of them to be exact. Participants are drawn into the doors, once inside they find themselves in what would be described as a horror survival game. They must figure out the game, find the key and the door in order to leave again. If they die within the door world they die in the real world when the game ends. Each door they pass through gets progressively harder, and the puzzle more difficult to solve. Only those who are already near death or dying are drawn into the doors, winning and surviving the doors actually extends the life of the person. Those who find and open the door first get a clue to their next door, a highly sought after prize. 

We start the novel with Lin Qiushi’s first door, where he meets a gorgeous women (yes you read that right) Ruan Baijie. I too was rather confused throughout the arc of the first door wondering if perhaps I was reading the wrong book, but once we get through the first door we learn that Ruan Baijie is actually Ruan Nanzhu, the beautiful, powerful, leader of an organization called Obsidian with the hobby of crossdressing (this comes up frequently in the novel). 

Lin Qiushi, is hands down one of my favorite horror protagonists, the man is completely unbothered. He is the definition of unphased, he accepts things as they come, he dosen’t overly stress, and he’s not interested in asking a lot of questions. He takes everything at face value, and very quickly implicitly trusts Ruan Nanzhu. It was nice to skip over the traditional emotional turmoil characters find themselves having in a horror novel and get right to acceptance. He’s also a total cat dad and I love that Chesnut is a good boy.  So when Nanzhu shows up and invites him to join, it really isn’t that hard to sway him to do so, and so begins Qiushi’s journey through the doors. 

I’m going to hop over to the series now, and run a compare and contrast, as the series *Spirealm* (2024) is also rather lengthy; when it aired, it was 78, 20 minute episodes, and was taken down within two hours. It has since been amalgamated into 38, 40 minute episodes and re-released. The series stars, Xia Zhi Guang as Ruan Lan Zhu (Nanzhu), and Huang Jun Jie as Ling Jiu Shi (Qiushi). For ease of understanding and writing I will be referring to the characters names as they are translated in the novel. 

Prior to even starting the series I knew there were going to be changes, as per the Chinese film censorship laws, this is a ‘bromance’ not a BL (tragic), which also meant the crossdressing was never going to make it into the adaptation, despite being a rather large plot point in the novel. The other part of the censorship is the horror aspect, Chinese horror is comparatively very mild. So this series is really an amalgamation of the two most heavily censored genres, but I will give credit the series, wasn’t as watered down as I had feared, it had a few solid little horror moments (and the didn’t fuzz the mild gore like Korea does) but they did very much tame down the doors as expected. 

In the series the doors are a virtual reality game ‘Spi Realm’, and playing the game draws you into the world of the doors. They lay the groundwork for our hero Qiushi, as a game designer and eventually an architect of the doors. Part of the censorship in horror series is not to base things in the supernatural, there needs to be reasoning and rationale for events, and the easiest way is to make it a ‘game’ Cdramas and esports are a popular genre. In the novel, as I mentioned, only people who are dying or near death can gain access to the doors. The reason for continuing to go through them aside from not dying, it gives the player the opportunity to extend their life. Qiushi has at the start of the novel stage 4 liver cancer, an ongoing issue. The novel really explains why the doors exist, there is an overarching theme of eldritch horror, inexplicable and incomprehensible. 

Both the series and novel note the organizations that use the doors as a business of sorts, Nanzhu is head of Obsidian, where people pay them to help them pass the doors. Nanzhu as well as his alter ego Baijie are well regarded in the community, and in both mediums they only assist paying customers up until door 5. They refuse to help 6 and up, due to the difficulty level. The organization White Deer also exists, but that is the only other one mentioned. The entire plotline in the series with the evil organization they are battling against doesn't exist. Something of note as well, in the novel your appearance changes within the door depending on how you look going in you can push looks one way or another. 

Point of clarification, in the novel, they number doors based on Quishi entering them not the actual door number. For example the second door Quishi enters is Fitcher’s Bird, but it technically numbered as door 3 in his 12 door series (stay with me it gets a little confusing). In the novel you can jump ahead doors if you tag along with someone who is entering an advanced door, for example jump 2 to 4. The more advanced the door, the longer it takes for your next door to come, the wait between 10 and 11 can be a year or more for example. However you can backtrack and do lower number doors to ‘level up’ so to speak, or get props that may help you in other doors. In the series they assign designations to the doors, but this is not the case in the novel. 

The first and second door in the novel Nanzhu enters as a women, and the second door like the series is *Fitcher’s Bird,* which is one of Grimm’s fairy tales (if you’re curious about the original source material you can read the original [here](https://sites.pitt.edu/~dash/grimm046.html)) in both cases within the door the story is changed, it’s not nearly as dark and instead of just trying to escape the horrors, the NPC’s within the doors are on more a redemption arc, but that goes back to the censorship. The second door was where the female character Tan Zaozao is introduced, they kept her backstory of an actress true to the source material as well. The door is very dark, cannibalism comes into play in this one. 



[Fletcher's Bird is the door, and the kept it in the series but added the weird  temporal time thing. ](https://preview.redd.it/b18tv6w11xxd1.png?width=2874&format=png&auto=webp&s=b665183bf2a08f2c1ced7df314d1be8ca8bb4ac9)

Third door in novel, as with the series is [Sister Drum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjfaohC62iM), this is an actual song if you’re curious. I was pleased they kept her peeling off the skin. In the novel, Nanzhu goes in again as a woman in this door, where they first encounter the leader of White Deer, Li Dongyuan played in the series by Liu Xiao Bei. Dongyuan plays a far bigger role in the series than the novel, there is actually far more brotherly affection between the three of them than ever in the novel. They did keep however Dongyuan’s crush on Nanzhu who he knows as Zhu Meng, with the allusion the crossdressing in the novel via photo instead of having met her in the door. 

[This had a few good horror moments, the CGI wasn't ideal, but better then I thought. ](https://preview.redd.it/bprk71491xxd1.png?width=2877&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f060c1a383536a8f8d1e17c5356966c3564e4a1)

In the novel, the fourth door, [Women in The Rain](https://theghostinmymachine.com/2021/11/15/encyclopaedia-of-the-impossible-the-rain-woman-cursed-painting/), is actually a cursed painting if you’d like to know a little more about it. In the novel like in the series Nanzhu, Quishi and Zaozao all go through, but in the novel at this point Nanzhu dosen’t crossdress he goes in as a man, at this time in the novel our often times oblivious narrator is still sorting out his feelings towards Nanzhu, and is trying to decide if it matters whether he is dressed as a women or not. The series kept the three of them sleeping in the same room, which was good, Nanzhu refuses to sleep with anyone but Quishi, they tend to sleep together when they’re in doors together. The door actually dosen’t happen until later in the series.

[This happens much later in the series, and is an amalgamation of a couple other doors.](https://preview.redd.it/rany28fh1xxd1.png?width=2859&format=png&auto=webp&s=364124f3337cfc1f63a8593de1680500390e497f)

The next door in the novel, and the third door in the series is, [Satchan](http://tokyoscum.blogspot.com/2012/09/creepy-kids-songs-part-3-satchan.html), follows loosely the Japanese urban legend. Quishi and Nanzhu go in with Dongyuan, except different from the series Nanzhu is dressed as a women in this door so the overtop attention from Dongyan makes more sense, and of course in the novel Nanzhu is fawning all over Quishi, so the rivalry is also included. Zaozao is not in the door in the novel, there is another woman who's into Dongyan so basically competes throughout this door for his affection. The door plays out similar to the series, they did keep the legs getting ripped off. 

[This door felt like a genuine horror door.](https://preview.redd.it/3otfvyap1xxd1.png?width=2878&format=png&auto=webp&s=b44cab1819aaafc6c4a0fbf98359af5763365002)

Following this door in the novel, ZaoZao tries to get Nanzhu to help her director friend, but like in the series the actor/director turns down the help and goes to White Deer and it goes poorly like in the series, and Nanzhu introduces him to someone else. In the novel it’s a man, and the two end up a couple, the series of course turns this character into a woman (of course) we don't really see too much of them they pop in and out occasionally. 

Quishi’s sixth door in the novel isn’t in the series at all, which is a shame because the door is based on the [Slenderman](https://theslenderman.fandom.com/wiki/Slender_Man) creepypasta (personal fav of mine I’m a *Marble Hornets* (2009) fan from back in the day) I’m assuming they needed to cut this one because the copyright would be a headache to get, as well in this door we flip the script Quishi is the one crossdressing and Nanzhu goes in as a man. Quishi also pretends to be mute because he can’t pitch his voice. It’s a weird lore they go with in this one, as you wear the hat you become Slenderman, but they do go with the missing and murdered children. 

The next door they enter in the novel, designated the seventh door (5th in the serial) is [Waverly Hills Sanatorium](https://www.americanhauntingsink.com/waverlytb) very famous paranormal hot spot in the US, I have  watched many ghost hunting series there (my favorite is Ryan and Shane if you want to watch them [visit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXhLlWQtdt0)). In the novel version of this door, both Nanzhu and Quishi are crossdressing as women, and the baby they find in the office is a real one…not a doll, and it is explicityly stated it's an aborted fetus. I am pleasantly surprised they kept the nurse that keeps jumping from the roof and repeating it over and over. The Death Tunnel was to move medical supplies, it was to transport the dead, as the Sanatorium was actually built for tuberculosis patients before they developed the cure or fully understood the disease. 

[What could have been with this one...all the elements where there. ](https://preview.redd.it/m8rych432xxd1.png?width=2869&format=png&auto=webp&s=684c49c95a8e89cdd0db93aa93f6edeea9480aba)

The book and the series did keep in the Obsidian member who succumbs to the doors, he bites Quishi (in the novel Nanzhu bites the same place to disinfect) but it’s done to show that the doors have a toll on the mental health of the participant and to sort of highlight how unusual Quizhi is that he is able to compartmentalize and move forward unaffected and in control. Also allusions to the end game. 

Quishi’s eighth door, is a skip ahead as he is planning to enter with Cheng Yixie. Cheng Yixie and Cheng Qianli are twins, both played by Liu Ruo Gu in the series. They do feature prominently in both series and novel, Qianli is sort of the carefree twin, scaredy cat that relies on his twin Yixie. Throughout the novel Qianli spends a lot of time with Quishi, they do a few of the doors together, while his twin Yixie operates in the background. Qianli also spends a lot of time cuddling his corgi Toast. This door isn’t in the series either, but it’s sort of mashed together with the Women in the Rain (mentioned above). Nanzhu is in drag for this one again, it takes place in a high rise full of mirrors. The answer to this door has Quishi having to go through the mirror world to get the key amongst a bunch of keys, the series puts this in the painting instead. They also make a deal with a couple (brother and sister in the novel) the sister is already dead but helps her twin brother in the doors. The series makes them a couple working for the shady X organization. 

The outcome of the door has both Nanzhu and Quishi badly hurt, and Dongyuan makes one last appearance. In the series, Dongyuan sacrifices himself saving Quishi, before they say their final farewell in the real world. In the novel he dies off screen, it’s a call they get a new leader take over and that's sort of that. 

[Love how they kept Quishi feeding Nanzhu in the series ](https://preview.redd.it/yvrle89u2xxd1.png?width=2127&format=png&auto=webp&s=e53e4f160c3a9955fedb66dce06d49e27a67db50)

At this point we’re just a little over halfway through the novel, and Quishi decides that he’s going to start helping others through the door. He finds through the door forums a high school student looking for someone to help her through the doors and agrees to help her through her fourth door. In the novel he ends up meeting Gu Longming, who is not a sixteen year old girl, but an adult man who is, you guessed it, crossdressing. 

Described as a muscley adult male in a miniskirt. In the series, this character is cut, but they do replace the mysterious person with Quishi’s best friend Wu Qi. Who does complete a door with him, the same door the novel has him complete with Longming. Nanzhu does not participate in this door in the novel. This is the door with the lamps and the landlady, but in the novel they are made from rendered people, and they don’t have the big info dump from the kid NPC to Quishi, but I do really like Longming, he is a whole vibe of a character in the novel. It’s a shame they cut him. To be honest this story is confusing, I’m unsure if it’s based off an actual urban legend or just one conceived by the author. I do think they pulled in elements from the Slenderman chapter (the kids being taken) as this story was just about the lanterns in the text. 

[This door felt the messiest out of all the doors, they did too much.](https://preview.redd.it/hys5ehbc3xxd1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=165ac5468791ba62ee943a96033ab0376dd5c6ab)

After this door we get Wu Qi’s storyline in the novel, the series gives him a much larger role, but it’s pretty small, and rather tragic in the novel. Wu Qi, distraught, shows up at the house that his girlfriend is dead. She was, of course, participating in the doors, her door was stolen (meaning someone followed her in and killed her) and he watched her jump out sixteen floors. Wu Qi ends up unaliving himself soon after, it’s sort of an accident as someone had told him how the doors work and he was trying to get in so he could get revenge. 

Quishi decides he’s going to get revenge for his friend and they set of a sting operation of sorts, both he and Nanzhu go undercover as a couple (Nanzhu in drag of course), this door is in the series it’s the Japanese based door with the teru teru bozu. It’s based on[ Kagome Kagome,](https://japan-makes-me-scared.com/kagome-kagome/) a children’s game/song. In the novel they get their revenge on the person that stole the door and tricked Wu Qi. In the series, this door is still a revenge door, but it’s revenge for Li Dongyuan instead. They also folded in the couple that ends of dying for eachother that is part of the Oni door later on.

[The visuals on this door where awesome](https://preview.redd.it/3u8x8zdpixxd1.png?width=2829&format=png&auto=webp&s=b02e547da99e17666c9d4b9badda44d2c5038332)

I am happy they kept the umbrella in the rain sequence, absolutely iconic. 

Following this door we get Quishi and Nanzhu attending Zao Zao’s movie premiere, in the series it’s the awards ceremony they attend, but that doesn't happen until later in the novel. They found out at the movie premier that Zaozao’s director friend and the guy Nanzhu set up to help him are in a relationship, they catch them making out in a dark hallway. At this point in the novel our narrator is having the ‘do I actually love him?’ crisis. Nanzhu also brings in another female character Rujiao, the successor to White Deer, she’s the one who got revenge for Dongyuan. She comes to work with Obsidian for a while (it’ll come back later) the filler section ends with Quishi doing another door with Longming. 

This door isn’t in the series, it’s a fun gory one that centers around a college campus and I believe it’s loosely based on the Greek myth of[ Pygmalion](https://www.greeka.com/greece-myths/pygmalion-galatea/). This door is pretty funny, the pair of them keep running around with an NPC in the door. Longming literally picks this guy up and throws him over his shoulder carrying him around a lot in the door. It’s a pretty quick door, and they make it through relatively easy. 

The next section is Nahzhu ignoring Quishi, and our narrator is irritated with him. He wants to talk with him but Nanzhu is actively avoiding him. This is when we get the Zaozao’s award show. In the novel Quishi attends alone, and Zaozao dies on stage in a rather spectacularly gory fashion. In the series both Quishi and Nanzhu are attending and Zaozao dies after she gets her award instead of on stage, but both in series and in novel this is the catalyst for their relationship, in the series this is Quishi starting to finally break. 

If you're curious, this is chapter 104, where we get a brief jump in narration over to Nanzhu’s perspective, the reason why he waited so long to do anything, to get together. He’s terrified that Quishi will completely fall apart if he dies. He’s worried that one of them dying would be the end of the other. Qusihi straightforwardly confesses, and Nanzhu finally stops running. Not going to lie, I loved this. I’m not a fan of the nobel breakup trope, but I’m a sucker for codependency trope. It takes 800 pages to get here, but it’s worth it if you’re into it. 

[They are so cute. ](https://preview.redd.it/bc6plz96kxxd1.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8a96d52d43afd06fc380bbbf55ba90ff85daff6)

In this little interlude in the novel we get Quishi visiting his mother with Nanzhu. The series does keep Quishi’s family story, his parents divorced, started new families and he’s basically forgotten. After the visit though, Nanzhu offers to be his daddy….Quishi dosen’t say no….

This leads up to Quishi’s tenth door at this point, they are taking a female from another organization with them, the door is [Hako Onna](https://playerelimination.com/2019/09/03/hako-oh-no-a-hako-onna-review/), which is actually a real table top game (I now want to play). This door is also part of the series as well, and while the game play is like the novel we do have some changes; the twins do not participate in this door in the novel, Nanzhu is crossdressing again, and we have badass Quishi. Like in the series we have a series of boxes, Nanzhu is the target, and he gets trapped in the room and Quishi pretty much goes off the rails, he gets items to try and open it, he starts opening boxes at random, and then tells Nanzhu he will kill all of the others including himself if it meant he could live. Nanzhu makes him promise not to sacrifice himself, and Qushi agrees, with the intention to get revenge for his beloved, and plans to go absolutely scorched earth.



[They kept that co-dependency element that I love so much. ](https://preview.redd.it/e6jw193mkxxd1.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3cf8f76f3b3401580ccda7d7c2254dce5f2a536)

It’s actually hilarious when Nanzhu turns up alive, and Qushi is absolutely livid with him, and gives him the silent treatment for a solid 24 hours. He does eventually forgive but he makes Nanzhu a promise to never again try something like sacrificing for him again. In this door as well there is a couple who are brought in by a more seasoned player and basically used as pawns. They did include this one in the series, but it actually happens sooner in the Kagome door. There is a couple where the partner gets killed and his girlfriend follows after him. In the Onna door the same thing happens, he gets turned into one of the ogre minions and she joins him after killing the player that forced them in. It’s to mirror our leads and the co-dependency they have on each other. 

We get another interlude chapter, some couple fluff, and a little outside the door plot; White Deer gets a new leader, the twins' door is coming up, and Longming wants to join Obsidian. This leads into another door that is not in the series either, it’s Quishi and Nanzhu (crossdressing) he wants to see if Longming would be a good fit. So off they go to do a door based on the Greek myth of the [Minotaur](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Minotaur). One of the more hilarious moments in the novel actually happened in this chapter; Longming thinks he’s figured out the door and takes Nanzhu aside, basically explaining it’s like the Greek myth (7 men and 7 women including Nanzhu) at which point Nanzhu, being himself lifts his dress and very directly shows Longming why he’s incorrect. Of course he’s spotted and one of the other door players takes Quishi aside to warn him his ‘girlfriend’ is cheating on him. Quishi well aware of his lovers antics takes it all in stride (I really like the translation on this one, he calls him dama llama). The door itself is one of the more disgusting ones Longming and Nanzu end up stuffing themselves with rotten fish and Quishi throws them through the door, but they are quite sick afterwards. 

At this point we get the story of the twins in the novel, the twins enter together their tenth door, however when they come out Qianli is dying. He dies in his twins arms in their shared room as the others look on. In the series they also kill Qianli, and I think they absolutely did it justice in that final moment together. It wasn’t the gorey end like the novel, but the heartbreak and aguish where the same. In the door Qianli sacrificed himself so Yixie could survive, they were the last two and they couldn’t solve it, so the loop hole is being the last alive so he kills himself. After the funeral Yixie vanishes. Nanzhu reveals the reasoning he and Yixie were at odds throughout, as Yixie kept killing off the others in the doors he entred so he could get more specific clues. The karma of his actions caught up to him.  I actually really liked how they did it in the series, it was such a emotinally charged moment, but we get much closer to the twins in the series then in the novel. 

[This final cut was perfect. ](https://preview.redd.it/qjlodn2dmxxd1.jpg?width=2153&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=846c7cae6f6f3332ebb9d8ff75ba5c93e6fc01c7)

We get sort of a fluffy chapter here, or as fluffy as this novel gets and Nanzhu realizing Quishi is at his breaking points takes him on a tropical holiday. It was a great source of amusement for me that the author has no issues talking about dismemberment, body horror, and cannibalism, but when we get to sexy time all we get is ‘they went to do something unspeakable’. 

Whew! Still with me? We are in the end game now (get it?) what I’m going to do is first go over the ending of the novel, then the series. There has been A LOT of discourse around the series ending, so I think it helps first to understand the source material. If you’re still thinking about reading the novel, feel free to skip ahead. 

**Novel ending:** Alright so how did this all end? Quishi and Nanzhu enter the 11th door together, and Quishi finds himself back at the first day he entered the doors. He searches for Nanzhu, he can’t find him he tries all the places he remembers, nothing. He goes home, and as the sun sets and suddenly the monsters start. Quishi starts seeing all of the creatures he saw in the doors, they’re chasing and trying to hurt him. But he also sees those who have died in the doors, they come to help him as well. He speaks with them and finds out that during the day they live their lives unknowing about what they where, and at night they remember the doors and that they died and are now here. Quishi also gets texts from Nanzhu, he’s alive but won’t tell him where he is. Quishi goes through a few days of seeing monsters, and former friends, before he demands Nanzhu tell him and he eventually finds him as he was when he first entered the doors; a high school students at a private school. The pair spend their nights running from creatures, and eventually the nights get shorter, and the monsters less and less, until one day they are done and the nights are normal, and Quishi can no longer find Nanzhu. He finds him during the day finally, except Nanzhu no longer know Stuck he’s unsure how they are to open the door until he accidentally knocks over his clock and finds the key. At this point he is given a choice, he can stay in the simple world or he can return to the world he knows and the doors and potentially loosing those he loves. 

Quishi chooses to return. 

When he does return no one knows who Nanzhu is; he dosen’t exist. Quishi refuses to forget or move on. Everytime he tries to talk about him, or the 11th door people seem to not understand. It’s a year before Quishi get’s a call that Nanzhu has returned, and of course we get a happy ending, Nanzhu chose Quishi as well. This where the main story ends, BUT not quite yet, we still have the extras. 

The first extra is the one that brings this all full circle, the big reveal of course is that Nanzhu is the 12th door. He didn’t know he was until the went through the 11th door. Things get a little complicated and existential here, but try to stay with me on this, if you wish to read this for yourself roughly page 1042 to 1048, but I’ll try to lay this out as concisely as I can. Nanzhu, is the NPC of the 12th door, sort of a like a formless eldritch horror that guarded the final door. He watched a Quishi navigated the doors, lived his life, and when he entered the 11th door Nanzhu choose his form and when Quishi woke up, is when the novel first began and the story of Nanzhi and Quishi started. Basically it has all come full circle. It’s also noted the Quishi knows that Nanzhu isn’t exactly human, but he dosen’t care.

They use the famous Nietzsche quote, ‘when you gaze into the abyss the abyss gazes back’, the whole quote is actually *He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster. And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.* I loved that part of the chapter, as in that moment Nanzhu confirms without saying it that Quishi knows, but he doesn’t care as long as they are together. 

[And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you...](https://preview.redd.it/h1x3uzoonxxd1.png?width=2124&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c34ec607a623a18caec09f7b3b95e8bc1d3b90c)

If you do read this one, I also recommend reading the very last extra as well Little Prince’s Rose, as it explains more the cosmic horror scope of the story, it explains Nanzhi as a gardener of sorts in then infinite garden that falls in love with a special rose, and chooses to be with his beloved rose. 

The other extras includes 2 chapters about Nanzhu becoming an actor/model after him and Quishi retire after the doors, and leave Obsidien. There are also 3 chapters that finish off the story of the twins, this one is actually incredibly sad, as we finally learn about Chen Yixie and the lengths he went to, in order to protect his brother. The reason why Nanzhu was so angry with him, he has figured out that if you were the only one to return through the doors you would get a very special hint with more detail. Finding this out meant he would go out of his way to mislead others into dying in the doors which was the reason he and Nanzhu fought, but he would ultimately pay for that with the death of his brother. His story ends with him finding his brother in the 11th door with the others and opting to stay in that reality where his brother is with him. There is also a short extra on the other couple, as well as Zaozao, and Chestnut.

That rounds out the novel, so now what about the series? The ending of the series was rather ambiguous, and has been the subject of much debate. However it tracks in terms of the rest of the virtual reality narrative. They do pull in parts of the novel as well, the final door in the series, like the novel, has them seeing past creatures from the door, as well as Qianli is a NPC as well. We also have the reveal Nanzhu is part of the game, only Quishin knows, and they say goodbye for now…with a handshake….and Quishin returns and we have a sort of Wizard of Oz type of moment ‘but you where there, and you and you’ because surprise, surprise, this all happened in his own head. The game dosen’t exist yet. So we get a 50 year time skip which is a little excessive, but choices where made, and we have a reunion once more. 

[It was the best we could hope for really.](https://preview.redd.it/rv7gywg7oxxd1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=48231a59672d502c43f41414855b908510fafb88)

So did I like the ending? Honestly it was the best outcome we could have hoped for in this instance. We weren’t going to get the sweet romance, and we weren’t going to get the horror movie ending, so the 80’s ambiguous sci-fi was the best we were ever going to get. That shouldn’t put you off the series though, it’s a good series. Bromance was solid, the plot pulled enough from the source material that it was an enjoyable watch, and I will always support spooky BL content.

If you’ve stuck with me through this whole thesis many thanks, hope these convinced you to check out one of the other, or ideally both!

Period.,u/inherentlil,JEENEETards,https://www.reddit.com/r/JEENEETards/comments/1gfxj1v/do_not_take_computer_science_period/,"Main points: Do not look forward to Software Engineering jobs the same way anymore. Jobs going down day by day, and it's evident in placements in colleges all across India. Even if the market gets better, so will AI - and jobs will only reduce. Also, as a side point, please do not join IIIT Delhi.

I'm posting here because I want you to know BEFORE you join college. Not after.

I'm currently a 3rd year student at IIIT Delhi. My college was supposed to have ~fancy~ placements. I have DTU / NSUT / IIT Delhi friends near me. Let me tell you, placements are a shit show everywhere.

My friend sitting in CS @ DTU tells me that he's expecting 7-10 LPA despite being very smart (my personal opinion) and having done over 700 LC questions.

It's October. Placements started in August. 3 months gone, only ~100 students have been placed in my college. Other than that, around 70 pre-placement offers. So 170 offers in total. Total batch size? 600+. Also, only around ~100 people got internship this year. Out of 600.

Last year, only around ~400 people got placed by the end of placement season. Around 150 people remained unplaced. Any other statistic that you see from my college has been heavily manipulated.

Do you know what's worst? The fact that I'm spending all my time learning to build things that somebody with ChatGPT can build with half the knowledge as me. And most of these are ignorant people - not even trying to learn, just prompt engineering throwing everything at GPT.

Everyone is using GPT for assignments. People are cheating in company tests, interviews, competitive programming contests, LeetCode contests, everywhere. It's a shit show. Why am I even learning so hard to code? It feels purposeless.

Tech is not worth anymore. If you still have a choice, choose something else."
1gfyj2p,47,2024-10-30,ChatGPT Nightmare,u/natafacts,managers,https://www.reddit.com/r/managers/comments/1gfyj2p/chatgpt_nightmare/,"Hey all, any advice here would really help. I'm a new manager with my first intern.

I work at a small (10 person) startup. I recently took on a corporate client that we're providing consulting services to - giving industry advice, and generally helping them understand the startup/innovation landscape within a specific market so that they can develop new disease control solutions.

I recently hired an intern to help me with this, and I was so relieved. I don't have time to research the client's specific questions for hours, as my role expands into other areas.

Everything seemed OK at first. I suspected he was using ChatGPT to conduct the initial research, which I'm not actually against. I did casually bring it up on one of our check-ins, and he actually denied using it, which was the first red flag. His research was clearly structured like: ""topic: \[insert 2-3 sentences of summary, with a lot of bullets\]"". Hopefully I'm articulating this correctly, but it's unmistakable.

I guess the next part is my fault for placing my trust in someone new without fully checking the work first. BTW, this intern is a grad student, so my expectations were a bit higher. I let him present the first go of his research to two senior members in my company that are helping me manage this account. The research got RIPPED apart. Torn to shreds. I immediately took my intern off the project and assumed control. I've spent Thursday, Friday, Monday, and Tuesday from 8:30am-8:00pm spending 100% of my working hours fixing our research deck (it was a 1-2 months' worth of research!!!). I noticed that all of his sources in the excel dock are free-floating - they're just dumped into a cell on the end and are not linked to the questions. I had to dig for which numbers/information correlated with each stat or figure, and eventually I gave up and started REDOING all the research from scratch. He was also using sources like Mordor Intelligence, which even I know (not having a background in research) is a terrible source. I'm just so floored by the whole experience.

We also had to move the research check-in with the client, which looked bad. All in all, it was a horrible experience: I feel that I let the ball drop AND I didn't notice this issue until the 11th hour. I also have a manager, but he's spread thin and the vibe here is very much ""bootstrap yourself // be autonomous,"" so I'm on my own for what to do next.

  
So my question for y'all: how would you handle this issue? I really believe that there is a lesson for my intern to learn, but currently I'm pissed that I've spent all my time cleaning up his mess. I can't trust him right now. Is it really expected that I have to check every single source of an intern's research work? I'm thinking of doing a feedback call next week to say ""respectfully, WTF was that?"""

Hi everyone,
I’m not really sure who talk to about this, so I thought why not come to Reddit lol. I’m in my 3rd year as a CS Major and I genuinely feel the most confused and lost I’ve ever been in my whole entire life. That is due to the fact that I’m rapidly losing interest and overall passion in CS. When I first started my cs major I was actually having a good time. I had a great calc 2 professor and learned so much from him, it was genuinely really fun going to school everyday and learning things from him. I also had a good intro to programming professor which made coding fun for me (it was the basics though). Now fast forward to now, I’m taking upper division classes and my entire world feels like it got turned 180. Never used chatGPT before but now I feel like I always have to use it or Google things to look stuff up and even copy/paste the code because the coding assignments are too complex for me to figure out. I feel so guilty and unworthy knowing that I have to do this to pass a class. It’s so demoralizing. They don’t really teach coding anymore, a lot of my professors have the “go figure it out yourself” mentality, which is fine since I know many other universities do this aswell but I just don’t think I learn well off that. 

I’m always a person who loves a same old routine. So being a CS major and always having to think outside the box or figuring out different ways to solve complex problems, I just don’t think it’s for me anymore.  But what do I do? I’m too deep in to fully switch out this major + telling foreign parents that I gave up software engineering isn’t really the best idea. Plus scrolling through tiktok and Reddit, all I see are these amazing projects people have done while I’m here being a below average cs student. It’s also just been affecting my overall mental health feeling this lost in life. I can probably type all night about this but my phone is dying so I’ll end it here. Any advice or just overall thoughts would be nice. Please don’t roast me too much my mental is already down lol."
1gge5xw,1,2024-10-31,Building a “Meta-Intelligence Tutor GPT” for Personal Growth: My Journey So Far,u/Professional-Ad3101,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1gge5xw/building_a_metaintelligence_tutor_gpt_for/,"Hey all! I wanted to share a personal experiment I’ve been working on in ChatGPT – one I’m calling “Meta-Intelligence Tutor GPT.” This isn’t a commercial project, but more of a learning exercise where I’m treating ChatGPT as my personal “thinking partner.” I’m using it to practice philosophical inquiry, deep questioning, and layered learning through what I call a “Command Interface.” It’s been surprisingly rewarding, and I’d love to bounce ideas off others here, especially fellow students of philosophy or anyone who enjoys diving into the “how” and “why” of thinking itself.

# The Vision: Why Meta-Intelligence?

Most of us have used ChatGPT as a helpful assistant, right? But I wanted to push it further, using it to build a self-guiding system that thinks with me instead of just answering questions. The concept of “Meta-Intelligence” here is essentially a layered approach where each module within ChatGPT takes on its own focus, like a tutor that can adapt and learn iteratively. Think of it as ChatGPT learning to not just provide an answer, but also to explore new perspectives, challenge itself, and even refine its reasoning along the way.

I’m currently using **four core modules** that interact with each other like sections in an orchestra, creating a self-adjusting, evolving “thinking partner”:

* **Module 1: Systems Thinking & Complexity Analysis** – Breaks down complex ideas into interconnected parts, revealing how they relate to the bigger picture.
* **Module 2: Reflective Prompts & Meta-Questioning** – Engages in recursive questioning, aimed at revealing underlying assumptions and guiding reflective learning.
* **Module 3: Generative Creativity & Conceptual Blending** – Combines ideas and concepts in novel ways, generating fresh insights and creative connections.
* **Module 4: Embodied Cognition & Intuitive Insight** – Brings insights down to earth, making sure the responses feel intuitively aligned and grounded.

# How It Works: The Command Interface

Instead of straightforward Q&A, I’m treating the chat like a command interface where I set prompts and guide interactions through commands. For instance, instead of just asking, “What are the principles of Stoicism?” I can initiate a more dynamic exploration with commands like:

* `/RecursiveQuestionCycle`: This loops a question through layers of self-reflection, prompting ChatGPT to ask follow-up questions, challenge its own assumptions, or look for hidden blind spots.
* `/SetReflectionVariables`: Establishes the core focus of the inquiry by setting variables like `[REFLECTION_TARGET]`, which then guides recursive prompts toward whatever philosophical topic I’m digging into.
* `/AdaptiveFeedbackNetwork`: Connects feedback loops across modules, enhancing overall depth by adjusting responses based on evolving feedback.

Through this, ChatGPT can refine its answers and offer something closer to a “co-creation of insights” rather than a simple response. Each module independently contributes to the response, but the feedback loops ensure that they stay in sync – kind of like each section of an orchestra adjusting to play a more unified piece. 🎶

# The Modules in Action

Here’s a quick rundown of how each module works with a simple philosophy topic (say, “The nature of knowledge”):

1. **Systems Thinking Module** maps out the primary aspects of knowledge, like empirical, rational, and intuitive knowledge, showing how they interrelate.
2. **Reflective Prompts Module** starts recursive questioning around the assumptions we might have about “knowledge” and “truth,” identifying potential biases in how we frame the concept.
3. **Generative Creativity Module** adds layers by blending in other ideas, like Zen “beginner’s mind” or Socratic questioning, expanding the boundaries of the topic.
4. **Embodied Cognition Module** grounds the insights, asking how these ideas relate to personal experience or practical philosophy.

By the end, I don’t just have a list of facts about knowledge; I’ve got a nuanced reflection on how we define, experience, and question what we “know.”

**Why** Just pushing ChatGPT to be the most intelligent partner I can be , and my passion for solving the mind.  I will just use these as modules as saved prompts to plug and play."

VoiceDocs allows you to upload any document and start ""talking"" to it instantly. Ask questions, get insights, get summaries, learn new concepts, jump back and forth with easy. It's my dream tool. 

I made it completely free so you can use it yourself as well! It's still early though so if you have any feedback or suggestions please let me know.

I am a pharmacy student who recently just started my first semester of pharmacy school recently. Who knew that during the first week of classes, my biochem professor would quit? So instead of my school finding a capable professor to teach, they decided to just call a random professor to teach biochem. Not only was it a random professor, but it also had to be my orgo professor. I hated that professor I dropped that class as soon as I could. He doesn't know what he's doing, whenever someone asks him what's going to be on the exam he just laughs and says ""everything that's taught in class"". When we ask him for an outline he also just laughs. He's like I'm not giving you guys shit. Throughout the semester we would ask him what chapters are on the quiz but the thing is he doesn't even know what chapter he's teaching. He would just say I don't know. Like what do you mean you don't know, you are the one that's writing the quiz so you must know what chapters, but no he just laughs. Like, give us a fucking answer. A few days ago we had our midterm and I got my grade back and I failed. Like how did I fail? He said that as long as you read your notes and look at his sample questions you should be fine. Come exam day, the exam looks like it's from ChatGPT. He basically just asked ChatGPT ""Give me questions that are as confusing and difficult as possible and don't bother with making it about bicohem, what about making it about orgo instead?"" None of the sample questions were on the exam and there were topics that we never even learned before. He also said that he recycles his quiz questions, but no he doesn't. The exam looked like it was for the wrong class. Only 20% of the people in my class passed and there are 152 students in my class. He came to class today and wrote on the board and it said that he ""curved"". By curved he just took out 2 questions. The exam is out of 50 btw. That curve didn't do shit, like wow I went from an F to an F. As a class, we tried to ask him about extra credit but he would just laugh it off and I'm just like what's so funny? This is a professional program, if I fail one class I'm basically on my way out of pharmacy school. It's like you'll still have a job, but I won't have a future because of you and all you do is laugh. No sympathy from this guy whatsoever.  We all as a class have already started talking to the Dean and she said she'll figure something out for us, but what the fuck is my professor's problem. Stop laughing every time we ask a serious question and do your job as a professor and teach us things that will actually be on the exam. We don't want you to constantly avoid our questions. We need to know what's going to be on our exams and not have every answer be ""I don't know"" because you should know it's your fucking exam that we are being tested on. Also is it that hard to make slides? Your messy ass handwriting combined with your accent also isn't doing it for this class. Also, I tried YouTube and reading textbooks, but they just don't align with what he teaches in class. I honestly won't even be surprised if he's been teaching us orgo all this time. 

  
TLDR: My professor is a terrible person who doesn't care enough about his students to let them know what is on the exams and things that he teaches don't line up with the sample questions that he gives us. "

",u/MirkWorks,u_MirkWorks,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MirkWorks/comments/1ggpm7e/notes_and_remix_on_reading_of_selective_breeding/,"To date the only art critic I’ve ever read who appears to have engaged with Allan Kardec’s writings on spirits and mediumship has been Boris Groys in chapter 7 of his book *Becoming an Artwork.* Felt good when I came across the passage in question. Admired Groys’ skillful application of Kardec’s theories on mediumship and discernment in relation to his own thinking about the internet; in our (the user’s) tension between a desire for public recognition and privacy. The expansion and contraction of the Narcissus’ breath. There is a paranoiac (though not necessarily inaccurate) sense that the spectator is a danger. It comes naturally then that the potential social and personal risk be mediated through grades of self-occlusion, editorialization, and privacy. Partially reminiscent of practices of malefica or harmful sorcery in which the sorcerer wears a veil or a mask while performing the act in order to avoid detection, or of the adoption of an initiatic name - names imbued with mytho-historical power when conspiring with certain spirits - to be recognize but not necessarily seen and to be seen but not recognized. Secrecy serving as the precondition for the emergence of power and the aura or emanation of power. Likewise evokes the integrations and hybridization of peoples. Syncretism giving way to shared World. Whenever this comes about through the impression or settling of conquerors unto the conquered and disparate conquered into and around one another, or owner unto bondsmen and disparate bondsmen into and around one another. Degrees of occultation become necessary, in part, as a *survival* tactic (though this dimension is one that’s perhaps sociologically overtly-emphasized to the detriment of reflection). Necessary and at a largely unspoken (or more accurately perhaps insufficiently cognized) level, mandated by circumstance.

Spiritism proved pertinent when thinking through the production of the digital personae and our ways of interacting through these digital eidola - the black box frame containing and revealing a great chain of animate images and world-things or monuments (layers of historical experience ‘excreted’ and preserved and curated… historical sites we can be drawn into or access, habitable spaces where shamblers and pilgrims, gather… seemingly trans-temporal or outside of time as measured by labor or mechanical production. Circular rather than linear; mythical rather than secular).

Allan Kardec’s description of obsession and obsessing spirits brings to my person three different images.

The obsessional spirit as a bad student and by extension educator.

The obsessional spirit as a social media personality/influencer and by extension as fan. Or content provider and consumer.

The obsessional spirit as dealer and addict.

When Kardec describes obsession and obsessing spirits we find that he isn’t mired in anything particularly mystical or gothic… it’s a bad student and by extension educator. In fact his description of the obsessing spirit is almost evocative of Schopenhauer’s critique of Hegelians… using a lot of complex sounding words in order to preserve the image of themselves as an intellectual and the prestige or social capital that comes with that. Seemingly always having an answer to every inquiry.

The Revelation of Spiritist Doctrine, the re-affirmation of the afterlife - the infiniteness of consciousness or immortality of particular souls navigating an infinitesimal potentiality experienced as a process of ‘purification’ or enlightenment leading into higher realms and states… the immortal soul as religious pilgrim turned eternal student and universal citizen. In the Brazilian Spiritist artworks and literature this adventuring enters into realms reminiscent of optimistic (utopian) Science-Fiction. The disincarnate or incorporeal spirit realizes that it is not uniquely alone or infinitely lonely - Infinite Loneliness, this is how the Soul’s Immortality is experienced by darker or obscured entities (ghosts), who seethes but is at the same time terrified by the possibility or presence of other spirits…

Concerning Kardec’s style and methodology, we might quickly note his fidelity to the idea of science; rational inquiry and (repeatable) methods designed to yield sensuous and sober knowledge concerning the spirit world. Since Kardec’s time, we’ve been blessed with a less violent approach towards investigating and thinking about the phenomena. Spiritist doctrine mirrors the 19th century French philosopher Auguste Comte’s formulation of Positivism and his Religion of Humanity. Positivism and Spiritism having emerged hand-in-hand out of the 19th century Impressionist interregnum. Left pondering why Spiritism (and by extension, though perhaps to a lesser degree, Positivism) was nowhere to be seen in France after WWII. Having settled instead in Brazil.

Positivism, Spiritism, Psychoanalysis, and Surrealism.

Indeed we might likewise settle in the contrast between Surrealism and Spiritism. As if the Dead where emerging in great processions out of the Paris catacombs. Giving the impression that Surrealism emerged in-between Freudian Psychoanalysis and Kardecian Spiritism. Keeping a variety of techniques employed by spiritualists while discarding the Spiritist doctrinal commitment to Positivism - Comte rejected spiritualism as a regression, but the spirits drawn and nurtured into the Spiritist seance are effectively Positivists, in their teachings and views - being the children of Mesmer and Nietzsche, the Surrealist embraces the unconscious as the rediscovery of the Soul and its atavistic-elemental vitalities.

Spiritism as doctrine and movement more or less vanished off the face of France. Once the dust and ashes had settled it was nowhere to be seen. Having found fertile ground in Brazil. A country whose Bourgeoisie had embraced its sister doctrine of Positivism with equal fervor as evidenced by the inclusion of Auguste Comte’s Positivist motto “Ordem em Progresso” on the flag. Spiritism (alternatively called Kardecismo) lives on as a major cultural institution with millions of adherents (with a firm White middle class identity, amongst intellectuals and artists). Shaped and shaping the landscape and popular imagination. With this in mind an engagement with Spiritist writings evokes something of the “Lost Future”. Of Belle Epoque optimism and a genuine faith in reason and progress. Tragic and imbued with sentiments easily satirized and reactively dismissed in the present-day.

The Positivist stance - Positivism appeals to the authority of modern natural sciences and the demand for epistemic unity. Truth can be extracted from sensuous experience through reason and logic. This is the ‘positive’ content of Positivism. The human subject is capable of rationally ascertaining objective truth and by extension capable of making objective truth claims in the wake of the rigorous implementation of the scientific method i.e., controlled experimentation, observation, repetition, analysis, documentation, and critical cross-referencing of existing data. Science can provide the correct approach to questioning (which or what questions should we be asking?) and in turn of arriving at a definitive-enough answer to a given question granted enough time and resources. The development of science as *the* theory of reality or truth disclosure results in the framing of theology and metaphysics (speculative philosophy) as infantile and antiquated modes of thinking. The modern rational individual can be a moral agent, a citizen, without having to situate this claim upon tradition, scripture, clerics, in short religious or mystical authority. In fact one can and should rely solely upon reason and empirically verifiable facts as aids in the process of ethical individuation. If necessary rebelling against and revising existing social mores.

The citizen as a rational and moral agent can critique existing legal, political, educational, and economic policies and in turn manage the implementation-installation of rationally mandated reforms via their participation in civil and political society. Reason mandates that we strive towards the peaceful realization of a society that optimizes harmonious relations and the material comfort of all its constitutive members. A society which gives adequate expression to the (Transcendental) ideals or values which draws and adheres the individuals that comprise the collective, should develop along these lines or at the very least *strive* to develop along these lines. The Ideal Republic as a transcendental model. And what is the citizen? The human-type who dwells in this republic? Who is actualized and preserved in their dwelling? What is the Human? The definitions provided by Aristotle have proved sufficient, remaining in the millennium. The human is a social or political animal who strives for the Common Good. What is good is that which is free or which enables emancipation. Evidence of freedom is leisure. Work constitutes a comprise, being a means to an ends rather than the ends itself. We toil and fight in order to be free from labor and warfare or in sublimated manner, of economics and politics. Comte’s Positivism holds that politics should (and will) be made subordinate to a moral doctrine capable of rationally articulating - and in so doing, elevating - a collective feeling. This, according to Auguste Comte, constitutes the necessary doctrinal codification of the aspirations undergirding French Republicanism. Playing in the Republic a role akin to that of Catholicism during the dawning of the Old Regime. Writing in *A General View of Positivism,*

* Viewed negatively, the principle of Republicanism sums up the first phase of the Revolution. It precludes the possibility of recurrence to Royalism, which, ever since the second half of the reign of Louis XIV, has been the rallying point of all reactionist tendencies. Interpreting the principle in its positive sense, we may regard it as a direct step towards the final regeneration of society. By consecrating all human forces of whatever kind to the general service of the community, republicanism recognizes the doctrine of subordinating Politics to Morals. Of course it is as a feeling rather than as a principle that this doctrine is at present adopted; but it could not obtain acceptance in any other way; and even when put forward in a more systematic shape, it is upon the aid of feeling that it will principally rely, as I have shown in the previous chapter. In this respect France has proved worthy of her position as the leader of the great family of Western nations, and has in reality already entered upon the normal state. Without the intervention of any theological system, she has asserted the true principle on which society should rest, a principle which originated in the Middle Ages under the impulse of Catholicism; but for the general acceptance of which a sounder philosophy and more suitable circumstances were necessary.

Comte’s thinking would culminate in his formulation of a “Religion of Humanity”… an attempt to ‘re-do’ the Cult of Reason and the Cult of the Supreme Being developed during the French Revolution to counter and replace Roman Catholicism while strengthening the Revolutionary Project. As noted previously Comte expressed in his writings a profound antipathy towards the growing interest in spiritualism amongst the European intelligentsia of his time - the kind of experimentation that gave Spiritism its empirical and methodological content - viewing it as a dangerously regressive social phenomena. What Comte dismissed on principle Kardec took seriously and in doing so helped provide a response to the epistemic shortcomings of Positivism. Especially in its reception of the ontological questions raised by the growing popularity of spiritualism in Europe. What we find in the case of both Comte and Kardec is a spiritualized Humanism or secularized Catholicism. As noted in regards to Positivism by Thomas Huxley and by the anthropologist Roger Bastide concerning Spiritism… Huxley referred to Comte’s project as “Catholicism without Christianity” while Bastide made the following observation (part of a broader analysis and critique of Spiritist political morality) about Kardecismo based on his own experiences with the practice and practitioners in Brazil,

* “A certain image of the ideal self, which returns like a leitmotiv is the fruit of Spiritist education, of its lectures, its sermons; but it is also equally clear that it corresponds to the traditional Brazilian mentality, of the fraternal type, and that it gives first place to the virtue of charity, and not justice. Spiritism does not break with Catholic morality; it continues it, but in doing so it pulverizes it in a series of practical counsels: don’t eat more than necessary, give away the rest of your food, be humble, respond with love to other offenses, free yourself from anger and pride, etc. What happens with Brazilian Spiritists, when they are converted \[from Catholicism\], is that far from abandoning the teachings that they have received as children, they put into practice what Catholics preach but quite frequently fail to translate into action.”

Christianity sans Yahweh, clergymen, sacraments, regional folklore/superstitions, and what Slavoj Zizek refers to as the “perverse core” of Christianity as encapsulated by John 3:16 or what Rene Girard calls the ""sacrificial reading” of the Gospels. Positivism as a Religion of Humanity, is a Universal Christianity “purified” by reason of its archaic dross, with what remains reformulated as a universalist and altruistic (in short, *positive*) doctrine which takes scientific truth as its unassailable foundation.

Spiritism is conceived of as a threefold doctrine. Scientific, philosophical, and religious. The scientific referring to the possibility of acquiring empirical knowledge through the use of reliable/repeatable methods, in this case, the practice of mediumship. From this perspective empirical data facilitates a process of anamnesis (recollection) of our authentic existence as spirits amongst other spirits engaged in a great work. Mediums and spirits gather and raw information is received through the Spiritist séance or session (relying upon various mediumistic techniques like psychography or automatic writing) and then reflected upon. This reflection constitutes the philosophic moment of Spiritist practice. What has been gathered, received, and reflected upon is further codified into an actionable moral teaching to be transmitted to all those in need. This is the religious dimension. The authentic phenomenal expression of spirit is as a light imbued with sentience and agency. That *is* sentience and agency. Mediumship becomes a process of having this light shine on and through the corporeal medium within a space that has been charged and ordered, sanctified, through prayers. Prayer as thought set in motion, thinking consecrated by the charitable intent of one being towards another. Spaces and words are consecrated when infused with an excess of care.

A phenomenological approach is warranted. After all to talk about spirits is to talk about light and light is in its appearance self-revealing. The entities at work in these Spiritist practices (Kardecismo in Brazil and Espiritismo Cientifico in Cuba) can be understood as being in communion with the continuum of thought projected upon the earth; Projected the Western view of the world. The processes at work are progressive and progress is an egalitarian potentiality. The doctrine of enlightenment and emancipation conceived of as a Universal one. One that is actualized, meaning given its positive content, through Charity. Without charity there is no salvation. This encompasses the appropriate codification and transmission of correct moral teachings to those in need of it.

What does this look like in practice and in the lives of Spiritists? Spiritism never conceived of itself as existing outside the continuity of Christianity. Christian truth and revelation is reaffirmed. Spiritism historically situated is one of many in the movement of Christianity through the dissolution of Christendom - the patchwork of Feudal social relations at one point bound by Ecclesiastical mandate and debt - and the ascendancy of the Bourgeoisie and the propensity for Bourgeois thinkers and tinkerers to conceive of themselves as a *European* Bourgeoisie. Their values transformed into the values of a post-Napoleon Europe, the Europe of Nation-States. The particular interests of the Bourgeoisie could then be understood as constituting the baseline for all sensible humans; the standard for the universal citizen. The Europe of the Nation-States was conceived of as a moment, a necessary concession in the development of the Human Spirit away from arbitrary identities, the petty tyranny of regional custom/laws, along with the interests of the aristocracy and its inherited ownership claims over said regions. For the Spiritist there is no clear-cut distinction to be made between Christian revelation and Western thinking or in philosophic terms, adopting Rene Girard’s reading of Heidegger, between the Heraclitean and Johannine logos. Instead the logic of modernity serves to transmit this revelation - one which in turn transforms or morphs the technologies it inspires in the progressive unfolding of itself on the earth. Our struggle as corporealized spirits lies broadly in our relation to this great unconcealment. Sin becomes anything which obscures, distorts, mystifies or materializes, this revelation - in short, sin is synonymous with ignorance. Ignorance begets cruelty, obsession, and immorality. The “enemy” of the Spiritist is the dogged perpetuation of error. The spirits of Spiritist doctrine are encountered and envisioned within a hierarchical schema, a spectrum of illumination, a model we might recognize as one of many latter-day permutation of the Platonic schema. Indeed I would go so far as to argue that Spiritism constitutes a Platonist revival or re-Platonization of Christianity. There are other worlds than these. Despite the seemingly hostile and inhumane rhythms of modernity and the world as is, God’s Grace is limitless, the spirits are tireless in their mission, and salvation (the correction of error) is universal. No one is beyond saving. The spirit world and material world mirror one another, with our physical plane and earth existing in a lower or condescend frequency of light and sound. We are all spirits, there are disincarnate spirits and incarnated spirits. The gentle setting of the Spiritist seance-session or misa-mass. The gathering together in a clean space to pray, softly sing, contemplate, and wait; receiving and transmitting. Correct advice along with philosophic reflection and education are expressions of Caritas. Grace is the substance and the subject of the Spiritist labor. No entity is unsalvageable.

  
Back to BAP

On white sand beach, the horizon a copulation of blues; the firmament and the wine-colored sea. The sun having ridden past the zenith observes the spectacle. The winds seeping through pores drenching bones warm. Dressed elegant, pale, feverish he sits and stares. Stares at the athletic young men holding knives performing pyrrhic dance round a good fire. Hella Good by No Doubt blasting from boombox. Arms interlocking, butt-kickers, spinning, stabbing. Round and round. Their steps in beat with electronic syncopation. No shirts, no shoes, no problems. Scantily clad, the light dances with them reflected on their glistening anointed bodies. The red satin kerchiefs crowning heads and around necks. It’s an adaption that stays true to the spirit of the original. Sipping on his ice tea the man admires the results. “Glory be! Glory be!! Ave! AVE! IO! We salute all the gods in their abodes high and low and in the seas. All is good. All is good. All is great. Be forever you gorgeous beasts of prey! ALLAHU AKBAR!!!” The feverish man intones. Visualizing the praise like perfumed smoke rising up out of his skull, joining the fragrance of all creation.

Ask him about his casting choices. It’s really very simple. In short; JCVD hits in a way that Billy Blanks doesn’t and he refuses to be forced to say otherwise. I propose the following hypothesis. Revealing the profound dialectical unity of BAP and the Wachowskis:

Transfixed on the tv screen displaying Jean-Claude Van Damme in all his elegant ferocity, kicking the daylight from the savage eyes of Asiatic barbarians, absolutely destroying his opponent without ambivalence…nigh flawlessly in the final round— he could watch this for hours. Reasoning in retrospect that the barbarian on the receiving end of the Belgian’s fury could not help but misuse his own talents and power, exemplifying the cruelty of the oriental matrix their genius had be shaped or rather warped by… the warrior degenerating into a mere criminal. Thus Providence has brought JCVD into existence so as to remind the despot that they too are prey liable to get caught in the gaze and ground up in the limbs and skillful technique of another. The blood-drunk audience chants “Nok Su Kao! Nok Su Kao! Nok Su Kao!” One suppresses the bubbling sympathy as the native fighter grimacing groggily slaps his thighs in consternation at this latest betrayal, the kind of self-consciousness required to cope with his own people turning against him lies beyond his horizon, barring an unlikely retreat into Buddhist monasticism and self-reflection/dissolution. Still, is it so bad? This humiliation? This coming so very close to death? The betrayal is in not dying. They cannot help but admire and glory in the deconstruction, despite it being at their own countryman’s expense, this champion in whose presence they had once cowered, misrecognizing the brute as a god and a king. Their bloodlust has opened the way for further ennoblement. According to him, to our Bronze Age Pervert, this is something deeply Platonic. Just read Book 3 of Plato’s Republic. Socrates (as portrayed here by Seth Rogan) would’ve adored JCVD.

Billy Blanks doesn’t hit the same. But who does, honestly? JCVD is singular.

And perhaps it’s true that all art made in service of political ends is pornographic and necessarily so. Here, the real “horseshoe” is a reformulation of Costin Alamariu’s observation in the introduction to Selective Breeding and the Birth of Philosophy,

The nascent youth rebellion is international, remarkably broad-based among high-school students and others somewhat older, and it is, like all youth rebellions, contrarian and nihilistic. But it has genuine, substantial criticisms of the egalitarian world-view. These young people are attracted in general to knowledge of human nature that was made “forbidden” to them by the educational and moral establishment of our time. Without engaging or being able to engage the new scientific body o knowledge that is coming out at an increasingly rapid pace, readers, of whatever moral or political conviction, will simply lose the plot.

Naively perhaps, I read the frightening-personae of BAP, advocating for things like eugenics-based regimes. His manner of highlighting the dangers of a potential philosopher attempting to control Humanity and Nature. It can and will only ever produce Regimes which either explicitly or implicitly, monitor and control us at the level of Breeding. In order to breed out undesirable traits and breed up desirable traits. A Regime which attempts to replace Nature with itself. Regardless of ideological particularities, it tends towards the same genocidal program.

Fake and Gay? Listen, I’m not the one dressed in green tights, playing a flute, promising a great banquet to the bewitched children, only to then reveal once inside the cave, that there is no Thielbucks, and that they’re actually being initiated into a Gnostic sect called the Coprophagians who eat shit in order to spite their fathers and sully his reputation or something. Literally says this on the pod.

“Indeed, I counsel you to go away from me,

Leave me and defend against Zarathustra,

And even better: be ashamed of him!

Perhaps he deceived you.”

From a caricature of the Right as saboteurs, sadomasochistic perverts, opportunists, and midwits, we instead arrive at something slightly less monstrous… but the slightly less monstrous is still predicated upon a certain hypocrisy, private humanity. And an inability if not outright unwillingness to actually, radically, enact the program they sell to their audience. Now perhaps I’m misreading, they aren’t “selling” the promise of Mass Deportation to the American electorate but rather simply alluding to it enough to draw them in. Caveat emptor. Everything will always ever be “the first steps towards a radical future.” Working then to facilitate the machine addiction needed for the Party to reproduce itself as long as possible. The pluckiness, inefficiency, and internal contradictions of a Trumpian New Right is what makes them “the lesser evil” when compared to the uniformity of the Progressive and Technocratic Left. Part of this involves a settling of the terms between mutually antagonistic parties… predicated on the lack of mobility and of the conformity that characterizes the highly-stratified society. It is too late to turn back now. Either submit or face exile and sure death or you can always kill yourself... this of course will be delivered by the beady-eyed moaning out, “but what about my feelings?”

I think the configuration of Costin Alamariu-as-BAP reveals Costin to be the luminary apostate of the philosophic school and lineage founded by Leo Strauss.

My understanding is that he is viewing this social phenomena from the perspective of someone who swore an oath to insure that a society which doesn’t force Socrates to kill himself, can exist. That’s why the “re-politicization” of Nietzsche is as important within his school as it is, the point of reversing Georges Bataille’s operation (convincingly showing that Nietzsche would’ve been deeply opposed to the Third Reich) is so that one undergoes the process of “de-politicizing” Nietzsche all over again, as a personal, spiritual, exercise. Shows that the student has read the material, deeply. Has communed with Nietzsche. Through Nietzsche with Callicles-Plato.

Influence or “mere words” should not provide license to torment, imprison, and execute someone. A society which does this, which sets the legal precedence to persecute specters and “influence”, is an inquisitorial and superstitious one. In short, a stupid one. Aristophanes’ satirization of Socrates should have been enough, the critiques Aristophanes’ levels against Socrates are the charges levied against his person by Athenian authorities. They weren’t wrong. What condemns Socrates was precisely his influence. Despite his disavowal of Critias. Consider that Socrates was not innocent. That he was indeed guilty of all charges. That doesn’t mean he deserved to be forced to drink hemlock which despite the beatific image of his passing in Phaedo, and his embracing of death as a ‘cure’ to life within Plato’s narrative… would’ve been a horrific death.

Recollecting BAP’s play with Empedocle’s leaping into the volcano in Bronze Age Mindset.

There was Empedocles, a philosopher, man of high vision. He jumped into volcano Aetna in Sicily because he knew he would be reborn as a god. Now imagine yourself in front of rim of Aetna. It’s dry and sandy. You feel the heat but is not like you thought it might be. Is not Romantic. Is just hot, dry, you can’t breathe, and the smell of infernal sulfur and wet earth and even worse things triggers an old memory or instinct in you to run. You’re brought to face with a vehemence and brutality of rock and you start to feel dizzy staring in. Molten rock in your nostrils and it’s not just that it scares you. If it were great fear, that could be a spur to action. But it fills your nostrils with banality and dullness of plain molten dust, you see gray and black. It reminds you of torrid summer afternoon by abandoned gas station, you are stranded on dirt road, choked by heat and so much dust. You see flames in the hole but it lacks the romance of fire as you imagined it. IIs this it? It seems like nothing to you, because to your eye it’s nothing. So you pull away from it. You’re not reborn as a god, you remain a mule. Your lying mind now comes up with many thoughts about why it’s right to pull back. Why, of course! There’s a nice meal to have, a glass of wine. Maybe there’s a girl waiting. Her pussy is warm and inviting. Empedocles was deluded.

Socrates’ decision to drink Hemlock rather than accept exile is I think, reminiscent of Empedocle’s apotheosis. Hemlock paralyzes your respiratory system. The way Plato writes Socrates’ death is beautiful. The prescribed sacrifice of a strange mutant, his head in the clouds, skulking the streets like a pelican. Eyes lolling looking for a debate."
