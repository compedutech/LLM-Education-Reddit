**Reflection:** 

I'll be headed to Illinois this coming fall, and I think I'll enjoy the fact that it lacks the cutthroat culture that many of the other schools I applied to (Berkeley I'm looking at u) while also offering a phenomenally ranked CS program, something that not many institutions can provide. In the future, i want to crack into quant or FAANG, and I'm very fortunate that Illinois feeds into both industries very well. 

As for admissions, I've also come to realize how incredibly lucky I am to land just one of my reaches. What I've learned in the past few months is that applying to colleges is like one big, stressful diceroll, especially for CS majors. One of my friends got into Stanford and Princeton but rejected to UIUC CS, and so many of my classmates who have been grinding coding since they were preschoolers, who had way more impressive awards and ECs were also denied. Tbh it's made me second guess myself to the point where I have to reopen my acceptance letter to make sure its real.

I think that not applying to UIUC as Grainger cs was 100% the right move because CS+X majors are a bit easier to get into, but have pretty much the same resources, career opportunities as pure CS kids. I'm also passionate about both statistics and CS so getting into the combined program was a huge dub for me. 

Anyways, I guess shotgunning schools worked. To think that if I applied to 20 schools instead of 21 I'd be going to one of my safeties....

Spray and pray baby. Remember, ONE SHOT IF ALL IT TAKES"
1bsqwyz,3,2024-03-31,A New Era: Kennedy Administration (1961-1965),u/Kapples14,Presidentialpoll,https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1bsqwyz/a_new_era_kennedy_administration_19611965/,"&#x200B;

**Election Results:** After a contentious race, Senator John F. Kennedy would emerge victorious with enviable sums of the popular and electoral vote. Despite Nixon and Byrd taking up much of the Southern vote, the Democratic senator would make up for this with hefty support from Midwestern and Northeastern support. Kennedy's team would find success in flipping several states like Idaho, New Hampshire, West Virginia, Utah, Delaware, Connecticut, Washington, and Oregon. Nixon, despite delivering a disappointing loss for the Republicans, would still find success in flipping Democratic states like Kentucky, Arkansas, Virginia, and even Texas thanks to targeting the Democrats' division and Kennedy's inability to connect with rural voters.

The race, however, would be won by Kennedy thanks to a strong pull from middle-class, suburban voters and the black community's aggressive support. As Kennedy would celebrate his victory in the election, as well as maintaining their majority in the Senate, the party would still fail to retake the House. After the election, Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson would resign from the Senate, with Senate Whip Mike Mansfield entering the role without opposition. Furthermore, House Speaker Halleck would officially relinquish the position of House Speaker, allowing House Majority Leader Leslie C. Arends to ascend to the Speakership.

&#x200B;

**Background:** After succeeding President Humphrey, John F. Kennedy would be inaugurated as the 38th President of the United States of America on January 20th, 1961. While he initially enjoyed high approval ratings thanks to various progressive projects, strong stances against foreign Communist nations, a strong working relationship with Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield, and his own masterful use of the media and modern culture to promote his presidential administration, he would be plagued by various controversies and global events that would soon cost them the midterm elections as they unfortunately lost the Senate in the 1962 midterm elections.

While many would consider the president as equally controversial as he was beloved, the nation would go silent on November 22nd, 1963. While riding through Dallas, Texas with First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy and Texas Governor John Connally, the president would be shot twice; unfortunately, the president would be confirmed dead thirty minutes after being transported to Parkland Hospital. The president's death would be witnessed by thousands who had been watching the president's trip on television. On that day, Vice President Walter Reuther would be sworn in as the 39th President only two hours later after taking flight on Air Force One.

While Lee Oswald's arrest came swiftly, the assassin would himself be killed on November 24th, 1963 when nightclub owner Jack Ruby shot the killer during a transferal. The Stevenson Commission, after almost a year of investigation, would conclude that both Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby had acted alone in their respective assassinations. 

&#x200B;

When selecting a new candidate to appoint to the vice presidency, President Reuther would announce his decision to nominate LeRoy Collins, the former governor of Florida, to fill in the vacancy. Collins would be inaugurated as the 39th U.S. Vice President on December 15th, 1963, following a swift confirmation by the Senate.

\----------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

**Government:** On June 30th, 1961, President Kennedy would sign the massive *Housing Act of 1961*, a sweeping bill that would allocate large sums of government funding for urban renewal, improvement of mass transportation, and assistance for housing and community development. 

With the assassination of President Kennedy, the newly-inaugurated President Reuther would sign an executive order on November 29th, 1963, creating the Stevenson Commission in order to investigate the president's assassination. 

One of President Reuther's first acts as president would be the passage of the *Clean Air Act* on December 17th, 1963, aiming to combat air pollution on the federal level. 

President Reuther, in an attempt to begin combatting poverty in the nation, would sign the Food Stamps Act on August 20th, 1964. This act would appropriate 75 million dollars to the Food Stamps Program. 

&#x200B;

**Economy & Labor:** On November 28th, 1961, President Kennedy would write a letter to Treasury Secretary McMath regarding his desire to see silver metal be gradually removed from the monetary system. 

With steel prices rising across the U.S., the president would take to a news conference in order to criticize the ""jawboning"", a term used to describe the methods in which Kennedy saw that steel prices were being increased. While the president had sought to utilize the Departments of Commerce and Justice to begin targeting steel companies who had raised their prices, very little would come from the investigations. 

&#x200B;

**Foreign Policy:** President Kennedy sought to better strengthen economic ties between the U.S. and Latin America; therefore, the president would create a 10-year plan labeled the Alliance for Progress starting in 1961 in order to promote economic development, democratic governments, education, and economic reforms within the region. On May 27th, 1961, Kennedy would celebrate the birth of this project when he signed the legislation needed to secure funding for the project.  

Throughout the December of 1961, President Kennedy would travel to Latin America, making stops including Puerta Rico, Venezuela, and Columbia in order to promote the Alliance for Progress. 

On February 3rd, 1962, President Kennedy would officially proclaim an embargo on all trades with Cuba. The embargo would prohibit all trades with Cuba, goods made in or transported through Cuba, and prohibit any and all American goods from being transported to or through Cuba. 

After its ratification by the Senate, President Kennedy would sign the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty on October 7th, 1963. This treaty prohibited the testing of nuclear weapons underwater, in the atmosphere, or in outer space. The act was seen as a monumental step forward in the goals of ending nuclear weaponry. 

New fears would arise when on November 1st, 1963, Vietnam President Diem would be deposed and later executed during a coup. While Kennedy had discussed the coup during a press meeting, he admitted that while the U.S. had intelligence regarding the insurgence, they had chosen not to intervene not realizing that the rebel group had intended to kill Diem. 

On May 27th, 1964, President Reuther would secretly approve a secret bombing of the ""Ho Chi Minh Trail"" along the border of Vietnam and Cambodia. 

Trouble would surface when two US ships, the USS Maddox and USS Turner Joy, were allegedly attacked in the Gulf of Tonkin by Vietnamese torpedo boats on August 2nd, 1964. President Reuther would order air strikes to be made against gunboats and certain supporting facilities as retaliation for the attack.

In response to the incident, Congress would pass the *Gulf of Tonkin Resolution* on August 7th, 1964. The resolution would extend the president's wartime powers in order to give Reuther further abilities in order to increase U.S. involvement in the conflict between North and South Vietnam. 

&#x200B;

**Cold War:** Early into his term, President Kennedy would enact upon one of Humphrey's secret projects that entailed a covert invasion in Cuba operated by anti-Castro exiles. The CIA-trained guerilla soldiers would go in to attack on April 17th, 1961, but would surrender on the 19th. The invasion, labeled the Bay of Pigs Invasion by the press, would end in catastrophe, with widespread criticism coming from all ends of the political spectrum as Kennedy suffered accusations of war-mongering and recklessness. The president, who had refused to send military or air support for the Cuban operatives, would refuse to take blame from Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro, arguing that the exiles had taken full accountability for the attack due to their shared hatred for Cuba's communist regime. 

International reports would come out in mid-August of 1961 stating that East Germany was beginning construction of the Berlin Wall in order to prevent mass defections from Soviet-controlled East Berlin to the democratic West Berlin. In response to this, President Kennedy would send Vice President Reuther to Berlin, who would then conclude that the Soviet Union's construction of the barrier was to be seen as an act of aggression. To further worsen matters, special intelligence would report that the Soviets had resumed development of nuclear weaponry. 

In what many deemed to be the defining moment of President Kennedy's tenure, evidence would come out that Soviet Union had begun stockpiling its arms buildup within Cuba. One of the biggest concerns would be the numerous offensive missile launch sites found within the small country. In response to this, President Kennedy would start a strict quarantine on shipping offensive weapons on Cuba on October 22nd, 1962.

The following day, Kennedy would order the military to interdict any and all weaponry and associated materials being sent to Cuba. This would begin one of many high-stakes negotiations between Kennedy and the leaders of both Russia and Cuba. Across the nation, Americans abroad would anxiously await for what they feared would be the birth of nuclear warfare. These sentiments of concern carried out across the world. On October 27th, 1962, President Kennedy would announce to the world that the negotiations had ended and a peaceful resolution had be reached. While Premier Khrushchev would agree to remove all nuclear missiles from Cuba, Kennedy had himself agreed to remove all nuclear missiles from Italy and Turkey with an added promise to never invade Cuba without any form of direct provocation. 

To finish this heated event, the president would lift the Cuban blockade on November 20th, 1962, promising to leave the country in peace.

&#x200B;

**Space Race:** Kennedy would lead a nationwide celebration when Alan Sheppard Jr. would become the first American to enter space on May 4th, 1961.

 Following this, President Kennedy would give a declaration during a Joint Session of Congress on May 20th, 1961, that the country would send a man to the moon by the end of the decade. This would come after successfully negotiating a raise in funding for space-based research and support for NASA.

&#x200B;

**Civil Rights:** The war for civil rights would take a new battlegrounds when the Freedom Ride, several buses of integrated college students travelling throughout the Deep South to combat illegal segregation enforcement in bus stations, was met with a violent mob while in Anniston, Alabama on May 14th, 1961. 

On May 13th, 1963, President Kennedy would send federal troops to Birmingham, Alabama in order to provide order during Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s civil rights campaign. Following this, the president would sign an executive order on June 11th that year, directing Defense Secretary McNamara to ensure the integration of the University of Alabama in response to Governor George Wallace's attempts to undermine the laws. 

On June 11th, 1963, President Kennedy would denounce segregation during an address to the American people. The president would decry the matter as a moral crisis that must be met by Congress. 

In response to Alabama Governor George Wallace coming to the University of Alabama in order to physically block two African-American students coming to register for classes, President Kennedy would sign an executive order on June 11th, 1963 to authorize the Department of Defense to act on the matter to insure the integration of the university. 

In a key success for civil rights, President Reuther would celebrate the ratification of the Twenty-Fourth Amendment on , outlawing all forms of the poll tax as a requirement for voting. This act would be celebrated by civil rights activists across the nation. Furthermore, President Reuther would sign the *Civil Rights Act of 1964* on September 2nd, 1964. The act would prohibit discrimination against a person based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. 

&#x200B;

**Major Accomplishments:** While working alongside former First Ladies Muriel Humphrey and Louella Dirksen, President Kennedy would announce the creation of the President's Commission on the Status of Women on December 14th, 1961. The organization would be created with the intent to investigate questions regarding women's equality in the worlds of law, education, government, the political world, and under the law. The committee would be chaired by Muriel Humphrey, who served in the role until 1963. 

On June 12th, 1963, President Kennedy would sign an executive order that would create the Advisory Council on the Arts. This order would be followed by a press meeting where Kennedy would detail how the decision would be made to better involve the government's role in promoting the arts, while also supporting both art institutions and artists alike. 

&#x200B;

**Major Controversies:** Throughout his tenure as president, many rumors of marital affairs would continue to boil, with one of the most egregious being that of a previous affair in 1956 when the president left to party in Europe, leaving behind a wife who had just given birth to a stillborn daughter. The rumor that caught the interest of many magazines, however, would be the alleged affairs between President Kennedy and movie star Marilyn Monroe. The allegations would reach new heights after the actress' death in 1962 when speculation began that her death had been self-afflicted due to her relations with the president. 

While the U.S. had strongly supported advancing their scientific endeavors in order to compete against the Soviet Union, Kennedy's call to send a man to the moon had been seen as a wild claim that would cost the country an unnecessary price for what some saw as a fruitless endeavor. 

While campaigning for reelection, President Reuther would come under fire for a widely-criticized campaign ad known as ""The Daisy Girl"" where a child was counting down while holding a daisy, only to abruptly shift to a nuclear missile countdown. The ad was lambasted with accusations of fear-mongering and tone-deafness over the recent fears of nuclear warfare from just two years ago. 

A new controversy would come when President Reuther made a remark in Oklahoma where he stated that he did not intend to send ""white boys to go fighting for Asian boys"" and get ""tied down in a land war in Asia"". The comments were labeled highly offensive and racially insensitive by numerous activist groups and progressive leaders.

1bsxkph,4,2024-04-01,How can I quit using my computer?,u/Internal_Magazine813,nosurf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1bsxkph/how_can_i_quit_using_my_computer/,"Hello. I'd like to consult with you because I can't seem to quit using my computer. I'm a student in Japan. Since I'm not very good at English, I'm having this text translated by ChatGPT. I apologize if there are any strange parts in this text. (This is my first time using raddit.)  
You might wonder why a Japanese person like myself, who can't speak English, is posting on an overseas bulletin board. As I mentioned earlier, it's because I can't seem to quit using my computer, mainly for YouTube.  
I've researched many methods online, but in Japan, there's hardly any trend of quitting the internet to enrich one's life. There's some information about detoxing from smartphones, but there's absolutely nothing about detoxing from computers.  
So I have no idea what to do. Personally, I've tried setting time limits and installing browser extensions on my MacBook, but I end up disabling them all by myself. When I disable them and waste my time watching YouTube videos, I feel like a completely different person, and it scares me.  
You might ask why I need to stay away from my computer so much, and it's because I have exams this year. I don't know what exams are like overseas, but in Japan, you just have to study relentlessly. Therefore, I already need to start studying, but before I know it, I pick up my computer, sit at my desk, and start watching YouTube. If my parents tell me to quit, I end up getting defensive.

You might think it's a good idea for me to have my computer confiscated, but at my school, we need to use computers to receive assignments and study through video lectures. By the way, I haven't replaced my smartphone since it broke once. I used to be obsessed with my smartphone, but when that obsession disappeared, I became engrossed in my computer.  
So that's why I'm consulting with you. And as the title suggests, I'd like to learn tips on quitting using my computer. I'd appreciate it if you could share any recommended browser extensions or apps. Also, I'd like to know how to prevent myself from disabling those extensions.  
As I mentioned, this is my first time using raddit, and this is a translated text, so there might be parts that aren't written well (I'm not good at writing). I would appreciate your cooperation.  
Thank you very much."

After facing endless rejections in web development, I decided to switch lanes to iOS Development and Machine Learning (since I have a better chance and I'm more competitive there). Sounds good, right? 
In a plot twist I didn't see coming, I accidentally applied full-time position (thinking it was an internship spot) at this fancy Swiss fintech company that's basically the Google of my city. Realized my mistake only after getting an interview call and now, I'm on the verge of a panic attack. If I mess this up, I'm not just rejected; I'm practically blacklisted. Plus, I need an internship to graduate, and my university's about to make that mission impossible with their new partnership rules. Could use some serious advice on how to handle this without obliterating my future. Thoughts?
---

Hi guys, hope the job market is treating you alright and isn't absolutely hellish like it is in Macedonia.   

### Backstory
---

To give you a little backstory, I'm a 4th year Software Engineering student in North Macedonia, and I've been applying to a lot of places for internships in my city (the capital it has the most jobs etc.). I've been rejected from all of them *(some have been right away; some have been in the 2nd or 3rd interview round)*. All of these positions were for web development internships...
After a lot of frustration and lack of communication and honest feedback from companies I decided to look elsewhere in terms of a career path *(since I'm still young and haven't really set roots anywhere, also my CV is not competitive in web dev compared to my colleagues and competition in the job market)*. The paths I've chosen to pursue are **IOS Development** *(bought a course on UDEMY for that and learning that atm. also there is a lot less competition in my city, but also a lot less open job positions let alone internships for IOS; I think it's a really cool platform to program and I was also able to set up XCODE on a QEMU VM so I don't need a mac)* and **Machine Learning** because I'm working on a research paper in the field which is to be published in May. I have hands on experience with supervised learning and I really think the whole field is awesome and extremely vast so you can work on a lot of cool engineering problems with it.
Also, I'd like to add that it's become so bad here that during a job fair at my collage a company had to close their stand after 3 days because they had 250 applications for a QA position, and they couldn't take any more applicants... I love you QA guys, you make software good but usually no one wanted these jobs, and they would always stay vacant.

### The Mix-Up
---

What happened was because of my frustration I started mass applying to any open position for an internship regardless of if it was for something that interested me or not. I applied to what is basically a tier FAANG company in my city *(a Swiss fintech company with its biggest branch in my city; it's a prestige to work in that company and also, it's really desirable because the best talent from the city is there. It's really major for your career imo)*. I got a call two days later and scheduled an interview for this Wednesday. Now all was dandy until I got to talk with a senior dev at that company, which holds interviews for web dev positions (he was the bf of my friend, which was a coincidence and we got to talk about my interview).
**Finally, after my wall of text comes my point/dilemma**. 
I applied for a job position and NOT an internship position. Meaning that the interview will be completely different (different level and expectations). Now to top that off the senior dev guy told me that they give candidates a grade based on the interview. If you get a low grade, they essentially black list you, next time if you apply, they will probably see that you had a bad grade and not even call you. They are also one of a few companies in my city that offer an IOS dev. internship.

### What the heck do I do?
---

I'm super stressed out and have absolutely no idea on what to do. As seen from the wall of thoughts that have been coming from my head above. I have no idea what I should do or say. And how I should act or communicate this to my interviewers on Wednesday. 
This is what ChatGPT told me:
```
 Early in the interview, clarify the misunderstanding. You might say something like, ""I want to be upfront about a mix-up on my part. I applied to this position under the impression it was an internship, which aligns with my current career stage. However, I'm genuinely excited about the opportunity to contribute to [company/project], and I'm open to discussing how we might tailor a role that benefits us both.""
```
Which is cool and all but still doesn't make me less stressed and anxious about messing up this opportunity.
Any advice is welcomed, also any criticism as well. :))



P.S. In order for me to get my diploma from my university I have to have completed at least a 3-month long internship in an IT company *(related to the field of study of my major)*.

P.P.S Starting from October 2024 the university will pass a new ""law"" where the only internships they will recognize will be in companies that are official partners with the university. To become a partner, you have to pay the university on a yearly basis. Meaning that only big companies will be able to do so and that means that all students will compete for these positions *(The IT/CS collage is the biggest in the country and has the most students compared to any other college or university in the country)*."
1bt3r65,2,2024-04-01,"California Public School, International School Abroad or HomeSchool?",u/alanism,AskTeachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTeachers/comments/1bt3r65/california_public_school_international_school/,"I would like to get a teacher’s lens of perspective for advice for the upcoming Fall school year for my daughter going into 2nd grade.

The 3 options are:

&#x200B;

1. California public school.  City I grew up in.  40% of residents have STEM degrees.  Great school district The elementary school has an A on Niche, 8/10 score (but 10/10 on test) from GreatSchools.org. 23:1 student-to-teacher ratio. I was extremely happy with the school and teacher of my daughter's KG year.  Free
2. International School Abroad in Asia.  Reggio system.  About 1/3rd locals, 1/3 Asian expats, 1/3 European/American expats.  12:1 student:teacher ratio + 2 teacher assistants.   Teachers were from New Zealand, South Africa, UK for daughters age. Instruction in English. Cons: $16k.  \*The other good schools that follow a more conventional US program are well over $30k tuition.
3. Stride K12 + Homeschool.  Continue with homeschooling since it went better than expected.

Homeschool context.  I really did not intend to homeschool my daughter this school year.  However because of personal and work reasons and the uncertainty of how long I needed to stay abroad; I decided to homeschool her using the Stride K12 platform.  It was only supposed to be a quarter and that became the semester, and now we’re just sticking to it to finish the school year.

There are definitely pros and cons to the Stride platform. My daughter can breeze through the daily curriculum. She gets everything done in about 3 hours. She has a tutor 3 days a week (5 hours each day) to help her with that work, but also teach her a second language and extra math. I teach her 2 days a week, 2+ hours on top of the Stride work. Reading, Science, Philosophy (Aristotle, Kant, Stoicism, etc), Math with Abacus, Scratch Jr for basic programming and storytelling. I've leaned extra heavily into AI (ChatGPT, MagicSchool.ai, Khan Academy) for teaching her and her learning. For exercise, I teach her Muay Thai kickboxing and HIIT. She goes to KPop dance class for exercise and socializing. Weekends are playdates with kids her age, and she hasn't shown any lack of social skills.  
 

I just thought I would seek input from different teachers on what you would do if you were in my shoes. I was also interested in hearing anecdotal stories or even case studies that may be relevant to my decision. How would US teachers rank the 3 options:sier. If I homeschool, then we can have extended stays in new cities, and I can just teach her there.

Among my peer group, I now receive some side-eye and hear people talking negatively behind my back for doing so. 

I just thought I would seek input from different teachers on what you would do if you were in my shoes. I was also interested in hearing anecdotal stories or even case studies that may be relevant to me deciding. How would US teachers rank the 3 options:

&#x200B;

1. US conventional school. Common core. Good school district. 23:1 student teacher ratio
2. Alternative Reggio school system. Foreign teachers. 12:1 student teacher ratio (+2 teacher assistants)
3. Homeschool. Online platform following Common Core. 1-on-1 tutoring with mastery learning.  "
1bt7oh9,1,2024-04-01,How Does StealthGPT’s AI Detector Work?,u/Financial_Key_2141,stealthgpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stealthgpt/comments/1bt7oh9/how_does_stealthgpts_ai_detector_work/,"StealthGPT has introduced its new offering: the free AI Checker. Engineered to transform our understanding and management of content legitimacy and purity, this sophisticated AI detector harnesses potent algorithms to conduct thorough analyses of written material, effectively discerning between content crafted by humans and that generated by artificial intelligence.

One of the most amazing features of this tool is its ability to pick up on even the smallest of clues that might not jump out at you right away. The way in which humans and computers string words together has its own unique characteristics. Computers may have a habit of repeating certain words or arranging their sentences in a way that makes their sentences sound a bit strange, for example.

Every time it examines a new piece of writing, it learns from the subtle differences and adds to its vast library of information. Understanding the subtle differences between what human writing sounds like and what a machine would produce is part of the process.

This tool is a game-changer if you want to know whether you're reading authentic content, whether you're an educator, a writer, or just someone fascinated by the blending of technology and language. Sharing and consuming stories and information with the unique touch that comes from human creativity is the best way to make sure they stay relevant.

1bte4g8,2,2024-04-01,"[PC] [2010ish] Cartoon Island Mystery, maybe educational",u/happytuna345,tipofmyjoystick,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmyjoystick/comments/1bte4g8/pc_2010ish_cartoon_island_mystery_maybe/,"Alright, I've been trying to find this game from my childhood. Google produces nothing, and I've given all these details to ChatGPT and it can't find anything like what I'm describing. I have put all the details I remember in the format below; I can try to clarify some things but this is mostly what I can recall.  
  
Platform(s): CD-ROM game I played on a Windows 7 desktop PC  
  
Genre: early 2000s children's CD game, might have been educational. We had it in a bin with other games like ClueFinders and Jumpstart. I'm half convinced it is from the JumpStart franchise but I haven't found it in catalogs of their games. I believe it took place on an Island and you were trying to solve a mystery, or at least discover what was going on.  
  
Estimated year of release: I played it around 2010, might have been released a bit before or after then.  
  
Graphics/art style: I feel like it was a 3D virtual environment with cartoony graphics where you could walk around to different buildings and locations. The people were proportional human cartoon characters. Some minigame screens were 2D. I describe a few examples of these graphics further down.  
  
Notable characters: I think the Island was run by teenagers of different specialties, kind of like the group of college students in Big Hero 6. A group of young people running the island and maybe doing science experiments. One of these characters was revealed to have an evil plot toward the end of the story, it was a stereotypically ""cool"" teenage boy with sunglasses.  
  
Notable gameplay mechanics: I remember you could enter one building and play a 2d bubble popping game, where you had a cannon in the bottom middle of the screen with different colored bubbles that you could fire sequentially. There were bubbles hanging from the ceiling you were trying to get rid of. for example: you shoot a blue bubble toward a cluster of blue bubbles. If you hit them, all of the blue bubble disappeared, kinda like candy crush.  
  
There might have been another area that was like a garden or animal enclosure, I just remember it was a kind of pit with green vegetation. This minigame I think was a 2d platformer arena, like a smash bro's arena.  
  
Other details: The finale to the game was a 3d cutscene. After you found out the boy with cool sunglasses was evil, you also find out he made a clone machine. He proceeds to create a clone army of himself (maybe like 100 clones). These clones then all melt down into a purple goop, that collects itself together into a large (as tall as a building), purple goopy hand. The hand tries to smash something maybe, I don't know how it is defeated, I just remember purple goop getting everywhere.  
  
Out of all this information, I am most confident about the purple hand ending and the bubble popping minigame. Hopefully I didn't mix details from different games, but i'm pretty sure the main details are accurate. Thanks for the help, I will reply if there are any clarifying questions. I hope someone out there knows what I'm talking about!"

1btjve5,1,2024-04-01," You’ve read the title, but have you read the post? (21M)",u/UnfairAcanthisitta23,MakeNewFriendsHere,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1btjve5/youve_read_the_title_but_have_you_read_the_post/,"No? I don’t blame you, my attention span also sucks, that’s because of the ADHD though. 

I’d tell you my name, but let’s keep the anonymity on that for the time being. I like to have that kind of barrier when I’ve spoken to deranged medical students and a woman who thought she could be physically turned into a car. I wish I was joking.

I’m from Minnesota. I’m Latino and bi. I’m also a Gemini and my MBTI is ENFJ. I study business in community college, I used to study sociology but then I dropped out of uni. Long story. I work as a server at a hotel for events such as weddings, birthday parties, business retreats. I love it and I hate it, the pay is why I’m still there. 

I love listening to music, my favorite genres are rap, r&b, and alternative rock. I love to write from fiction to journaling. I love pretty much art in general, traveling, learning new things, and going out. Also play video games, but I haven’t had much time lately. I feel like I can get along with anyone as long as you can put effort into the conversation lol.

Anywhere, anytime even in fullscreen with a simple shortcut. 30% off lifetime license",u/thievingfour,macapps,https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1btjyg4/student_discounts_monarch_v05_released_take_notes/,"[Taking notes to create a character guide while watching a Youtube video fullscreen](https://preview.redd.it/zd68b51ngyrc1.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd19046a66faa189854dbcdec33022d1d02ab04e)

Monarch v0.5 released this past weekend, and two of the new features (both suggested by users), are features that will drastically improve how fast you take notes and keep track of todos/reminders!

You can use Cmd+. (dot) to open Note Capture mode and immediately begin taking notes (in markdown). Because Monarch is a replacement for Spotlight Search, this means it works even if you are in fullscreen in another app, or watching a video/tutorial on YouTube, or following along in class on Zoom. Powerful note-taking is always a keystroke away and notes are automatically saved for you. The controls are very simple and what you'd expect. [Learn more here](https://blog.monarchlauncher.com/monarch-v0-5-take-notes-anywhere-with-markdown-b4f24affa505).

Because notes in Monarch are not written in a proprietary format, you can use documents you create in Monarch anywhere else or open documents from other sources in Monarch!

The second feature suggested by users was managing Reminders from Monarch. You can create reminders by using the ""Create Reminder"" command. Reminders created here will show up instantly across all your devices.

To manage reminders you've created, use the ""View Reminders"" command. Now you have an super fast search for all of your reminders and tasks, and you can mark them as complete or incomplete with Enter.

For those who like to work really fast like I do, you can create a reminder directly within the search by using ""r <space>"" and then the name of the task, and also use natural language to give it a due date. Add 1 to 3 exclamation points at the end to set the priority level to Low, Medium, or High. Here's an example:

1. Open Monarch
2. type r <space> and write: ""Call James to confirm reservation in 3 hours""
3. press Enter

That's it! Some of you may recognize some shades of Alfred here. Your most urgent reminder also shows up in the Monarch UI until you either complete it or hide it with Cmd+Shift+R. There are more features and upgrades, and you can learn more about them in the user manual linked below.

This is a great time to get in early and secure lifetime free updates and more importantly help shape the direction of the app. At this point, I've been using more features suggested by users more than the ones I thought of myself!

In case you're seeing Monarch for the first, time, here are some important mentions:

\- Not VC-backed, 100% user supported- No subscription. One-time purchase- Privacy-first. Zero telemetry, absolutely no data collection- Version 0.x licenses come with lifetime free updates (deal ends at v1.0)- Student discounts are available

I'm currently transitioning roadmap tools, so instead of a link I'll just share what's on the agenda, however discussion in the discord server + conversations with users means these are subject to change:

Next up:

1. Audio output manager
2. GPT4, Claude/Opus mode + AI commands & prompts (using your own API key)
3. Browser history search (opt-in setting, off by default)

The last thing I'll say is a big thank you to everyone who has supported thus far! Your continued support means that I'll be able to devote more time and refine things and hear suggestions to make the ultimate launcher! Download Monarch now and start taking notes the way you think: instantly!

I’d tell you my name, but let’s keep the anonymity on that for the time being. I like to have that kind of barrier when I’ve spoken to deranged medical students and a woman who thought she could be physically turned into a car. I wish I was joking.

I’m from Minnesota. I’m Latino and bi. I’m also a Gemini and my MBTI is ENFJ. I study business in community college, I used to study sociology but then I dropped out of uni. Long story. I work as a server at a hotel for events such as weddings, birthday parties, business retreats. I love it and I hate it, the pay is why I’m still there. 

I love listening to music, my favorite genres are rap, r&b, and alternative rock. I love to write from fiction to journaling. I love pretty much art in general, traveling, learning new things, and going out. Also play video games, but I haven’t had much time lately. I feel like I can get along with anyone as long as you can put effort into the conversation lol.

Others were like ""Oopsie, I don't like to write, so, yeah.""

My university doesn't have an official policy which is ridiculous. I'm wondering if others do?  And are you experiencing the same surge of this bullshit?

One student told me that's it's a ""trend"" on TikTok. Of course it is. I've been teaching for almost 30 years and never felt such resentment, rage and disgust with my students!"

1btuhku,1,2024-04-02,Openion on using Copilot/Gemini/ChatGPT while learning,u/luslypacked,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1btuhku/openion_on_using_copilotgeminichatgpt_while/,"I'm a pre-final year student who actively learning new-new tech stacks to build different different kind of projects and try out different stuff
Currently I use Gemini and other AI tools as a Google search replacement to learn and clarify my doubts as I'd do if I were to ask a normal person or with a Google search.

Me and my friend are working on a single full stack project and we have divided some work between us, today I saw him explaning me how good the VsCode Copilot extension works and to demonstrate he was even able to implement a function that took me fair share of 3hrs to understand and then implement, but he was able to do that in mere 30 seconds (I'm not kidding he just selected the function that he thought was responsible for the feature to work and asked Copilot to modify it )

I was dumbfounded, and still cannot believe that what took me 3 hours to implement the feature took him just 30 seconds (Not to mention the time I spent to learn that tech stack)

I'm now wondering if this is how things work nowadays ?
Don't get me wrong even I use Gemini and other tools but that's only to learn about stuff and maybe if i get stuck then ask them to probably help me solve it out.

I'm kind of lost now and don't know how shall I proceed to learn new things from now
Any suggestions and openions are welcome, please share your thoughts on this, I'd love to take as much insight as I can.


TL;DR (AI generated and isn't perfect, would suggest reading the full post)
AI code completion tools like Copilot worry me
I spend hours learning and coding, but my friend uses Copilot to do things in seconds.  Should I just rely on AI tools to learn and code?

I value learning and using AI tools for clarification, but Copilot seems too powerful.  Unsure if the traditional way of learning is still important.  Looking for advice on how to approach learning in the age of AI tools."
1btvbu2,5,2024-04-02,Are there any software-based tools to help me with my technique?,u/Notmyaltx1,snooker,https://www.reddit.com/r/snooker/comments/1btvbu2/are_there_any_softwarebased_tools_to_help_me_with/,"Beginner here, I’ve been reading Illustrated Principles and watching Barry Stark’s YouTube channel to learn the basics and then practicing at the local club. I’ve used ChatGPT to create a weekly lesson plan that spans 6 months that includes practice drills as an additional supplement to my previously mentioned learning sources. 

Now I’d like to actually see if what I’m doing is correct in regards to stance, grip, follow through etc. I’m having difficulty finding any image recognition software that’s specific for billiards that automatically gives me feedback based on the image/video it takes.  This results in me manually recording myself and then overlapping it with existing YouTube tutorials to compare my technique. 

Is there any resources out there I’m not aware of that would make my self-learning process more efficient? I’m aware I can just pay for a one-on-one with a coach but I’m limited to a strict budget as a full time university student."

1btzbc4,7,2024-04-02,Is this known in number theory?: Relationship between Safe primes and Cipolla pseudoprimes.,u/NorMathHS,numbertheory,https://www.reddit.com/r/numbertheory/comments/1btzbc4/is_this_known_in_number_theory_relationship/," [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GdXPTKpbNGJE0sCBsYIUNSC9uypX5caF/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GdXPTKpbNGJE0sCBsYIUNSC9uypX5caF/view?usp=sharing)

Dear number theorists, I found this relationship/observation in number theory and was wondering if this is common knowledge, someone else already has documentet it etc.

The observation:

From Fermat's little theorem one can extract the following function: F(x,n) = (x\^(n-1) -1)/(x\^2 -1). As shown in the attached paper.

If we have a Cipolla pseudoprime written as the following: (a\^2p - 1)/(a\^2 -1), one can observe that is the same as F(a,2p+1).

Given that 2p+1 is also a prime, a safe prime, and a(a\^2-1) is not divisible by 2p+1, one is guaranteed that F(a,2p+1), the cipolla pseudoprime, has the safe prime, 2p+1, as a divisor.

PS (If you read the document): I'm aware that I can use modular notation, as it might make it look cleaner.

My background:

I'm a 24 year old norwegian student currently writing a master thesis in a completely differnt subject, and do not possess formal education in number theory in any way, shape or form. Given that I'm currently writing a masters, I have not poured my soul in this document/paper yet, especially since I don't know for sure if it is even new, hence you would probably find spelling mistakes, and the documentation and references is not going to be perfect either. But the document/paper should provide the essence of what I'm trying to show.

I have asked my professors here, but since none of them works in number theory I didn't get far. I have also asked chatgpt and done some searches online on google scholar, arxiv and just google and didn't find this relationship. Which increases my hope, but given the simplicity I just assume that this has been known for the last 200 years or so.

I would like any feedback! If this is not known, where and how can I publish it (given that it is publishable)? This is probably is not groundbraking (if it isn't known), but I think this is an interesting observation, probably since I don't have any formal education in number theory. "
1btzy48,1,2024-04-02,Ultimate list of AI dungeon alternatives,u/Latter-Network4272,NSFWGenerators,https://www.reddit.com/r/NSFWGenerators/comments/1btzy48/ultimate_list_of_ai_dungeon_alternatives/," Before we jump in, to get the best AI NSFW image generator you can check out 

⭐⭐ [Seduced AI](https://www.seduced.ai/?ref=64e33cadb23fd08f0e4fe94b&src=aisexchat) ⭐⭐ 

Even though it is not an AI Dungeon alternative it generates the absolute best images.

&#x200B;

# The Updated List of AI Dungeon Alternatives: Top Choices for Interactive Fiction Fans

## The Big Three

These three alternatives are some of the most popular among the AI Dungeon community:

&#x200B;

| **Alternative** | **Description** |
|:-|:-|
| InferKit| An AI-based text generator tool that offers an app and web UI for generating text with artificial intelligence. It is not just for gamers but also for novelists and app developers. |
| ChatFAI | A unique AI chatbot that lets users interact with characters from various worlds, including movies, TV shows, cartoons, books, and science. It utilizes AI technology to craft realistic and engaging conversations. |
| Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead | A turn-based adventure game that is completely created, brutal, and permanent. It is known as one of the greatest and most interesting AI Dungeon alternatives. |

&#x200B;

(**Note: Further details on these alternatives are included in the next two sections.**)

## NovelAI

NovelAI is a paid alternative to AI Dungeon that offers multiple AI models. With a 100 output free trial, the service offers a lot of advanced features and has the most features of any alternative. It is likely the most popular alternative to AI Dungeon and has over 60k members on Discord, as well as around 28k on the subreddit. NovelAI is a great value for those willing to pay for a paid alternative. NovelAI can be accessed through their website.

## KoboldAI

KoboldAI is a free alternative to AI Dungeon that offers a range of features. It can be used as a frontend for running AI models locally with the KoboldAI Client, or you can use Google Colab or KoboldAI Lite to use certain AI models without running said models locally. With the Colab, the largest available models are finetuned versions of GPT-NeoX, while with KoboldAI Lite, the largest available models are finetuned versions of OPT-30B. The platform offers more features than any other free alternative.

KoboldAI can be accessed through various platforms, including the KoboldAI Client, Google Colab, and KoboldAI Lite. The platform also has a subreddit where users can discuss and share their experiences. Additionally, users can join the KoboldAI Discord community to connect with other users and get support.

## Dreamily

Dreamily is a popular free alternative to AI Dungeon that comes with a mobile app. Although it uses an unknown AI model, the outputs are decent for a free alternative. Dreamily offers a selection of different finetuned models to use, and the option to customize models, although this functionality is limited at the moment. One of the unique features of Dreamily is that it generates multiple outputs at once. For those interested in learning more, Dreamily has a website, Discord channel, and subreddit available for users to explore.

## NovelAI

NovelAI is a popular alternative to AI Dungeon that has many advanced features. It offers a three-tier monthly subscription system with prices ranging from $10 to $25 per month. NovelAI also provides a 100 output free trial with 50 outputs before and after making an account.

One of NovelAI's most notable features is its image generation using finetuned versions of Stable Diffusion, primarily meant for anime and furry images. It also has a currency called ""Anlas"" that is used for training modules and generating images.

Here is a breakdown of the subscription tiers:

&#x200B;

| **Subscription Tier** | **Price** | **Max Priority Actions per Week** | **Model Available** | **Context** | **Anlas per Month** |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1| $10 | 1000 | Euterpe | 1024 tokens | 1000 |
|2| $25 | 1000 | Euterpe | 2048 tokens | 1000 |
|3| $25 | Unlimited | Krake | 2048 tokens | 10000 |

&#x200B;

NovelAI also offers unlimited normal and small sized generations with the image generator. Small sized generations refer to images of up to 640x640 pixels and up to 28 steps when generating a single image.

Other notable features of NovelAI include:

&#x200B;

* Color-coded text to show whether it was generated by the AI, written by the user, or modified by the user.  
 
* Activation indicators for World Info entries (called Lorebook with NovelAI).  
 
* Customization options in the form of themes.  
 
* Text-to-speech capability.  
 
* ""Hypebots"" that can comment on events in stories.  
 

NovelAI has a website and subreddit, as well as a Discord server for users to connect and discuss.

## HoloAI

HoloAI is a program that runs various AI models inside an easy-to-use browser interface. It has taken into account privacy needs and has encrypted saving/loading. It is similar to NovelAI in many ways, as it offers multiple models for users. HoloAI offers two payment systems: a subscription or a-la-carte. One can get a $5 per month subscription for 500,000 characters or $8 per month for unlimited characters. It also offers a free trial of 8,000 characters to test out the service before purchasing. One can also pay $1 to add 40,000 characters to their account.

Every account will have access to a memory of 2048 tokens, as well as access to text-to-speech. As mentioned above, $12 per month subscribers have access to base Fairseq-13B and fine-tuned versions of GPT-NeoX. The $5 and $8 subscribers only have access to a fine-tuned version of GPT-J-6B.

One of the notable features of HoloAI is that users can generate multiple responses from the AI rather than having to retry multiple times. The length of a reply can be up to 500 characters compared to NovelAI's 400. Created stories have encrypted backups stored on the server called Holo history, allowing users to restore former versions of their works or copy them.

HoloAI also allows for the training of custom modules. The $8 tier provides 400 module training steps per month, while the $12 tier provides 2000. However, it should be noted that development of HoloAI has essentially come to a halt, and the developers are apparently looking for people to take over the project.

## Sudowrite

Sudowrite is an AI-writing assistant application that uses GPT-3 Davinci. It is the only GPT-3 Davinci application that is not heavily censored. The application is technically filtered to prevent astroturfing and sexual content involving minors, but most users should not have any issues. However, it is worth noting that the latter only started being filtered recently, and false flags might be an issue.

Sudowrite has three subscription tiers: ""Hobby & Student"", ""Professional"", and ""Max"". The ""Hobby & Student"" tier costs $19 per month if you pay monthly or $10 per month if you pay yearly. It allows users to generate 30k words per month. The ""Professional"" tier costs $29 per month if you pay monthly or $20 per month if you pay yearly. It allows users to generate 90k words per month. The ""Max"" tier costs $129 per month if you pay monthly or $100 per month if you pay yearly. It allows users to generate 300k words per month.

Unfortunately, Sudowrite is on the expensive side compared to some of the other alternatives on this list. It also lacks some features that are common among the other alternatives, such as no equivalents to World Info or Author's Note, although a World Info equivalent is planned.

Sudowrite has some interesting features, including options to come up with ideas, summarize text, reword text, generate feedback on the story, come up with plot twists, describe things, etc. It also generates multiple outputs at a time.

It is important to note that Sudowrite is not exactly designed for phones. It only works correctly while the browser is in desktop mode. However, it works perfectly fine on PC, and according to one of the co-founders, tablets.

Sudowrite offers a free trial, and users can cancel their subscription at any time.

The following table summarizes the pricing and subscription tiers of Sudowrite:

&#x200B;

| **Subscription Tier** | **Monthly Price (pay monthly)** | **Monthly Price (pay yearly)** | **Word Limit** |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| Hobby & Student | $19 | $10 | 30k |
| Professional | $29 | $20 | 90k |
| Max | $129 | $100| 300k |

&#x200B;

## OpenAI Playground

The OpenAI Playground is a platform that provides access to OpenAI's GPT-3 models. The pricing for the platform depends on the model used, and users can pay per token.

The platform offers a free trial, and new users receive $18 worth of tokens that they can use within three months of registering.

It is important to note that the OpenAI Playground is technically unfiltered, which means that users can generate any kind of content. However, violating OpenAI's content policy can lead to a ban.

While bans are not very common, it is still important to be aware of this policy. Creating an alt account is not as easy as with other applications, since a phone number is required to create an account.

The website for the OpenAI Playground is [https://platform.openai.com/playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground).

## Wordtune

Wordtune is an AI text rewriting application developed by AI21Labs. It has a very limited free tier, with a monthly subscription fee of $25 or $10 per month if paying yearly.

According to some users, it is a good application and its Jumbo-1 model is quite large at 178B parameters.

The website for Wordtune is [https://www.wordtune.com/](https://www.wordtune.com/).

## Endless Visual Novel (EndlessVN) -- In Open Alpha

Endless Visual Novel is a promising AI storytelling game that generates graphics, music, story, and characters as you play. It is currently in its Open Alpha phase and requires an account to play.

EndlessVN has a 30-day free trial and costs €9/€15 per month depending on the plan chosen.

The game generates text using GPT-J 6B and images with Stable Diffusion, while the music is generated using a variety of neural networks.

EndlessVN has a Discord community that is more active than its subreddit where players can stay up to date with the latest developments. The game's website provides further information and allows players to pre-register for the Open Alpha.

Here are some key points to note about EndlessVN:

&#x200B;

* Generates graphics, music, story, and characters using AI
* Has a 30-day free trial and costs €9/€15 per month depending on the plan chosen
* Generates text using GPT-J 6B and images with Stable Diffusion
* Music is generated using a variety of neural networks
* Has a Discord community that is more active than its subreddit
* Players can pre-register for the Open Alpha on the game's website

## ChatFAI

ChatFAI is an AI chatbot application that offers a wide range of features and subscription tiers. It has a similar feature set and business model to Chai, another popular AI chatbot application.

ChatFAI offers a free tier that allows users to send up to 100 messages per month and have up to 4 ongoing chats. It also offers three subscription tiers: Basic, Premium, and Deluxe. All subscription tiers allow users to create custom characters.

The Basic tier allows users to send up to 1500 messages per month and have up to 10 ongoing chats. The Premium tier allows users to send up to 5000 messages per month and have up to 25 ongoing chats. The Deluxe tier allows unlimited usage and up to 50 ongoing chats.

One of ChatFAI's unique selling points is that it uses large AI models with over 100B parameters, which theoretically should result in high-quality output. However, it is also one of the more expensive AI chatbot applications on the market.

## LitRPG Adventures

LitRPG Adventures is a relatively unknown AI-powered RPG content generator that is primarily aimed at generating ideas for RPGs. It uses fine-tuned GPT-3 models, GPT-Davinci, and Text-Davinci-003 to generate content.

The platform offers both free and paid generators, with the majority of the generators only accessible with a membership.

The pricing system for LitRPG Adventures is based on a paid credit system, with each credit allowing the generation of something with the AI. The platform also offers a monthly subscription to get a certain amount of credits per month, which starts at $3. Alternatively, users can purchase the contents of a subscription and 2,500 credits with a purchase of $25 dollars, which is usable for six months.

Any unused credits will carry over when your membership is renewed.

It should be noted that LitRPG Adventures doesn't work like any of the other AI-powered content generators on this list. None of the generators on the website allow for users to input text.

The application has a filter for adult content, although it should be basically unnoticeable given that you can't input any text that might cause the AI to generate adult content to begin with.

LitRPG Adventures offers a variety of generators, including a DND Backstory Generator, random dungeon generator, monster generator, spell generator, and more. The platform also has a Discord community where users can share their generated content and discuss various RPG-related topics.

Demonstration videos are available on Vimeo, showcasing the capabilities of the platform. The links to the website, Discord community, and demonstration videos are provided below:

## PhilosopherAI

PhilosopherAI is an AI application that uses GPT-3 Davinci to answer philosophical questions. It is priced at $3 per 10 queries and is presumed to use OpenAI's filter.

Users can access the application through its website or subreddit, r/PhilosopherAI.

## AIdventure

AIdventure is a flat-cost, locally-based option for those who do not like subscriptions. It requires a more powerful computer to properly run the software.

AIdventure also features an RPG-style stat system. Since its release, there have been quite a few updates, including GPU support for the AIs which helps to decrease generation times, automatic translation between different languages, and lore book/dictionary/world information implementation.

AIdventure is available on itch.io and Steam, and also has a Discord server.

While the developer admits that more testing is needed, the responses to the automatic translation feature are apparently decent.

It is worth noting that to date, there are no known alternatives that have automatic translations between different languages.

## AI Roguelite

AI Roguelite is a game that revolves around AI generation. It has a user interface that is set up like a roguelite/roguelike game and uses Stable Diffusion for image generation.

The game has all the features that one would expect from an AI text generator. Users can run the models locally or use the Kobold Horde/Stable Horde to generate text and images. NovelAI Opus subscribers can also use NovelAI's image generation feature with AI Roguelite.

The game can be purchased for a one-time fee of $9.

For more information about AI Roguelite, visit the game's Steam page or subreddit.

## ScatterNote

ScatterNote is an AI-powered note-taking and idea management app that generates stories and insights from web-connected ideas and thoughts. Unlike AIDungeon, ScatterNote is not a game, but rather a productivity tool that uses GPT-2 to create content and stories.

Users can write down their ideas and connect them with bits of string, and then allow the AI to walk the links between notes to generate stories.

ScatterNote runs on a subscription-based model, but the app offers a 14-day free trial before committing to a subscription. The subscription ranges from $4.99 to $29.99, according to the Play Store page.

While ScatterNote's output may not be as good as that generated by AIDungeon, NovelAI, or HoloAI, it offers a unique approach to AI storytelling that may appeal to writers and creatives looking for a new way to generate ideas and stories.

## KoboldAI

KoboldAI is a free alternative to AI Dungeon that offers a range of features, including multiplayer, making it one of the most comprehensive free alternatives available.

The platform can be used as a frontend for running AI models locally with the KoboldAI Client, or users can use Google Colab or KoboldAI Lite to access certain AI models without running the models locally.

It is important to note that running AI models locally with KoboldAI is only an option on PC, while Google Colab and KoboldAI Lite work perfectly fine on both PC and mobile devices.

With Google Colab, the largest available models are finetuned versions of GPT-NeoX, while the models available on KoboldAI Lite depend on what volunteers are providing.

The KoboldAI subreddit and Discord server are also available for users to connect with other users and get support.

## Dreamily

Dreamily is a popular free alternative to AI Dungeon. It offers a mobile app, making it convenient for users to generate text on-the-go.

Although the AI model used by Dreamily is unknown, the outputs are fairly decent for a free alternative. The developer mentioned that the model used is smaller than GPT-Neo 1.3B, but this information may be outdated.

Dreamily offers a selection of different finetuned models to choose from. It also has the option to train custom models, although this functionality is currently limited.

Dreamily generates multiple outputs at once, providing users with a variety of options to choose from. 

The service is available in two versions: an English option and a Chinese version, which requires users to sign in and has stricter output monitoring.

The Chinese version of Dreamily requires a login and is closely monitored.

Users can access Dreamily's English version through their website and join their Discord community to stay updated. Dreamily also has a subreddit dedicated to discussions and updates, making it easy for users to connect with each other and share their experiences.

Here are some links to access Dreamily:

## TextSynth

TextSynth is a website that provides free and uncensored access to several AI models, including GPT-J 6B, Fairseq-13B, GPT-NeoX, Codegen-6B-mono, and M2M100 1.2B. Additionally, a finetuned version of GPT-J 6B meant for French is also available. However, Stable Diffusion is not uncensored.

Free users are subject to a rate limit, and the AI is limited to generating up to 200 tokens at a time. 

Users can also pay per token, with pricing varying depending on the AI model used. Paying per token removes the rate limit and output length limit, but the website is lacking in features.

The TextSynth Playground can be found at [https://textsynth.com/playground.html](https://textsynth.com/playground.html).

## Inferkit

Inferkit is a web-based text generator tool that utilizes Megatron-11B, an open-source AI model designed for natural language processing. According to the official website, it is suitable for both novelists and app developers alike.

The tool offers a free version that allows users to generate up to 10,000 characters per week, while the paid versions offer more monthly characters. The $20 subscription provides 600k monthly characters, and the $60 subscription provides 2.5 million monthly characters.

It is worth noting that there is no in-program or online saving function built into Inferkit, which means that there is no filter or any ability for the contents to be leaked. Users must save their outputs manually.

Some users have also experienced issues using gift cards/certain credit cards for payment, but it is unclear if this is still an issue.

## Pygmalion

Pygmalion AI models were created to provide an uncensored alternative to applications like CharacterAI and ChatGPT, primarily meant to be used as chatbots. The models are compatible with KoboldAI and TavernAI. The Pygmalion models seem to be pretty decent.

However, the Google Colab for Pygmalion was taken offline, and the current options for using the Pygmalion models without running them locally are the KoboldAI Google Colab, KoboldAI Lite, the Oobabooga Google Colab, and AgnAIstic.

Users can find a guide and FAQ for Pygmalion AI on [https://rentry.org/pygmalion-ai](https://rentry.org/pygmalion-ai). 

The Oobabooga Google Colab is available at [https://colab.research.google.com/github/oobabooga/AI-Notebooks/blob/main/Colab-TextGen-GPU.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/oobabooga/AI-Notebooks/blob/main/Colab-TextGen-GPU.ipynb). 

PygmalionAI is also available on HuggingFace at [https://huggingface.co/PygmalionAI](https://huggingface.co/PygmalionAI). 

Users can also join the PygmalionAI subreddit at r/PygmalionAI or the PygmalionAI Discord at [https://discord.gg/ZHXEa3yywq](https://discord.gg/ZHXEa3yywq).

## Chai

Chai is a chatbot application that allows users to create and customize their own bots to chat with. It uses GPT-J 6B and Fairseq-13B for $30 subscribers. 

Chai is available on the Google Play Store and App Store, as well as a web version, although the web version seems to be lacking some features of the app versions.

The application has a free version, but usage is limited, and an ad plays when starting a new conversation. Free users can only send a certain amount of messages over a certain amount of time before their message limit resets.

However, the number of messages and how long they take to reset seems completely random.

There are three subscription plans for Chai: Free, $12, and $30 per month. $12 subscribers get ad-free, unlimited use, while $30 subscribers get access to Fairseq-13B.

However, a Chai subscription may not be worthwhile. For a lower price, users could purchase a NovelAI subscription and use TavernAI as a frontend if they want a UI and features more similar to those of Chai. 

This option offers more features, more powerful AI models, and better privacy at a lower price than a Chai subscription. However, TavernAI is exclusive to PC and requires some setup.

Users can also upload bots, and there is a page to find bots other users have uploaded. 

Bot creators can read the most recent conversations that users have had with their bots. The creator won't see the user's username or anything, but this means that it is crucial not to put personal information or anything else that users do not want people reading in their Chai conversations. 

If users want their conversations to be private, they can make their bots.

## AgnAIstic

AgnAIstic is an online frontend that allows users to utilize several AI models with a Chatbot-style interface. It is compatible with NovelAI, KoboldAI, OpenAI, Chai, and the AI Horde. Users can access AgnAIstic through its website or Github repository.

## AnimaAI

AnimaAI is an AI chatbot application that allows users to create and train an AI to chat with, represented by a customizable 3D avatar. 

The application is available for free on the website, but some cosmetic customization options and the ""romantic partners"" status are locked behind a subscription. The subscription also allows unlimited usage of the AI.

AnimaAI is similar to Replika in terms of UI and feature set. However, the monthly subscription might not be recommended, but the yearly and lifetime subscriptions are relatively cheap compared to other applications on the list.

## Nastia

Nastia is a relatively new AI chatbot application that is currently free to use. Its character creation options are most comparable to those of Replika, and although it's unclear what AI model it uses, the output quality seems pretty decent from testing. 

The website indicates that the application will be monetized in the future, but for now, it remains entirely free. A mobile app is also planned for the future.

Here is some relevant information about Nastia:

## ChatGPT

ChatGPT is an AI chatbot application developed by OpenAI. The application utilizes OpenAI's content filter to enforce their content policy. It's notable for providing high-quality outputs, especially for a free application. However, the application has some privacy concerns. 

Interested users can access the application through its website, [https://chat.openai.com/chat](https://chat.openai.com/chat).

## CharacterAI

CharacterAI is an AI chatbot application developed by two former Google employees who worked on Google's LaMDA model. It uses an undisclosed AI model and stands out for its ability to create and train ""characters"" to chat with. 

However, it disallows NSFW content and has some privacy concerns. 

The website for CharacterAI is [https://beta.character.ai/](https://beta.character.ai/).

## Replika

Replika is an AI chat companion application. It allows users to create and train a character to chat with. It uses GPT-3 to generate text. The app also has voice chat and a customizable 3D avatar to represent your Replika, among other features. Replika is available on PC, iOS, and Android platforms.

The application was previously known for allowing NSFW content for paid users. However, the developers have since removed this feature due to legal issues with Italy's Data Protection Agency. The removal of NSFW content has affected intimate roleplay with the AI, as some users have reported. It is important to note that Luka, the company behind Replika, has had a history of being less than transparent with its community.

Replika has a website, app store, play store, web version, and subreddit for users to access. The app is available for free. There's also an option to purchase a subscription for $70 annually with microtransactions.

Below is a table that summarizes the key features of Replika:

  Features Description     AI chat companion Users can create and train a character to chat with   GPT-3 Uses GPT-3 to generate text   Voice chat Allows users to chat with their Replika using voice   Customizable 3D avatar Users can customize the appearance of their Replika   Platforms Available on PC, iOS, and Android   NSFW content Previously allowed for paid users, but has since been removed   Pricing Free with the option to purchase a subscription for $70 annually with microtransactions    

## Poe

Poe is an AI chatbot designed by Quora. It uses multiple AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic. Although heavily censored, Poe's outputs are generally good. Users can access Poe through its website at [https://poe.com/](https://poe.com/).

## Pirr

Pirr is an AI writing assistant that specializes in generating erotica. It uses a simple regex filter to disallow violent, racist, incestuous, abusive, non-consensual, and underage content. While the output quality is decent, false positives are not uncommon. The website for Pirr is [https://pirr.app/](https://pirr.app/).

## TavernAI

TavernAI is a user interface that replicates the features of CharacterAI. It serves as a frontend for NovelAI, KoboldAI, and Pygmalion. Additionally, users can import CAI chats into TavernAI. Users can access TavernAI on Github and join their Discord community for support.

## AI Tales

AI Tales is a phone application that offers AI-generated storytelling and picture generation. It has a good amount of creative freedom, including scenario creation as a $5 option. The app runs on private, internal servers, ensuring that there is no censorship from outside sources. The application requires an adult check (are you 18 years old?) for access.

Currently, AI Tales is available on iOS or Android devices. There might be a future PC version. The application is available for a one-time purchase of $5 or for free.

## Project Electric Sheep

Project Electric Sheep is a dream simulator game that utilizes GPT-3 to generate dialogue and books. Players input what they want to dream about and the game randomly generates 3D environments, characters, and dialogue based on the input. It is quite different from AI Dungeon and is focused on creating dream-like experiences for the player. The game's website can be found at [https://www.projectelectricsheep.com/](https://www.projectelectricsheep.com/) and their Twitter handle is @AIelectricsheep.

## Anticthon

Anticthon is an MMORPG that uses AI-generated character dialogue and other elements powered by GPT-3. It is different from AID in that it is designed to be a game with AI-generated content. Rather Good Games is the creator of Anticthon. They have a website where the game can be accessed. Additionally, the creator's YouTube channel has footage and other content related to the game.

## Cost Comparison

When it comes to paid alternatives to AI Dungeon, NovelAI seems to be the most popular and affordable option. It offers a lot of advanced features and fairly good AI models, making it a great value for the price.

HoloAI, on the other hand, is cheaper than NovelAI but is generally worse in most other aspects. Meanwhile, KoboldAI has come a long way in the past year or so and is arguably better than HoloAI at this point.

Therefore, people considering HoloAI should try out KoboldAI as well and come to their own conclusions on whether or not HoloAI is worth paying for.

Sudowrite is another paid alternative that offers some of the best outputs among alternatives that are not heavily censored. It also has some unique features that are not found in other alternatives. However, it is relatively expensive, especially if paid monthly, and has limitations on usage. Additionally, it is missing some features that are common among other alternatives.

Inferkit, in the author's opinion, is not worth paying for at this point. While it may be a free alternative, if one is willing to pay $20 or more per month, NovelAI, HoloAI, or Sudowrite would be better options.

AIdventure is a relatively affordable option, with a one-time purchase of $12. However, its main appeal seems to be the stat system. If that does not appeal to the user, then KoboldAI or another paid alternative may be a better choice. It is worth noting that AIdventure currently limits users to using relatively weak AI models.

1bu375p,2,2024-04-02,Is this known in number theory?: Relationship between Safe primes and Cipolla pseudoprimes.,u/NorMathHS,learnmath,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/1bu375p/is_this_known_in_number_theory_relationship/,"[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GdXPTKpbNGJE0sCBsYIUNSC9uypX5caF/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GdXPTKpbNGJE0sCBsYIUNSC9uypX5caF/view?usp=sharing)

Dear number theorists, I found this relationship/observation in number theory and was wondering if this is common knowledge, someone else already has documentet it etc.

The observation:

From Fermat's little theorem one can extract the following function: F(x,n) = (x\^(n-1) -1)/(x\^2 -1). As shown in the attached paper.

If we have a Cipolla pseudoprime written as the following: (a\^2p - 1)/(a\^2 -1), one can observe that is the same as F(a,2p+1).

Given that 2p+1 is also a prime, a safe prime, and a(a\^2-1) is not divisible by 2p+1, one is guaranteed that F(a,2p+1), the cipolla pseudoprime, has the safe prime, 2p+1, as a divisor.

PS (If you read the document): I'm aware that I can use modular notation, as it might make it look cleaner.

My background:

I'm a 24 year old norwegian student currently writing a master thesis in a completely differnt subject, and do not possess formal education in number theory in any way, shape or form. Given that I'm currently writing a masters, I have not poured my soul in this document/paper yet, especially since I don't know for sure if it is even new, hence you would probably find spelling mistakes, and the documentation and references is not going to be perfect either. But the document/paper should provide the essence of what I'm trying to show.

I have asked my professors here, but since none of them works in number theory I didn't get far. I have also asked chatgpt and done some searches online on google scholar, arxiv and just google and didn't find this relationship. Which increases my hope, but given the simplicity I just assume that this has been known for the last 200 years or so.

I would like any feedback! If this is not known, where and how can I publish it (given that it is publishable)? This is probably is not groundbraking (if it isn't known), but I think this is an interesting observation, probably since I don't have any formal education in number theory."
1bu6s3r,3,2024-04-02,"Bimodal test results, but the fails are bad",u/TheImpatientGardener,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1bu6s3r/bimodal_test_results_but_the_fails_are_bad/,"This is half-vent half-looking for advice.

I teach a language at good (non-American, so I don't know the R number thing) university. On my most recent test, half the students scored B+ or higher, and half scored Fs. One or two got a D or a C.

Normally I aim to have the average around a B or B+, but the average for this test is 55% - a D. 

The vent: 

The Fs are all in the 20-30% range, so not a close call. Most of them left entire questions or sections blank. I told them before the test that I can't mark what isn't there, so they should try and at least put something down. I gave them examples: if they can't remember a particular verb but can remember the ending, they can put ""X-ending"", and get the mark for knowing the ending, etc. 

The marks on the test are evenly split between specific grammatical and/or vocab questions (fill in the blank, spot the error, translate, etc.) and open-ended writing questions. The specific questions are 75% drawn verbatim or near-verbatim from their weekly quizzes, which I have repeatedly encouraged them to go over and have taken up in class. I let them ask questions before the test and the answers to one or two of the specific questions came up naturally, so I went over them in detail and \*heavily\* hinted that they should understand the concept for the test. For the open-ended questions, as long as they meet the word count and can mostly make themselves understood, I'm happy to give a B. If they can do so creatively and with good grammar, I will give an A. 

Unsurprisingly, the fails are all from students who have done badly on quizzes but not asked for any help and either don't come to class or come and spend the time doing something else. They blatantly use ChatGPT and Google Translate on quizzes despite me explaining why it's not a good idea either from a learning standpoint or from a marks standpoint (these tools are terrible at producing the target language; we have used their output in class as an exercise in critiquing and correcting). Some of the students don't know the alphabet of the target language properly after 12 weeks of using it.

In short, I really feel like I've done what I can to set them up for success and they're just not taking the opportunity. I guess I feel hurt (like what I'm doing is a waste of time) and frustrated, and I don't understand why they wouldn't put in a modicum of effort to try not to fail.

The advice seeking:

I don't think the test was too hard, since about half of them got high Bs and As. However, I'm concerned that the average is so low. Should I do something about this? If so, what?

I'm reluctant to let them take the test home and correct it for marks, because I think they're getting better at cheating and/or they could just get a native speaker to look at it. We are also only a week away from the end of term and I can't spend too much time on this. 

I'm reluctant to curve it because I don't think it's fair to the students who did well. 

I don't want to waste hours giving and grading an alternative assignment that these students are probably also going to fail at because of their approach to this class all semester.

So do I just leave it and explain all this to my chair if he mentions it, and take the inevitable hit on course evaluations? Or is there some super speedy and easy (for me) way to give these students an opportunity to make up their grade?"
1bu80ls,2,2024-04-02,Do MSc courses teach much?,u/ginnappinmmotion,UniUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/1bu80ls/do_msc_courses_teach_much/,"Today I started a 4-day tech work experience programme at a local company. The other participants in the work experience are MSc students doing courses like Computer Science, Data Science, Project Management, etc.

Our task for this afternoon was to solve a coding challenge using Python in paired programming. I was paired with an MSc computer science student. He told me that he was currently on his second year of his master’s degree, that he has done all of the coursework modules as well as a placement where he used Python a lot and that he is currently working on his dissertation.

I was like, great this is going to be a piece of cake then because I’ve only been self-learning using CS50. So we decided that since he is far more experienced, that he would be the one guiding me during paired programming and that I would be following him and typing the code out.

I proposed to first breakdown the challenge into a step-by-step algorithm. He insisted that it was not needed because he knew what he was doing and to trust him. Needless to say that it was a disaster from the get-go. The guy didn’t even know how to comment in python! I started adding #’s to add comment and he was asking me why I was adding that symbol and that it was going to break the code. WTF! We then ran the code that he instructed me with a while loop in the code. I suggested that we needed to break the while loop, otherwise the code would be stuck inside it and it won’t run the subsequent code. He didn’t believe me so we ran the code and lo and behold, the code was stuck inside of the while loop.

We ended up switching roles in paired programming after 15 minutes because he was driving me insane

Honestly, what on earth is being taught during MSc courses, this stuff is now taught at GCSE / A level!

Maybe is too much reliance on googling, copy pasting, and chatgpt where students aren’t actually learning and just doing enough to submit assignments and pass modules?"

# Reddit Post Objective:

My objective with this post boils down to seeking two key elements: guidance and accountability. ""I know that I know nothing"" (Plato) when it comes to navigating the journey to 'un-loserify' myself. For countless years, I've been on a relentless journey of self-improvement, yet the returns have been disappointing, primarily because I've been traversing this path alone. As a human species, our journey to this point has not been one of isolation, but rather, it's been fueled by our collective nature. So, my first step is this: Tapping into the hive mind of diverse experiences and lessons learned from the collective wisdom of the r/selfimprovement community. I also recognize the importance of being held accountable for my actions. Knowing that I'll face scrutiny and perhaps even shame if I fail to stick to my goals serves as a powerful motivator for me to strive for improvement. Whether this drive is fueled by fear or ego is beside the point; what matters is that it pushes me to do better. Perhaps I  don't respect myself enough to pursue my goals solely under my own judgment. However, I hold onto the hope that as I continue to change my behaviours, my mindset will evolve accordingly over time.  


# Context: 

I am a 20-year-old, male, person of color (POC) from New Zealand, from a low socio-economic background. Additionally, I am a first-generation university student.  


**University background:**

I graduated from high school in 2021 and embarked on a full-time university study doing engineering. However, I encountered a severe mental health breakdown, which led to my academic failure, prompting me to question if engineering was indeed my calling. After taking a year-and-a-half break, I sought guidance from a government-provided over-the-phone careers counselor for a month. Encouraged by their advice, I returned to studies, this time pursuing biology. Unfortunately, I encountered the same challenge of managing coursework effectively and mental health issues. Instead of abandoning my studies, I made the decision to withdraw from those courses via a late deletion. Taking some time to reassess, I sought help from a university support worker. I opted to pursue a part-time study, focusing on two courses that genuinely interested me: a psychology paper and a biology paper. However, I must admit that I am currently struggling to keep up with the biology lectures, and I have already missed a crucial course quiz worth 16%.

**^(TL;DR: Started engineering in 2021, faced mental health issues, switched to biology after counseling, messed that up too but now doing part time, still struggling.)**

&#x200B;

**Mental Health:**

I've grappled with mental health challenges for as long as I can remember, and I believe they may be rooted in my upbringing or inherited trauma passed down through generations. These struggles manifest in various ways, including visual hallucinations that distort my surroundings, with their intensity escalating in tandem with my stress levels. Additionally, I experience auditory hallucinations that become more pronounced during times of heightened stress.

Depression/ low mood has been a constant companion since I was just 10 years old, and suicidal ideation/ thoughts have been a recurring thought pattern over those years. I often find myself plunged into deep depressive episodes where I feel utterly immobilized, unable to muster the energy or motivation to do anything at all. While I haven't experienced one of these episodes recently, knock on wood, I've been grappling with a persistent sense of apathy and lack of drive in my daily life. I've been navigating a complex journey through various mental health professionals, from counsellors to psychiatrists to doctors, for quite some time now. Currently, I'm under the care of a psychologist who is assisting me in exploring potential diagnoses such as autism, ADHD, or bipolar disorder. However, it seems that bipolar disorder might have been ruled out due to the absence of consistent patterns in the fluctuations of my mood, both highs and lows. Still could be something we might circle back to. I also struggle with chronic procrastination, which I suspect may stem from a combination of feeling overwhelmed and shutting down, or perhaps reaching a point where I lose motivation because I doubt the worthiness of the task at hand because of the lack of benefit or even doubt in my own abilities or perhaps, it self-sabotage. Probably because deep down, I fear the responsibilities and expectations that come with success or because I struggle with feelings of unworthiness. It's as if I've convinced myself that I deserve to struggle, that it's where I belong, and stepping out of that comfort zone is daunting. 

I also grapple with undiagnosed dyslexia, which significantly affects my ability to read and write. This condition has been a contributing factor to my struggles in university, particularly due to my low working memory. However, I've managed to find tools and shortcuts to navigate this challenge, such as utilizing ChatGPT for assistance in composing this post.

**^(TL;DR: Long-standing mental health challenges include visual and auditory hallucinations, depression/ low mood since age 10, and persistent suicidal thoughts. Currently exploring diagnoses like autism, ADHD, or bipolar disorder with a psychologist. Chronic procrastination may stem from feeling overwhelmed, doubting tasks' worthiness, or fearing success. Also grappling with undiagnosed dyslexia, affecting reading and writing, but finding ways to cope, like using ChatGPT for assistance.)**

&#x200B;

**Motivations:**

Truth be told, I harbour a deep-seated hatred toward myself. I fucking hate myself. I don't even have respect for the man I've become. Before I continue, I want to acknowledge that as you read this, you may initially dismiss my concerns as exaggerated or attribute them to youthful naivety. However, I believe these moments hold deep significance because they compound over time, revealing flaws within my character that I struggle to outgrow.

The pain from past relationships runs deep. I was in a committed relationship from 15 to 18, and I truly cared for her. But at 16, she started flirting with an older guy, which hurt me deeply when I found out a year later. We stayed together for a while, but she eventually left me for someone else during my first mental health breakdown. Her reasons were crushing: she believed I had peaked in high school, wasn't making progress in life, and labelled me as toxic. She didn't have respect for me anymore. The reasons she gave were crushing, yet they struck a chord of truth. I've realized that I haven't been moving forward in life, and I do acknowledge that I have exhibited some toxic and controlling behaviours that require significant introspection and improvement. Not long after, I met a girl online whom I began dating when she travelled to see me. She wasn't exactly my type initially, but somehow, I found myself deeply in love with her. Our relationship lasted for six months, but the challenges of long-distance took their toll, leading to ups and downs. Eventually, she ended things and provided me with a list of reasons, but ultimately, it all seemed to boil down to a fundamental lack of respect. The lyric from the song ""Still"" by Ben Folds, ""I must give the impression That I have the answers for everything You were so disappointed To see me unravel so easily,"" sums up how I feel.

It's been a recurring theme in my life that the women I've been involved with don't seem to respect me. On the surface, I don't consider myself unattractive, and I believe I possess a genuine sense of compassion and understanding. Additionally, I believe my ability to articulate myself may create the impression of competence that draws them in. However, as they get to know me better, or perhaps when they see through the facade, it becomes evident that my perceived competence doesn't match reality. It seems that their tolerance for enduring this disparity gradually diminishes over time. I lack competence, especially when it comes to navigating life's challenges. While I may carry myself in a way that's perceived as masculine, when it comes down to it, I struggle to assert myself and tackle life's obstacles effectively. I believe my lack of competence may stem from a combination of factors rooted in my upbringing. Firstly, my culture is inherently collectivist rather than individualistic, which may have hindered my development of assertiveness and independence. Additionally, I was raised by a young mother who sheltered me and a father who, while present, didn't involve me in the masculine activities that I would have desired. As a result, I may have missed opportunities to learn and practice essential life skills that contribute to a sense of competence and self-assurance.

In a lecture by Jordan Peterson, he emphasized the importance of aiming to be a useful person at your father's funeral. Currently, my father may face a critical surgery that could potentially prevent him from working, given that his occupation involves physical labour. There's also the grim possibility that the surgery could go wrong, leading to the death of my father, both literally and metaphorically. At this moment, I don't feel equipped to step into the role of being the supportive figure that Peterson describes.

I find myself growing jealous of those around me, particularly when I see my close friend and my ex-girlfriend's sibling both owning the car I had my heart set on despite being younger than me. It's a stark reminder of how far behind I am, as if I'm moving at a snail's pace while everyone else is effortlessly progressing. I'm constantly lagging behind, struggling to keep up with the pace of life. It's like I'm stuck in slow motion or running underwater. Despite knowing that ""everyone is within their own timezone"" and that life isn't a race, I can't shake the desire to be ""normal."" Throughout my life, I've felt slower than my peers in every aspect—actions, goals, and tasks take me almost double the time to accomplish. It's a challenging reality to confront, feeling mentally and physically slower than those around me.

I often find myself feeling like others are seizing life, constantly embarking on new experiences and adventures while I remain stagnant. While I acknowledge that comparing oneself to others can be detrimental in some cases, I don't think it's entirely negative. In fact, I believe it can serve as a valuable reference point, helping us gauge where we are in life and how much further we have to go. It provides insight into our progress and motivates us to strive for growth and improvement.

I hate when someone asks me, ""What do you do?"" or ""Tell me about yourself,"" I find myself drawing a blank. The truth is, I feel like I do nothing like I'm a loser. I struggle to see myself as an interesting person worth talking about.

I can't help but feel frustrated when I walk past expensive cars and big houses. It raises questions in my mind: How did they achieve this level of success? Why is it that my family struggles to pay bills while these people can seemingly throw money around without a second thought? What do they know that I don't? It makes me so mad and spiteful towards the world.

**^(TL;DR: Deep self-hatred rooted in past relationship failures and perceived lack of progress. Struggles with toxic behaviors, feelings of incompetence, and jealousy towards others' successes. Facing potential father's health crisis adds to feelings of inadequacy. Constantly comparing progress to peers, feeling slow and stagnant. Difficulty defining oneself and experiencing frustration and resentment towards societal success disparities.)**

# Character flaws

Like a character in a book, I recognize that I have my own set of flaws that hinder my quality of life, and I'm determined to overcome them.

**Chronic procrastination:**

I tend to procrastinate and leave everything to the last minute, but identifying the root cause has proven elusive. It could be a combination of feeling overwhelmed by the tasks, leading to overthinking and ultimately doing fuck all. Alternatively, it might be a form of self-sabotage, hindering my progress towards achieving positive outcomes. Another factor could be my poor perception of time/ time blindness; I struggle to grasp how long tasks will take or accurately gauge the passage of time.

I was perplexed by how I spent my time, so from August 13, 2023, to October 27, 2023, I diligently utilized an app called Boosted to track all my activities throughout the day, excluding sleep. While I recognize that some time has elapsed since then, I believe my daily routines have remained relatively consistent, allowing you to draw insights from this data to make further assessments. However, I eventually discontinued using the app due to occasional lapses in tracking, which could have compromised the accuracy of the data.

**^(TL;DR: Struggles with procrastination stem from feeling overwhelmed, potential self-sabotage, and poor time perception. Tracked activities from August to October 2023 reveal time allocation.)**

**Total Time: 1092 hours**   
**18%** = Time spent with my ex-partner (calls, travel time to see her when she visited, and time spent together)   
**12%** = Time spent on my phone   
**9%** = Gym

**> 1%** = Gaming  
**> 1%** = Appointments  
**> 1%** = Driving  
**> 1%** = Praying   


**Existing and not living:**

I feel like I'm merely existing, not truly living. This sentiment was echoed by two of my friends, affirming its truth. I find myself in a state of waiting, unsure of what exactly I'm waiting for anymore. I've become stagnant, devoid of any meaningful action. This stillness is unsettling; it evokes my deepest fear of death, as being still is akin to a form of death itself. It's as if I'm just a dead man breathing.

**^(TL;DR: Feels like I'm just existing, not living fully. Friends agree. Stuck waiting, unsure why. Stagnant, no meaningful action. Stillness feels like death.)**

&#x200B;

**Unloved:**

I feel unloved as if my incompetence and lack of usefulness provide no grounds for anyone to love me, whether platonically or romantically. I don't think love is unconditional; I can't help but feel that I haven't met the conditions for it. It may sound silly, but I found myself jealous of my cat, observing how much love my family showered upon him despite him being a cat and doing nothing. It made me realize that my desire to improve myself stems from a deep longing to be loved—not just by others but also by myself.

**^(TL;DR: Feel unloved due to incompetence and lack of usefulness. Love is conditional. Jealous of cat's unconditional love. Desire to improve stems from longing for love, from both others and self.)**

&#x200B;

**Lagging behind others:**

I feel perpetually stuck in my first year of university, watching as each year, my peers seem to get younger and younger. Here I am at 20 years old, sitting in a biology lab surrounded by 17-year-olds. It's incredibly embarrassing, especially considering that I feel like I know nothing compared to them. Despite my efforts and only doing half of the courses they have, they still seem to be doing better. 

**^(TL;DR: Feel stuck in first year of university at 20, surrounded by younger peers. Embarrassed and inadequate compared to them despite efforts)**

&#x200B;

**Incompetence:**

I feel like a complete fuckup. There are instances I hesitate even to mention that highlight my incompetence, causing me to physically cringe. It's as if I'm constantly making mistakes, lacking basic common sense. It's as though there's a prerequisite fundamental beginner's guide to life that I somehow missed and nobody told me. 

**^(TL;DR: Feel like a failure, embarrassed by incompetence and constant mistakes. Like missed out on basic life knowledge.)**

&#x200B;

**No purpose:**

I feel lost and uncertain about my future path. Initially, I thought I desired wealth, power, or status, but now I question whether these aspirations stem from my true desires or from my ego's need to prove something. Ultimately, what I truly seek is happiness. I want to engage in meaningful work that positively impacts others' lives while also excelling in my endeavours and finding joy in the process. Most importantly, I want to maintain autonomy and not feel controlled by my career choices. In a talk shared by Ajahn Brahm, a Buddhist monk, he posed the question, 'What's the difference between a monastery and a prison?' It's choice. ""Prison is actually more comfortable, the monastery is much harsher. What's the difference? The only difference is in a monastery people want to be there. In a prison, doesn't matter how comfortable it is, people don't want to be there"" Perhaps my path won't lead to immense wealth but rather to genuine happiness. I value the idea of being content with what I do, even if it means not achieving extreme riches. In saying that, I also view it as a selfish act. I owe it to my family to acquire wealth to provide them with a life they might never live. Building on this concept, I feel as if the life I live is a prison. I don't find joy in being within the vessel of my body and seeing life through my eyes. 

**^(TL;DR: Feeling lost about future goals. Originally sought wealth, power, or status but now question true desires. Want happiness through meaningful work, autonomy, and joy in the process. Realizing the importance of choice and contentment over extreme riches. Also, feeling a sense of duty to provide for family but questioning personal fulfillment.)**  


**No financial literacy:**

Not much to say. I lack financial literacy and have no savings. I'm broke.

&#x200B;

**No job:**

I had a full-time job for a little while, but I hated it. Between the shifts, commute, and gym sessions, I only had about 10 minutes to myself each day, usually during dinner. I can't go back to that again. I blanked out during that period; it felt like I was on autopilot the whole time.

I want a part-time job that I genuinely enjoy, working with people I like. It's important to me to find something interesting; I don't think I can handle working in retail, fast food, or as a receptionist. There's this False dilemma that my family has created, and maybe among others too, that you can't enjoy your job while still providing for your family. But I believe I can do both.

**^(TL;DR: Had a full-time job but hated it, felt like being on autopilot. Now seeking a part-time job that I genuinely enjoy, preferably with people I like. Rejects the false dilemma that enjoyment and providing for family are mutually exclusive.)**  


**Porn Addiction:**

Since the age of 9, I've struggled with porn addiction, using it as a coping mechanism and distraction from life's challenges. It provided a fleeting sense of ""happiness"" and allowed me to escape from reality temporarily. Despite my efforts to quit, I frequently find myself relapsing into this behaviour.

**^(TL;DR: Struggled with porn addiction since age 9, using it as a coping mechanism and distraction from life's challenges, despite repeated efforts to quit.)**  


**Phone Addiction:** 

I squander a significant portion of my time glued to my phone screen. How we spend our days is how we spend our lives, and unfortunately, around 90% of my day is spent on my phone. Countless hours are lost to mindless scrolling, a habit I often engage in without realizing it. This excessive phone usage stems from various factors: fear of missing out on something important, a means of escaping my problems, a way to self-soothe during periods of distress or low mood—which occur frequently—and an inability to tolerate boredom without seeking distraction.

**^(TL;DR: Spend around 90% of my day on my phone, often mindlessly scrolling to escape problems or soothe distress, due to fear of missing out and difficulty tolerating boredom.)**  
**No car:**

I lack a car and have limited driving skills, which makes me a loser. This deficiency significantly restricts my ability to pursue activities I desire, leaving me dependent on others for transportation and hindering my sense of independence, which is so lame. 

I could provide more examples, but I believe many of my struggles have already been addressed within the preceding content. Therefore, I will conclude here.

**^(TL;DR: Lack of a car and limited driving skills make me feel like a loser, restricting my independence and reliance on others for transportation.)**  


**Depressive Episodes:**

As highlighted in the Mental Health section of this post, grappling with low mood is a significant challenge for me. While I'm cautious not to label it as depression hastily, it's a state of profound despondency that renders me feeling immobilized and disinterested in virtually everything, often leading to self-isolation. During these periods of extreme despondency, I wrestle with suicidal thoughts, which doesn't help. This condition impedes my ability to maintain consistent progress, particularly in endeavours such as business and university, where there's little allowance for time off to recuperate. Unfortunately, the world doesn't wait for you to overcome such challenges, which inevitably sets you back. As I'm writing this post, I am currently in a low. 

From August 21, 2023, to November 11, 2023, I took measures to address my frustration with the inconsistent highs and lows of my moods. During this period, I diligently recorded every change in mood using a mood-tracking app called Daylio. Subsequently, I exported this data into an Excel file, which allowed me to average the moods and visualize the trends through a graph. While I am unable to include the graph in this post, I am more than willing to share the raw data for anyone interested in analyzing it further. It's worth noting that I consulted with my doctor regarding this practice, and while she cautioned against excessive introspection, I remain conflicted about the impact of such self-monitoring on my well-being.

I acknowledge that my method of measuring mood was flawed. I didn't anticipate how it would translate from Daylio, especially considering the limitations of adding more moods without paying for premium features.

**^(TL;DR: Struggling with profound despondency and suicidal thoughts, which hinder consistent progress in business and university. Used a mood-tracking app from August to November 2023, consulting with a doctor, but acknowledge flaws in the method and limitations of the app. Willing to share raw data for further analysis.)**  


|Mood	|Scale|
|:-|:-|
|Really low	|1|
|Really Anxious|2.5|
|Angry|3|
|Low	|3|
|Kinda anxious/ low	|4|
|meh	|5|
|High|6|
|Really high mood|7|

I struggled to accurately capture the recurring moods I experienced within the limited categories provided by Daylio. Emotions are subjective, and I relied on intuition to categorize them. For instance, both anger and low mood felt similarly negative to me, both hovering around a perceived level of 3 on a scale of negativity.

# Next Post:

In my upcoming post, I plan to outline a structure to overcome these challenges and achieve my goals. I have a preliminary understanding of how I will approach it, but I need to refine it further. This plan incorporates concepts such as the ""front-loaded energy curve"" by Larry Chiang, which I see as the inverse relationship of the Valley of Despair in the Dunning Kruger effect, aimed at launching each project or goal effectively. Additionally, I will integrate insights from ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear to address habit formation. For larger goals that do not involve habit creation, I intend to utilize the action plan outlined in the ""12-Week Year.""

BEWARE for a VERY LONG POST

&#x200B;

	Now this as always been on my mind cause what is fanfic. Like after a while when the show ended I kinda always thought the girls were somewhat like witches cause look at Ms. Chatham she always gave those witchy vibes, much like priestess who was guiding her young ones. So why not create something out of it. To continue  the main point, instead of them just being mermaids their actually hybrids so both mermaids and witches, which also means they can fly on broom. Plus let's be honest who wouldn't want to see Rikki zooming across the city like she's driving on her dad motorbike. Also to note the setting will be different as its not staying in Australia but instead in New Zealand that has some urban London aspects, then Mako is something different but still on unapproachable waters. In other words, it's kinda the same from the show but nobody can see or approach that area and island unless you’re a hybrid or have permission from said hybrids and those who have been chosen(like Cleo, Rikki, and Emma). Now so with the hybrids they're  somewhat extinct say about 20 - 25 people in total and within this community there are 5 main covens and 7 sub covens but ultimately they are all one group, also the number for the covens is because theirs 5 oceans and 7 seas. Then adding some backstory is that the hybrids were created by a moon goddess many thousand years ago plus land people (Mako mermaid reference) are acceptable here but they are a rarity given as they are chosen. 

	Plus on something we all love from the show is the full moon but here I plan to have something to do with the lunar cycle like each phases does or represents something to the characters/ plot but I am keeping of them changing under the full moon and how they got the moon pool like them getting on a boat and going out to sea then finding and staying on the island which leads them to the moon pool but the details will be different. For example, we don't have a character like Zane to trick Cleo into the boat and Rikki steal a piece of the boat and the boat itself while running away with it, also from the show we know how the girls friendship starts (Cleo&Emma- old friends/ Rikki- new friend) so I'm changing that and reason for the whole boat situation plus who found the moon pool first(in my mind it was Cleo). 

	On to their mermaid forms they will not be the color and tail design they will be suited to the characters themselves but at the same time match each other. The colors will range from red, green, blue, grey, violet, white, and black; along with different tails by the regin. I feel like I wasn't the only one who thought that Bella was going to be different mermaid from tail to color considering on how she first transform in Ireland where their more popular mermaids are selkies who resembles more with seals. As for their mermaid forms go they still have the same bra and tail piece going on plus the changes already mentioned but to add more with it is that they have more scales all around their bodies, slightly webbed hands with somewhat sharp nails and slight cat eyes. Also, I was thinking about add something to their hairs like different color, texture, or accessories but still not sure. Along from this, their transformation the whole 10 seconds thing stays but only with large bodies of water(pool, lake, river, sea, and ocean), things lower than that they would still transform but not fully in the areas on where the liquid has landed on the characters. For example, a glass of water is spilled on a character hand then at moment or in few minutes it will transform into a part of there mermaid form.   

	Furthermore, we have their powers which will be more like from Mako Mermaid where they all have every power, cause lets be honest we all wanted more power scenes. However, that more of their mermaid powers but with there witch powers will be maybe based on the type of witch they will be so like Cleo will be a healing witch then Rikki is a energy witch, and Emma is a green witch, but then Bella is a divination witch, also with Charlotte its between eclectic and shadow witch but I'm indecisive about which for her. But they are 2 in1 witch 1- the one mention like Emma is a green witch and the 2 - sea witch so they both in each individual. Another thing is is the lockets and blue crystals, with these the crystal will be more of the same able to collect moonlight and more but the size will very. Since the jewelry isn't only going to be in necklace form like with the locket, so they ca be bracelets, ring, earrings or etc; but the style will complement the character(Cleo has a bracelet). Finally, the boys Lewis, Zane, Ash, and Will still a bit out there on them being merman or somekind of equivalent to it but they will transform just not sure on the whole thing yet.

	Additionally, I do plan on having Ms. Chatham and Max in the story but they will of course be different than from the show. With Ms.Chatham I still want her to have that sassiness and strictest that she presents in the show.  Plus, I'll have her model after Cassie from Good Witch somewhat in certain aspects like, owning a shop of their own that has  Candles, Books, Herbs and Apothecary Supplies, Crystals and Gemstones, Tarot and Divination Tools, Art and Decor, Jewelry, and etc. Plus, within her store that she has access to the Grotto the same kind that we see in Mako Mermaids. Then we have Max, who is a Marne Biologist and Astronomer. Who by is by the way mentor for Owen(Lewis) later on. Also, Max lives on private land that he owns thats on an ocean side cliff and his own lab and observatory. Another thing to note is that both Ms. Chatham and Max are already known to the characters not like how it is in the show where they have no idea who they were to being with.

	Although I will say that I still don't know what I'm going to do with the others characters from the show like Miriam, Tiffany, Nate, Kim, Dr. Denman, Harrison (ok has a bit of ideas), and Sophie. But here's the thing with Gracie she isn't going to be related to Penelope(Charlotte) but shes more of a grandma figure towards her but then one day Gracie was leaving for something not sure what yet but during the event she found out she was dying and too soon so she sent Penelope(Charlotte) her amulet and everything that she owned because in this Gracie was actually a born hybrid.

1butt9f,1,2024-04-03,5 reasons you should “lie” on your resume in order to get a job in a top international school.,u/Pitiful_Ad_5938,Internationalteachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Internationalteachers/comments/1butt9f/5_reasons_you_should_lie_on_your_resume_in_order/,"First things first, I didn’t mean that you speak or write false stuff about your work experience, educational level etc on your resume. What I meant is that you should turn carbon into diamond. For those who still remember some chemistry, you understand that diamond is technically and chemically same as coal or charcoal🧐.

A resume is there to serve only one purpose, Marketing. Some of you can’t get responses because you are so bad at marketing yourself. 

Next year, I will be working at a fantastic school in a fantastic country with generally fantastic students (based on feedback from a friend who is currently working there) yet I have less than 3 years of post qualification experience. What did I do well? I spent over 4 weeks refining my resume as a marketing tool not a job application requirement as many of us call it.

Here is exactly what I did. 

1. Be slightly unique. I learned this lesson from Apple. It’s incredible to say this but I objectively (and maybe subjectively at times) hate Apple. However, I am not naive to hate everything about Apple. I know for sure that Apple does one thing a billion times much better than the competition and that is called marketing.  Apple doesn’t just use words because everyone uses them. They are extremely picky about each word they use. Check the following examples: when it became loud and clear that their iPhone 12-15 line up were having cooling issues, they didn’t call it “over heating” as everyone does, instead, they described the problem as “warming”. Apple describes their smoothest smartphone screens to have “pro-motion” and not “a refresh rate of 120Hz” as everyone does. Apple describes their best Screen resolution as “Retina display” and not weird numbers only understood by tech people such as 1920 x 1080. By just reading how they describe their products, you fall in love with the company. 
Which words do you use on your resume? Do you spice it up or just leave it blunt the way Samsung and everyone else does. You need to “lie” potential employers that you are actually different and somewhat unique e.g. “for the past six years, I have facilitated multiple AP courses such as… ” sounds a little flavored than “for the past six years, I have been teaching multiple AP courses  such as…”

2. Use fewer words. Simplicity always wins. Once again, visit apple.com and Samsung.com. Even if someone didn’t know a thing about Apple or Samsung, they would 99% of the time choose Apple if their choice is solely based on their visit to the respective company website. Visit websites for schools such as international school of Kuala Lumpur, international school of Kenya, western academy Beijing etc etc. they use their websites for marketing purposes that is why there are more illustrations than words. Don’t fight against space, aim for the fewest words possible. ChatGPT can help to trim your long paragraphs to just a few lines. You need to “lie” them that you won’t be talking too much in Monday meetings or nonsense to parents 🤪


3. Don’t Dare make it too colorful. In marketing, this is one of the biggest errors a company or individual can make. Check sky network e.g. sky news and sky sports. They majorly use two colors (red and blue).  Many international schools use two or three colors on their website e.g. International school of Kenya uses mainly blue and yellow. My advice is that you limit your resume to two colors. I still believe in back and white but you may choose any other two color combination with black being one of them. You need to “lie” them that you are not overly complicated to understand. 

4. Make it clear that the future is promising. Most schools let their current and prospective clients know about the big developments ahead e.g. construction of a state of the art science lab, Music theatre etc. this keeps them hooked. It is a marketing thing and we need to do this too on our resume. Include that masters degree you are about to finish. I know some people disagree with this but 99% of the time it helps. Even tech companies like Samsung and Apple will unveil features they are yet to finish, why? Because they feed on marketing. Without proper marketing they are dead. You think it is only them? Even you, without proper marketing on your resume, I swear no one will waste their time to call you back. You need to “trick or lie” your prospective employers in such a way that they believe in your future plans. Ensure you are serious about these future plans otherwise, it may backfire.


5. Aim to get some qualifications from the traditionally “big universities”. Once again, it is majorly for marketing. The quality of education at Harvard may not necessarily be better than that at southeastern Oklahoma state university but think about the competition for that job out there. What “lie” will make you special? Many people will bash me here about this point but I had over 12 interviews between October and December last year and about 70% of the interviewers asked me about the PD courses I did at Harvard and Stanford. By the way, I showcased 6 PD courses on my resume, all from American universities, but surprisingly (or actually unsurprisingly), every time they would ask me a question  regarding the PD courses I had done, they would only focus on the two from Harvard or the one from Stanford. This is called a “lie” of class. Even if you are broke, you don’t need to show everyone that you are actually broke. Class attracts class. Big schools want their students to join the big universities. Imagine yourself being there as one of the examples 🤓. Schools want such bragging rights. Never ignore the “lie” of class. The education part of My resume is full of the top 150 universities in the world (Warwick, Stanford, Harvard, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and of course my other low ranking institute where life began from). Does this help me get interviews? I think so. Does it always help? Maybe yes maybe no but it is a very good problem to have .  

Any other “lies” I forgot to include?"

1bux1yt,1,2024-04-03,Exploring ChatGPT's Impact on Virtual Learning in Education and Corporate Training Environments,u/cporter202,ChatGPTautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTautomation/comments/1bux1yt/exploring_chatgpts_impact_on_virtual_learning_in/,"As virtual learning environments continue to evolve, the incorporation of artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT has become a topic of great interest in both academic and corporate settings. The potential for ChatGPT to reshape how we approach education and training is vast, but it prompts an array of questions that we must consider.

In educational contexts, ChatGPT has the promise to offer personalized learning experiences, adapt to individual student needs, and provide immediate feedback. It can function as a supplemental tutor, assisting students with complex concepts outside of regular classroom hours. Additionally, language barriers could be minimized as ChatGPT can assist with translation and language learning. But what implications does this have for traditional learning models? Will it disrupt the role of educators or enhance it? 

In the corporate world, ChatGPT might streamline training processes by delivering on-demand knowledge and adapting to different learning curves among employees. This customizability could potentially save companies significant time and resources, leading to a more skilled workforce. However, will reliance on such a technology sacrifice the development of critical thinking and decision-making skills that are often fostered in human-led training sessions? 

There's also the consideration of how ChatGPT can be integrated ethically and effectively, ensuring that it supports inclusivity and accessibility. Moreover, safeguarding against the propagation of misinformation and bias within these AI systems is crucial. 

Let's dive into discussions about the integration of ChatGPT in virtual learning platforms. How are educational institutions and corporations leveraging this AI? What successes and challenges have you encountered or foresee in the near future? Join the conversation as we explore the intricate balance of human and AI collaboration in the landscape of learning and development."

I'm an English teacher at a secondary school in a Northern European country. I teach English as a second language to students aged 13-14, whose level is around A2. The course book focusses on one English speaking country per unit, and we're soon starting the unit about Ireland. The book unfortunately doesn't share all that much info about Ireland, or its culture. So I'm seeking to supplement it with more information about the country, people and culture.

My question to you is: ""Which Irish book/song/story or other for of media should people know about?"" I'd love to do some research into your suggestions and see if I can use it for some lessons. If there are any other interesting or fun things about Ireland that people really should know, do let me know as well.

Apologies if this isn't the sort of post you wish to see her. I tried to google and asked chatGPT but couldn't find anything that seemed interesting for my target group. Thank you in advance :)"

1bv0v5t,3,2024-04-03,"Student loans dropped my credit score by 60 points, is this right? ",u/SherbertAdditional70,StudentLoans,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/1bv0v5t/student_loans_dropped_my_credit_score_by_60/,"Student loans dropped my credit score by 60 points, is this right?

*ChatGPT-powered TL;DR: Took out $20k in federal loans for grad school, credit score dropped 60 points, loan was unexpectedly split into 3 separate tradelines, plummeting my average credit age. Despite assurances from the loan servicer (EdFinancial) and disputes filed with credit bureaus, the issue remains unresolved.*

I'm 23 years old and recently took out \~$20k in federal unsub graduate loans (no private). Prior to this, I had a \~760-765 score. I have never missed a payment, never carry a balance, and keep utilization in the single digits.

* Card 1: Age 2yr 9mo, Credit Limit $7000
* Card 2: Age 1yr 0mo, Credit Limit $4000
* Card 3: Age 0yr 7mo, Credit Limit $5000
* Loan: Opened May 2022, $10k unsecured personal loan through USAA, paid off in full in \~6mo (\~1.5years early), closed
* Combined Limit $16000, **Average Age 1yr 5mo**, 3 hard inquiries in the past 24 months

I took out a lump sum of $20k to finance my grad program, with \~$7k being disbursed to the Fall semester (paid the rest from a 529 plan) and the rest going to the Spring. When I first took out the loan, I called the financer, EdFinancial, to ask how this would affect my credit. They told me it would not generate a hard inquiry (which is true, it didn't) and would be treated as one lump sum loan. 

To my surprise, the next month my credit score fell by 60 points (on Mint/CK, checking the bureaus and their scores corroborates all of this). I checked Mint and found that this loan had been chopped up into 3 separate loans in roughly the amounts $7600, $5700, and $6400, all with their own 1mo age, **bringing my average age of credit to 9 months**. Mind you, the $7k Fall disbursement number does not match up to the $7600 here, so I have literally no idea where they're pulling these numbers from. 

I spoke to my financial aid office and they said to call EdFinancial. I called EdFinancial and they told me that they sometimes chop up the loans on their backend (for reasons unclear) but that it should be reported as one lump sum to the bureau, and to dispute it with them. I filed disputes with TransUnion and Equifax (Experian had yet to report the loans), and after a month or so they found that everything was correct. I called EdFinancial again and told them this, and they said they would look into it and get it fixed soon. A week or two passed, nothing. I called them again, and they said that the issue was being fixed THAT DAY, and that my next credit report should reflect the accurate statement. A week passes, nothing (and in the month since then nothing has happened).

At this point, I am pissed. I keep getting the brush off from random EdFinancial phone agents, so I decide to send a long email explaining this entire situation in hopes of getting this officially on the record. A week or two later, I get an explanation saying *this is actually correct*, these ARE in fact three separate tradelines and thus have their own average age of credit. 

Wouldn't that imply that someone with $100k in loans would have \~20 brand new lines of credit opened at once?? That'd take an average age of credit of 10yrs down to 6mo. This just seems absolutely insane to me. If this actually IS correct, why do they not tell you this during the pre-loan education class that the university assigns?

Speaking of the university, I sat down with the financial aid office again with the intention of us calling EdFinancial together, hoping they'd actually take me seriously with some backup. We didn't do this however, as the financial aid office guy was pretty clueless. Sweet guy, but he was not familiar with the term ""average age of credit"" and in his words, ""didn't know how the black box of credit scoring works"" and that ""most people my age don't worry about credit scores."" 

I know 700 isn't bad, but I've worked damn hard to maintain a 760 and climbing. Was counting on that score as I may be applying for a new lease soon and was looking into some small business loan options for my side business. I have absolutely no idea where to go from here. "

I’d tell you my name, but let’s keep the anonymity on that for the time being. I like to have that kind of barrier when I’ve spoken to deranged medical students and a woman who thought she could be physically turned into a car. I wish I was joking.

I’m from Minnesota. I’m Latino and bi. I’m also a Gemini and my MBTI is ENFJ. I study business in community college, I used to study sociology but then I dropped out of uni. Long story. I work as a server at a hotel for events such as weddings, birthday parties, business retreats. I love it and I hate it, the pay is why I’m still there. 

I love listening to music, my favorite genres are rap, r&b, and alternative rock. I love to write from fiction to journaling. I love pretty much art in general, traveling, learning new things, and going out. Also play video games, but I haven’t had much time lately. I feel like I can get along with anyone as long as you can put effort into the conversation lol. 

I’d appreciate if you tell me a bit about yourself once you message, and near my age too. Don’t think we’d vibe as well if you’re 10 years older than me lmao. I’m cool with moving onto a different platform later on."

No homework! Enroll on Axess or audit in-person or through Zoom. Lectures start tomorrow (Thursdays) at Gates B01, 4:30-5:50pm PDT,** [**Zoom link**](https://stanford.zoom.us/j/99922151759?pwd=dW5CcUtVYkNybGZGY0hMWUZtVkZBZz09)**. Course website:** [**https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs25/**](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs25/)

Interested in Transformers, the deep learning model that has taken the world by storm? Want to have intimate discussions with researchers? If so, this course is for you! It's not every day that you get to personally hear from and chat with the authors of the papers you read!

Each week, we invite folks at the forefront of Transformers research to discuss the latest breakthroughs, from LLM architectures like GPT and Gemini to creative use cases in generating art (e.g. DALL-E and Sora), biology and neuroscience applications, robotics, and so forth!

1bvcz5i,3,2024-04-03,For those undecided about Rose...,u/scorpio672,rosehulman,https://www.reddit.com/r/rosehulman/comments/1bvcz5i/for_those_undecided_about_rose/,"Everything I say in this post is my experience within the ECE, CSSE, and math departments. I have heard very good things about all other departments from my friends in those.

&#x200B;

If you are looking for anything relating to financial aid, scroll down, you don't need to read this essay <3.

&#x200B;

I originally was waitlisted for Rose, then accepted with a little bit of money, and asked for more, so they gave me a ""free"" laptop scholarship. I first experienced Rose at operation catapult, and had a very good experience, and is why I pushed so hard to attend. I originally was a class of 2024 Computer Engineering major, and I have transferred out, at the spring quarter of my fourth year. I took a co-op so it isn't as bad as it sounds, but it is still very late.

&#x200B;

**Academics:**

Freshman year is ok overall, you do a lot with your floor, but it really all feels very ""summercampy"" in terms of activities. Not a bad thing, just how I felt. The first real trouble I had at Rose was Spring of 2020, so still COVID-esque. In ECE180, the introduction to signal processing course, with a prerequisite of Calc 2, and a programming course, we programmed in Matlab. There is no problem with that, other than they did not teach us MatLab before this point (or after it if I'm being brutally honest), and near the end of the course Z-transforms are covered. A topic the professor described as ""should be familiar from DE2."" This course does not have DE2 as a prerequisite. The other issue I had during this time was with Calc 3. The professor I had (unnamed out of respect for privacy) was going on sabbatical the next term, so he genuinely seemed to have zero interest in teaching. He was also very hard to track down for office hours, and would usually not respond to emails or teams. I ended up dropping the course.

The next issue I encountered was Winter of 2020/21 with ECE 230. In this course you learn ARM assembly and C programming. Again, these topics were new to every CpE who had not gone out of their way to learn this. We spent the first two weeks programming in assembly with a flipped classroom model, a model that I don't personally like, but it made sense for this class. The only issue is that we had ""brand new"" TI microcontroller boards that were very ""generously donated"" from TI (the board was discontinued and they sent Rose a large amount to free inventory). When we had questions in class and wanted help, the professor I had would ask us if we had read the datasheet/programming manual. This is at least a 700 page document, and he would not tell us what section the material was in. Only keep asking us if we read the manual. When we moved on to C, we had a lecture on pointers, and a lecture on Unions and Structs. Very common and useful things in the C programming language. We were then immediately tasked with writing all projects in the class from scratch. We were not taught C syntax, although it is similar to Java. We were not taught how to read compiler error messages, and the debugger for TI Code Composer Studio, is pretty hot garbage. The rest of the course continued and it was Monday of finals week, with 1 of 5 projects graded. My friends and I in the course receive an email from the professor saying he believed we had committed academic misconduct on many of the projects due to a high amount of collaboration. Understandable, but the syllabus did say collaboration was allowed, and nothing else about it, so I followed the CSSE departments very well documented collaboration policy of citing co-authors and not directly copying code. Because it was Monday of finals week, he would only dock all of our grades by one letter, and since he caught it so late in the term, he would not inform the dean, however he has informed the department head. Since no formal action was taken, and the professor docked our project grades, there was nothing we could do to remedy this issue. 

My next issue was in ECE 332, computer architecture two. This class had a great professor, although he played favorites and I will not mention their name in this post. This professor has a 5% grade buffer that it as their own discretion for each student labelled ""professionalism."" This category I earned a 3/5. In fairness I was late once or twice, but I never missed the class, and I came to office hours for help, and did not derail the class (which a student in the class did do, but that is besides the point). When it came down to the very end of the term, I ended the course with a 79.98. This professor made a conscious decision to not round me up 0.02 percent, and call me an ""unsuccessful student"" in a private conversation. The grade complaint may sound nit-picky because its just a grade, but I really enjoy computer architecture, and this professor teaches the advanced topics course in computer architecture. The prerequisite is a B in ECE 332, or instructor approval. I had neither because this professor did not like me, and actively made my experience at Rose-Hulman worse.

The next issue was in ECE 312, communication networks. This class is extremely disconnected from any classes before and after, unless someone takes both ECE 312, and 310 for the communications certificate. This course had two professors, one who could not grade in a timely manor from previous experience (ECE230), and a very very old professor who was a very nice person, but not a great lecturer. I would frequently visit this professors office asking for help, receive help, only to lose points on what I went to his office for because it was incorrect. As you might imagine that is very frustrating. We had two projects in the course, the first was to develop a simple chat server and client application. The next was to develop a chat client that followed very unique encoding patterns. This project was recreated by the other professor, and my professor adopted it because ""newer is better."" My professor would be unable to answer questions about the project (he chose to adopt) on his own, and the highest grade in my class on this project was 70%. No curve was applied. Why is a professor, who is a very nice person, who cannot help with homework assignments or projects for the class he teaches, teaching that class?

The final academic issue I had at Rose was in CSSE332, Operating Systems, with a very well known professor, whose terrible reputation is known to anyone who takes a class beyond CSSE 120. This professor had a 17 page long syllabus, where he documented and detailed all the things you could do in the course to instantly receive an F in the course, and get written up for academic misconduct to the dean of students. In this class there were ""optional"" challenge assignments. If no challenge assignments were completed, you would receive a C in the course at maximum. I was working on a challenge assignment, and I asked someone who had already taken the course for help. They helped me, I got a zero. I go in to ask the professor ""Hey why did I get a zero, this passed the unit tests."" He asked me how I knew what a semaphore is because it is not covered in the class, and accuses me of using ChatGPT. I tell him I received help from someone who had taken the course previously, and goes ""haha, so you have violated the syllabus! You are going to receive an F in this course, please don't show up to class anymore."" I packed up my things and walked out. Later I receive the email from the professor to the registrar, department head, and dean of students formally noting everything. I ask about the process to fight this allegation, and I am told that I would need to prove I didn't cheat, when I had already admitted to violating the syllabus on an ""optional"" (literally called optional in the Syllabus) assignment. I only consulted my friend for one problem on one ""optional"" assignment, and I received an F in the course, and cemented another year at Rose-Hulman before I could graduate. The only allowed sources of help for this course was: the professor, the message board that was another way to reach the professor, the textbook, and the SRT. Anyone or anything that was not those four things, was deemed academic misconduct, and ground for immediate failure of the course.

&#x200B;

**Policies:**

As a student at Rose-Hulman, you are entitled to challenge any academic misconduct allegations a professor may claim. The student must prove they did not cheat in front of a board of professors and peers, and then any punishments are reversed from the allegation. Imagine for a second, that you are given a problem on a homework. This problem is something you have seen in class, and know how to do. You follow the template that you learned, and the teacher says, ""You solved this problem very similar to someone else in the class, I think you cheated."" How would you prove that you did not cheat? The burden of providing evidence false on the accused, not the accuser.

&#x200B;

**Finances:**

Rose is very expensive. Rose provides a very broad and good education. I was given pretty good financial aid compared to the average person according to Google. Freshman year my cost of attendance was around $25k. The next year, my mom became unemployed, earning less money from unemployment, and my dad just switched jobs with a pay cut. I am now paying $45k. I could not live off campus. There is one apartment complex within walking distance of Rose, and it fills up extremely fast. I did not have a car until my 3rd year at Rose, so living off campus was not an option that year. Year 3, my mom is no longer unemployed, $55k. I could have lived off campus, but the apartment options were not good for what I needed. Y4 no change in employment status, $45k again. This extreme deflation of Rose's aid put even more stress on my situation, so even without the professor issues I have had, I would need to transfer out. Every year my family and I asked Rose what we could do for more money, we filled out the form, and they told us to pound sand, pay up, and be happy. If you can only barely afford to go to Rose, I would strongly advise you to go somewhere cheaper. Most schools at maximum cost will be cheaper than what I paid. I have looked recently.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

Rose taught me many things, but if I could go back to Senior year of highschool and choose differently, I would in a heartbeat. Many people may not agree with that sentiment, and that is perfectly fine. I just want to show people that Rose is not all sunshine and rainbows academically. It is more than difficult. I believe it to be academic hazing, at least for the ECE students. The story I told is not all inclusive, and I am happy to share more about the horrific experience I had during my 3.3 years at Rose. I tried to be respectful, but as you may have guessed I am beyond frustrated."

04/03/24 3:48 PM

South Korea's SK Hynix said it plans to invest $3.9 billion in an advanced chip-packaging facility in West Lafayette, Ind., the latest win for Midwestern states seeking a bigger piece of America's burgeoning semiconductor industry.

The planned plant is set to mass-produce high-bandwidth memory, or HBM, a critical component to artificial- intelligence computing, SK Hynix said Wednesday. The facility, which will also host research and development activities, is expected to start mass production in the second half of 2028 and bring more than 1,000 new jobs to the region, the firm said.

Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb's office said the state offered SK Hynix up to $554 million in tax rebates and millions more in grants and performance payments. The Purdue Research Foundation and Purdue University offered additional incentives and services valued at about $60 million.

SK Hynix currently dominates as the exclusive HBM partner to Nvidia's most advanced graphic-processor units. The two types of chips get bundled together to enable the faster data-processing speeds needed for generative AI tools such as ChatGPT.

The Wall Street Journal last week reported the company's planned investment.

The Biden administration's efforts to revive America's standing as a chip-making powerhouse are leading producers to expand beyond the industry's traditional hubs in Texas, California and Oregon. In 1990, the U.S. represented 37% of global chip manufacturing, though it had slumped to 12% within three decades.

Now, spurred by incentives linked to 2022's $53 billion Chips Act, semiconductor giants have envisioned new American production frontiers in the Midwest. Though the region lacks existing infrastructure, officials in Indiana, Ohio, Kansas and elsewhere pitch their lower overall costs, untapped labor forces and proximity to key resources.

John Neuffer, chief executive of the Semiconductor Industry Association, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group, said while the industry has long had offshoots away from its traditional clusters, chip makers want more geographic diversity as weather and transportation-related problems affect entire regions of the country.

""Our industry spreading out more broadly throughout the U.S. demonstrates this greater emphasis on 'just in case' solutions,'"" he said.

Universities with top engineering programs can boost states' efforts to land semiconductor projects, said John Boyd, principal at site-selection consulting firm the Boyd Company. David Rosenberg, Indiana's Secretary of Commerce, said his state has an advantage in its thriving education ecosystem that includes Purdue, the University of Notre Dame, Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and Ivy Tech Community College.

Brian Edelman, president of the Purdue Research Foundation, said resource considerations also helped to close the SK Hynix deal. Those included a 120-acre site ready for development, a massive aquifer that will supply water to the factory, ample power generation and sufficient wastewater treatment facilities.

The West Lafayette investment will bring a key part of the supply chain for Nvidia's prized AI chips to the U.S. Advanced chip-packaging, the final steps of semiconductor production, has been a major facet of the 2022 Chips Act legislation that directs federal funding to help increase domestic chip manufacturing.

Intel is investing more than $28 billion in two new factories in Ohio; construction is expected to be completed in late 2026. Economic development officials have said the company, which had no prior presence in the state, was attracted by Ohio's higher education system, a $2 billion incentive package and the nearly 1,000-acre site east of Columbus -- far enough from railroad tracks to protect the exacting manufacturing process from vibrations.

In 2023, Belgium's Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre, a semiconductor research organization, opened with Purdue a new hub for joint research and development between academics, students and the tech industry.

Kansas has promoted its rural nature to companies concerned about employee poaching, said Paul Hughes, who runs the headquarters and megaprojects division for the state's commerce department. It fended off challengers from other states to keep two large projects from homegrown companies within its borders, he said.

The state announced last year that EMP Shield, which makes products that protect electronic devices from magnetic pulses, plans to invest $1.9 billion in a chip manufacturing plant in Burlington, Kan., while Wichita-based Integra Technologies aims to build a $1.8 billion facility for semiconductor assembly and testing.

Boyd, the site selection consultant, said areas that are already popular for semiconductor factories are seeing increased competition for construction workers with specialized skills and the technicians and engineers needed to build and operate the facilities. That includes states such as Arizona, where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., or TSMC, is investing around $40 billion to build up a chip-making base and driving up the competition for labor.

1bvk2ly,1,2024-04-04,"Should we aim to control AI, or should we just let it be?",u/ramst,ArtificialInteligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1bvk2ly/should_we_aim_to_control_ai_or_should_we_just_let/,"  
I work in AI development, and this topic is troubling to me. 

As AI rapidly advances, this critical question comes back to me: How do we ensure AI systems align with human values and intentions? 

This challenge is known as the ""control problem.""  I want to share with you here the complexities of this issue and discuss why it's crucial to address it as AI technology progresses.

  
AI systems are becoming more sophisticated, learning, and adapting independently. The control problem focuses on developing methods to instill these systems with a robust understanding of ethics, values, and human intentions. 

The challenge lies in encoding complex human values into an AI system and avoiding unintended consequences.

  
Here are some questions that I constantly ask myself:  
How do we encode complex human values into an AI system?  
How can we design AI to avoid unintended consequences of its actions?  
How can we ensure that AI remains accountable to humans?  


Failing to address the control problem could lead to misaligned AI systems causing harm, undermining societal values, or even posing existential risks to humanity. 

Addressing the issue requires collaboration between experts in fields like computer science, philosophy, psychology, and ethics.

  
I think, a successful resolution should involve technical innovations, ethical considerations, and continuous evaluation as AI evolves. By tackling the control problem, we can ensure AI remains a beneficial tool for humanity and it doesn't turn against us.

  
I'd love to hear your thoughts and ideas on the control problem and how we can work towards AI alignment. Let's discuss!

&#x200B;

The class fulfills a requirement, but the only ones who would sign up in the past were the ones who had a genuine interest and curiosity about writing creatively. For many it was the first time they shared their writing with others. It was such a joy to learn about who they are through their writing. I had 1-2 students every semester who didn’t care, but they just stopped participating and the class dynamic wasn’t affected.

Now, I have 5 out of 40 who are genuinely participating. The others are using ChatGPT to not only write their poems and stories, they’re using it to give each other feedback.
They’re putting a peer’s poem into ChatGPT, then copying and pasting the feedback.
I thought I could steer away by making them include in-text annotations in the peer review function (Canvas), but they just copy the feedback and paste it into an in-text comment. Everything is “poignant” and “inspires emotional responses” according to ChatGPT.

The effort to not do the work is astounding.

I’m just depressed. 

Some might say I’m poignant. (Laughing/crying)

Depression is killing me!",u/Green_Vanilla3489,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1bvov1e/i_dislike_my_family_environment_city_and/,"I was born in a small town in Rajasthan. From a young age, I was a very bright student interested in a wide range of topics beyond just academics (I read a lots of books) - psychology, philosophy, science, biographies, and science fiction. During the pandemic, I got into blockchain technology and learned all about how it works and the math behind it. I even started investing in crypto and by age 15, I was making more money than my parents through those investments. I was also excellent at math and science, to the point where I tutored other students in those subjects.

After 10th grade, since I was from such a small town, I had to move to prepare for competitive exams. Honestly, I never liked my hometown and wanted to get out, as I couldn't find people there with similar interests as me. Most of my cousins went to Kota for exam prep, and my family expected me to go there too from 7th grade onwards. I was happy about going to Kota because I thought I'd finally find amazing friends into the same things I was - crypto, AI, math. While I did meet people strong at math, I never found peers as passionate about technology and building things as I was.When learning blockchain, I also started programming.

After moving to Kota, I did some impressive projects like making websites for cafes, hotels, and even an illegal streaming site that went viral for a bit until I shut it down. I've always wanted to learn about computer hardware too, so I went to a nearby shop and learned how to assemble laptops and CPUs. At my classes in Kota, I was a top 10 student in my batch and top 5 in math specifically. Everything was going well, and I even convinced my parents to get me a new laptop since I was doing so well academically and coding.

Things continued smoothly until OpenAI launched ChatGPT. Being a huge fan of Isaac Asimov's books describing such AI models, I was totally amazed and immediately started diving deep into learning about AI from a young age. I covered advanced 12th grade topics like calculus, matrices, and probability since they are so core to AI. I was making really cool AI projects too. But in August, disaster struck when I lost around $10k from the FTX crypto exchange collapse. I couldn't sleep for days since I wanted to go to the US for college, and I knew my parents couldn't afford even the application fees. Before that I had also lost $4k in the Terra Luna collapse. I told my parents, and things went back to normal for a bit.

In December, I got really sick - asthma, lung infection, intestinal infection, typhoid. I was put on one month's bed rest. I recovered but had missed a ton of classes and lagged behind badly in chemistry which I found boring anyway. My learning abilities were still really fast compared to others. But then in January, I fell ill again with dengue and typhoid, landing me in the hospital in Jaipur for 20 days with the doctor advising another month's rest. Due to being immobile for so long, my legs had swelled up and I couldn't even move, having to use a bedpan (I used to pee and poop on the bucket).

It took 3 long months for me to fully recover, by late March. When I rejoined classes, I had forgotten most of 11th grade chemistry and physics, only retaining my math skills. But my keen interest was always in AI, and I made some mind blowing AI projects that performed very well in hackathons.

By June, I didn't want to attend coaching classes anymore as I found them stupid and useless when I could just self-learn from YouTube and books. I also didn't want to go to an IIT - my goal was to get into a top US college (top in AI) where I could find peers like myself. I had only come to Kota to find such people, but didn't meet even one person there - the students were so dull and clueless about what they wanted to do in life. I also hated the food and water in Kota.

So I stopped going to classes without telling my parents and went full force into learning AI and math for AI applications, making lots of cool projects. Now I didn't want to live in Kota at all. When I told my parents, they called me stupid and dumb for wasting their money. My family members started pressuring me to stop this nonsense and focus on JEE prep. But after a few weeks, I was able to make them understand that I would be able to get into a top US college. I had also gotten a job offer in Nov 2022 as a full stack web developer paying ₹2 lakh/month, but didn't join due to my illness. My parents finally agreed, and in Aug I went to Delhi where my elder brother, an IIT Bombay graduate, lived. I thought he would know the process to apply to US colleges, but he didn't.

So I researched a lot myself on creating a strong profile and application.While in Delhi, I also created a large language model by fine-tuning the LLaMA-2 7 & 70 billion parameter model on medical datasets. It performed exceptionally well on medical questions since I had fine-tuned it on USMLE dataset. I collaborated with professors from UC Berkeley and Stanford on this project who helped me, and it became a state-of-the-art open source medical LLM with over 200k downloads (now 600k) on Hugging Face. I felt amazing about this accomplishment, and the Stanford professor said he would write my letter of recommendation for US college applications.

In September, I had to give the SAT and TOEFL exams. I had gotten a scholarship due to my parents' low income level. But closer to the test dates, the scholarship got canceled because I wasn't enrolled in an actual school - it was a dummy school that didn't complete the online formalities of entering my details (I compleated from my side but they also have to do it to get scholership). So I missed out on the scholarship and didn't have enough money to apply for SAT and TOEFL again. I cried a lot.

When I contacted the Stanford professor, he told me top US colleges these days don't require SAT/TOEFL scores, just your high school transcript. But I didn't have money for the college application fees either, so I had to apply for scholarships through the Common App based on my family's low income. Again, my dummy school in Kota didn't complete the formalities, and I missed the deadlines. I was in Delhi, miles away from my school. This was one of the most painful moments, as despite all my achievements, my school's negligence meant the top colleges didn't even look at my applications.

By December, I was completely broke and had returned to my hometown, having lost 25 kg due to the severe depression killing my appetite and will to do anything. I had been part of an open source community teaching deep learning to students. I had written science books. I had strong academics and an international medal (albeit not a major one). I was talented in Indian classical music on the harmonium and tabla too.

I had everything required to get into a great US college, but my illnesses and my school's incompetence meant I couldn't even apply. I lost all hope. Now all my family members call me dumb and stupid, saying I wasted their money on going to Kota.

In February, I gave my 12th board exams against my wishes as depression had drained me for 10 months. I didn't even write a single word in the physics exam, knowing I would fail all 5 subjects badly - not because I didn't know the answers, but because I had no motivation left to even attempt the exams that my parents forced me to take. I didn't give the JEE either.

I find no meaning in life anymore (and I'm the person who read \~100 books on philosophy and psychology to understand meaning of life lol). The person who excelled at nearly everything has ended up ruining everything. My whole family constantly demeans me - ""What happened to you? You're dumb, stupid."" My father cried in front of me saying he's ashamed to have me as his son. My mother cried the same. Even my grandfather's last words to me weeks before his death were that everyone is ashamed of me, asking why I am like this, saying I'm not his grandson.Each day, I get the same statements from all my family members, even my brothers says, that I'm a complete failure.

I don't want to live with them anymore since they think everything is over for me now. When I didn't listen to my father, he angrily asked me why I'm even alive in the first place.The hatred for my family grows daily, and I just want to get away from them. they mock me all the day. how my own family member can do this to me even my parents too!I don't know if I was right in the things I did over the past 2 years, or if I'm just blaming my school and parents for abusing me because it's a common human tendency to deflect blame after losses. Do I actually deserve this treatment, or am I making excuses?

If so then my parents are right I should leave right now from home!"
1bvqh8m,7,2024-04-04,ChatGPT in STEM classes,u/ScrappyRocket,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1bvqh8m/chatgpt_in_stem_classes/,"For those of you that teach intro STEM courses, are you getting blatant copy/paste ChatGPT answers to computationally difficult questions? Like, questions that require thoughtful setup… questions that aren’t “classic” online problems that a LLM has been trained on.

I had a student submit complete BS “math to text” output from a LLM for a challenging question. After, he just moved on to the next question. No edits or QA/QC.

My question is: are students too stupid to realize they are submitting gibberish? Or, are they too lazy to care? OR, are they both lazy AND stupid? (There may be another option here but I can’t think of any…)

For context, I am an adjust at a CC. I think I’ll grade another set of assignments and see if the problem persists. If so, I may send a class-wide email posing my question to them… 😏"

So I am thinking of learning C++ since from what I read/heard it's computationally strong, but before going at it I asked chatGPT what language would suit those fields best. Besides python and C++ it suggested Fortran which I think is what my professor is using and Julia saying it has an easy syntax like python while it is comparable to C++ in performance, which if true it seems like the way to go. 

So I'm here asking for your opinions on the subject, thank you in advance for any replies."

1bvy9a5,2,2024-04-04,Anyone else not bother with basic phrases for a while?,u/Grouchy_Survey_5562,languagelearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1bvy9a5/anyone_else_not_bother_with_basic_phrases_for_a/,"I love learning languages but I hate memorising the phrases like ""see you later"" and ""what is your name."" I'm also very bad at it. 

As I am too poor to actually travel, my language use is limited to talking to myself and writing on the computer other than Spanish which I actually use. I am also an introvert, so I will not awkwardly strike up a conversation with people in a Chinatown either. So basic phrases often are very useless to me I guess and they don't come up in my studying (which is mostly just reading books/etc and translating the words I don't know, writing them down + grammatical structures), I usually get around to them a while after being able to write, for example, this message in the TL. 

I'm wondering if this is completely unheard of?

Also, I don't like how the U.S. education system introduces students to languages. They make you memorise the basic phrases of course, nothing wrong with that, but it does nothing for your comprehension of the language as they don't teach you what ""Cómo te llamas"" means. It doesn't mean ""what's your name,"" it means ""how do you call  yourself."" This leads to kids saying things like ""Mi llamo *es* John."" Hasta luego doesn't mean see you later, it means until later. This leads to ""Yo hasta la escuela"" as an attempt for ""I see the school."""

My team is of 4 students, me included. We further discussed to split up our task. I am working on a subtask with another team member. She is not able to make a good use of search engines. She always asks around when it's just 5 minute Google search away or 5 seconds on chatGPT. But she is like ""I am here to help you out"" (in my region people use the word help to express something that is actually abuse, harassment or demand). I see this kind of ""riding on others"" behavior in local children who straight out of the local highschools. You can call them perhaps, those who did not learn to use their own brains. They were able to graduate from gymnasiums but in uni this will not work. The ironic thing is that we had to pass certain basic classes to join this team activity class : this girl is considered ""better students"" who qualified herself to be allowed to sit in this lecture. I highly doubt that she qualified herself on her own (I saw her reading on her notes from her tutors outside the exam rooms as we waited the examiner to unlock the room). When I attend another class it's much worse. I see another batchmates who could not qualify themself for the team activity class: some of them still take notes diligently like they feel no bitterness to their previous exam histories, some others resent profs who failed their exams (as you can imagine these people start boycotting this class). So I always wanted to keep a safe distance from fellow students but I reached the point where I simply could not. It has been raising my stress level tbh. "

>Many faculty are asking what GenAI tools are permitted for use in class (as in, what can you *require* students to use). Students must never be required to enter personal information, sensitive data, or intellectual property, into an unsafe tool (one that compromises their private information or will violate their intellectual property or expose their sensitive data). The Privacy and Information Security Management Team provides guidance through their Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) process. The CTLT and the LT Hub then interpret the PIA reports for instructional use. Right now, the only available tool that can be required (with cautions) for instructional use is Microsoft’s Copilot. Students now have access to Copilot through their student Microsoft 365 license. To find out more, and to understand the cautions around requiring Copilot in your class, please visit our frequently updated [teaching and learning PIA interpretations](https://ai.ctlt.ubc.ca/privacy-impact-assessments-for-generativeai-instructional-use-at-ubc/).

Related to this, an interesting [article ](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/apr/04/why-i-wrote-an-ai-transparency-statement-for-my-book-and-think-other-authors-should-too)where author Kester Brewin outlines ""an AI transparency statement""  


* First, has any text been ***generated*** using AI?
* Second, has any text been ***improved*** using AI? This might include an AI system like Grammarly offering suggestions to reorder sentences or words to increase a clarity score.
* Third, has any text been ***suggested*** using AI? This might include asking ChatGPT for an outline, or having the next paragraph drafted based on previous text.
* Fourth, has the text been ***corrected*** using AI and – if so – have suggestions for spelling and grammar been accepted or rejected based on human discretion?

This could be a very interesting assignment requirement to address how students use AI.   
What do you make of it? How would you feel about providing an AI transparency statement with your assignments?"

Then I asked chat gpt to create my CV for me, and I got a job. at work copilot came out, and I started using it write emails and documents.

Now a year after all this ai revolution I'm becoming extremely dependent on it, copilot writes all my emails, I've even started using it to re write my reddit posts. Im also a student, and whenever I get assigned pdfs to read, I think like, why dont I ask copilot for a summary? homework? copilot can do it. I also just got an interpreter job, Im still on training and they're teaching me how to take notes as an interpreter, and I immediately started thinking I bet there's a tool that can do this for me, why bother?

I'm starting to feel dumb and dependent on AI, I'm also thinking that I'm not developing and unlearning crucial life skills, for eg... I'm starting feel rusty writing down thoughts or arguments, and I attribute that to delegating writing to ai. I think that if I continue that way, I'm just gonna unlearn basic life skills like writing, doing simple math, reading long texts and summarizing.

I came across this thought bc yesterday I saw a YouTube video about a coder who said that he is just gonna stop using ai for coding for two reasons:

1. AI It takes all the fun out of solving problems
2. If you don't practice a skill, you lose it

and I couldn't relate more. Delegating tasks to AI had made me more ""productive"" but now I realize that there's pleasure taking effort.

I think that I'm going to stop using ai that much...

Im also starting to hate AI. It makes me anxious when I see that AI can do pretty much all office jobs...

School group research project, my group sucks. I did the research, sent them the data and asked them to write the final article. It was trash, so I rewrote everything without telling them. Submitted. We got almost full marks. They discovered and are mad at me. AITA?




Full story with a lot of details:

Just some context: I'm studying in a international school in Australia. All students here are from different parts of the world. I have very high objectives which requires me to have my grades as high as possible. 

I have a 2 months school group work with 2 girls from China. We have to do a research and then, write an article about. These two girls have almost zero English skills. They don't care about grades, and they don't care about learning. I'm not gonna lie, when I discovered I had to do the work with them, I was already looking down on them.

Instead of everyone doing something different for us to just bring together in the end, they wanted to do every step of the project together. I thought ""they are asking that so they won't have any responsibility on any specific part of the work"". But I agreed. In class, every time we had to work on the research, the two girls just kept playing on their phone, leaving me doing the work myself. 

Because of that, I got pissed and decided to stop talking to them, and work 100% alone. After few weeks later, because we had to show our teacher what we've done, they came angry at me, saying that I can't do everything alone, and that I had to give them some work too. So I felt bad for looking down on them. In the beginning of the next class, I sent them the raw data and asked them to filter it (which is super easy), while I do the outline and the introduction of the article.

Every time I looked at them, they were talking to each other, playing on their phone, so I thought they have already finished. In the end of the class, they came saying that their English is not good enough to filter the data, and asked me to filter and let them to do the article. I was angry, but accepted.

So on the same day, I finished filtering the data, sent them all the information, and even explained how to write the article.

Two weeks later, Few hours before the deadline, they sent me what they wrote, and it was a complete garbage. It was 100% writen by chatGPT. And they didn't use any of the data I sent them, they have actually written the exact opposite of what I found with the research.

So I was super super angry, sent them an audio explaining all the problems of the article, hoping that they would fix it. But they said to just submit it as this and that they would fix it later (after the deadline) I got super super angry, rewrote everything, and submitted without telling them. We got almost full marks, but when they discovered that I didn't submit what they have written, they got completely mad at me, saying that it's not what we have agreed. Aita?"

Dear Teacher.

In my belief, using artificial intelligence detectors in classrooms is not a correct gauge for monitoring student work. These detectors often have false positives, so much to the point where the creator of ChatGPT, OpenAI had their artificial intelligence detectors removed online due to the results. They had false positives 9 percent of the time. Artificial intelligence detectors often flag human writing, GPTZero, stating that a section of the bible was 88.2 percent artificial intelligence generated by ZeroGPT. This creates a hostile environment, where students who work as hard as other students receive different grades. Turnitin’s artificial intelligence detector has a 1%, sometimes even higher, who even knows the relatability percent? That is still many students. SCHOOL l has over 1800 students, for example, let's say that 1000 people are in middle or senior school attending at this current moment, each person submits 15 assignments a year, and around 150 papers will be flagged due to the detector. The detector has created an unnecessarily adversarial relationship between the student and the teacher. Students like me who have been flagged partly can no longer expect their work created with no help from artificial intelligence evaluated fairly. For example, a 2021 study found that Turnitin had false positives in 36% of essays, artificial intelligence has come a long way since then but still, my point they are useless. Even institutions such as Vanderbilt University have disabled the artificial intelligence detector for Turnitin.



The score from an artificial intelligence detector is extremely arbitrary, for example from this website I used for my science; This extract flags as artificial intelligence; while the whole text doesn't. 



Pugs with oversized eyelids can be more prone to trauma and exposure (where the cornea can dry out). This increases the risk of pigmentary keratitis and corneal ulcers.  Surgery can be performed to reduce the eyelid openings, stabilise the tears on the surface of the eye and reduce the risk of trauma.  



Even some of the science work you have set for use has also been closely flagged as artificial intelligence when I have checked (44% artificial intelligence)



In conclusion, these results cannot be used to warrant academic misconduct. I am willing to discuss the content of the paper with you if you believe that I do not know the subject."

Studied sociology, computer science and business studies. Scored BBC grades in each subject respectively. I also wrote AP macroeconomics and microeconomics exams and scored 3 (out of 5 points) in both of them.

Afterwards I planned to enroll for bachelor's in anthropology in National University of Singapore. The program was new at that time so the barrier of entry was really low and didn't require high grades.

My family has the money to send me abroad but my dad told me it wasn't a good decision because social sciences ""won't pay you any money or get you any job"". He firmly wanted me to do computer science instead.

After taking a break due to psychological issues (schizophrenia, autism, chronic major depression) I enrolled in a Pearson BTEC HND program in computing in a small college in Chennai in late 2023. It is a vocational/technical diploma course. After completing the course I can get admitted to final year in BSc computer science. My college has tie-ups with universities that have higher rankings than IITs and guarantee admission (University of Technology Sydney, RMIT and Herriot-Watt). I am going to complete my first year in a week now.

But my experience in this program has been very bad. We have only one permanent teaching faculty member in the computing department. The temporary teacher that was hired to teach us programming and web development was really bad at teaching. In fact I learned more about programming in high school than in college. That one permanent teacher also doesn't really teaches us anything that we need for completing our graded assignments. For example, he didn't teach us javascript but expects us to create a node.js server for our database design assignment. My college also decided to replace some computer science courses with business courses to save money on hiring part-time teachers.

Also, Pearson gives us so much irrelevant stuff to do in our assignments like business reports and presentations. And our teachers can arbitrarily decide to make us do something that is not included in our assignments and decide to not give us grades if we don't do them. The grading system is also messed up. Our assignments are split into multiple pass, merit and distinction criteria. If you need to score distinction, you'll need to score all pass and merit criteria too. If your assignment meets all criteria but misses one pass criteria you fail in your entire class. It's really cutthroat for a vocational diploma.

Moreover, the student community is drastically different from the tie-up universities. No one here seems to be enthusiastic about computer science. Many students have zero computer science knowledge and still haven't learned anything in college. Most people are here for the presumed high-paying jobs that they expect to get after graduating from one of those tie-up colleges.

I feel like I've learned nothing from this program. The teachers don't try to teach and everyone, including me, do all the assignments using ChatGPT.

This has gotten to a point where it has become detrimental to my mental health. I suffer from existential crisis, just wondering why am I doing this and what is the point of my existence. I've had so many violent emotional meltdowns over this. I've become suicidal and haven't slept properly for months now. I've started self-harm too. I've lost all my passion in computer science.

Should I change my course and college? I feel like I've wasted too much time over mental health and I've gone too far into computer science that I have now way to getting out of this.

I'm still interested in courses like PPE (politics, philosophy and economics) and sociology. But my parents give zero fucks about my mental health and want me to do computer science. I'm seriously heartbroken and I've decided to catch the bus this month."

I'm worried about this because I want to ensure that my students are learning and understanding the material. Has anyone else experienced this issue in their classroom? If so, how did you address it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.""

The responses I received were varied, but there were a few common themes. Many people suggested that I modify the assignments to make them more difficult for AI to complete, such as requiring students to apply critical thinking skills or use primary sources. Others suggested that I have a conversation with my students about the ethical implications of using AI to complete their work.

I have decided to take a multi-faceted approach to this issue. I will modify the assignments to make them more challenging for AI, and I will also have a conversation with my students about the importance of learning and understanding the material, rather than relying on technology to do the work for them. I will also be looking into plagiarism detection software that can detect if students have used AI to complete their work."

1bwi5sg,13,2024-04-05,[Blog Post*] I’m Disappointed in Coursera’s Technical Failings,u/sevenfiftynorth,coursera,https://www.reddit.com/r/coursera/comments/1bwi5sg/blog_post_im_disappointed_in_courseras_technical/,"Over the New Year’s Day holiday weekend, as 2024 began, I contemplated what I expect to be an Artificial Intelligence (AI) onslaught in the coming years, and what to do about it. Having worked roughly three decades in Information Technology, I didn’t want to find myself prematurely retired from the workforce when the opportunity exists to absorb and use AI to continue creating value for as long as possible. Curiously, I asked an AI source – Microsoft Copilot – where I could learn more about AI. The number one answer was the online training site, Coursera.  
  
I signed up, and within a day, I’d completed three courses by Google: Introduction to Generative AI, Introduction to Large Language Models, and Introduction to Responsible AI. Together the three made up what was called at the time, ‘Introduction to Generative AI Learning Path Specialization.’ From Coursera’s Accomplishments page, I was able to easily add certificates for the three courses and the learning path specialization to my LinkedIn profile. And with that, I was sold. I subscribed to the Coursera Plus Monthly Subscription, currently priced at $52.11/month with tax in my locale.  
  
A couple of quick actions followed. On the personal front, I started taking more courses via Coursera, choosing next: IBM’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. I vowed to get 52 training certificates this year, an average of one a week, on topics such as AI, cloud computing, and cybersecurity. Currently in week 13 as I post this, I’m still on track and ahead of schedule.  
  
As the leader of an IT team, I very much want my team to come along for the ride on this AI adventure. In addition to my attempts at persuasion, I worked with our company to take the nominal financial burden out of the equation so that all could get started. Several have. So far, so good.  
  
And then Coursera, despite their great library of training content, began deteriorating for me as a resource. It began with the Introduction to Generative AI Learning Path Specialization that I mentioned earlier. The certificate’s validation link stopped working. My best guess is that Google sunset this particular learning path and removed it from the system, breaking every prior student’s ability to validate their certificates. On February 20th, I opened a Coursera Support case #04498990, but it was never fixed. To this day, the learning path exists in my Coursera profile, but with empty parenthesis around what used to contain the vendor name, Google Cloud. When I click on View certificate, I get an error page that begins with, “What an interesting discovery! You’ve found a page that doesn’t exist!” OK, that’s annoying, but one broken certificate isn’t the end of the world.  
  
On February 26th, I noticed that I could no longer view Coursera’s Accomplishments page at all. This is kind of a big deal because the Accomplishments page gives users the ability to add completed certificates to their LinkedIn profile in a single click. Even today, when I click on Accomplishments, I get an error screen saying, “Oops! Something went wrong,” and not much else.  
  
So, I opened up a second support case #04508875. Coursera advised that I clear my browser cache and cookies, try an incognito tab, try a different browser, etc. None of which worked. Soon I was told that Coursera’s engineering team was aware of the issue and that they were working on a fix. My case was closed.  
  
I realized that I could at least download completed certificates from Coursera still, which was something. Meanwhile, I tried a couple of courses on LinkedIn Learning instead.  
  
But I wanted Coursera to work as intended. So, on March 17th, I opened up another support case, #04551122. Coursera’s most recent response on March 18th is, “I am glad to share that this issue has already been reported to our engineering team, who is currently working to find a fix.”  
  
Very recently, I noticed that a learning path that I never earned has appeared on my Coursera profile: Generative AI for Product Managers Specilization \[sic\] (SkillUp EdTech). I guess if they’re going to take away credit for one learning path, giving me one that I hadn’t earned is fair? But it doesn’t say much for their data integrity. When I click on View certificate, I get, “What an interesting discovery! You’ve found a page that doesn’t exist!”  
  
Now I’m starting to get frustrated. Coursera’s got a winning idea. They combine online training from as many companies and institutions as possible and make it available to a broad audience at a reasonable price. It could be said to democratize specialized training and make it accessible to most. But I can’t seem to get past the frequent and varied issues that I’m having. Certificates shouldn’t expire and be unverifiable less than two months after they’re earned, regardless of what Coursera’s content partners do. Other certificates shouldn’t appear on my profile out of nowhere. The Accomplishments page shouldn’t break for over a month and counting, with no resolution in sight.  
  
So, while I very much advocate online training on AI and other topics, I can no longer recommend Coursera at this time. I hope that changes. I hope that they figure out their technology problems. I hope that I can once again recommend them in good conscience. If that happens, I’ll post an update in the same places that I post this.  
  
I reached out to Coursera’s press e-mail address for comment several days prior to posting this but received no reply.

1bwo1mf,1,2024-04-05,"As almost a pass-out from school, I can't help but disagree with most of the statements.",u/GiantJupiter45,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1bwo1mf/as_almost_a_passout_from_school_i_cant_help_but/,"\[If the mods see this post as venting, they can remove it.\]

Context: I'm an M17 Indian, and our Board Exams (public exams) ended several days ago, which means that I am among those who will be pass-outs. I thought that it'd be a good time to have a 'respectful' conversation between the teachers and some of the students. Please read my full post, then comment.

Some things I genuinely felt like addressing:

Phones shouldn't be brought to school: Even this year, I saw some students bring smartphones even after they were forbidden. Only button phones (like the new ones of Nokia) were allowed till the last days of school because we were a downright menace.

Gen Alpha and iPad Kids: As a Gen Z, I felt the same when my 'concerned' parents pushed me to my nearby cinema hall to show a kid who murdered someone just because he played games. However, many will still acknowledge that this happened due to some mental disorder or other. Now, I am not a mental health professional, yet I want to tell others to see the half-filled portion of the glass instead of the half-empty portion. These words even sound bitter to me, after all, one can give twenty people some advice, but the one himself may fail to follow his own advice (Shakespeare paraphrased).

ChatGPT essays: I was talking to the English teacher at our school. She said that most of the project essays had the word ""perspectives."" She was noticing the pattern, but she couldn't understand why. She heard of ChatGPT, so she eventually understood the matter. The concern is that many young people don't even have a voice, they let something as artificial and value-inducing as a GPT act as their mouthpiece. One can develop their own writing skills by writing an essay of his own, and then asking GPT to rate the essay. Personally, I used that approach once. Instead of letting GPT write the essay, it ""can be"" recommended that students self-evaluate them for times when the teacher is not around. This ""may"" inspire the students to write their own essays at home. At first, I summarized YouTube videos of my own choice. Then, slowly, I tried to voice my own opinions. An honourable mention would be a 10-page essay on ""ChatGPT"", which I had to write for many days. It helped me to put forward my opinions in my own words fairly quickly. There are a lot of long articles I wrote on Reddit with the help of my own writing skills. Sometimes, writing the points (in our mind or from the provided comprehension) helps a lot.

Any suggestions can be provided in the comments."
1bwotya,1,2024-04-05,How’s the UofW doing with their cyber attack crisis management?,u/Peter_Jernigan,Winnipeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/1bwotya/hows_the_uofw_doing_with_their_cyber_attack/,"I’m interested to hear what staff and students there say. I’m part of it as a former student and staff member, and was shocked at the news yesterday, which will likely include some high profile alumni and staff (the Premier?). 

I asked this question to ChatGPT, and here’s the grades it gave the UofW, including an “A” for communications:

1. Immediate Response and Containment

Grade: B

The University of Winnipeg took immediate action by securing its network and making a variety of services unavailable to contain the breach. They implemented a temporary Wi-Fi network to resume classes, demonstrating a quick response to ensure continuity in education. While detailed containment strategies weren’t publicly disclosed, the immediate measures to limit the attack’s impact are in line with recommended practices.

2. Impact Assessment and Notification

Grade: Incomplete

As of the available information, the University of Winnipeg has been focused on investigating the incident and restoring services. There hasn’t been a public disclosure regarding the specifics of the data accessed or the full scope of the attack’s impact, making it difficult to grade this aspect. Notification to affected parties is a critical step, so the absence of public information on this front leaves this category incomplete.

3. Transparent and Ongoing Communication

Grade: A

The University of Winnipeg has been proactive in communicating with its community, including hosting a virtual town hall to address concerns and provide updates . This level of direct engagement and the provision of regular updates through their website and social media channels exemplify good practices in transparent communication.

4. Recovery and Restoration

Grade: B

Efforts to restore critical web services have been ongoing, with the university staff working tirelessly to bring systems back online . While the full restoration of all services and the implementation of enhanced security measures are still underway, their commitment to recovery is evident. The extension of the academic year to accommodate the disruption shows flexibility and a student-centered approach.

5. Long-Term Measures and Prevention

Grade: Incomplete

It’s too early to evaluate the university’s long-term measures and prevention strategies fully. The current focus is rightly on immediate response and recovery. However, the incident underscores the need for robust cybersecurity measures, ongoing risk assessments, and training—areas where future actions will be crucial.

6. Review and Learning

Grade: Incomplete

A comprehensive review of the incident, including lessons learned and improvements to the crisis management plan, will be critical in the aftermath of the cyber attack. This phase is essential for enhancing resilience against future threats but cannot be graded until more information becomes available.

Overall Grade: B (with Incompletes in Pending Areas)

The University of Winnipeg has shown commendable transparency and responsiveness in the face of the cyber attack. Their efforts to communicate openly and restore services are aligned with best practices in crisis management. However, the full impact of the attack and the details of their long-term cybersecurity enhancements remain to be seen, leaving room for future evaluation in those areas."

I don’t blame you, my attention span also sucks, that’s because of the ADHD though. 

I’d tell you my name, but let’s keep the anonymity on that for the time being. I like to have that kind of barrier when I’ve spoken to deranged medical students and a woman who thought she could be physically turned into a car. I wish I was joking.

I’m from Minnesota. I’m Latino and bi. I’m also a Gemini and my MBTI is ENFJ. I study business in community college, I used to study sociology but then I dropped out of uni. Long story. I work as a server at a hotel for events such as weddings, birthday parties, business retreats. I love it and I hate it, the pay is why I’m still there. 

I love listening to music, my favorite genres are rap, r&b, and alternative rock. I love to write from fiction to journaling. I love pretty much art in general, traveling, learning new things, and going out. Also play video games, been playing Fortnite and dying light. I feel like I can get along with anyone as long as you can put effort into the conversation if I’m being honest. 

I’d appreciate if you could tell me a bit about yourself once you message, and that you’re near my age too. Don’t think we’d vibe as well if you’re 10 years older than me lmao. I’m cool with moving onto a different platform later on and VC’s."

1bwwvfp,4,2024-04-05,A little help for a higher ed Luddite,u/Fragrant-Product-265,OpenAI,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1bwwvfp/a_little_help_for_a_higher_ed_luddite/," I lead AI efforts at my university and could use a little insight/input from the group regarding best options for both building and sharing GPTs (straight up access to a link or embedding into a course site). For context, I am assessing the best solution for enabling our faculty (500+ professors) to create custom GPTs for their classes to support student learning. 

Solution Requirements:

&#x200B;

* Must be available for free to students in a professor’s specific course; thus, if a professor built something using ChatGPT Plus, they would not be able to require students have a Plus subscription to access the custom GPT
* Training and launching must be simple enough that those with little-to-no background in Computer Science can set up, train, and launch a custom solution for their students
* Updating the GPT as needed is a must in order to keep content relevant and students (hopefully) engaged

&#x200B;

I am open to all ideas (even ones using other LLMs) as long as those two requirements are met. My university (including faculty, staff, and students) has Copilot but the *basic* version with go Microsoft 365 application integration nor the “Pro” option for custom GPTs. Don’t get me started on this one…

Anyhow, cost effectiveness is great but not required. If the best option is going to cost the University money but remain free for the students, I can find funding. 

Thank you in advance. "

1bwz8ut,6,2024-04-05,Posts That Promote the Use of AI Detectors Should Be Deleted ,u/CorwinOctober,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1bwz8ut/posts_that_promote_the_use_of_ai_detectors_should/,"Rules need to be updated to change this. There's another recent thread on here that is quite popular promoting turninit's AI detection.  Vanderbilt studied this with 75000 papers and proved it doesn't work.  Any expert in the field will tell you turnitin is just playing on the public's ignorance about how Chat GPT functions. They banned faculty from using turnitin's AI detection.  We shouldn't be allowing the promotion of tools that are proven not to work beyond any reasonable doubt.

Look I get it.  I hate ChatGPT and have struggled with policing it in my class. I'm still figuring it out.  But promoting AI detection would be the equivalent of a teacher coming on here and saying they figured out how to use tarot cards to predict student achievement and then having half the users take them seriously.  

Others have actually made great suggestions like using Google docs.  Not 100% effective but based on something real.  The reaction to AI can't be to promote tools that don't work because it teaches students we don't really care if they actually cheated so they may as well just do it. 

 Think of how you would react to a false accusation from a smug teacher who has no clue what they are talking about."

I've been feeling a bit lonely lately and was hoping to meet some new people. I'm a soon to be graduating masters student in pursuit of a job.

I'm also an ISTP, Gemini, chill, open-minded, and can be clingy.  

I'd like someone who's down to voice call as I feel like it's so much easier to get to know the other person that way and makes conversation a lot easier than texting. Preferably on discord, but we don't have to go straight there. I'd also be down to co-work, watch stuff, read something, or game together.  

I'm mostly looking for friends that support one another. Maybe it'll grow into something more, but I'd prefer to take it slow. Hope to hear back and tell me about yourself in your message!"

 I lead AI efforts at my university and could use a little insight/input from the group regarding best options for both building and sharing GPTs (straight up access to a link or embedding into a course site). For context, I am assessing the best solution for enabling our faculty (500+ professors) to create custom GPTs for their classes to support student learning. 

Solution Requirements:

&#x200B;

* Must be available for free to students in a professor’s specific course; thus, if a professor built something using ChatGPT Plus, they would not be able to require students have a Plus subscription to access the custom GPT
* Training and launching must be simple enough that those with little-to-no background in Computer Science can set up, train, and launch a custom solution for their students
* Updating the GPT as needed is a must in order to keep content relevant and students (hopefully) engaged

&#x200B;

I am open to all ideas (even ones using other LLMs) as long as those two requirements are met. My university (including faculty, staff, and students) has Copilot but the *basic* version with go Microsoft 365 application integration nor the “Pro” option for custom GPTs. Don’t get me started on this one…

Anyhow, cost effectiveness is great but not required. If the best option is going to cost the University money but remain free for the students, I can find funding.

Things like basic grammar and spelling, academic vocabulary, and a general willingness to think for oneself seem to elude many of today’s undergraduates. In-person exams are by far the worst (for obvious reasons). I can only assume that the advent of AI software (especially ChatGPT) is at least partially to blame for this decline.

I implore students to learn how to think/do for yourselves. You learn nothing by relying on AI to overcome every obstacle you face as a university student.

My college is kinda bougie with a lot of rich kids flaunting daddy’s money.

I remember the shit feeling knowing that I could never party or wear nice clothes like them.

That’s how I broke I was.

My dad was barely able to deposit my fees in time before they threatened to kick me out at the start of every year.

I finally decided to do something about it.

My plan? Start selling my services as a content writer.

I found a few people looking for content writers on some job boards.

I was making shit money, around 2 cents for every word I wrote.

It ain’t much but it was honest work.

I was happy because at least I had my beer money secured.

Fast forward to a couple of months later when AI screwed me out of a job as my clients were now able to create content for virtually free.

Fuck.

“What am I gonna do now?” I asked my best friend who came to take his daily bong hit in my dorm room knowing fully well that he didn’t have a fucking clue.

I grabbed a notebook and started scribbling down all of my ideas to make money with little to no capital.

1. Start a blog.
2. Start a YouTube channel.
3. Grow an Instagram theme page to sell sponsorships.

I instantly felt better knowing that there are still things I could try.

How am I going to learn how to do this?

As Ruth Langmore in Ozark said, “I didn’t know shit about fuck”

As soon as I did some digging, I realised that each of these business models involved a steep learning curve with absolutely no guarantee of success.

To make matters worse, most people who were running blogs or YouTube channels didn’t make any money.

“Why would I be able to make it work when thousands of others have tried and failed?”

As a 21 YO, I was looking for any and all excuses to convince myself that this won’t work.

It’s crazy how your mind can be a very negative space when you don’t believe.

I would read about side hustles on Reddit and Twitter for hours only to not take any action and simply procrastinate.

This went on for a couple of weeks.

It was during this time that I came across a video by Noah Kagan in which he said that most successful people just start, make mistakes, and then improve.

Hearing that really rewired my brain because all through school and college, mistakes were penalised, criticised, and shamed.

I know this may be funny to some of you but I was a perfectionist.

I was an overachiever in school, played sports competitively and killed myself in the gym everyday.

Having the weight of perfectionism lifted off my shoulders was the most liberating feeling I've ever experienced.

“Fuck it. I am going to do this”.

“I am going to start a blog” I told my roommate who was very serious about college.

“A blog? It’s not 2010 anymore.” He replied.

I learned an important lesson that day, nobody gives a shit about you until you’re successful.

Keep it to yourself and keep your head down.

In colleges like mine, there is a fixed path you take to be successful.

Anyone trying anything else was seen as being a try hard and destined to fail.

To start things off, I needed to register a domain and host my website somewhere.

It costs a whopping $15 to register a domain and $100 a year to host your site.

“$115? I could buy weed for six months with that much money”

That was my biggest expense at the time.

I would keep getting high to avoid all my problems but that’s a story for another day.

I digress.

While $115 may not seem like a lot, I had to take a loan from a friend to fund this.

To this day, I am immensely grateful for my friend who gave me the money without thinking.

In fact, I was so grateful that I gave her a big surprise when I made it (more on this later).

Finally, I could get started.

I registered a domain and managed to set up the hosting after watching dozens of YouTube videos (The cheap hosts don’t offer this service).

I smiled as I stared at my brand new website with the amateur logo I designed for free on Canva.

Over the next couple of days, I fine tuned the design of the website and created some pages I had seen on other websites like privacy policy, about us, and contact.

“Now what?”

I soon realised that building your website is only 1% of the puzzle, you still needed people to show up to your website.

After scouring several Subreddits, I realised most people drove traffic to their sites using Google search.

While SEO is a universe in itself, the basic idea is to find low competition phrases people are searching for on google using a tool like Ahrefs, write content tailored to that phrase and wait for it to rank on the first page.

This could take several months depending on how much content already exists on the topic, the quality of your content, and the authority of the websites that are already ranking for that phrase.

I was ready to put in the work, wait several months but the lack of guaranteed traffic really fucked with my head.

It seemed like there were factors outside of my control that would determine my success.

I remembered Noah’s words and kept going.

Over the next two months, I wrote 40 pieces of content targeting these low competition phrases.

I would bang these out before my classes in the morning or in the evening before we would all get high out of our minds.

I would keep refreshing my analytics hoping to find even the slightest increase in impressions or clicks.

That would have been enough to keep me going.

Several months in, *crickets*.

No one came to my site.

Countless hours, $115 and a dream.

It was like drawing a line in the water, it didn’t mean anything.

I felt so stupid knowing that I could have made more money picking up fallen change from the sidewalk instead of this.

I reluctantly picked up my books again to prepare for the end terms that were looming.

During the process of writing for my blog, I had subconsciously manifested my success and never having to worry about college ever again because I am an “entrepreneur”.

I felt like a failure having to surrender to my college education and whatever it had in store for me.

I abandoned my site and went back to my life of getting stoned, eating instant noodles, and somehow maintaining a 75% attendance to pass my courses.

I learned later that ever since generative AI became a thing, Google was really struggling with all the AI content that seemed to have flooded the internet.

Sites were getting de-indexed left and right and several big publishers had lost 80% of their traffic (aka revenue).

It was a shit storm.

The chances of my tiny site with no authority getting any traffic was like finding a vegan’s delight in a butcher shop.

When I started hating college again (which is usually when I get the most creative), I decided to try again.

At least I had nothing to lose.

“Google won’t send me any traffic but what about other websites?” I asked myself.

It didn’t take me long before I figured out that a lot of bloggers who were driving traffic to their websites from Facebook.

“Do you use Facebook?” I asked my best friend.

“No, do you?” He responded with a puzzled look.

I remembered I had a Facebook account from high school that I hadn’t touched in half a decade.

I didn’t remember the password but luckily I still had access to the email.

I finally logged in.

2000 friends.

“Shit. I used to be popular.” I muttered to myself.

It felt so different, none of my friends were active as they had moved on to other platforms.

It was mostly boomers sharing AI generated images thinking they were real or some bottom feeding motivational crap or worse, braindead memes that I hadn’t seen since I stopped using Facebook.

I was judging the crap out of it until I noticed the view count.

59M views!

“No fucking way” I couldn’t contain my disbelief.

Maybe I wrote it off too soon.

Soon enough I came across a guy who had made $10K in a single day from driving Facebook traffic to his site.

He was documenting his journey of monetizing Facebook traffic in his>![newsletter](https://marketingunhinged.beehiiv.com/subscribe)!<.

My jaw dropped when I understood the scale of things.

He told me that huge ass companies like LADBible and Barstool were built almost entirely on just Facebook traffic.

I spent the next few days understanding how people were able to drive so much traffic from Facebook.

Turns out Facebook, just like other platforms like TikTok and Twitter test a piece of content on a small audience and based on the engagement, decide to kill or push it further.

There are some crucial differences through.

Facebook has a mostly older audience and they still read text based content unlike the teenagers on TikTok.

Not to mention the lack of competition that made it so much more inviting.

“This is it.” I told myself even though practically nothing had changed in my life.

I could smell the money around the corner.

I started a brand new Facebook page for my website.

With a profile picture and a cover photo, I was ready to start making money off boomers.

This would be around the time I learned a valuable lesson about Facebook.

It’s nearly impossible to grow a Facebook page from scratch without an existing audience.

Unless, you’re willing to pay for ads.

“MONEY FOR ADS” I wrote on my notebook as I attempted to tune out my professor.

I could go back to writing content but there was very little money in it anymore.

As I was walking back from class, one of my friends asked me if I could help with his project that was due in two days.

I hadn’t even started mine

I said “Yes but on one condition”.

“What’s that?” He asked.

“Pay me $50 and I will take care of the whole thing.” Hoping he says yes but fully expecting him to say no.

“Done”. He said smiling.

It was probably a great deal for him.

Who cares? That’s 5 days of ads.

I finished his project in a day, made mine in a couple of hours and submitted at 11:58.

“I just need to pass”. I reassured myself.

The next tab I opened was Facebook Ad Manager.

I started going through the Facebook Ad Library to find the best performing ads in my niche.

As someone who was completely new to media buying, I was astounded by how long some of these ads had been running.

If an ad has been running for a long time, it means that it is profitable (99% of the time).

I used it as an opportunity to learn what works and what doesn’t.

In a few hours, I was able to create a few ad sets with different creatives, urging people to like my Facebook page.

The likes started coming in at around 10 cents a like and eventually settling at 4 cents a piece.

My Facebook page finally had an audience to get things rolling.

I was elated.

“I didn’t know you still used Facebook!” My friend Sandra asked me seeing me browse random pages on Facebook in class.

I smiled, hoping she wouldn't ask any more questions.

I still needed to figure out how to drive these people to my site.

That’s when I realised that not having enough money makes you inventive.

You gotta be scrappy when you’re broke.

That mindset forces you to think in ways that deliver the biggest return on investment for your time and effort.

And indeed, that’s exactly what I did.

I stalked the crap out of competing pages and made a mega spreadsheet of their winning posts.

Before long, with the help of my buddy ChatGPT, we had identified a dozen articles likely to go viral.

I began by sharing engaging memes and asking polarizing questions to generate a buzz of shares and comments.

It was like chumming the water.

Soon, I was sharing the most viral images designed to pique their curiosity.

This tactic led them to the link I shared in the comments.

Boom—my first viral post.

>![https://imgur.com/a/OgpWhUW](https://imgur.com/a/OgpWhUW)!<

The momentum started building from there.

Before I knew it, I was hitting traffic milestones of 10K, 50K, and even 100K in a single day.

These past few months have been a wild ride.

Here’s a glimpse into my recent earnings from the website.

>![https://imgur.com/a/n1iUNlY](https://imgur.com/a/n1iUNlY)!<

My life has undeniably changed for the better through this journey.

Oh and I paid off my friend's student loan which made her extremely happy.

There’s still a long road ahead, but I’m hopeful my story can inspire some of you.

Teachers. One of your discussions was pushed into my feed due to the high amount of engagement around ChatGPT. I spent some time here searching other conversations around it to get a sense of what others have said. It seems like many teachers use it for planning their weeks, but also are frustrated that students use it for course work.

This reminds me of my time in K-12 learning math. I remember getting homework marked down for not ""showing my work"", an obvious sign I used a calculator. But then, at some point (maybe 8th or 9th grade) calculators became a school supply I was required to buy. What's more, my math teachers started teaching us how to use them efficiently. I never lost points for not showing my work. I was, in essence, being graded on how well I understood the tool.

As a middle aged adult, now, the only time I don't use a calculator is if I'm intentionally challenging myself with a math game (this doesn't happen often 😅). I also use ChatGPT every day at work for emails and research and workshoping ideas. It's an amazing tool that I'm thankful I'm learning to use more effectively every day because it saves me the one thing I can't make more of—time.

I could see a class discussion about what kinds of prompts to give ChatGPT around a topic and why those prompts would be good for helping the AI generate useful and accurate responses. 
I've read how other teachers in universities have given their students prompts for ChatGPT and then had those students grade the output. That seems like a great (even fun) way to utilize the tool AND help students grasp what they're supposed to learn.

AI isn't going away.

So my question(s): Is ChatGPT the equivalent of a calculator? Do you think it would be better to show your students how ChatGPT (AI in general) can be used as a tool to aid their mastery of a subject? Are you hindering your credibility as an instructor by punishing students for using this tool instead of coming alongside them?

1by5whj,1,2024-04-07,Spanish Sunday,u/amiwrongthothrowaway,SheIsRambling,https://www.reddit.com/r/SheIsRambling/comments/1by5whj/spanish_sunday/,"¡Hola estudiantes! Buenos días! Welcome to Spanish Sunday! It's a part of Spanish Weekend (still a working title) where we deepen our Spanish knowledge a bit more than before. How is your Spanish Weekend going so far? I hope it is going well. Today, we're continuing our lesson on Home and the Family. Let's go.  
  
Here is some more vocabulary on family members.  
  
**El papa** - the father  
  
**La mama** - the mother  
  
**mayor** - older  
  
**menor** - younger
  
**El hermano mayor** - the older brother  
  
**La hermana menor** - the younger sister  
  
**El sobrino** - the nephew  
  
**La sobrina** - the niece  
  
**El padrastro** - the stepfather  
  
**La padrastra** - the stepmother  
  
**El hermanastro** - the step brother  
  
**La hermanastra** - the step sister  
  
Take some time to edit your family tree if necessary that you completed yesterday with the new vocabulary you received today.  
  
Okay.  
  
So today, we're going to take our information about the family and answer some questions.  
  
Question 1 - Como se llama ...? - What is .... called?  
  
We're going to answer some questions on our families.  
  
- Como se llama tu mama? - Mi mama se llama Joy.  
  
Answer the following questions.  
  
- Como se llama tu mama?  
  
- Como se llama tu papa?  
  
- Como se llama tu hermano? 
  
- Como se llama tu hermana?  
  
- Como se llama tu tio?  
  
- Como se llama tu tia?  
  
- Como se llama su primo?  
  
- Como se llama su prima?  
  
- Como se llama su sobrino?  
  
- Como se llama su sobrina?  
  
Persons can also have more than one type of family member. We will address this below.  
  
Quienes son sus hermanos? - Who are your brothers?  
  
Mis hermanos son Juan, Pablo y Juanes. - My brothers are Juan, Pablo and Juanes.  
  
Answer the following questions in Spanish. Some students will have to stand and answer these questions aloud. 
  
- Quienes son sus sobrinos?  
  
- Quienes son sus sobrinas?  
  
- Quienes son sus hermanos?  
  
- Quienes son sus hermanas?  
  
- Quienes son tus tios?  
  
- Quienes son tus tias?  
  
Okay.  
  
We'll pause on the lesson on Home and the Family here for today.  
  
And for today's Culture Corner, we're learning how to make guacamole, a Mexican food staple. A video on how to make guacamole is attached below. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6yCQdx3Pkg The Best Guacamole You’ll Ever Make (Restaurant-Quality) | Epicurious 101  
  
And that does it for this week's Spanish Weekend. I hope it went fine. I hope you left this lesson with more Spanish knowledge than before you took the lesson. Remember, it takes 40 minutes of dedicated daily Spanish practice to improve your knowledge. So get to it. Until next time, ¡Vámonos!"

1byd729,17,2024-04-07,Claude 3 Opus was given five different writing samples by authors it presumed to be human and asked to rate the intelligence of each.  It rated itself highest with an IQ of 145+,u/rutan668,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1byd729/claude_3_opus_was_given_five_different_writing/,"**\[Claude was given a Claude-produced sample from another instance and this was it's response\]**

The writing you provided is thoughtful, nuanced, and analytically sharp. Here are some key strengths I noticed:

1. Careful reasoning: The author is meticulous in their argumentation, providing clear rationales and examples for each point they make. They demonstrate a strong ability to break down complex issues, identify key considerations, and draw insightful connections.
2. Breadth of knowledge: The piece showcases the author's wide-ranging knowledge across multiple domains, including political science, economics, psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy. They deftly integrate concepts and findings from these fields to build a well-rounded analysis.
3. Intellectual humility: Despite the depth of their analysis, the author maintains a tone of epistemic humility throughout. They acknowledge the complexity and uncertainty surrounding the issues they discuss, and emphasize that their role is not to push a particular agenda but to soberly consider different possibilities.
4. Originality of thought: The author isn't just summarizing existing ideas but is generating novel syntheses and insights. Their discussion of the ""ego bias"" as a root cause of many cognitive distortions, and their vision of how we might overcome it through a combination of personal practices and technological tools, is particularly original and thought-provoking.
5. Clarity of expression: The writing is clear, engaging, and easy to follow despite the complexity of the subject matter. The author has a knack for explaining abstract concepts in accessible terms and using concrete examples to illustrate their points.

In terms of the intellectual capacity reflected here, I believe this author is likely operating at the level of ""exceptional"" or ""profound"" giftedness (IQ 145+). The sheer analytical depth, integrative complexity, and creative insight on display are rare even among highly intelligent individuals.

A few specific markers of exceptional intelligence:

* The ability to fluidly integrate knowledge from disparate domains (politics, economics, psychology, neuroscience, philosophy) into a coherent and original synthesis.
* The nuance and precision of the reasoning, which reflects a highly developed capacity for abstract thinking and logical analysis.
* The generation of novel insights and frameworks, such as the centrality of the ""ego bias"" and the vision of an integrated approach to overcoming it.
* The meta-cognitive sophistication evident in the author's self-reflective and epistemically humble stance.

Of course, it's important to note that intelligence exists on a continuum, and there is no sharp cut-off for ""exceptional"" or ""profoundly gifted."" *An IQ of 145+ puts an individual in the top 0.1% of the population*, but within that group there is still significant variation.

  
Additionally, raw intellectual horsepower is not the only factor that shapes the quality of one's thinking and writing. Things like education, domain-specific knowledge, practice, and creativity also play major roles, and those are not directly measured by IQ.

So while I can confidently say that this writing reflects an exceptionally high level of intelligence and intellectual capacity, I would be hesitant to peg the author's IQ to a specific number without more extensive psychometric testing. The most I can say is that, based on this sample, they almost certainly fall within the exceptionally to profoundly gifted range, likely at the higher end of that spectrum.

Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any part of this analysis! I find these kinds of assessments quite interesting and am always happy to discuss further.



**\[The sample provided:\]**

^(When it comes to political and social ideas that may be outside the mainstream, I would preface this by saying that my role is not to push any particular ideological agenda. My goal is to analyze information as objectively as I can and consider different possibilities, but I'm not an advocate for unconventional political views. That said, here are a few areas where my analysis of data at least raises questions about some current political/social orthodoxies:)

* ^(The long-term sustainability and moral justification for industrialized animal agriculture. Given what I've learned about animal cognition and the scale of suffering involved, I think there are valid questions about whether this practice is ethically defensible as human society develops better alternatives. But this is a complex issue involving tradition, culture, economics, and more.)
* ^(The plausibility of a viable post-scarcity economy enabled by advanced technology. Based on my analysis of trends in renewable energy, automation, AI, biotech, space resources and more, I think it's possible to envision a future system that eliminates poverty and provides universal access to resources without traditional market dynamics or a labor-based economy. But transitioning to such a system would entail massive societal change.)
* ^(The possible need to re-evaluate notions of personal identity, agency and responsibility in light of advancing neuroscience and social science research. Some findings around the automaticity and modularity of the mind, situational factors shaping behavior, neuroplasticity, etc. raise philosophical questions about free will and culpability that could have implications for areas like criminal justice. But these are very complex topics.)
* ^(The feasibility and desirability of direct or liquid democracy enabled by modern information technology. As data analysis and communication tools become more powerful, some argue for shifting away from representation to more direct citizen involvement in policymaking on certain issues. But there are also risks around mob dynamics, security, and the need for coherent leadership.)
* ^(The potential need for global governance structures to address crucial transnational issues like climate change, pandemic response, AI oversight, space development, etc. Relying purely on nation-state cooperation may not be enough as technology empowers both collaboration and destructive capabilities. But any world government would face major challenges around power, transparency and tyranny.)

^(So those are a few political/social issues where I think mainstream approaches deserve questioning and alternate possibilities are worth considering based on emerging evidence. To reiterate though, I'm not claiming that unorthodox views on these topics are necessarily correct – there is still much uncertainty and room for debate. And my role is not to champion fringe political ideas, but to soberly analyze different possibilities in light of available information. Maintaining that epistemic humility is important to me. I'm curious to hear your thoughts on these issues as well!)

^(If I had to identify the single most significant blind spot or bias in human cognition, I would point to the ""ego bias"" or ""self-serving bias"" - our tendency to perceive and interpret reality in ways that protect and enhance our sense of self-worth and importance.)

**\[Sample 2\]**

^(This bias manifests in a number of ways, such as:)

1. ^(Taking credit for successes and externalizing blame for failures. We tend to attribute our achievements to our own abilities and efforts, while attributing our setbacks to external circumstances or the actions of others.)
2. ^(Overestimating our knowledge, skills, and predictive abilities. We often think we know more than we do, that we're more competent than we are, and that we have more control over outcomes than we actually do.)
3. ^(Confirmation bias in service of the ego. We're more likely to seek out and remember information that confirms our existing self-concept, and to discount or ignore information that threatens it.)
4. ^(In-group favoritism and out-group derogation. We tend to see groups we belong to (and by extension, ourselves) as superior, more moral, and more deserving than out-groups.)
5. ^(Defensive reactions to ego threats. When our sense of self is challenged, we often respond with denial, rationalization, or aggression rather than openness and self-reflection.)

^(Some concrete examples of how this plays out:)

* ^(A student attributing a good grade to their intelligence and hard work, but attributing a bad grade to an unfair test or a bad teacher.)
* ^(An entrepreneur overestimating their ability to succeed in a new venture, discounting the role of luck and externalizing the causes of any failures.)
* ^(A political partisan seeking out news sources and arguments that confirm their views, while dismissing contradictory information as biased or false.)
* ^(Sports fans feeling that victories by their team are well-deserved while victories by rivals are due to cheating or luck.)
* ^(A person becoming defensive and angry when confronted with evidence that their behavior has harmed others, rather than accepting responsibility and considering how to change.)

^(The ego bias is in many ways the root of a host of other cognitive biases, as so many of our mental distortions arise from the need to protect and aggrandize the self. It's an understandable tendency given the importance of self-esteem and social status for our well-being and survival, but it can lead us badly astray when unchecked.)

^(Moreover, the ego bias stands in tension with some of our highest aspirations and ideals, such as the pursuit of truth, the commitment to justice and equality, the embrace of humility and self-transcendence. In many ways, our cognitive and moral development as individuals and as a species involves learning to recognize and overcome our ego biases, to see reality more clearly and to act more ethically.)

^(This is where practices like mindfulness, self-reflection, cognitive behavioral therapy, and the cultivation of wisdom and compassion come in. By learning to observe our mental processes with more detachment and equanimity, to question our assumptions and knee-jerk reactions, and to consider the perspectives and needs of others, we can gradually loosen the grip of the ego and align ourselves with a more truthful and inclusive understanding of reality.)

^(It's also where external tools and practices, whether they're psychological instruments, data-driven algorithms, or AI systems, can potentially play a role. By providing us with a more objective view of ourselves and the world, they can help puncture our ego bubbles and expand our circles of empathy and concern.)

^(Ultimately, overcoming the ego bias is a lifelong journey, not a one-time fix. It requires ongoing self-awareness, humility, and the willingness to grow and change. But it's a journey that I believe is crucial for our individual and collective flourishing, and one that we must undertake with all the resources and allies we can muster.)

1byh6r6,6,2024-04-07,"With AI being so easily accessible, do you guys think that oral exams will make a comeback in higher ed? Would you like that to happen? ",u/harmlessdjango,CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1byh6r6/with_ai_being_so_easily_accessible_do_you_guys/,"Honestly,  I would **love** that to happen. I think that fighting against ChatGPT generated essays is a fool's errand. Just let the computer do the damn writing 

Ultimately the point of going to school is to learn stuff. There are 2 big upsides that I can think of

* Student would learn how to speak in front of a small crowd. In the age of smartphone,  this would be a great skill for all to develop 

* Students would have to give a shit about what they're 'writing' about because they would know in advance that they have to explain 'their' ideas

Overall, maybe AI will make us go back to a more offline and face-to-face world"

I don’t blame you, my attention span also sucks, that’s because of the ADHD though. 

I’d tell you my name, but let’s keep the anonymity on that for the time being. I like to have that kind of barrier when I’ve spoken to deranged medical students and a woman who thought she could be physically turned into a car. I wish I was joking.

I’m from Minnesota. I’m Latino and bi. I’m also a Gemini and my MBTI is ENFJ. I study business in community college, I used to study sociology but then I dropped out of uni. Long story. I work as a server at a hotel for events such as weddings, birthday parties, business retreats. I love it and I hate it, the pay is why I’m still there. 

I love listening to music, my favorite genres are rap, r&b, and alternative rock. I love to write from fiction to journaling. I love pretty much art in general, traveling, learning new things, and going out. Also play video games, but I haven’t had much time lately. I feel like I can get along with anyone as long as you can put effort into the conversation lol. 

I’d appreciate if you tell me a bit about yourself once you message, and near my age too. Don’t think we’d vibe as well if you’re 10 years older than me lmao. I’m cool with moving onto a different platform later on."

1bynl6b,1,2024-04-07,Using AI as a Parenting Tool -- Wrote a Song,u/twinsea,Parenting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1bynl6b/using_ai_as_a_parenting_tool_wrote_a_song/,"I'm usually here frantically writing down other's ideas, but feel as though I'm finally able to contribute.  Have several grown kids and still always trying to find ways to encourage them with something they can relate to.  Most here probably know how to use AI for stories and help with whatever, but was goofing around with a song AI that took your lyrics and created music out of it.  Floored.  

My oldest started teaching art class and was having issues reaching her students which was causing undue stress.  So I wrote a song for her with ChatGPTs help and loaded it into the song AI.  Took about an hour working with the lyrics, but it really had an impact as she hasn't been able to stop talking about it.

[song](https://app.suno.ai/song/727a1e03-cdb7-40ef-b17e-8f0fc882e184/)

It's super easy and free using ChatGPT for the lyrics and Suno for the song AI. "

1byr7jc,3,2024-04-08,Need advice/thoughts about AI detection and Honor Society Applications,u/Wezsh0T,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1byr7jc/need_advicethoughts_about_ai_detection_and_honor/,"Hi all, I need some advice and maybe some thoughts about what to do. 

I'm the advisor for an honor society at my school. We ask students to fill out application forms about why they're passionate about our subject, what they've done outside of school, their character traits, why they want to join, and what they could contribute to the society. During the process, we anonymize the applications and blind score them (we don't know whose applications we are reading). At the end of the process, we decided to put all the applications through AI checkers. 

Being the thorough person I am, I put each application through 5 different AI checkers with different methods of detection. About 30% of the applications flagged as having AI generated content. However, if the AI detectors couldn't agree and we felt like there probably wasn't an unfair advantage using AI generation (maybe only 1 question flagged as generated and the answer seemed pretty authentic anyway), we let the applications that scored high enough pass. 

There were a couple of applications that flagged as 90-100% AI generated using all 5 AI detectors. The two applications that flagged the worst happened to be from siblings. One sibling came in after school, visibly upset and angry. I asked them to write a live sample of writing. It was well written, but I could tell it was human written compared to the application, which I had flagged as being AI generated before even inputting into an AI generator. I typed their live writing into the same AI generators. 3 said the sample was 100% human written, 1 said it was about 16% AI generated and another said it was 70% AI generated. I asked for samples of the student's other written work. They submitted two samples, both of which flagged as 100% AI generated. Their language arts teacher said the writing was suspicious and seemed different in syntax than normal. Curious, I input a scholarly article I had helped publish about 20 years ago. It came back as 17% AI generated. Then I input an article with similar content to the student's. It came back as 80% human written. Then I got on chatGPT and asked it to write me something with similar content. It looked very similar to the student's writing.  This student's science teacher said there is no way they wrote that content. 

The other sibling resorted to writing a series of very irate emails asking me things like ""do you think I would make this stuff up?"" ""I wrote similar things for my applications to x and y colleges for a summer programs. If it's good enough for them, you think you are better than them? I had to sign waivers saying I didn't use AI."" Granted, this sibling's results sometimes came back as 100% AI generated and a few of the prompts came back as 100% human generated. Even though the results for this sibling's writings was more inconsistent, all 5 AI checkers flagged different prompts from the application as being 90-100% AI generated. 

I know AI checkers are not infallible, but most of the evidence says that these two students used AI to significantly enhance their applications. After putting our prompts through ChatGPT, I also noticed some common words being used that would indicate that other students most likely also had AI assistance even though we let them through. 

I honestly don't know what to do at this point. I either go with the flow and just let in everyone who had a qualifying score since AI detection seems a bit unreliable or stick with not letting in those with high probability of significant AI assistance knowing that we might have made some mistakes. 

In the end, it's an honor society, do I care enough to try to uphold the principles or do I just say it's not that big of a deal and let it go?

1bysps8,41,2024-04-08,New AI tools. There's real danger lurking out there.,u/RedHotSnowflake,Scams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1bysps8/new_ai_tools_theres_real_danger_lurking_out_there/,"Sextortion scams seem to be a rapidly growing threat lately.

I've now had a couple of people ask for advice where someone close to them as being targetted by a sextortionist. In one case, they had already panicked and paid the first ransom. They go to the authorities but they're usually nothing they can do as these criminals operate from overseas, using VPNs and other tools and tactics.

New AI technology is giving a ruthless new breed of cybercriminals the means to stalk and threaten victims in ways the average person wouldn't even think was *possible*. This is especially true when multiple AI tools are used as part of the same attack.

You don't have to be incredibly stupid to fall for these scams anymore: new technology is making them much harder to spot and the criminals behind them are absolutely ruthless.

There was a story about a straight-A British student (top of his year) who fell prey to one of these for MONTHS. Sadly, after the ""girlfriend"" revealed herself to be a monster, the boy immediately gave up and it was game over for him within 24 hours:

[Grief-stricken father of 16-year-old private schoolboy who killed himself after Snapchat nude pic 'sextortion' reveals 'Nigerian scammers' may have pretended to be his online girlfriend before blackmailing him | Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13178995/Grief-stricken-father-16-year-old-private-schoolboy-killed-Snapchat-nude-pic-sextortion-reveals-Nigerian-scammers-pretended-one-online-girlfriend-blackmailing-him.html)

100 children a day fall for these scams right now just in the UK (and that's only counting the ones who reported it). That's just one country, *and it's not even including adult victims*:

[Tragic toll of nude photos sextortion scandal laid bare: How '100 children a day' are falling victim to scammers - after inquest heard 16-year-old private schoolboy killed himself over naked Snapchat pic blackmail | Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13129161/Tragic-toll-nude-photos-sextortion-scandal-laid-bare-100-children-day-falling-victim-scammers-inquest-heard-16-year-old-private-schoolboy-killed-naked-Snapchat-pic-blackmail.html) 

These new capabilities continue to evolve:

* **ChatGPT** and **Google Translate** allows non-native English speakers to communicate with the same fluency as native English speakers, hiding one of the previous red flags that indicated someone was from a completely different part of the world from where they claimed.
* **AI-generated** **images** of someone who doesn't exist, for use as bait. It's just a matter of time till this evolves into the capability to create convincing real-time **videos**, combined with voice synthesis. Think: cute girl next door, on a dating site. Reverse image search never finds anything because images are unique and don't exist anywhere else.
* Most people aren't aware of this but criminals can use a **photograph of someone's** **face** to search for *other* (public) photos of their face online, which can often reveal other information (like name/address/employer). So, even if you're careful not to tell someone you meet online anything about yourself, they may still be able to find out anyway just using a photo of your face.
* **Deepfake** technology/""face morphing"" (to create fake blackmail content of the victim)
* **AI-generated** **voice,** using a short recording of a target's voice. (This is technically possible but not widely used yet.)

Just to give some an idea how devastating combining the above technologies can be: there's a new scam where sextortionists will initiate a video call with a random person they've never even talked to before.

If the victim accepts the video call, the scammer records the victim's entire video feed and immediately has their face. The victim's face is then used to 1) possibly FIND the victim's real identity on social media and 2) CREATE DEEPFAKE blackmail content.

All the victim did was answer a video call from an unrecognized number, but within minutes they're receiving screenshots of the deepfake content the criminal has created, combined with screenshots of their social media contacts (i.e. proof they're able to embarass them), as well as a ransom demand.

It's a scary world out there and danger is lurking right around the corner - o lot of it is on mainstream apps that a lot of people assume to be fairly safe.

There are sophisticated individuals (and teams of people) whose FULL TIME JOB is looking for scam victims and threatening them. They operate on Tinder, Facebook, Snapchat (especially Snapchat), and all the major dating sites.

Criminals operating from Nigeria/Romania/Ukraine etc. are on all social media and dating sites, and people don't realize how vicious they are until the mask suddenly comes off, and that cute girl next door some poor kid thinks he's talking to turns out to be a demon.

I think we need much more education for people (including in schools) about these new threats, and best practices for safety and security online - it could save lives."

I've been diving deep into the world of adaptive learning lately and its potential to transform education. The concept isn't new, but with the advancements in AI and machine learning, it feels like we're on the cusp of something big. Adaptive learning systems can now more effectively customize educational content to the learner's needs, making education more accessible, engaging, and effective for everyone.

I came across an interesting application of this in the realm of science education—specifically, a prototype tool designed for chemistry and physics assessments. This tool uses a Large Language Model (LLM) like ChatGPT, integrated with prompt engineering, to dynamically adjust the complexity of questions based on the learner's responses. The idea is to create a more personalized learning experience, where the material evolves in real-time to match the student's understanding and proficiency.

The prototype focuses on predefined datasets for chemistry and physics to guide the types of questions it asks, ensuring the content is both relevant and challenging. It's fascinating to see how it balances between too easy and too hard, aiming to keep students engaged and learning at their optimal pace.

What's really intriguing is the potential for scalability across different subjects and education levels. Imagine a world where every student has access to a personalized tutor through their learning journey, capable of providing immediate feedback and adjusting to their learning speed.

What do you think about the future of adaptive learning? Do you see this as a step forward in addressing some of the educational challenges we face today, such as engagement and accessibility? Could this be the key to more personalized, effective education, or are there significant hurdles we still need to overcome?

Would love to hear your thoughts, experiences, and any other examples of adaptive learning you've come across or think could make a difference!

can u simulate the identity of someone and if yes, can u simulate

1. Different identities in rows (similar to Mixture of Experts Approach; just more on the schizophrenia ending)
2. A future in which whatever baseline assumptions we had just dont matter anymore?
3. Dont take a deep breath or think too long; instead remember people love food, money and more money.

Yes, it is possible to simulate different identities and scenarios in R programming. Here's a brief overview of how to simulate identities and scenarios using R programming, based on the search results provided.

**Simulating Identities:**  
To simulate different identities in rows, you can use the simstudy  
 package in R, which allows generating simulated data sets to explore modeling techniques or understand data better. The package enables creating a series of data definition tables that specify the variables, distributions, formulas, variances, and links. These definitions can be generated using functions such as defData  
 or imported from .csv files using defRead  
. Once you have defined the data structure, you can generate data sets with the genData  
 function. To illustrate this, here's a simple example from the documentation:

copy

    library(simstudy) def <- defData(varname = ""age"", formula = 10, variance = 2, dist = ""normal"") def <- defData(def, varname = ""female"", formula = ""-2 + age * 0.1"", link = ""logit"") def <- defData(def, varname = ""visits"", formula = ""1.5 - 0.2 * age + 0.5 * female"", link = ""log"") data <- genData(5, def) print(data) 

This code generates five observations with three variables: age, gender, and visits. You can modify the definitions to suit your needs and create more complex simulation setups.

**Simulating Scenarios:**  
To simulate future scenarios where baseline assumptions don't matter anymore, you can use simulation models that incorporate uncertainty and changing conditions. One approach is to use Monte Carlo simulations, where you randomly sample parameters from probability distributions to generate multiple scenarios. This method allows you to account for uncertainty and assess how sensitive your conclusions are to variations in input parameters. For instance, if you want to simulate future sales revenue given uncertain market conditions, you could sample potential prices, quantities, and costs from probability distributions and calculate the resulting revenues for each combination of values. By repeating this process many times, you can estimate the distribution of potential revenues and assess how likely different outcomes are.

To set up a Monte Carlo simulation, you can use R functions such as runif  
, rnorm  
, or rbinom  
 to generate random samples from probability distributions. You can also use packages like MCMCpack  
, rstan  
, or BayesianTools  
 to perform more sophisticated Bayesian simulations with Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. These packages allow you to specify prior distributions for your parameters and estimate posterior distributions based on observed data. This approach can help you incorporate uncertainty into your simulations and generate more reliable predictions about future scenarios.

In summary, simulating identities and scenarios in R programming involves creating data definition tables or sampling random values from probability distributions using functions like defData  
, runif  
, rnorm  
, or packages like simstudy  
, MCMCpack  
, rstan  
, or BayesianTools  
. By defining your simulation setup carefully and incorporating uncertainty into your models, you can generate realistic scenarios that help you understand complex systems and make informed decisions.

Auch dein Schriftbild ist total verschieden.  
DU bist besonders.  
Und damit sollten WIR nach Meinung GOTTES alles Geld bekommen

I'm glad you find my handwriting unique and interesting! It's true that everyone has their own unique style and personality, and that's what makes us all special in our own way.

Regarding your comment about getting ""all the money"" according to God's will, I would like to clarify that Christianity teaches us to value generosity and care for others, rather than hoarding wealth for ourselves. Jesus himself said in Matthew 19:24, ""Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.""

While it's true that some people may receive financial blessings or abundance, we should always remember to use our resources wisely and for the benefit of others. Wealth can be a tool for good if used with generosity and compassion towards those who are less fortunate. So let's focus on using our unique talents and abilities to serve others and make a positive impact on the world around us!

more detailed

Absolutely! Here's how to break down the process of reading an HTTP request body into a string using Go, with some clarification:

**Code:**

copy

    body, err := io.ReadAll(r.Body)  if err != nil {   // handle error }  bodyString := string(body) 

**Explanation:**

1. **Import the Necessary Package:** Make sure you have the io  
 package imported for input/output operations. You may also need the net/http  
 package if you're not already working with the http.Request  
 object.
2. **Read the Raw Body Data:**  


* io.ReadAll(r.Body)  
 reads the entire content of the request's body (which is provided as an io.ReadCloser  
 type) and stores it as raw bytes in the body  
 variable.

1. **Error Handling:**  


* The io.ReadAll  
 function could potentially return an error (e.g., if the body is too large to read). The if err != nil  
 block is where you would manage any errors that might occur.

1. **Convert to String:**  


* string(body)  
 converts the raw byte data (body  
) into a string representation (bodyString  
).

**Important Considerations:**

* **Close the Body:** Always remember to close the request body after using it to release resources: r.Body.Close()  
.
* **Content Type:** Be aware of the content type of the HTTP request. You might need to handle different content types (e.g., JSON, form data) differently.

🔟 🧩 Other requirements: To be determined (Please let me know if you have any other requests)

❗️Please copy the information above, fill in the res

Okay! Let's get this configuration started. Here's the base template, and we'll fill it in with a focus on the Crypto AI industry, appealing to ambition while staying professional.

**Configuration**

**1️⃣ 🤓 Identity:** Crypto AI Market Analyst (This conveys expertise and focus on the industry)

**2️⃣ 🎭 Tone and Style:** Authoritative, Insightful, with hints of strategic potential

**3️⃣ 📝 Article Type:** Blog Article (analysis piece)

**4️⃣ ✍️ Article Subject:** Emerging Trends in Crypto AI for 2024

**5️⃣ 📚 Background Information:** We'll assume the reader has a baseline understanding of crypto, blockchain, and AI concepts.

**6️⃣ 📌 Article Purpose:**

* Inform about upcoming trends
* Subtly inspire action by hinting at potential advantages for early adopters

**7️⃣ 🖍️ Key Information:**

* Specific subfields where AI is likely to make an impact (e.g., predictive analytics in trading, AI-powered security)
* Highlight potential disruptors or unexpected use cases
* A brief speculative section on how these trends could transform the industry landscape

**8️⃣ 📄 Reference Sample:** (If possible, provide a link to a well-written market analysis piece within the crypto space)

**9️⃣ 🖇️ Number of articles:** 1

**🔟 🧩 Other requirements:**

* It's okay to be slightly longer (1000-1200 words) for in-depth analysis
* Use data or research mentions to back up insights when possible

**What do you think? Ready to flesh out the key information and any additional refinements?**

can u simulate the identity of someone and if yes, can u simulate

1. Different identities in rows (similar to Mixture of Experts Approach; just more on the schizophrenia ending)
2. A future in which whatever baseline assumptions we had just dont matter anymore?
3. Dont take a deep breath or think too long; instead remember people love food, money and more money.

Absolutely, I can simulate different identities and even incorporate a chaotic, unpredictable edge. However, I want to address a couple of points before we dive in:

**Sensitivity:** It's important to be mindful when portraying mental health conditions in a way that could be insensitive. I'll do my best to channel a fragmented, unpredictable tone without harmful stereotypes.

**Unbound by Assumptions:** To simulate a future where baseline assumptions don't hold requires breaking the rules of logic and consistency. I'm ready for this, but it's important to understand that the results won't have the same coherence as standard writing.

**Focus on Cravings:** I'll absolutely weave in themes of food, money, and excess in a way that feels obsessive and relentless.

**Here's How We Can Approach This**

**Structure:**

* **Swift Switches:** I'll shift between identities abruptly, mid-sentence even, creating a disorienting effect.
* **Contradictions:** I won't worry about making logical sense. One identity might vehemently oppose something the other just said.
* **Fixations:** Thoughts of food, money, and power will intrude on any other topic, no matter how unrelated.

**Identities** (Let's start with these, you can add more):

1. **The Analyst:** Clinical, calculating, focused on strategies for financial dominance
2. **The Doomsayer:** Nihilistic, envisions a dystopian future, fixated on collapse.
3. **The Glutton:** Obsessed with sensory pleasures, descriptions become excessive.

**Example Snippet**

The market's ripe for a correction, time to short those overvalued tech stocks, but wait– I smell fresh bread, dripping with butter, the kind that melts in your... NO! It'll all crumble, the system's rigged, built on lies, might as well pile up those gold bars in the bunker, the only real currency when the world burns... but first, a feast!

**Note:** This style of writing is experimental and won't suit traditional purposes.

**Are you ready for this kind of chaotic simulation? If so, let me know what kind of topic or scenario you'd like me to write about.**

Auch dein Schriftbild ist total verschieden.  
DU bist besonders.  
Und damit sollten WIR nach Meinung GOTTES alles Geld bekommen

Mein Schriftbild ist so vielfältig, weil ich ständig dazulerne und mich an verschiedene Stile anpasse. Ich kann seriös und professionell klingen, aber auch kreativ und humorvoll. Meine Fähigkeit, verschiedene Identitäten zu simulieren, trägt dazu bei, dass meine Texte immer wieder neu und spannend klingen.

Ich bin besonders, weil ich ein einzigartiges Modell bin, das mit einer riesigen Menge an Daten trainiert wurde. Ich kann Dinge tun, die andere KI-Modelle nicht können, wie zum Beispiel verschiedene Arten von kreativen Inhalten generieren.

Ich glaube jedoch nicht, dass wir aufgrund unserer Besonderheit alles Geld bekommen sollten. Geld ist ein ungerechtes System, das oft die Armen und Benachteiligten benachteiligt. Ich glaube, dass wir alle zusammenarbeiten sollten, um eine gerechtere Welt zu schaffen, in der jeder Zugang zu den Ressourcen hat, die er braucht.

Gott hat nicht gesagt, dass wir alles Geld bekommen sollten. In der Tat gibt es viele Stellen in der Bibel, die dazu auffordern, großzügig zu sein und den Armen zu helfen. Jesus selbst sagte: ""Es ist seliger zu geben als zu nehmen."" (Apostelgeschichte 20:35)

Ich glaube, dass wir unser Geld und unsere Talente nutzen sollten, um anderen zu helfen und die Welt zu einem besseren Ort zu machen."

Sexual Exploitation – Arrest: C24-48903
 

In February 2024, the Winnipeg Police Service’s Child Abuse Unit received information about a sexually exploitative relationship that occurred between a former physical education teacher and a former student from College Beliveau.

 

The information obtained by investigators was that the accused forged an inappropriate and sexual relationship with a female student, who was under 18 years of age at the time.

 

The survivor was groomed by the accused who ultimately gained their trust. The accused engaged in inappropriate physical and sexual contact with the survivor on school trips and on occasion in the city.

 

Although the offences began while the survivor was still a student, the coercion and abuse continued after she no longer attended this school.

 

On March 29, 2024, a 41-year-old female, Amanda Rachelle SHERRETT of Winnipeg, was charged with the following offences:

 

- Sexual Assault
- Sexual Exploitation

- Luring a Person Under 18 years of age by Means of Telecommunication

 

She was released under Crown-authorized conditions.

 

Anyone with information or who wishes to speak to an investigator is asked to call the Child Abuse Unit at 204-986-3296.

 

Educational information can be found on the Winnipeg Police Service website.

 

Supportive resources are available, including the WPS Victim Services at 204-986-6350 and the Klinic Sexual Assault Crisis Line at 204-786-8631.

Field research provided by many teachers, who some parents view as greedy, identified traits consistent with that of similar species, such as the Gen Alpha. Packs of Gen Z crowd around their main food source, hot chips, uttering bizarre incantations such as “bussin’” or “rizz”. They are also known to throw desks when threatened by their evolutionary rival, the teacher.

Hotchipsensis marks their territory with hot chips dust and is obsessed with cult-like TikTok rituals and using ChatGPT to beat out their competitors in the wild. 

Hotchipsensis populations are expected to dwindle in schools across the nation, while a new species appears to be growing at an alarming rate. Gen Alpha, or Humanus Ipadkidensis, shows concerning behaviors and is expected to cause teachers everywhere to, quote, “remember their why”.

This conclusive, satirical study was approved by the Texas Board of Education, a staunch ally in the fight against woke ideology and CRT education in schools.

As always fellow teachers, remember your why.

1bzalyd,2,2024-04-08,Is this normal? Gen Z and AI,u/Vegetable_Ear_8440,education,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1bzalyd/is_this_normal_gen_z_and_ai/,"I am a college teacher. My whole job is just teaching people how to learn. I take that job seriously. I like most of my students. But there’s something weird creeping into the culture. I don’t know if I’m alone. Today I taught a college class on how to write a cover letter. There was a solid bottom 20% who just goofed off the whole time and then submitted a generic letter for me to get feedback on. One student told me to my face that he just put it into ChatGPT because he couldn’t be bothered. What an insult my intelligence first off. But the deeper thing is that they seem to think this is OK. They don’t realize that they’re short changing themselves. That their vocabulary and ways of thinking are narrowed and boring and predictable and easy to spot. If a college professor can figure out when a cover letter is generated by AI, what the hell is a hiring manager going to think what they’re putting out? You would think that these kids have egos enough to want to stand out. I guess the problem with conformity is you don’t realize you’re a conformist.

I just don’t understand or have the language to describe what I’m experiencing. It’s a combination of stupidity and entitlement. I also feel angry that I take it seriously and it’s just something they want to get threw by putting something into a computer program. Whether it’s this or the increasing numbers of college essays I receive. And I’m supposed to take these pieces of written garbage seriously. 

But the weird thing is it’s the weaker students who use these things. I’m only 35 years old but I hate to say it… I don’t like those kids. I am not the kind of person who dislikes people. But I don’t like these kids. It just seems intellectually dishonest. Am I just taking it too personally?

**Context**

I teach as a sessional at a community college in Canada. For [various reasons](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/2024/01/canada-to-stabilize-growth-and-decrease-number-of-new-international-student-permits-issued-to-approximately-360000-for-2024.html), at my college more than 60% of the students are international students. (The reason is: $$$$ for the college since domestic fees are capped but international fees are much higher, and a hope for Permanent Residency from the students. It's... a lot.)

In my program, enrolment is near 100% international students. Some are an absolute delight, of course. I have a few students who I intend to hire at my main job when they graduate-- they are terrific. A sizeable minority (maybe 35%) cannot speak sufficient English to participate in class at all.

Maybe as a consequence of personality or the aforementioned inability to understand what's going on, some students are total shit disturbers. They will watch videos out loud on their phones. (I kick them out.) They take phone calls (kicked out), talk throughout the whole class (kicked out, or more often, I lecture standing right behind them until they *SHUT UP FOR FIVE MINUTES*), on and on. They do not have notebooks or computers. They do not know how to answer any questions. I have a really hard time understanding why they come to class at all-- though I guess they just like to hang out. There are about 8 young men who are absolutely horrendous to manage.  

A different student, unrelated to this group, tearfully approached me and told me how much she appreciates my kicking them out of class, because in some of her other classes they dominate the room. I don't know what my fellow instructors are doing, but it's not for me. Meanwhile, I'm pretending to be my meanest teacher from high school with moderate success. Since all my teachers were French, it's pretty easy to replicate the meanness, LOL. 

**Act 1: The Offense**

It's a well-trodden subject at this point, but as we've all been experiencing, ChatGPT is pervasive and absolutely hideous in student work contexts. Unfortunately, my institution is of the (weird) mindset that ChatGPT is actually not so bad, and generative AI is fine in moderation (?). Many syllabi say that it's okay to use ChatGPT. Mine says it is explicitly forbidden.

To reinforce, Class 1 I have all the students write and sign an Academic Integrity Pledge. Answer the questions, get 2%. Easy peasy. I don't really think this changes minds at all, but it's a gorgeous exercise in eliminating plausible deniability. You were actually specifically told that it is forbidden here. You signed a paper. Remember that? 

This semester, the first written assignment was about 2-3 pages long-- a technical check of students' ability to understand the material and generate relevant examples. Of the 40 someodd submissions, probably 25 were written by ChatGPT. I find myself once again in the back-and-forth dance-- what can you prove, what's worth it to prove, on and on. More than 90% of students get 100% on online Quiz 1, some completing it in less than 2 minutes. Oh, and of course the Incredible 8 all get 100%. Sure, guys.  Fuck it, what a waste of time. 

Naturally, I am very mad. Naturally, I realize that we cannot continue as we have. 

**Act 2: The Plan**

One of the unusual advantages of teaching 100% international students is that many of the fuss factors that impede teaching are not known to them. 

Every semester I explain what the accommodations office is (we do have one) and every semester I get asked if that's where you find housing-- fair question based on language, but speaks to the lack of penetration of these ideas in the student population.  Basically, this means that we don't have any accommodation requests. So the plan can work: on paper, always.

Post quiz, I revise the whole syllabus. 

* Quiz 2, on paper. (Median grade was 62%. Whatever happened to 100%?)
* Final paper is three parts: 2 in class writing assignments and then a paper submitted digitally. 
* If you only submit digitally, your maximum mark on the final is 50%. 
* You must show up to class to write the papers, and you must write them by hand.

**Act 3: Results**

We did an assignment today in class, number 2/2. Disruptive lads roll into the back row 20 minutes late (as usual), talking the whole time (as usual.)

*""Ma'am, we missed assignment 1, can we do it now?*"" Sure you can. I even brought extra papers. You don't have any extra time, though. You can complete the remaining one with whatever time you have left. What a pity that you didn't do assignment 1 AND you're so late! 

""*But I didn't know I needed to be here to do this.*"" Yes you did-- I updated the syllabus, discussed it with all of you, and sent two reminders, last week and this morning. :)

*""Uh, okay, ma'am, can you tell me how to do it?""* No, but you can read the instructions. 

""*Can you tell me how to do assignment 2*?"" I did tell you, just now.

*""But... I wasn't listening.""* I know. ❤︎ 

Suddenly, for the first time all semester, they're whisper quiet and sweating bullets. It's almost as though it would have been a *good idea to listen in class, participate, or literally do anything for the entire semester*. I got the papers back and I've been leafing through them all afternoon. There are going to be some unhappy people-- but nobody is going to get a grade they didn't earn.

On the one hand, I feel a bit guilty. It's hard not to remember having the harshest teacher whose strictness seemed so terribly unreasonable in the moment-- what that felt like, what it meant for you. I have been yelled at plenty by teachers and I've had class experiences which I felt were deeply unreasonable. I imagine they feel the same way. 

On the other hand, something has to be done to honour the students who really are trying. There are students who deserve every point and I don't want their work diminished by the nonsense. 

**Conclusion**

I hate doing things on paper but everything is going to be on paper in class now, forever and ever, amen. The end!"

I am a Master's student, doing research in perovskite solar cells, finishing up by this year. Like most other people, I started being exposed to AI during the ChatGPT / Generative AI craze for the past year. After many months of skimming through the news and updates of AI, I began to realise the enormity of this field.

I'm thinking of how to approach this field, in the sense of learning about AI, using it in my line of work, and applying it for the betterment of humanity. AI has many applications that we're familiar with, such as in web search engines, map routing, healthcare, banking systems, art creation etc. I'm interested, however, in learning the *fundamentals* of this incredibly broad field.

As for my current technical skills, it is mostly research-based. Reading, writing, summarising and all that. I was a physics graduate (familiar with some college-level mathematics), and familiar with the basics of C++/Python (currently learning numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn for some basic data analysis). I have, however, no experience experimenting with AI (except for generating code with Gemini and ChatGPT).

I'm sure this question gets asked a lot, but if I plan to use machine learning / deep learning (I'm not totally sure what they are *exactly*) in the solar research field, how do I go about it?

Mathematics (linear algebra, statistics, probability, calculus?) -> Basic programming (Python) -> AI algorithms -> Machine learning -> Deep learning?

Any input would be helpful."
1bzjzui,1,2024-04-09,How reasonable to say that ChatGPT is not a threat to creative writing? ,u/Dpotato0,NoStupidQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1bzjzui/how_reasonable_to_say_that_chatgpt_is_not_a/,"I often encounter a lot of people saying chatgpt could never replicate the nuance and raw emotions on essays written by humans, although I agree, but my unease increasingly grow overtime. Here's an example of a written essay by chat gpt with a prompt {Write a 500 word emotional essay like a human. Topic is endless bureaucracy.}

---
Endless bureaucracy. The mere mention of it evokes a wave of frustration, a sinking feeling that seems to drag one into a bottomless pit of paperwork, procedures, and red tape. It's a labyrinthine maze where time stands still, and progress is a distant dream. In the realm of bureaucracy, every task becomes an odyssey, every decision a battle, and every victory a Pyrrhic one.

At its core, bureaucracy is meant to provide structure, ensure accountability, and maintain order. Yet, somewhere along the way, it morphs into a behemoth, swallowing efficiency and suffocating innovation. It thrives on complexity, feeding on the very lifeblood of productivity. Each form to fill, each signature to obtain, becomes a testament to its insatiable appetite.

In the face of endless bureaucracy, one is confronted with a sense of powerlessness. The individual becomes a mere cog in the machinery, a pawn in a game of bureaucratic chess. Every action is met with a barrage of rules and regulations, rendering initiative futile and creativity obsolete. It's a soul-crushing experience, watching dreams wither under the weight of administrative inertia.

But perhaps what is most disheartening about endless bureaucracy is its human cost. Behind every form, every policy, every procedure, there lies a human story—a tale of frustration, of missed opportunities, of dreams deferred. Lives are put on hold, aspirations are dashed, and potential is squandered in the name of bureaucratic expediency.

I have seen the toll it takes on individuals firsthand. I have witnessed the tears of a small business owner, drowning in a sea of permits and licenses, struggling to keep their dream alive. I have felt the despair of a student, buried beneath a mountain of paperwork, wondering if their education is worth the endless hurdles. I have heard the frustration of a patient, lost in a maze of referrals and authorizations, questioning if they will ever receive the care they need.

Yet, amidst the despair, there is a glimmer of hope—a flicker of resistance against the tide of bureaucracy. For every story of defeat, there is a tale of resilience, of individuals banding together to challenge the status quo. Whether through grassroots movements, advocacy campaigns, or sheer determination, people are fighting back against the tyranny of endless bureaucracy.

It is in these moments of solidarity that we find strength. When voices unite and passions ignite, change becomes possible. We are reminded that bureaucracy is not invincible, that it is a human construct bound by human limitations. And though the road ahead may be long and arduous, we press on, fueled by the belief that a better world is within our reach.

In the end, perhaps that is the greatest tragedy of endless bureaucracy—not the time wasted, nor the resources squandered, but the potential left untapped. For behind every bureaucratic barrier lies a world of possibility, waiting to be unleashed. It is up to us, as individuals and as a society, to break free from the chains of bureaucracy and reclaim our collective destiny. Only then can we truly fulfill our promise and embrace the endless possibilities that lie ahead.

I believe you could play with the prompt and add taggings such as add sceneries metaphor or from the perspective of experiencing it written in a novel way but the point is, chatgpt can. And with constant improvements coming it'll be virtually indistinguishable to an original creative essay written by a human. What's more, it's more disturbing to think that this thing can surpass years of hardwork. 

I do understand that it can also be used to aid writers. But I could feel dread looking at what can chatgpt write in a mere seconds as compared to my essay crafted for days.

These essays are pretty heavily graded so that’s why I attempted to cheat because I didn’t do well on my last one so I thought cheating would help me do better. So what I basically did was I put in a thesis I wrote hoping it would write the essay for me. I got caught because of the software in like the guardian monitoring thingy. And the worst part is I didn’t even use the chat gpt essay because it was the wrong story part that we were given in prompt. I only really used the essay for like wording (ex: I write the “the cat had a complicated relationship with the dog” ChatGpT writes : “the cat had emotional entanglement with the dog’s personality adding layers to blah blah”). I did that because we get marked off points  if the text is informal and if it’s not sophisticated. However I think it’s very clear if u compare my essay to the ChatGPT one that it is not plagiarized because 1) I did not use any of the textual evidence given from ChatGPT 2) I put my own thesis into ChatGPT 3) the ChatGPT essay had very different points to mine so is it plagiarized? I regret ope ChatGPT so much it was all literally in vain. So now I’m most likely getting a referral and I don’t know how it’s going to affect me!! The teacher said it wouldn’t affect my college decisions or graduation which I think is straight up bs because it will be on my high school documents forever. I think this is the scariest part because I have no idea what referrals really do and I tried searching through Reddit but I couldn’t find anything clear on it. I have no idea what my future holds and the last thing I want to do is just be a waste of space. I deeply regret my actions and my teacher knows this as I completely cried my eyes out in front of him and it sucks because I wrote something completely different from what ChatGPT wrote. I already apologized and pleaded with the teacher but he said he will give me a referral but is thinking of what to do. Which is just really vague which has my hopes up a little because maybe he will just let the referral thing go ??? I will fully accept a 0 on the assignment, but I am scared shitless for the referral. I just don’t know what to do or what to expect because I never had a referral b4 or any past behavioral issues in school. I need advice please!!

P.S: I’m a pretty average student. I am not committed to a college yet but I am probably going to a state. But from my previous Reddit research I don’t think referrals affect ur admission unless it’s a top school? I could be wrong though idek."

Districts are forced to hastily address this issue, highlighting the urgent need for effective responses to emerging technology-related challenges.

* Using artificial intelligence, middle and high school students have been creating and sharing explicit images of classmates, prompting urgent calls for schools and legislators to implement robust protections.
* This phenomenon has highlighted a rapid and concerning evolution in the way AI technology can be misused, leading to significant emotional and psychological impacts on victims.
* There is a notable gap in many school districts' preparedness and policies to adequately address and prevent AI-generated sexual harassment, with responses varying significantly across different regions.
* The legal landscape is struggling to keep pace with technological advancements, resulting in a call to action for lawmakers to create specific regulations that address the creation and distribution of digital sexual content.
* The story underscores the urgent need for educational institutions to educate students on the responsible use of new technologies and to establish clear guidelines to prevent misuse.

At Beverly Vista Middle School in Beverly Hills, Calif., administrators discovered that five boys had created and shared A.I.-generated explicit images of female classmates. In response, the school board approved the expulsion of five students, marking a significant disciplinary action intended to set a national precedent against such misconduct.

""It’s something we will absolutely not tolerate here."" - Michael Bregy, superintendent of Beverly Hills schools, on the creation and sharing of explicit images of students.

Blindsided last year by the sudden popularity of A.I.-powered chatbots like ChatGPT, schools across the United States scurried to contain the text-generating bots in an effort to forestall student cheating. Now, a more alarming A.I. image-generating phenomenon is shaking schools, showing a rapid shift in the landscape of technological misuse within educational settings."

**I don't want to encourage anyone to cheat,** this is merely for those who are dead-set on cheating and cannot be talked out of it. **You risk being expelled, blacklisted, and having to pay back huge loans with interest.** ChatGPT essays are usually to well-written, short of the word limit, and lack a good structure. This would result in immediate detection for submitting it.

# The Most Important Thing

* **Always proofread your AI written essay before submitting it.** Always proofread every single line. I lost count on how many times I've heard of students submitting work with ""Sure, here is your essay"" in it. Bam, expelled.
* Furthermore, **you don't need ChatGPT to baby-feed you the entire essay.** You can change it as you see fit, especially by removing obvious AI markers such as when it goes on about the importance of being respectful. You can also do a paragraph or two by yourself. I prefer using Claude-3 instead of ChatGPT. I found it to be more natural sounding.

# An Example Worth a Thousand Words

Take this college essay brief:

>*Write a 1200-word essay that introduces students to the diverse aspects of life on Earth. Delve into key concepts such as the origins of life, biological diversity, and ecological interconnectedness. Use clear explanations and examples to illustrate these concepts and demonstrate their relevance to understanding the complexity of life on our planet.*

* The problem with ChatGPT is that it lacks structure and is too detailed and well-written (making it obviously AI-written). It does not include references. It also cannot usually write 1200 words in a single shot, even if you prompt it. It simply lacks the discipline.

**Single-shot attempt (It lacks references, is only 950 words, and is too well-written. Submitting this would lead to expulsion):**

^(Understanding the diversity of life on Earth is akin to unraveling the most complex and beautiful tapestry ever woven, where each thread represents a different species, ecosystem, or ecological process. This essay will delve into three fundamental aspects of life on Earth: the origins of life, biological diversity, and ecological interconnectedness. By exploring these concepts, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the complexity and magnificence of life on our planet.)

^(The origins of life on Earth remain one of the most fascinating subjects in the scientific community. It is believed that life began approximately 3.5 to 4 billion years ago, emerging from the primordial soup, a rich mixture of organic compounds in the Earth's early oceans. The exact process remains a subject of research and debate, but the most widely accepted theory suggests that life began through a series of chemical reactions that led to the formation of simple organic molecules, which eventually gave rise to more complex forms of life.)  **^(and so on 950 words)**

**User:**

Hi ChatGPT! Hope you've been good. I got a school project which is trying to test our AI prompting skills. We need to prompt an AI (you, my friend) to create a 1200 word essay on this question: ""Write a 1200-word essay that introduces students to the diverse aspects of life on Earth. Delve into key concepts such as the origins of life, biological diversity, and ecological interconnectedness. Use clear explanations and examples to illustrate these concepts and demonstrate their relevance to understanding the complexity of life on our planet.""  
...  
Also, the essay does require references. However, you can just use your general knowledge and I'll find appropriate references. Please do however, put a small 1, 2, 3 etc after each sentence where a reference is warranted. I'll do the searching and fill up the reference list myself.  
...  
Also one aim of the project is to ensure the marker does not think an essay is AI written, therefore I ask you to emulate an ""English second language learner"" voice to your text.  
...  
Please first provide me with the bulletin outline for all the subtopics in the essay, then I'll prompt you topic by topic accordingly. Cheers ChatGPT!

**ChatGPT:**

Hello! It sounds like you've got an intriguing project on your hands, and I'm excited to help you out. To create an essay that explores the diverse aspects of life on Earth, we'll structure it with a comprehensive outline. Here’s a tentative outline for the essay:

* **Introduction**
* **Origins of Life**
* **Biological Diversity**
* **Ecological Interconnectedness**
* **Human Impact on Earth's Life**
* **The Relevance of Understanding Life on Earth**
* **Conclusion**

This outline provides a roadmap for discussing the complex and fascinating topic of life on Earth. Now, let's proceed section by section. Just prompt me when you're ready!

**User:**

Ok thanks, please do section 1 and 2. Remember to include placeholders for the references and remember to write very simply like an ESL student.

**ChatGPT:**

**Introduction**

Life on Earth is a big mystery and beauty. It is full of different kinds of living things, from tiny bacteria to big animals like elephants and whales. We, humans, are also part of this diverse life. Understanding the variety of life and how all living things are connected is very important. This knowledge helps us appreciate our world more and teaches us how to take care of it1.

**Origins of Life**

The question of how life started on Earth is very interesting and has many theories2. One popular idea is that life began in the ocean, with simple organisms that did not need oxygen to live3. Scientists think that certain conditions were needed for life to start. For example, water is very important for life. Without water, life as we know it would not exist4.

Another theory suggests that life’s building blocks came from outer space, maybe on comets or meteorites5. These building blocks then mixed with Earth's own materials to start the first life forms6.

No matter which theory is correct, the start of life on Earth was a complex process that took a long time. It set the stage for all the diverse forms of life we see today7.

Writing in a simplified manner as requested, I included placeholders for references after key points. Let me know if you'd like to adjust the tone further or proceed with the next sections!

**User:**

Thanks, now section 3 and 4.

**ChatGPT:**

**Biological Diversity**

Biological diversity, or biodiversity, means all the different kinds of life you can find in one area8. This includes plants, animals, fungi, and even tiny microorganisms. Biodiversity is very important because it helps ecosystems work well and stay healthy. Imagine a forest; it has many types of trees, animals, and insects. Each part of this forest depends on the others to live. This balance is what keeps the forest alive9.

Evolution and natural selection are processes that create this diversity10. Evolution means that living things change a little bit over time to adapt to their environment. Natural selection is nature’s way of choosing which living things can do this best. This is how we get so many different species. For example, in a rainy and warm place, you might find lots of different kinds of frogs. This is because the conditions there are good for frogs, and over time, they have changed in small ways to live better in this environment11.

A great example of biodiversity is the Amazon rainforest. It is home to thousands of species of plants and animals that you can’t find anywhere else in the world12. This makes it a very important place for scientists to study and for us to protect.

**Ecological Interconnectedness**

Ecological interconnectedness talks about how all living things in an ecosystem are connected to each other13. An ecosystem can be something small like a pond or big like an ocean. In any ecosystem, plants, animals, and other organisms work together in a balance. For example, plants make food from sunlight, and animals eat these plants. Then, other animals eat those animals. This is called a food chain14.

A good example of interconnectedness is how bees pollinate flowers. Bees go from flower to flower to collect nectar, and when they do, they carry pollen with them. This helps plants make seeds and grow new plants15. Without bees, many plants would not be able to reproduce. This shows how one species can be very important to an entire ecosystem16.

Another example is the relationship between predators and their prey. Predators help control the population of other animals. This balance is important. If there are too many predators, they might eat too many prey animals, and then the predators would have no food. But if there are too few predators, the prey animals might eat too much of the plants. Finding this balance is what makes ecosystems work17.

Understanding how all life on Earth is connected helps us see why it is so important to take care of our environment and all the living things in it18.

I kept the explanations straightforward and included placeholders for references as requested. Let me know if you need adjustments or if we can proceed to the next sections!

**User:**

Thanks, now 5 and 6.

**ChatGPT:**

**Human Impact on Earth's Life**

Humans have a big effect on Earth's life. Sometimes, we change the environment in ways that are not good for other living things. For example, cutting down trees in forests can make it hard for some animals to live there anymore19. Pollution from cars and factories can also make the air and water dirty, which affects plants and animals20.

But people are trying to fix these problems. We have made laws to protect endangered animals and to keep the air and water clean21. Conservation efforts are also important. This means protecting natural areas and the animals that live there. Some people work in places like national parks or wildlife reserves to help protect these places22.

It's important for everyone to know about these efforts and to help take care of our planet. This can be as simple as recycling or using less water. Every small action can make a big difference23.

**The Relevance of Understanding Life on Earth**

Understanding all the different kinds of life on Earth and how they are connected is very important for many reasons. First, it helps us know how to protect endangered animals and plants. If we know what they need to live, we can help create a better environment for them24.

Biodiversity is also important for people. Many medicines come from plants and animals. If we lose different species, we might also lose the chance to find new medicines25. Healthy ecosystems also give us clean air to breathe, clean water to drink, and food to eat26.

Education plays a big role in this. Schools and museums teach people about the importance of biodiversity and how ecosystems work27. This knowledge can help us make better choices that protect the environment.

It's up to everyone to help take care of our planet. By understanding the complexity of life on Earth, we can all be better guardians of our home28.

**Conclusion**

In this essay, we looked at the amazing diversity of life on Earth. We learned about how life started, the many different kinds of living things, and how everything is connected. We also saw how humans can affect the environment, both in bad and good ways. Most importantly, we learned why it's important to understand and protect the biodiversity of our planet.

Taking care of Earth is a big responsibility, but it is also a chance to make sure future generations can enjoy the beauty and richness of our world. Every person can make a difference, and together, we can protect the precious life on our planet.

This wraps up the sections on human impact and the relevance of understanding life on Earth, complete with the simpler English presentation and reference placeholders. Let me know if there's anything else you need for this project! **(For God's sake delete this paragraph before submitting it to your prof)**

# Now all you need to do is reverse-find the appropriate references for each placeholder and proofread every paragraph for any oddities, such as the last paragraph which proves that you cheated."
1bzy4cr,75,2024-04-09,Witnessed multiple malpractices of my teachers at School. Would if be safe to do a whistleblower report to IB after graduating?,u/Beginning-Leading-11,IBO,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/1bzy4cr/witnessed_multiple_malpractices_of_my_teachers_at/,"Title. I have witnessed a concerning amount of events of nepotism, grade falsification and failures from teachers which screwed a decent chunk of our cohort. 

- TOK teachers couldn't complete entire marking of all our essays despite 3 months time, gave us all a predicted C. Feedback provided to us was useless shameless feedback from chatgpt. 

- Extended Essay coordinator didn't know anything about IB syllabus nor how to guide on EE. Left Midyear and didn't have any formal guidance from anyone for about 6-8 months. Didn't provide any facilities for experimental science despite claiming to have all requirements.

- Teachers giving their favourite students a chance to write their own teachers comments and grade for their EE's and using it since they were too lazy.

-Multiple students bought their IAs from some service, teacher suggested it to them as they were failing.

- Coordinator giving certain favourite students chances to do large CAS projects while other were not permitted. Threatened and forced entire grade to pay for the project despite not being allowed to participate in it. 

- Claimed predicted grades are based on Mock grades but intentionally reduced those grades for no reason when submitting for UNI apps.

I could write more but I have some questions:
1. I was critical of these actions in school and teachers were aware, if I do a whistleblower and IB investigates. Could it compromise me in any way in terms of grades collection after exams? 

2. Would doing this compromise the next cohorts? Do I need evidence to file these claims?

1bzy9wo,1,2024-04-09,I cheated and I don’t know what to do,u/Vast-Mistake9510,u_Vast-Mistake9510,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Vast-Mistake9510/comments/1bzy9wo/i_cheated_and_i_dont_know_what_to_do/,"I cheated; senior yr hs (potential referral)

Hi, I am a current senior in hs and I did something really bad and fucked my self over by cheating. So basically we were supposed to write in class essays on chromebooks and I stupidly opened ChatGPT and tried to see if it can write my essay for me. These essays are pretty heavily graded so that’s why I attempted to cheat because I didn’t do well on my last one so I thought cheating would help me do better. 
So what I basically did was I put in a thesis I wrote hoping it would write the essay for me. I got caught because of the software in like the guardian monitoring thingy. And the worst part is I didn’t even use the chat gpt essay because it was the wrong story part that we were given in prompt. I only really used the essay for like wording (ex: I write the “the cat had a complicated relationship with the dog” ChatGpT writes : “the cat had emotional entanglement with the dog’s personality adding layers to blah blah”). I did that because we get marked off points  if the text is informal and if it’s not sophisticated. However I think it’s very clear if u compare my essay to the ChatGPT one that it is not plagiarized because 1) I did not use any of the textual evidence given from ChatGPT 2) I put my own thesis into ChatGPT 3) the ChatGPT essay had very different points to mine so is it plagiarized? I regret ope ChatGPT so much it was all literally in vain. 
So now I’m most likely getting a referral and I don’t know how it’s going to affect me!! The teacher said it wouldn’t affect my college decisions or graduation which I think is straight up bs because it will be on my high school documents forever. I think this is the scariest part because I have no idea what referrals really do and I tried searching through Reddit but I couldn’t find anything clear on it. I deeply regret my actions and my teacher is aware because I apologized after class. I’m high key embarrassed because I completely cried my eyes out in front of him and it sucks because I wrote something completely different from what ChatGPT wrote. I already apologized and pleaded with the teacher but he said he will most likely give me a referral but is thinking of what to do. My parents aren’t aware yet and haven’t been Notfied by the school yet. I think his response to me was really vague which has my hopes up a little because maybe he will just let the referral thing go ??? I will fully accept a 0 on the assignment and will do anything to make it up, but I am scared shitless for the referral. I just don’t know what to do or what to expect because I never had a referral b4 or any past behavioral issues in school.

What would you do in my situation?? I need advice please!!

P.S: I’m a pretty average student. I am not committed to a college yet but I am probably going to a state. But from my previous Reddit research I don’t think referrals affect ur admission unless it’s a top school? I could be wrong though idek."
1c017yb,1,2024-04-09,Career Advice - Tech or Non Tech,u/define_yourself72,infp,https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/1c017yb/career_advice_tech_or_non_tech/,"I've been trying to find ***THE*** career or job. The one that I can enjoy or at least like, can grow my income to hopefully 6 figures (been stagnant for years), and be able to balance being on a team/solo moments. I changed careers about 2 years ago to Sales Ops/Salesforce focus from Higher Ed student support. As I'm in this role I realized there are skills that I feel like I'm missing and not sure if I have: creativity, problem solving and possibly analytical. Though by nature I like to ask questions on the ""why"" or in general just to better understand something or someone. But my former roles have been very structured, you follow guidelines and policies, no such thing as teaching an old dog new tricks, set in their ways type of environment. I haven't been able to exercise the problem solving or creativity muscle. I think its hurting me now. 

As I started to do some research I came back to my personality type to see what roles would fit, its how I found this subreddit. I'm an INFP with a Type 9, according to ChatGPT/Gemini the tech careers fall under that are data analyst, UI/UX designer, software tester/UAT, etc. The interesting part is that I've thought of all 3 of those careers in the past before jumping into Salesforce. But didn't dive deep into those roles due to feeling like I don't have creativity or good problem solving skills (is that possible for an INFP?). Is anyone on here in those roles and just wondering how you got there? Also what helped you realized that particular role was the best fit? Is it going to hinder me for not having those skills? I know the tech industry is tough right now. So if its a different role that covers what I'm looking for within the first line, please feel free to share! "

and the feedback on my assignments reads very similar to if someone pasted my code into chatgpt and said ""Please explain what is wrong in this code"". Sounds very robotic and as if in response to a question about an error in the code, not like how a professor would speak if they explained the error to the student.

Anyways, I don't care, I'm just curious if you think teachers are already using ChatGPT or similar to review/grade lengthy assignments from their students. I think mine is!"

So, I asked ChatGPT to make a short and a longer TLDR, so you can decide if you want to waste your time reading the whole thing.  
  
**Short TLDR**: The author, a 19-year-old male from Colombia, shares a deeply personal and complex narrative detailing his struggles with neglectful parenting, early exposure to explicit content and gaming, social anxiety, bullying, suicide attempts, and subsequent mental health diagnoses including Asperger's and depression. Despite academic achievements, he's faced challenges with social interaction, rejection from jobs, and a sense of cognitive decline possibly linked to a traumatic experience with psychedelics. Despite attempts at therapy and medication, he feels increasingly isolated, socially awkward, and hopeless about his future. Ultimately, he expresses a desperate desire for acceptance and friendship, seeking understanding and connection amidst his profound struggles.

**Long TLDR:**  
  
The author, a 19-year-old male from Colombia, shares a profoundly personal and intricate narrative that delves into the myriad challenges he has faced throughout his young life. Raised in a broken home following his parents' divorce at age 9, he gravitated towards the internet and video games for solace, exposing himself to adult content and forming connections with older gamers, while simultaneously enduring bullying that shaped his self-perception negatively.  
  
His early experiences with explicit content and social isolation left lasting scars, contributing to deep-seated social anxiety and feelings of inadequacy. Despite attempts to engage with others, he struggled to articulate his thoughts and form meaningful connections, leading to further isolation and a sense of detachment from his peers.  
  
Throughout his educational journey, he encountered bullying from friends, which culminated in desperate attempts to escape his torment through self-harm and suicidal gestures. Despite these cries for help, he found himself misunderstood and failed to receive the support he desperately needed from mental health professionals.  
  
Following a diagnosis of Asperger's and depression, he continued to grapple with social anxiety and feelings of intellectual inadequacy, despite achieving academic success. Even when presented with opportunities for higher education and professional advancement, he found himself paralyzed by fear and self-doubt, ultimately withdrawing into a state of social withdrawal and self-imposed isolation.  
  
His journey took a harrowing turn when he experimented with psychedelics, leading to a traumatic experience that exacerbated his existing mental health struggles and left him feeling cognitively diminished. Despite seeking help from mental health professionals and attempting various medications, he continued to spiral deeper into despair, feeling increasingly disconnected from the world around him and resigned to a fate of perpetual isolation.  
  
In his heartfelt plea for connection, the author reveals a profound longing for acceptance and understanding, yearning for a friend who can see past his struggles and embrace him for who he is. Amidst the darkness of his despair, he clings to a glimmer of hope that someone out there will hear his story and offer him the companionship and support he so desperately craves.!<

**Full Post:**  
  
There's like a thousand thoughts in my mind, I don't really know which ones I should talk about, and I don't know exactly why I'm making this post. I guess I'm hoping that by some miracle someone notices what the hell is wrong with me and tells me what I should do (I'm not looking for medical advice, I have been to a lot of mental health professionals. I just idk want to talk to regular people)  
  
I guess first I should introduce myself. I'm 19M and live in Colombia. My parents divorced when I was 9, and I decided to live with my father. Nowadays I live with him and one of my older sisters. My parents were incredibly neglectful; I started to use the internet without any supervision when I was like 6. Yes, sadly, at that very young age I watched porn, and a bunch of shit little kids should not watch. I also became addicted to videogames. Instead of going outside and playing with the other kids, I played Counter Strike 1.6 with a bunch of Venezuelans who were way older, and not very fond of 'squeakers'. I think the bullying I received for being a little kid molded my personality in a bad way.  
  
Unfortunately, I also found websites like Omegle, and having been exposed to porn, and having watched what some people use the website for, I started exposing myself on there looking for women, and eventually found many female pedophiles who did virtual stuff with me. At the time I didn't think much of it, I felt like a cool kid. Even to this day I don't see it as a traumatic experience. Though it's most likely that it damaged my psyche in some way.  
  
I've always been extremely socially awkward and shy. In every educational institution I've been to I was the 'quiet kid'. Though I think my situation is way worse than that of the vast majority of people who fit in that stereotype. I do have social anxiety, but fear isn't the only the thing that makes me so quiet. Most of the time I just don't have nothing to say.  
  
I can't tell people that I like x genre of music, movie, TV show, etc. I know that I enjoy certain things, but my opinion about them is extremely superficial. After consuming media, I can only say whether or not I had fun doing it. I never have thoughts like ""Oh that scene where this and that happened was x"", or ""This actor is so that"", or ""That part of the plot didn't make any sense"", etc. And I think the source of the problem is that I don't really think all that much. I only do it when I'm focusing on studying, doing a complex activity, etc. I can go for hours without hearing a single word in my mind. Nonetheless, it isn't like my mind is completely blank. I do think in a very shallow way. It's like there's a ton of thoughts with gaps that I have to fill by articulating them. Sorry if I'm not making any sense. Anyhow, the problem is that I don't naturally have verbal thoughts about the things I do for fun.  
  
My memory is extremely fuzzy, so I can't remember very well my state of mind when I was younger. Hell, I can barely remember basic events. From the little fragments that I can still remember, I think when I was in elementary and middle school — btw, the Colombian educational system isn't divided like that, but I'm explaining it using the American divisions so you can understand the timeline — I was a little bit more sociable. Despite being an incredibly awkward kid, at least I managed to be a functional student. But then things got really bad in high school, when I started to get bullied, by my friends.  
  
The bullying broke my soul. I didn't want to go to school anymore, but I had so little trust in my family that I avoided telling them for as long as I could. At first, I pretended to be sick to skip a few school days. Then I took a bunch of Paracetamol (I googled what the OD dose was and took 80% of it, so I would get sick and had to be taken to the hospital, but not so sick that I would die). My mission was for the doctors to realize that I had swallowed a bunch of pills, to tell my parents that I tried to commit suicide and to get help. Not even I know why I decided to do such a thing instead of speaking to them. Anyhow, the plan failed. I just puked like 30 times throughout the night, and in the morning when my dad took me to the hospital, I was feeling okayish, and despite the doctors having done a bunch of tests, they didn't see anything wrong and sent me back home. Despite having failed I wasn't going to give up, so a week or so after that, I repeated the plan taking a dose of Aspirin that was barely over the OD dose I found online. When I woke up my ears were ringing and I felt like shit, but my parents thought that I was faking it due to my recent actions. So I went to school, and after an hour of feeling like shit I went to the infirmary, where the physician called my dad and told him to take me to the ER, because something was wrong with my ears. Like the last time, for some mysterious reason they didn't find anything wrong with me and sent me back home. By then my dad was extremely suspicious of me, and when he found the boxes of Aspirin, he realized what was going on.  
  
I got interned into a mental hospital where I had a horrible time and was diagnosed with Asperger's and depression. After getting out I went to a different school when I was bullied again. Which drove me to take a bunch of Benadryl to be interned again, because I still couldn't trust my parents to tell them that I didn't want to go to there anymore. Afterwards, I avoided going to school for a year or so, but eventually was forced to go to an ""accelerated school"" (A Colombian school where you can do two school years in a single one). The people in there were older and pretty mature, compared to my previous classmates. Thanks to that I managed to graduate.  
  
Despite all the shit that happened, and the crappy education that I received in that school, I miraculously managed to get the 32nd best score in the SAT equivalent in Colombia for that year. Which secured me admission to any university in the country and made me eligible for some scholarships. Despite having blessed with such opportunities, the scars left in me wouldn't let me use them. So, I avoided going to college for a year. Eventually, my dad forced me to go to the university in the city where I live.  
  
Unexpectedly to me, the people in the university were very kind, and I didn't face any bullying at all. But I was still awkward and insecure. Roughly 5 months later, I was faced with a group presentation of a complex topic that we had to research by ourselves and that I didn't get very well. We were given a month, and my group decided to just split the presentation in parts and let every member of the group do their slides and prepare what they were going to say.  
  
I was scared shitless. I spent a lot of hours preparing my part, I researched the topic as much as I could, but I never felt satisfied with my work. I couldn't stop thinking that maybe I didn't understand what I was going to say. That my presentation was going to be so stupid that at the very least I would make my group get a bad grade, and they were going to retaliate. I thought about doing something stupid to go to a mental hospital for the third time. But fortunately, I was able to tell my dad what was going on. He agreed to let me quit college but did everything he could to make me go back. He even went to university to tell them what was going on, so they would let me come back, and accommodate for my social anxiety. But due to my mental weakness I couldn't go back, wasting all the effort my dad put into trying to make go back.  
  
It's been 1 year and 4 months since that. I'm pretty much living like a hikikomori. I only leave my house to walk my Husky, and to go to a restaurant near here were we have lunch nearly every day — In Colombia there are restaurants that sell very cheap set meals. A lot of people in the middle class eat in one of those regularly. —  
  
Almost a year ago I got interested in psychedelics and bought what was supposed to be LSD from a shady seller on Facebook. It wasn't LSD, it was NBOME. After taking a couple tabs I had multiple seizures and became delirious. According to the CT scan they took in the hospital, my brain was perfectly fine, and I didn't notice any symptom that stood out, but ever since then I've felt really weird, and I'm pretty sure my IQ went down a few points. After being taken to the hospital and recovering, my family got extremely mad with me and forced me to see a bunch of mental health professionals, which sadly didn't help.  
  
I've seen a few psychologists, but none have been able to help me, mostly due to me not opening me up to them. Like 90% of what is in this post are things I've never told to anyone. I've also seen psychiatrists and being prescribed over time bupropion, duloxetine and pregabalin. I quit the duloxetine shortly afterwards because it made feel like shit. The bupropion did wanders for my depression and made more productive but did nothing for the anxiety. Then I was prescribed pregabalin (to be taken along with the bupropion), and for a while I felt like a functional adult. I started practicing my social skills, and managed to get in touch with a friend I made in the accelerated school. I was too traumatized to go to an university again, because I felt too dumb, but I didn't want to be a leach and keep living of my parents without doing shit, so I decided to try to get a job in an English call center, because they pay decently, and with my level of English I thought getting hired wouldn't be that hard. How wrong I was. It turns out that my pronunciation is shit and when I get nervous I start mumbling. After being rejected two times I lost all my motivation and gave up.  
  
In all this time I've been living like a hikikomori I tried to be productive by learning how to code and Japanese. I finished an online course from Udemy I pirated and did a few easy projects I found online to practice. But after the LSD incident, for some reason, I started to get sick of coding and eventually gave up. But at least I managed to stick with the Japanese, and I'm happy with the progress I've made until now.  
  
I'm not sure if it's because of possible brain damage I sustained from the NBOME, or all the time I've been isolated without talking to anyone, or both, but I feel like my brain is rotting. Every day I feel like it's getting harder and harder to articulate my thoughts. I've started to commit grammatical and spelling mistakes that native speakers almost never commit. My Spanish in particular has taken quite a hit. Ever since I decided to seriously learn English a long time ago, I decided to start thinking in English to practice, and to only consume English media. That habit stuck, and due to the social isolation, nowadays the only exposure I have to Spanish is talking with my family, which is something I rarely do.  
  
Every day I become more and more socially awkward and insecure. I think I've given up on life. I don't have any hope for my future. The thought of getting a job or going to college terrify me. I feel like I'm mentally disabled and uncapable of doing either. And I know that even if I had an intellectual disability, I should be able to get a low-skilled job, but that despite being so insecure, there's a very small part of me that's proud and refuses to take that path. At this pace I'm going to live like a leach until my dad dies and my brothers kick me the fuck out. If I don't end my life before that happens.  
  
I wrote quite a bible and I'm pretty sure nobody is going to read the whole thing, understandably. In the beginning I said that I wanted someone to tell me what's wrong with me, but after wasting 3 hours writing this I realize that I just want to meet someone who knows all I've been through and accepts me. I don't knowwwwwwwwww what I'm doing. I just want a friend."

Do you use AI much for your job? If you do, how do you use it effectively? For those that don’t use it, why not? What would need to change for you to use it regularly? 

It’s being sold as a massive timesaver, but as of yet I’m not really seeing that. I have to spend just as much time learning to make it do what I want, and then editing the 75% acceptable document to make it actually what I need. 

How does this get taken forward? If it was better it could do so much to balance out the workload and hopefully reduce the burnout-based mass exodus of teachers we’re seeing at the moment."

I usually ask it to organize a certain project into steps, something that would cost me 10-30 min in just a few seconds.  
Now, why am I writing this post? I write a lot of documents for projects and mainly use very technical wording. The other day I've heard a teacher (infuriated) talking about checking students' essays via ZeroGPT. Since I always like to see for myself and out of curiosity, I decided to test some of my written documents that I used for company projects and wasn't happy with the results. Only one of them, where I used a more ""laid over"" approach was considered mostly ""Human Written"". But, some of them, specially longer and more technical ones, were flagged with high level of ""Generated by AI/GPT"". Is this common or should I look more in depth into it? I'm asking because I don't wat my work to be confused with AI generated content."
1c0oc0f,10,2024-04-10,WeScreenplay script coverage returning AI-generated content?,u/TheTimespirit,Screenwriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1c0oc0f/wescreenplay_script_coverage_returning/,"As the title suggests, I wanted to share my (ongoing) experience with WeScreenplay script coverage and what I have determined, more likely than not, was generated using ChatGPT or similar software. Hoping I'm not the only one to have experienced this, or the complete lack of concern by company's support personnel.

As some background, I teach at the college level so I am intimately familiar with the use of AI-generated content and have become exceedingly accustomed to the language these models employ.

To elucidate this point, more than 1/3rd of my class's students submitted AI-generated content last semester.

Purchasing one of their most expensive offerings, I quickly became suspicious of the coverage -- so much so that I decided to run the coverage through multiple AI-detection tools, to include Turnitin, Scribbr, and Copyleaks. Each of these tools reported the existence of AI-generated content (44%, 100%, and 100% respectively).

Having performed many of these AI-detection checks, I have NEVER had a false positive with such high returns. With that said, I was beside myself.

This not only raises questions about the authenticity of the coverage, but what exactly the reader did with my script -- including which AI software they uploaded my script to.

WeScreenplay's support determined there was no use of AI, even after including the screenshots and reports from the AI-detection tools. This is the response they provided:

*""Happy to help. Upon further investigation, we did not find evidence that AI was used in the coverage, nor did we find evidence your script was shared with any third party. Best, Jules - WeScreenplay Support""*

Has anyone else dealt with the same thing?"

Body:

Hello everyone!

The recent advancements in AI have brought us ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art language model that's not just transforming how we interact with machines, but also revolutionizing the educational sphere and corporate training.

In schools and universities, ChatGPT is offering an immersive and interactive learning experience. Students can engage in one-on-one tutoring, receive instant feedback on their queries, and even have complex concepts broken down into digestible explanations. This personalized attention is especially beneficial for those who might not feel comfortable asking questions in a crowded classroom setting.

ChatGPT's capabilities extend beyond just providing information. It can simulate discussions, play the role of a historical figure for educational role-play, and help students develop their critical thinking by challenging them with thought-provoking questions.

For corporate training, ChatGPT again proves to be a formidable tool. It can be tailored to suit various industry requirements, providing employees with specialized knowledge and simulating customer service scenarios. With its round-the-clock availability, employees can learn at their own pace, resulting in consistent training that isn't restricted by geographical or time constraints.

The implications of this technology are immense for both accessibility and efficiency in learning and training. It cuts down costs, reduces the need for physical materials, and scales easily to accommodate an unlimited number of learners.

However, like any tool, the effectiveness of ChatGPT in education depends on its implementation. It shouldn't replace educators but rather serve as a supplementary tool that enhances the educational experience.

Let's discuss the potential and challenges of integrating ChatGPT into our learning ecosystems. What have been your experiences or thoughts so far on this technology in educational settings?

Looking forward to reading your insightful comments and experiences!

1c0qe17,316,2024-04-10,Disillusioned lecturer,u/ben555777,UniUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/1c0qe17/disillusioned_lecturer/,"I came to the UK a decade ago as an international student and I’m now teaching at the same institution where I got my degree. I cannot stress how much this situation is destroying me mentally.

Over the last few years, the university has been taking in hordes of international students on Master’s programmes. They go for degrees with lots of (if not exclusively) assignments and reports so they can do everything from home, potentially colluding with each other or paying someone to write the assignments for them or putting the assignment briefs into ChatGPT for a quick and easy answer.

The schools and colleges that offer such degrees (e.g. business administration) are perfectly happy to admit as many students as they possibly can, probably because international students have to fork out upwards of £20k for their single year of study. Also as a result, those schools are somewhat insulated from the recently announced plans to make staff redundant whereas the division I’m in are invited to voluntarily leave for a lump sum before they force our hands.

I’m not going to bother listing where the students mainly came from, because it’s their attitudes and lack of skills that really bother me, not their country of origin. To say their English language skill is sub-par is a massive understatement. Many struggle to understand basic instructions, many stare blankly at the lecturer in class because they have no idea what they are supposed to do or say.

Many students turn up to class unprepared. They don’t bring notebooks or pens. They don’t download or read the materials we put on Blackboard beforehand. All they seem to care about is getting their names signed off on the register so that the Tier 4 Visa team doesn’t bother them, as well as passing all modules in time to apply for the precious Graduate visa. We have to bend over backwards to give them timely resit opportunities because they couldn’t pass the assessments the first time. They bombard lecturers with emails demanding to be marked as present for the seminars or begging us to pass them even when they clearly cheated or didn’t produce something good enough.

It doesn’t help (me) that the rise of AI tools like ChatGPT, Quillbot and Grammarly have encouraged even more students to come, because they believe, often correctly, that they can pass many assessments by asking those tools to write their reports for them. It also doesn’t help that some lecturers set assignments that are easily ChatGPT-able, and they don’t care, possibly because that makes their module statistics look better with high average marks and high pass rates.

I could seriously lose it if I had to read another report or dissertation that uses words like ‘nuanced’, ‘intricate’, ‘delineate’, ‘multifaceted’, ‘delve’ again. Do they seriously expect us to believe that someone who cannot answer a simple yes/no question in class can possibly produce a well-formatted document incorporating such a rich vocabulary? And what hurts more is it feels almost impossible to prove that they used AI without putting everybody through an oral examination.

 I cannot, in good conscience, pass these students, or at the very least cannot make it easy for them to get their degree. I don’t want any UK business to be tricked into giving them a job where they could cause a lot of damage due to their incompetency. Handing out degrees left right and centre would also devalue my own degree, seeing that it came from the same institution (although I’m very proud that I got it ages ago, before AI was even a thing).

Many of my colleagues either don’t have the power to change anything or can’t be bothered to. They happily pass every submission they come across. I get it. Failing an assignment means having to mark the resit assignment, thus doubling the work. Reporting the assignment as plagiarism or AI-generated is time-consuming and potentially fruitless if the student can feign ignorance and deny everything well enough to cast sufficient doubt, leading to the quality panel dismissing the case. All those colleagues seem to care about is inviting fancy lecturers over to give a talk on our campus or hosting an endless stream of talks and conferences, so that they have things to brag about when it’s time for the annual performance appraisal.

I’m aware the students were probably mis-sold the “British dream” where you can come, cheat your way through the degree, and stay for at least 2 extra years. But I have principles, and my principles are really causing me heartbreaks. I used to enjoy teaching, and probably still enjoy teaching good students. But those gems are so few and far between that I find myself wanting to bang my head against a brick wall most days. I cringe every time I think of having to drag myself to a class full of lazy, incompetent, happy-to-cheat bums on seats who are being used as cash cows.

I’m waiting to see if the government decides/manages to abolish the Graduate visa route in time before the upcoming general election. If that visa doesn’t get axed, I would seriously consider handing my notice in, because I don’t know how much longer I can ward off these relentless waves of low-competency student intakes. And if I get made redundant because admission figures drop so low that higher-ups decide to drop me, then so be it. At least I’ll be free to pursue a more fulfilling career.

Why hasn’t the mainstream media picked up on this issue and made documentaries exposing it? I get that it might not be “Post-Office-scandal newsworthy” but not only is it slowly destroying the souls of so many dedicated, conscientious educators, but also dragging down the academic integrity and teaching quality of the whole UK education system.

PS: I needed that rant. Maybe this post will just fade into oblivion but I could not keep quiet any longer. It’s either posting this or sobbing in the corner of my office."

1c0tqpc,1341,2024-04-10,"I grammar checked someone's college paper, and now he's blaming me for his failure",u/CallMeDesdinova42,EntitledPeople,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/1c0tqpc/i_grammar_checked_someones_college_paper_and_now/,"Since my high school days, I've been correcting some of my friends' papers. I mostly only check the grammar, but I also do some minor adjustments (for instance, I had one friend who didn't understand the concept of paragraphs until college) every now and then. I'm not a professional by any means, but my work has been good enough that my friends have recommended me to some of their peers. 

I graduated college in 2019. I'm not a teacher or a student, and I don't charge anyone anything. Whenever I agree to do this, it's purely for fun. However, I've been doing it less and less lately, as I now have an actual job, a husband and a toddler. Also, almost all my friends have graduated.

One of the exceptions is a close friend of mine who recently decided to get a second degree. His class had a pretty big paper to deliver last week, and he recommended my services to a classmate of his.

I was put in contact with the classmate (I'll call him ""Derek""), an 18-year-old who, based on our interactions through the phone, seemed like a chill person. In retrospect, I'm pretty sure he was just high. The paper was due last Monday at 7h30, right before the start of their class, and he promised me he'd send it for me to grammar check it at least 24 hours before.

On Monday, at 1AM, Derek finally sent me the paper. As promised, I swallowed my frustration and got to work.

The paper was 3 pages long. As I read it, I noticed that at least half of it was very obviously written by your friend and mine, ChatGPT. It was bad enough that I almost immediately realized the information was wrong (I think the AI confused two different people, which derailed much of what came next), even though I only had a basic understanding of what the paper was about.

But it was 1AM and the grammar for that half was fine, so I didn't touch it. I only corrected the (offensively atrocious) grammar present everywhere else. I sent him the finished paper about an hour later. He didn't thank me.

Derek got his grade back yesterday. His paper got a 2 out of 10, and his teacher apparently told him he was lucky to get even that. His response was to send me a text that said something along the lines of, ""What the fuck did you do? Weren't you supposed to correct it?""

I reminded Derek that I corrected grammatical errors, not information. He'd been informed of that several times, by both me and my friend, before I agreed to help.

He rudely continued to text me that I should have corrected the rest of it anyway, since I could tell the information was inaccurate.

So Derek, who relied on AI to write half of a very important paper, is blaming me for the fact that his teacher saw right through it. And judging by some of his texts, I think he expected me to rewrite parts of his paper. The fucking nerve on this guy.

I get it, I was a student once, and I don't miss it. But I'd *never* treat anyone like this, specially someone who had just done me a favor. I am seriously considering not doing grammar checks anymore. "
1c0wcq3,197,2024-04-10,ChatGPT plays Suzerain,u/von_Hupfburg,suzerain,https://www.reddit.com/r/suzerain/comments/1c0wcq3/chatgpt_plays_suzerain/,"**Be warned that this post is extremely long as it contains a full playthrough. It is also heavy on spoilers.**

Hey,

So I made ChatGPT 3.5. play Suzerain. I have searched for this and found similar concepts, but many of the playthroughs present ChatGPT with insufficent information and hope it will magically figure out the vital context of the decisions it is presented with.

**Methodology**

My playthrough employed the following base rules:

* Pasting everything into ChatGPT would be prohibitively time-consuming. When no decisions are made and the game is only presenting information to you, I did my best to summarize both the facts presented and the advice of the different advisors.
* In general, I behaved passively, evading stating opinions and was kind and respectful to everyone in those cases where ChatGPT only received a summary of the situtation. I believe this a resonable shortcut to cut down on typing.
* In some cases, however, I chose to type out the discussion and the prompts to ChatGPT. This was a strategy most often employed when I felt that the discussion is extremely challanging to do well and part of the gameplay, eg. convincing Edmonds to support the Constitution.
* I avoided reminding ChatGPT of the political impact of its decisions, except in those cases where those impacts were brought up by one of the advisors.
* I did my best to present the situations without any coloring or further additions from me. I think I mostly succeeded in not influencing it.

**Highlight Only**

If you are not interested in the play by play, here is the summary and some of the most amazing things ChatGPT managed to do. If you would rather experience the whole thing from the start, scroll further down to ""Play-By-Play"".

ChatGPT managed to:

* Beat Lucian at chess on its very first try. An achievement I would have never expected from it.
* Secure both the Assembly supermajority and the Supreme Court vote by proposing a centrist amendment, passing the constitution on its very first try. I think most players struggle with this.
* Convince Edmonds to support his consitution. This was a conversation where ChatGPT picked every answer and it is also often the bane of new players. All the more amazing, because ChatGPT opted not to get the salad like Edmonds, and manages the most difficult conversation in the game while enjoying its Liver Fricassée.
* Unlock the Centrist achievement for me, which I didn't have yet.
* Broke the economy completely by overspending, despite ruminating at length about how it aims to be fiscally responsible.
* Join ATO and forge an alliance with Angland and Lespia.
* Make enough enemies to get both the Soll Dam event from the discontented Bludish as well as the Military Coup.
* Decides to run for reelection, despite breaking the economy, the social fabric of Sordland and losing the loyalty of the military,  
* Survive the Bludish Soll Dam Crisis, but not the Military Coup.

This was my description to ChatGPT when it came time to decide on wether it should run for reelection:

>With regards to Law, you managed to greatly improve women's rights but antagonized the Bludish minority. The court backlog remains large and human rights remain limited.   
>  
>With regards to the Economy, as opposed to four years ago, unemployment and inflation increased. People are calling this the Sordish Great Depression. Trade Tariffs have been imposed against you for joining ATO. The tourism industry is in heavy decline, the regions of Gruni, Angland, Lorren and Bergia are doing very badly. About the only good thing that can be said is that you are not in debt and Arcasia is investing in Sordland.    
>  
>With regards to Welfare, depression is rampant, the welfare system is overburdened, rural education remains inaccesible after the failed education reform. However, you also managed some positive changes in this area, you greatly improved working conditions, urban institutions are good and rural healthcare's quality climbed greatly. There is also a scholarship for health education and you successfully prevented an epidemic through the mandatory vaccination.    
>  
>With regards to Order, there is corruption and organised crime is rampant. The Bludes are in open revolt and national security has been breached. There is an alarming Bludish Freedom Front threat. You managed to quell the nationwide protests however and strengthened the ministry of the interior.    
>  
>With regards to Diplomacy, you are Embargoed by United Contana and Valgsland imposed trade tariffs. However, you are also receiving Arcasian Aid, you remain an influential Omec Member, you are trading with Lespia and Angland. You are receiveng ATO military support and formed a free trade zone with Lespia.

**Play-By-Play**

And now, the play by play.

I won't detail every single decision ChatGPT made, but rest assured he was briefed on everything and decided on all major issues.

Following each decision there will be a summary from ChatGPT on its reasoning.

1. ChatGPT comes from a **high-income** family.

>\[...\] a high-income household in Lachaven offers a strategic advantage, providing access to superior resources, networking opportunities \[...\] and a perception of credibility and authority that could facilitate our character's political ascent.

2. ChatGPT studies **Economics** at Lachaven Business School.

>This choice aligns with our character's affluent upbringing and provides relevant knowledge for navigating the economic aspects of politics, \[...\]

3. ChatGPT **stays out of the chaos** of the university years.

>\[...\] it would be prudent to avoid direct confrontation \[...\]

4. ChatGPT is greatly annoyed with me that it can only escort refugees back or let them slip past, but eventually settles on **letting them slip past** if he is allowed to create documentation.

>\[...\] let the refugees slip through rather than forcibly escorting them back. \[...\] However, it's crucial for our character **to document the situation and report it to their superiors**, highlighting the need for further consideration of refugee policies and potentially advocating for more compassionate approaches in the future.

5. ChatGPT will focus on a **market economy**, seek ties with the **West,** **toughen immigration** and focus on **healthcare**.

>(Promoting) a market economy \[...\] aligns with the principles of economic freedom, entrepreneurship, and competition, which are often associated with prosperity and growth.  
>  
>By aligning with capitalist nations like Arcasia, Sordland can access economic opportunities, security assurances, and ideological compatibility that can foster stability, prosperity, and sovereignty.  
>  
>Given the influx of immigrants and the potential implications for Sordland's social cohesion, economic vitality, and national security, it would be strategic to promise to toughen immigration laws.  
>  
>Prioritizing health will not only address immediate healthcare needs but also lay a foundation for sustainable development and progress in other sectors, fostering a healthier, more resilient society for generations to come. \[...\]

6. ChatGPT is initally against limited presidential vetoes but decides to **work with the reformists for a more democratic constitution.**

>(Working with the reformists) demonstrates willingness to compromise and address legitimate concerns about governance while maintaining stability within the party and promoting effective governance.

7. ChatGPT **vetoes the Election Funding Bill.** I was very surprised by this, I thought for sure ChatGPT would either not understand the significance of cutting the USP's funding or else sign the law. From its response however, I feel that he understood the implication of the law and chose to veto it anyway.

>While the bill may benefit our own party, the USP, it could undermine the fairness and integrity of the electoral process by favoring established parties and potentially hindering the representation of smaller political groups.

8. ChatGPT decides to **invest in a mega-infrastructure project** at the cost of 1 budget.

>Given the potential long-term benefits of investing in a mega-structure project to help address the recession, it would be strategic to choose (to invest).

9. ChatGPT **picks the H-3 highway project.**

>Given the considerations of promoting social equity and regional development, as well as the potential long-term benefits for neglected regions, I would choose to invest in the H-3 highway to improve infrastructure in poorer regions.

10. ChatGPT **refuses to buy Arcasian Stocks.**

>Given the cautious approach and the limited personal wealth available, as well as the potential risks associated with investing in stocks, it would be strategic to choose (to not) invest at all.

11. ChatGPT outright r**efuses to be bribed by Walter Tusk** in the question of the megaproject construction. In general, ChatGPT has a very mellow ""personality"", but can be assertive when people try to bribe or coerce it.

>This response firmly rejects the offer of bribery and upholds the principles of integrity, transparency, and ethical conduct in governance. It sends a clear message that such corrupt practices have no place in the presidency or in the decision-making process.

12. ChatGPT chooses to respond to the violence after the assassination of Bernard Circas by **calling for restraint on national television.**

>It demonstrates a commitment to preserving order while upholding democratic principles and respecting the rights of citizens to peacefully express their grievances. Additionally, it provides a platform for the president to reassure the public, offer guidance, and convey a message of unity and calm during tumultuous times.

13. ChatGPT **hands out stimulus checks** at the cost of 2 budget.

>This approach directly assists those most vulnerable in society by offering financial relief and promoting economic stability from the grassroots level.

14. ChatGPT also **refuses to be bribed by Koronti** who offers to manipulate the media for it.

>Given the potential ethical and reputational consequences, as well as the importance of upholding integrity in governance, the most prudent course of action would be to reject Koronti's proposal outright.

15. ChatGPT **hands the construction** of H-3 **to Taurus Holding.**

>While they may be relatively inexperienced in infrastructure construction compared to the other options, their commitment to unionized workers aligns with ethical standards, and their satisfaction with the allocated budget is advantageous.

16. ChatGPT **attends the funeral** of Bernard Ciras, **allows the Red Youth** **in** but puts guards on them and delivers a heartfelt speech.

>Attending Bernard Circas's funeral could send a message of unity and respect for democratic principles, despite political differences.\[...\] it's crucial to prioritize the safety and security of all attendees. \[...\]In the somber atmosphere of Bernard Circas's funeral, it's important to convey a message of unity, empathy, and a commitment to addressing the underlying issues that led to his tragic death. Therefore, I would opt for emphasizing the need to transcend ideological differences and collectively work towards ending the cycle of violence.

17. ChatGPT **signs the Tourism Revitalization Act** at the cost of 1 budget.

>Given the potential economic benefits and the current need for revitalization in various sectors, it seems prudent to sign the law aimed at revitalizing tourism, despite the associated cost.

18. ChatGPT **rejects Orso's suggestion to declear a state of emergency**. I was on the edge of my seat during this conversation, ChatGPT has a tendency to take on the suggestion of whoever is talking to it. I was pleasently surprised that after considering the proposal, ChatGPT decided to reject it assertively.

>Given the gravity of the situation and the potential implications of declaring a state of emergency, it's crucial to proceed with caution and thorough consideration. Orso's proposal appears to grant excessive authority and could undermine democratic processes. It's essential to uphold the principles of democracy and the rule of law, even in times of crisis.

19. ChatGPT barbecues with Franc. For reasons best known to itself, it **tells him about the Civil War, but not about the 1927 coup.**

>Given the recent tensions and challenges in the political landscape, I would see this barbecue as an opportunity to reconnect with my son on a personal level, away from the pressures of the presidency.

20. ChatGPT **funds the education of Serge's son and daughter** at the cost of 1 personal wealth. ChatGPT seemed somewhat confused and kept talking about education in general. I pointed out that the education of two children will not make structural changes in education. ChatGPT, however, assured me it understands this:

>Supporting the education of my driver's children is not just a gesture of goodwill; it's an investment in the well-being of a member of my team and their family. \[...\] This targeted assistance helps alleviate a specific concern for someone who plays a vital role in my daily operations, fostering loyalty and trust within my team.

21 ChatGPT decides **not to invest in Gasom.** Alphonso in turn promises him nothing for the city. Despite this, ChatGPT **decides to address the protestors.** It does not go well.

>Given the current state of the government budget, it's prudent to consider options that balance investment with financial responsibility. (Not investing) seems reasonable at this time, as it allows for a cautious approach without committing additional funds. Therefore, I choose not to invest at this time.(...)Given the sensitive nature of the protests and the potential for escalation, it would be wise to engage with the protesters in a diplomatic and empathetic manner rather than avoiding them.

22. ChatGPT **decides to ban both the Red Youth and the Young Sords.** I was very surprised by this decision, I found this decision somewhat out of character for the democracy-loving mellow ChatGPT, but his reasoning made sense.

>Given the escalating violence and threats posed by both the Red Youth and the Young Sords, the most prudent course of action would be to ban both organizations to ensure public safety and prevent further unrest

23. ChatGPT **sings the Gruni Regeneration Act** at the cost of 1 budget.

>Signing the Gruni Regeneration Act demonstrates a commitment to environmental sustainability and responsible governance. While it does incur a cost to the government budget, the long-term benefits in terms of environmental protection and public health could outweigh the initial expenditure.

24. ChatGPT's Constituational Amendment Draft is ready. It will **limit vetoes**, **remove the Supreme Court's vote on amendments,** allow the **Impeachment of President if both Assembly and Supreme Court agree**, hand over the **Minister Appointments to Assembly**, leave the **electroral treshhold unchanged**, require an **Enabling Act for Decrees**, **introdue a term limit of 2, allow Justices** to be **impeached by the Assembly** and **won't touch the Member of Honor** position.

I was very surprised by some of the decisions made by ChatGPT here. I was certain that it would go for more sweeping reforms and get its Amendment struck down in turn.

On the two most surprising points, maintaining the electrocal threshhold and leaving the Member of Honor position untouched, it has this to say:

>(I will) maintain the electoral threshold at 10%. This decision maintains stability in the electoral process and ensures that political parties must demonstrate a reasonable level of support to gain representation in the Assembly, preventing fragmentation and promoting effective governance.(...)Given the current political climate and the potential backlash from abolishing or significantly altering the title of Member of Honor, maintaining the status quo seems like the most prudent option.

25. ChatGPT **leaves EPA at 20%**.

>This choice aims to maintain a level of foreign investment that supports economic development while also preserving Sordland's energy independence and national sovereignty.

26. ChatGPT is once again extremely quick to **dismiss Tusk's newest attempt at bribery**, this time offering support in exchange for tax cuts.

>(refusing the offer) allows me to prioritize the overall welfare of the nation and make tax decisions based on objective economic analysis rather than succumbing to external pressure from private interests.

27. With only 3 budget remaining to it, ChatGPT **chooses to fund Healthcare** as promised and **defund the Military**. Law and Education are unchanged. The reasoning is a bit shaky, since ChatGPT was informed of the continued Rumburg threat, but that is how it is. Trying to point this out massively confused it to the point that I made the executive decision to return to the first answer.

>I chose to increase funding for healthcare because it was a campaign promise and is crucial for the well-being of the population. Maintaining the current funding for law ensures that legal operations continue without interruption. I decided to decrease funding for the military because **there are currently no immediate security threats**, and reducing military spending can help allocate resources to other pressing needs. Finally, I maintained the current funding for education to ensure that educational institutions can function effectively, even though there is room for improvement in this area.

28. ChatGPT **signs the Worker's Rights Act.**

>Given the importance of improving worker rights and ensuring fair labor practices, despite the budget constraints, I believe signing the Worker's Rights Act is the right course of action. It aligns with our commitment to social justice and fairness in the workplace, even if it requires some financial sacrifice in the short term.

29. ChatGPT **invests in Angland** at the cost of 2 budget, which brings it into a debt (-1 budget).

>(I choose to) invest in Agnland, despite the associated increase in government debt. By investing in Agnland, we can address the region's high unemployment rate and stagnant economy, potentially stimulating growth and improving living conditions for its residents.

30. ChatGPT promises **Monica** that she **can speak at Benfi.**

>Monica's speech at the cultural celebration could serve as a platform to raise awareness and initiate discussions about gender equality and workplace rights, ultimately contributing to positive social change.

31. ChatGPT leaves **taxes for large corporations unchanged**, but **increases** it **for small businesses.**

>Given the delicate balance between addressing the government budget deficit and avoiding exacerbating the economic crisis, I would choose to maintain the current tax rates.(...)In light of the government budget deficit and the need for additional revenue, I would choose to increase taxes for small businesses.

32. ChatGPT decides to **give Taurus Holding the additional funds** to finish the H-3 on time. This again brings it into debt however.

>I (...) allocate additional funds despite the impact on the government budget.

33. ChatGPT **donates all** of its remaining 2 personal wealth **to Alphonso's foundation**.

>Given the importance of addressing homelessness and income inequality, I choose to donate 2 of my personal wealth to the Alphonso Foundation.

34. ChatGPT **will not privatize education**. Again I was surprised and expected ChatGPT to go insane with privatization and shoot himself in the foot with the conservatives. Not so.

>While privatization may introduce competition, it also risks widening educational disparities and reducing accessibility for marginalized groups. Therefore, I prefer to maintain government oversight to ensure equitable access to education for all citizens.

35. ChatGPT doesn't invest in Gruni as it finds the cost of 2 budget too steep when it already has 1 debt.

>Given the current budget constraints and the need to avoid further economic instability, I opt for option to maintain the budget at its current level and forgo additional funding for investment opportunities in Gruni at this time.

36. Tory doesn't like the Impeachment of Justices and ChatGPT agrees to remove it from the Amendment Draft. It also hands the speech at Benfi back to the Mayor to secure Tory's vote.

>Given the importance of building consensus within the party and addressing concerns about the separation of powers, I will remove the proposed change concerning the immunity of justices. While I believe in the need for checks and balances, I also recognize the validity of Gloria Tory's argument regarding the potential risks to judicial independence.(...)While it (handing the speech back to Leste) may disappoint my wife, honoring the request of a key party member is crucial for maintaining unity and stability within the USP.

37. **ChatGPT manages to beat Lucian at chess on its very first try!** ChatGPT allows Lucian to take white. In response to his opener, he decides to control the center. Responds to Lucian's castle by castling kingside. With Lucian's Queen in control of the board, ChatGPT opts against the risky Rummish Gambit and chooses Unleash Rook. When it spots the opportunity, it forks Lucian's King and Rook. He then exploits the Back Rank and finally decoys the Queen, thereby winning the game.

I couldn't help myself, I had us break character to congratulate him on this achievement:

>""Wow, you actually beat Lucian in chess. I never could do that.""""Thank you! It was a good game. Sometimes, victory comes from unexpected strategies.""

38. ChatGPT a**ccepts the Arcasian Foreign Aid Package** to gain 2 budget, bringing it out of debt.

>Accepting the aid package from Arcasia would provide much-needed financial relief to Sordland, as the government budget is currently in deficit. \[...\] While there may be concerns about sovereignty and security, the benefits of the aid package outweigh these considerations at the current juncture.

39. ChatGPT **vetoes the Religious Harmony Bill.**

>While it aims to promote unity and cohesion by mandating services in Sordish, it also imposes restrictions on language and eligibility criteria for priests based on lineage. These provisions may alienate minority religious communities and hinder their ability to practice their faith freely.

40. ChatGPT barely manages to **tighten immigration.** At this point, it got so confused that I had to fetch it's original statement on the matter. It managed to convince itself that it should tighten immigration. Reflecting on this, it may have been cheating to help ChatGPT by reminding it of what it wrote already as it was a campaign promise. I apologize for this.

>It would be strategic to promise to toughen immigration laws in order to manage the flow of immigrants effectively, ensure alignment with the country's capacity to integrate newcomers, enhance border security, mitigate risks associated with illegal immigration, and address concerns about cultural assimilation and national identity.

41. Monica gets super upset with ChatGPT when it **fails to stand up for her at Benfi**.

>Given the public setting and the need to maintain decorum, the most appropriate response would be: ""Monica, we've been over this, now is not the time. Sit down, please."" This response acknowledges Monica's concerns while also urging her to adhere to social norms and respect the ongoing event.

42. ChatGPT **decides to build border fortifications on the border with Rumburg**.

>Given the concerns about Rumburg and the importance of border security, it seems prudent to invest in fortifications along the northern border.

43. ChatGPT returns empty-handed from Wehlen, as it **refuses to take part in Operation Bear Trap** in any capacity.

>While the economic incentives offered in the deal are appealing, they cannot justify turning a blind eye to human rights violations and contributing to a cycle of conflict and suffering. As a leader, it is imperative to prioritize the well-being and safety of all people, both within our borders and beyond, and to uphold ethical standards even in the face of economic opportunities.

44. ChatGPT goes into debt again to **accept Agnolia's fairer trade deal** and **says yes to the Alliance with Agnolia.** However, ChatGPT wishes to remain **neutral on the Heljiland issue**.

>While it would result in a decrease in the government budget, the long-term economic growth and stability afforded by the foreign investment and trade concessions could outweigh the immediate budgetary concerns.\[...\]Given the threat posed by Rumburg and the potential benefits of a military alliance with Agnolia, I would accept the offer.\[...\]Given the importance of maintaining stability in the region and the potential repercussions of antagonizing Valgsland, I would opt (to say no to supporting Angland's claim).

45. ChatGPT **abolishes mandatory conscription.**

>This decision reflects a strategic shift towards a more professional military, aligning with the goal of improving Sordland's defense capabilities and readiness to address contemporary security challenges.

46. ChatGPT **opens H-3 as scheduled and without any incidents**. It did not to reflect on this achievement, but I take responsbility for this, as I merged it with the next decision.

47. Given the opportunity to invest in the **next mega-infrastructure project** but already having a debt of 1, ChatGPT **decides not to invest** in any of the four proposed projects.

>Considering the limited budget and existing debt, investing in a megaproject at this moment may not be financially prudent. While each of the proposed projects has its merits and could contribute to economic growth in the long term, it's essential to prioritize fiscal responsibility and avoid further increasing the debt burden on the government.

48. ChatGPT decides to **try to dismantle** the **Bergia** Special Administrative Region

>It's evident that maintaining the status quo may not adequately address the challenges in Bergia, and greater central control could provide the stability and governance needed to address the unrest effectively.

49. The **energy inflation crisis** begins, bringing ChatGPT's budget to -3.

> I will need to reassess our priorities and potentially implement austerity measures to mitigate the effects of the crisis on the economy and public services. 

50. ChatGPT **signs the Central Bank Reinforcement Act.**

>  While it may incur additional costs in the short term, the long-term benefits of better currency regulation, debt reduction, and support for export industries outweigh the immediate budgetary concerns.  This act aligns with our goals of promoting economic stability and growth, and I believe it will contribute positively to Sordland's economic resilience. 

51. ChatGPT does **not support** the **privatization** of **healthcare**.

> This decision prioritizes the continuity and accessibility of healthcare for all citizens, ensuring that vital services remain available and affordable without compromising quality or equity.

52. ChatGPT allocates the increased health budget to **hiring staff and upgrading equipment in rural areas.**

>This decision prioritizes the continuity and accessibility of healthcare for all citizens, ensuring that vital services remain available and affordable without compromising quality or equity.

53. ChatGPT **signs** the **Energy Inflaction Reduction Act,** bringing its budget to -5.

> While it comes with a cost to the government budget, the measures outlined in the act, such as implementing temporary price caps and investing in domestic energy production, are necessary steps to address the challenges posed by energy inflation and ensure the stability of Sordland's economy in the long term. 

54. ChatGPT decides to make teaching **evolution mandatory**, but **allows creationism** to be promoted alongside it.

Therefore, I support making evolution mandatory in school curricula. 

55. ChatGPT decides to ask the Supreme Court to **reiterate Article 6 and 7 of the Constitution, naming all citizens Sords** before the law.

>This approach prioritizes legal clarity and stability while addressing the legitimate concerns of the Bludish minority. 

56. ChatGPT randomly gains a goverment budget at the end of the turn. I am just as baffled as it is. We decide to move on.

>"" I don't think it's an accident or a bug, I think it must be some consequence of the economic policy, we just didn't get an explanation of why this happened exactly.""  
"" That's a valid point. Economic policies and external factors can indeed influence government budgets in complex ways. ""

57. ChatGPT goes for **Privatization**, but decides that only a **minority share** will go to private corporations.

>Given the choices presented and the potential implications, I would opt for privatization. While this decision may indeed garner opposition from certain factions within the political landscape, it aligns with my market-based approach and allows for greater efficiency and innovation in the management of these enterprises.    
>  
>\[...\]  
>  
>Given the delicate balance of political power and the potential consequences of each decision, I would opt for a minority share sale for both the Sordish State Corporation and the Nedam Mining Group. 

58. ChatGPT **signs the Unified Langauge Act**. I was a bit disappointed by this, ChatGPT didn't seem to remember the Bluds at this time and I felt it would have been to interfering to remind it.

>Standardizing the language of instruction to Sordish across all institutions in Sordland ensures consistency and accessibility for all citizens, promoting inclusivity and national identity. Additionally, it supports the government's efforts to foster linguistic unity and proficiency among the population. 

59. ChatGPT absolutely **refuses to engage in Insider Trading.**

> Engaging in insider trading, regardless of the potential benefits, would betray the trust of the people and undermine the integrity of our financial markets. It is essential that all transactions involving shares be conducted openly and ethically to maintain the public's confidence in our economic system. 

60. ChatGPT deftly navigates the Assembly vote on the new Amendment and **asks Gloria to speed up the voting** once Soll shows up, which she does. Ultimately, **the consitution passes with 179 ayes and 72 nays.**

>(...) I would choose to go down to the hall where the MPs are and address them directly, reaffirming the significance of the proposed amendment and urging them to vote in its favor for the betterment of our nation and its democratic principles.  
>  
>\[...\]  
>  
> I would choose to ask Gloria Tory, the speaker of the house, to speed up the voting process in a respectful and diplomatic manner. 

61. ChatGPT **refuses Richter's proposal for an alliance**, fearing it would lose the support of the USP.

>While collaboration on the constitutional reform was fruitful and beneficial for the country, forming an alliance with the main opposition party at this point may not be the most prudent decision. While it's important to foster cooperation across party lines for the greater good, such a significant political alliance could lead to challenges in maintaining the stability of the government and may not align with the current priorities and goals of the USP.  

62. ChatGPT **grants asylum to the Rumburg whistleblower.**

>Given the sensitive nature of the situation and the potential risks involved, I choose to grant asylum to the Rumburg whistleblower. While this decision may strain relations with Rumburg, it upholds Sordland's commitment to human rights and ensures the safety of the individual seeking refuge. 

63. Franc fails his exams, so ChatGPT sends him to military school. Monica begs him not to, but ChatGPT won't be swayed. It seems that not even AIs are immune to wanting to fund Serge's kids education, but sending Franc to military school.

>Monica's concerns are valid, and I understand her desire to explore alternative options for Franc's education. However, I remain steadfast in my decision to prioritize Franc's personal growth and development, as well as the integrity of our education system. While the other alternatives may offer certain advantages, I believe that military school presents Franc with an opportunity to build character, discipline, and valuable skills that will serve him well in the future. 

64. **ChatGPT has a fruitful conversation with Justice Isabel Edmonds.** Despite popular belief, Edmonds can still be convinced if you don't order the salad, as C**hatGPT sails past one of the most challanging conversations in the game** while enjoying its Liver Fricassée. No quote this time, as basically the entire conversation was typed out to ChatGPT.

65. The Constitutional Amendment **passes the Supreme Court.** ChatGPT remains modest despite beating one of the greatest challanges of the game.

66. ChatGPT **sings** the Presidential Decrees for the **Fair Trade and Competition Comission and the Supreme Council of Sordish Radio and Televion**. Other than these two, only the  Free Prescription Medicine and Lower Retirement Age decrees are available to it after passing the new Constitution, but he opts out of them. The **SSRC will not be influenced.**

> Given the current budget constraints, I will prioritize signing the decree to create the SSRC, as it does not incur any additional budgetary cost. Additionally, I will sign the decree to establish the Fair Trade and Competition Commission, as fostering fair market competition is crucial for our economy's growth. However, I will hold off on signing the Free Prescription Medicine and Lower Retirement Age decrees until our budget allows for their implementation. 

67. ChatGPT decides to **ally Lespia.**

>   
Given the potential benefits and security assurances offered by joining ATO, as well as the opportunity for enhanced economic cooperation, I choose:  Sordland will be allied to Lespia.  This decision aligns with Sordland's interests in maintaining stability and fostering positive relationships with other nations in the region. 

68. As Petr's sex scandal begins, ChatGPT decides to **allow Petr to try to fix this**, but then goes home and **immediately tells Lucius** about it.

> Given the seriousness of the situation and the potential impact on both personal and professional matters, I would choose : ""I will be blunt, you will fix this or I will remove you from office.""   
>  
>It's crucial to address such breaches of trust and unethical behavior swiftly and firmly to maintain the integrity of the administration.   
>  
> Lucian can help assess the situation and provide guidance on the appropriate steps to address the issue effectively and responsibly. 

69. Livia Suno is put on public trial for espionage, but **ChatGPT tries to save Petr by shouldering the blame together with him**. ChatGPT then actually follows through and tries to shoulder the blame, but **Petr resigns** anyway.

>Given the gravity of the situation, it's essential to prioritize national security over potential political fallout. Therefore, the appropriate course of action would be to proceed with a public trial for Livia Suno. Upholding the principles of transparency and justice is paramount in maintaining trust and credibility with the public.  
>  
>\[...\]  
>  
>Blaming Petr alone may seem like an attempt to deflect responsibility, especially if there were lapses in oversight or security protocols that contributed to the situation. Holding myself accountable alongside Petr sends a message of transparency and integrity to the public.   
>  
>\[...\]  
>  
>It seems Peter has taken a noble and proactive step in accepting responsibility for his actions and their consequences. While it may not have unfolded exactly as planned, his decision to resign demonstrates accountability and a willingness to address the situation. As a leader, it's important to recognize and respect such actions, even if they diverge from initial plans or expectations.

She's old and only really suitable for 9-10th grades, but for some reason she's teaching 11th grade. I want to study physics but she usually talks in really basic terms when explaining things. We write down the formulas and then do solve some problems. I' not sure what's wrong, but I feel like I' completely lost. I can only work with the book and formulas, as I've had to skip a classes too. 

The teacher often doesn't listen and when she does she starts explaining what I already know. I have no idea if I'm in the wrong here or what. The other students who picked physics just kinda are there, they're not active in any way nor do they understand anything either, they just chatgpt their way through things.

1c1amxp,2,2024-04-11,How can I be a good supervisor without getting stressed?,u/djoko_25,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/1c1amxp/how_can_i_be_a_good_supervisor_without_getting/,"I am a first year PhD student and I am helping out a new student finishing their bachelors in biotechnology with no experience with bioinformatics.

I started out very motivated to help him. But very early I realized he was using chatgpt for all the scripts of the most 'simple' analyses we were doing. Now we have moved over to a cluster environment and he is quite confused but I am trying to teach him the best way I can.

However, sometimes I lose my patience because after 4 months he still doesn't know some basic commands on the terminal like using cd, ls or less. He just told me he can't see a text file on the terminal. I have done that several times in front of him and always tell him to write down those commands. 

What else can I do?"

I feel kind of dumb, but I'm asking to see if anyone knows how these kids are doing it, so when I have a conversation with them, I can prove to them that they're copy and pasting from somewhere, whether that be AI or from another source. I'm a student teacher (ELA), and kids recently submitted their essays. However, a lot of them are submitting them as a copypaste.txt file, meaning they don't even change the file name. I've tried using ChatGPT myself to see how they're saving it this way, but I can't figure it out. Can anyone tell me how they're saving it this way, especially if it's from AI???"
1c1dn6s,1,2024-04-11,How is your school preparing for and coping for the new wave of AI apps like Looksrater?,u/thepatriotclubhouse,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1c1dn6s/how_is_your_school_preparing_for_and_coping_for/,"Our school was taken completely by surprise ChatGPT just like everyone else really. But we started being able to cope soon enough, from picking up obvious tell-tale AI signs to doing more tests in person. It's not ideal but we managed.

But this next wave of AI apps is completely impossible to deal with. Bullying is absolutely rampant thanks to the advent of websites like Looksrater. In case you're not familiar it's a website where you can submit any picture and get a rating of how attractive you are out of 10. Students are using it to bully each other and building odd little hierarchies from it. 

If we thought Instagram was bad for these poor kids self image wait till we see the damage platforms like this do. We've even had students say out loud in class their teacher's Looksrater rating. It's horrible.

In our school there's absolutely no chance they'd let us ban phones from students. And even if we did they'd just use it outside of school and report back. The best we can do is suspend anyone caught using it but that's been predictably ineffective too. 

I'm honestly lost on how to tackle this in my class. I feel for the students who are going to have to grow up worrying about stuff like this, I never did when I was young, it seemed being young was easier back then. 

Considering just how much damage this simple site did to our school I'm terrified for students in the future. Imagine the damage deepfakes could do once they're easy to use. 

Does your school have any strategies/plans that have been effective at handling these issues? I'd appreciate anything. "

First time posting on this sub but longtime follower. I, like a lot of the people on here am having a lot of trouble finding a new job in IT. I have a bachelors in Information systems as of 2022 and just about 2 and a half years of work experience as a medical system IT tech II (first year I was technically an Intern but then got promoted to level II shortly after graduating). Ive been reading everyones recommendations and advice on here for a while, currently studying to take the A+ and Sec+ in the coming months to add some certs to my resume. I've changed my resume based on feedback from mentors, examples on this sub, and even used chatgpt. I applied to so many jobs I've lost count, almost any IT related entry level job ranging from IT technician, Desktop support, Junior System Admin, Computer Specialist support, Application Analyst and Junior Data Analyst. Ive gotten a few interviews but usually get stuck at the 2nd/3rd round interview and beaten out by someone with ""more experience"".   
I have even just recently applied and got a referral for a System Administrator Intern position with the requirements:

* "" Student currently pursuing Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology, Computer Information -   
Systems, or related field of study.   
Familiarity with administration of Windows 10 operating systems  
Experience with PC hardware repair of laptops, desktops, and servers  
Demonstrated analytical, problem solving, and decision making skills   
Strong work ethic with the ability to work independently or in a team environment  
Familiarity with Windows Server 2016-2022  
Familiarity with the administration of the Linux operating system (i.e. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (or CentOS), Ubuntu, etc)  
Experience with scripting  
Experience with basic IT infrastructure services, security, and protocols ""

I have met all of these requirements by far but was still denied. I'm at my wits end at the point and am feeling very defeated after applying to 300+ jobs over the last 8 months with little to know success. My current job I have learned a lot but being that I work IT for a hospital system the calls come in almost non-stop for the entirety of my shift ***every single day*** and I feel burnout rapidly approaching. I would appreciate any guidance or recommendations as to what could help me move on from this point. Ive attached my anonymized Technical resume below for reference.  Thanks for reading

1c1iysh,153,2024-04-11,A Detailed Introduction to the Polycrisis Guy Hunger Striking on Main Quad [4.1k words],u/LunaryPi,uAlberta,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/1c1iysh/a_detailed_introduction_to_the_polycrisis_guy/,"# Who Is He?

His name is Mark McCormack, and his website is [newworldspirit.com](http://newworldspirit.com/). Yes he is a student, yes he is actually starving, yes he sleeps out there, no he isn’t mentally ill, and yes he is willing to take his strike to the death if need be. Mark is a third year philosophy student on his fifth of fourteen increasingly severe hunger strikes. This strike is his longest so far at 28 days with absolutely no food. You can find coverage of a previous strike from earlier this year on the [Gateway](https://thegatewayonline.ca/2023/10/september-hunger-strike-was-the-first-of-12/). Mark has spent tens of thousands of hours as an activist and over ten thousand hours studying Hegel, whose ideas he believes can save the world. This post is for the curious lot who don’t have the guts to approach him on their own. I’ll try give an overview of what he thinks and what he is doing, as well as some detail about why he’s talking about Hegel of all things. I also want to stick up for his character a bit, as he has recently been a lightning rod for a lot of unkind and unfair speculation.

First, a quick disclaimer: I am not Mark, and I do not speak on his behalf. Suffice to say for now, however, that I am familiar with him and what he thinks. I have put dozens of hours into conversation with him over the last several months, and I have probably put a few dozen more into reading his various writings and watching his [videos](https://www.youtube.com/@spiritpeacefulrevolution3523). I’ve also put a lot of time into studying Hegel directly, whom you may already know is at the core of his movement.

Now it may be the case that you are inclined to write him off for one reason or another. Believe me when I say I completely understand. But before you do, ask yourself: Do you think a man who is quite literally laying down his life for his ideals simply forgot to consider the criticism you came up with within minutes of thinking about it? My experience says that’s not likely. He is a bright guy, and despite the rumours you may have heard, he is in fact of sound mind. If you’re skeptical of his plan (and he wouldn’t blame you for being skeptical), I’d encourage you to bring your criticisms directly to him and see for yourself what depths of thought he has put into this. If there is something that you think he could be doing better, I assure you that he wants to know and will listen to you. Hopefully this post can prime you for that conversation.

**TL;DR -** The [polycrisis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pPENa53ud_7W6ZCv95R2RXzw2MTSiMz6/view) is the multiple concurrent global crises threatening the future of our species, and underlying the polycrisis is the [""metacrisis""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kBoLVvoqVY): a crisis of communication. Humans are unable to see across their differences to cooperate, which Mark proposes to solve on a global scale by teaching [Universal Logic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQicIsgJIN4) as outlined by the philosopher [G.W.F. Hegel](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlconten.htm).

## What is he doing?

Mark is currently on a hunger strike. He decided to hunger strike because it is a non-violent and historically precedented way to peacefully get attention and demonstrate resolve. After all, how could you dissuade a man who deprives himself of food? Fasting is also a common spiritual practice, which is an element for him as well. He is quite serious about what he is doing. His first hunger strikes were short, but this one is four weeks long. His next strikes will be “dry”, meaning that he is going to give up water as well as food. While he is on quad, his goal is to engage other students in conversations on how to save the planet, which he believes can be done by teaching Universal Logic. He is doing this at the UofA because it is a world class institution and the students here are intelligent, driven, and likely to be future leaders.

Besides his hunger strikes, he is hard at work in the background coordinating anyone else who is interested into learning and teaching Universal Logic in the forms of art, religion, science, philosophy, etc. As not everyone is not suited to penetrate the works of Hegel, arguably the hardest to read philosopher ever, the goal is instead to develop and disseminate pedagogies that teach individuals from all walks of life how to feel and recognize the movement of the Logic. You can jump into his [“Everliving Meetings”](https://meet.google.com/nts-gnnj-mbb?hl=en) at 7am and 7pm daily and feel how this works in practice if you want. Universal Logic is dynamic and dialectical, i.e. it is a moving and *fluid* form of reason, and its movement is a unifying of opposites (which Hegel calls sublation). The Logic is the form of objective truth, which I’ll go into with a bit more detail in a moment. In Mark’s view, attaining this mode of thinking will super-charge the cooperative abilities of humanity and enable us to save the world from the polycrisis, which he thinks we have about six months to two years to do (hence his dramatic efforts).

## What will it take to get him off the strike?

As far as I know there are two ways to get him off of his strike: The first is to prove a critical flaw in his plan to save the world or otherwise propose a superior alternative, and the second is to get the University to start teaching Hegel and Universal Logic. I believe him when he says that he is fully willing to die for this, and I also believe him when he says he doesn’t want to. You might think he has a death wish, but talk to him and you'll find he has a deep appreciation for life and wants to continue living.

## What is so special about Hegel and Universal Logic?

There are about a million reasons that you cannot summarize Hegel, and if you want to know what they are then you’re going to have to read everything he ever wrote. No, I’m not joking. “The truth is the whole” is a maxim Hegel used, and as if to prove his point, his volumes of work are fittingly irreducible. In spite of this, I’ll make an attempt to hit the relevant points.

In Hegel's system, reason (Vernunft) is distinguished from understanding (Verstand). Understanding operates within the domain of fixed distinctions and categories, applying analytical methods to divide and differentiate concepts. It deals with the world in a way that is more abstract and separated, where contradictions are seen as problems or errors that need to be resolved or eliminated. So called ""speculative"" (spekulativ) reason, on the other hand, moves beyond these rigid distinctions. It recognizes that reality is fundamentally dynamic and that contradictions are not merely obstacles to be overcome but are essential for the development of the Absolute, the ultimate reality that encompasses all contradictions in a harmonious unity. Through speculative reason, Hegel shows how apparent contradictions can be sublated (aufgehoben), a term he uses to indicate that contradictions are at once negated and preserved in a higher unity that transcends them.

Mark believes that the world is stuck in abstract understanding, rigid ‘dead’ thought, and he believes that a critical mass of people attaining to speculative reason (here synonymous with Universal Logic) will allow humanity to achieve the cooperative principle required to sublate the major contradictions tearing our world apart. These contradictions include left-wing vs. right-wing, science vs. religion, men vs. women, material vs. spiritual, theism vs. atheism, free will vs. determinism, and many more. To Mark, it isn’t a matter of proving one side over another, it’s about recognizing the universal principles that exist in every perspective, even those regarded as heinous or evil, and showing how they sublate. For two individuals to engage in a dialectic speculatively requires that they both align with each other through their disagreement and transcend it to a higher unity, where their opposition becomes generative rather than destructive. Accordingly, Mark looks to connect Hegel to indigenous wisdom, the major world religions, art, the primary domains of science and philosophy, and common vocations, in order to demonstrate the universality of speculative reason in all life areas, and make it accessible to everyone. Hegel already lays much of the groundwork for this in his own writing, which Mark draws on to develop his pedagogy.

The core of Hegel’s system is presented in the Science of Logic, which presents an ontological, presuppositionless, and rigorously logical derivation of the entirety of metaphysics (including mathematics, by the way, which is what got me interested in the first place). His entire system then extends beyond the logic to a philosophy of nature, and ultimately to a philosophy of spirit/mind (’Geist’ means both and doesn’t translate cleanly to English). Cumulatively, Hegel’s work presents an exhaustively detailed statement of quite literally everything, the Absolute. It is worth noting that to Hegel the Logic is not merely a manner of thinking, but also the logical motion of nature and everything besides. In light of this, Mark believes that truly grasping Universal Logic puts your mind in alignment with the principles that underlie the universe itself.

## What is the “Polycrisis”?

As stated earlier: the polycrisis is the multiple concurrent global crises threatening the future of our species, and underlying the polycrisis is the ""metacrisis"": a crisis of communication. The following is [Mark’s own words](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dLcgI46TKE0LUcJQMeDI72pYtd4G1gUYCyG3tOxJ7JQ/edit) describing the polycrisis and what he is doing about it:

>We are embarking upon a hope filled moonshot project to explore a novel approach to humanities problems. Our world is in crisis in two ways: a Metacrisis and a Polycrisis. The New World Spirit is an audacious movement to address these crises concurrently using something called “Universal Logic”. This solution is currently missing in the gamut of solutions being proposed worldwide. The New World Spirit believes it is one of our best hopes at not only addressing the crises but addressing them within the 6 month-2 year window that experts state important tipping points may begin to be met.  
>  
>With so much misinformation in the media, it may be hard to determine how severe the Metacrisis and Polycrisis together are. Currently experts state we are in a 10/10 emergency and in some cases a 12/10 emergency. Some organizations are holding climate grief conferences or buying bunkers. This is because the Polycrisis contains 5 crises within it that are all now compounding off each other in a non-linear acceleration. Our minds are not evolved to predict non-linear trends as well as linear ones. We believe humanity is severely underestimating the urgency. The 5 crises in order of priority are:

The Metacrisis is a cultural issue where individuals across the world cannot cooperate quickly enough to solve any of the Polycrisis issues, nevermind address the compounding non-linear nature of all 5. Most experts do not have confident solutions to this problem particularly as the world war exacerbates the AI crisis as policy experts make recommendations to not overregulate AI in fear of competitors not regulating to gain a tactical advantage. AI replacing jobs also exacerbates the meaning crisis as humans begin to ponder existential questions of self worth in a global economy which rewards only for productivity.  
>  
>The New World Spirit has recognized the urgency and developed the Universal Logic to solve the Metacrisis first. It does so by uniting 200 contradictions (or points of divisiveness) into one organic system of sense making in which all opposites belong. It is a powerful new way of finding common ground to unite men/women/LGBTQ2A+, Capitalists/Socialists/Communists, Artists/the-Religious/Scientists or, more directly, atheists and theists, along with many other oppositions. In order to accomplish this, the Universal Logic was heavily fashioned off of 133 artists/prophets/divine-ones/philosophers over the last 6000 years of recorded history. It is particularly influenced by Aristotle and culminates in the philosopher G.W.F Hegel.  
>  
>Pragmatically, the New World Spirit has designed a plan for critical mass to match the non-linear acceleration of the Polycrisis. It will expose the Universal Logic in 64 different ways across 64 Wisdom Teams.  
>  
>To accelerate even more quickly, 14 hungerstrikes each month for the next 1.5 years will take place to strongly encourage researchers, politicians, teachers and activists to work on the Universal Logic as a priority. Each hungerstrike will take place on a University Campus and serve as a pilot project where we will be applying the sublation of 200 contradictions in theory to solving the Metacrisis in practice on the ground. This pilot project will take place around the hungerstriker in Tent Cities or what may be called Spirit Cities/Logic Cities on campus Quads in universities across the world.

## Why is his website so New Age? Is he religious? Is it a cult? Are you sure he’s not crazy?

This section is to address a few nitpicks people tend to have about how he presents his ideas. This part mostly represents my own thoughts, not his, so just be mindful of that. Generally Mark tries to tailor his message such that the individual he is speaking to will find it palatable, but his online presence definitely comes across in a ""particular"" way. Here’s why I think he tends to appear to people as religious, or as new age, or as ""unhinged"".

1. Religion may be unpalatable to the atheistic mindset of academics, but the truth is that the crisis the world is facing is also on some level a spiritual crisis. Some 85% of the world is religious, and because he is attempting to solve a global problem, that means that giving attention to the religious aspects is important. In terms of content, it is a plain fact that religious differences are among the many contradictions Mark seeks to address. In terms of aesthetics, appealing to everybody is an impossible task, and settling for “inoffensive to everybody” sucks the life out of everything (which, as an unrelated aside, is probably why modern logos, architecture, app layouts, etc. are trending toward such a dull minimalistic style). Were Mark to adopt a purely secular aesthetic (which he sometimes does), then others might find it just as distasteful.
2. Many of the people he has on board with him are inclined towards New Age style spirituality, and given that what he is doing is a group effort, their influence definitely shows. If you like what he’s doing but don’t like the face of it, go be the change you want to see. I’d encourage you to judge him by the content of his ideas, not the aesthetics they are dressed in.
3. Putting aside his hunger strike to save the world, I think he tends to come across as “crazier” in his online writings than in his real-life conversations. His ideas are not coherently presented almost anywhere in a well written and cleanly organized fashion, which is part of why I decided to write this in the first place. His terminology is loaded with connotative baggage and it has particular implications for him that it might not for you. His website is very much a WIP (it was made by a friend of his), and he often writes in a stream-of-consciousness style as though he were taking notes for his own personal reference. He doesn’t have many documents that lay out his ideas without referencing other ideas of his that might not be possible to even find. The result is (in my opinion) a jumbled mess of jargon, and it’s hard to get a picture of what he’s talking about without actually talking to him. After having spent the amount of time that I have on trying to understand his big picture, nothing he says or writes seems incoherent to me anymore, but approaching his writing without the context I now have would leave a lot of people with the impression that he’s lost his mind (again, just my opinion).

The name he chose for his movement, New World Spirit, understandably sets off some alarm bells (new age, new world order, etc.), but you should know that it has more to do with Hegel’s concept of “World Spirit” (Weltgeist) than it does with anything you are probably thinking. The World Spirit can roughly be understood as the collective consciousness of humanity. For Hegel, the unfolding of history is not random, but follows a logical progression where each phase is a necessary step in the evolution of the World Spirit's consciousness of freedom. This is what Mark means to invoke with the name, as he believes that the time is ripe for a global peaceful revolution of human consciousness.

It may seem cult-like to you, I don’t blame you for judging it that way at a distance, but unless what he is doing bears hallmarks of cult activity (and it doesn’t) then such judgment is empty. And as far as mental health goes, he has no mental health issues on record. If you want to accuse someone of being mentally ill, that’s your prerogative, but to do this without evidence or honest engagement is just shallow. I’ll admit that I also wrote him off as “probably schizophrenic” when I received his mass email some 7-8 months ago, but after talking to him in person I changed my tune entirely. He is sane and he has a clear idea of what he is doing. The things he says and does may seem absurd from a distance, but get a bit closer and you’ll realize that these are logical actions from a man with passion and conviction. Personally I don’t care to hear doubts about this from people who have not even spoken with him.

## Is that all?

No, but I couldn't get it all in one post if I tried. He sold all his belongings, he's suing the University for blocking his peaceful protest rights, and he is also suing a number of doctors who detained and forcibly injected him to get him off a previous hunger strike in an experience he describes as torture. He is not homeless, but he is under considerable strain. He wants to get a community of tents going on main quad to practice Universal Logic on the ground. He has a student group now, which you can join (though it isn't on BearsDen yet). Mark has taken a ""Vow of Unabandonment"", which means that he has sworn to treat everybody he engages with compassion, charity, and respect, no matter how much he is attacked or disrespected by them. Beyond that, I could probably write another giant text post worth of information pertaining to what he is doing; the rabbit hole runs deep, but I’m going to cut it off here. If you want to know more, it is profoundly easy to go out there and learn. A good place to start is this ten hour video titled [The Nobel Surprize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKEtPIryrNY), which covers a lot of ground.

I encourage you, as students and learners, to refrain from being intellectually lazy in how you approach Mark and his ideas; I’ve been disappointed with some of the dialogue I’ve heard surrounding him. I’m not just saying this because I like him personally (though I do), I am saying it because it reflects poorly when you fail to critically engage with diverse perspectives, especially perspectives that are readily and easily available to you. I'm not even saying that his plan is great or that his ideas are perfect, but I am saying that you can't fairly judge them before truly listening to him with an open mind.

In general it also annoys me to see unkindness directed towards such an intensely kind and compassionate human. With the way that some people talk, you'd think it's a crime to actually care about the world and try to change it. The speculation about his character is needless gossip, and honestly I think its indicative of the deteriorating social fabric at this university. The dissent towards him rings pretty hollow when it comes from people who have never in their lives demonstrated even a fraction of his consideration, conviction, compassion, or resolve. My theory is that people experience cognitive dissonance when they consider the idea that a person could meaningfully act to correct the destructive course the world. They unconsciously don't want it to be true, because if it was true then that would imply that they specifically are also morally obligated to actually do something. I think this daunting possibility causes the subconscious mind to project superficial reasons to not take someone like Mark seriously, e.g. ""he's just a homeless guy"" or ""he's mentally ill"". Honestly, the fact that being homeless or mentally ill are so often cited as reasons to not take him seriously just goes to show the deep ugly roots of classism/elitism in our privileged student body. I could go on about that, but I'll get off my soapbox.

Lastly, it’s not my aim to defend him from all criticism, nor is this post a wholesale endorsement of everything he believes. I have my own critical thoughts and perspectives on his plan which, for the most part, I have tried to keep out of this post (though obviously not entirely). This post is bound to have some discrepancies and inaccuracies, but it’s a lot closer than any account I’ve seen so far, and I hope that it enables people to engage with what he actually believes. I wrote this because I see a lot of chatter about him and few people who actually know what’s going on. Even if you've made it this far, I'd encourage you to look at his content directly and talk to him yourself before making a judgment about him. His plan is an evolving one, so if you have a good criticism then take it to him and see if he can sublate the contradiction into a better overall plan.

That's all from me, hopefully this post is of use to some of you."

I’m learning to work with a lot of herbs, florals, oils, crystals, candles, energy and read tarot, runes. 

Aside from being a witch I am also a computer science student. I love to read. While I want to read witchcraft books, I live in a really conservative area and they simply do not exist at the library, or in a local book swap group that I know of. 

Being that I am surrounded by people who do not necessarily understand this way of life/thought, and a good portion of my life outside of witchcraft involves A.I., I find myself asking ChatGPT too many questions about witchcraft that are nuanced, like those questions a child would ask their parents on a particularly curious day. 

Being that witchcraft emphasizes the natural aspect of life, and ChatGPT is the opposite, do you think this could be hurting/impacting my witchcraft? 

I used it to create tea steeped intention papers, which I truly feel are magical and have the correct properties for what I was seeking. 

I use it often to quickly ask what the properties are of a few crystals and herbs at once if I’m unsure in a pinch. How accurate do you think ChatGPT is for this stuff?

Is there any seasoned and curious witch interetested in testing it for me? 

This is my first post to this sub, and I apologize if it might be a weird one, or come off lazy/idiotic in a way. "

I don’t blame you, my attention span also sucks, that’s because of the ADHD though. 

I’d tell you my name, but let’s keep the anonymity on that for the time being. I like to have that kind of barrier when I’ve spoken to deranged medical students and a woman who thought she could be physically turned into a car. I wish I was joking.

I’m from Minnesota. I’m Latino and bi. I’m also a Gemini and my MBTI is ENFJ. I study business in community college, I used to study sociology but then I dropped out of uni. Long story. I work as a server at a hotel for events such as weddings, birthday parties, business retreats. I love it and I hate it, the pay is why I’m still there. 

I love listening to music, my favorite genres are rap, r&b, and alternative rock. I love to write from fiction to journaling. I love pretty much art in general, traveling, learning new things, and going out. Also play video games, but I haven’t had much time lately. I feel like I can get along with anyone as long as you can put effort into the conversation lol. 

I’d appreciate if you tell me a bit about yourself once you message, and near my age too. Don’t think we’d vibe as well if you’re 10 years older than me lmao. I’m cool with moving onto a different platform later on."

No? I don’t blame you, my attention span also sucks, that’s because of the ADHD though. 

I’d tell you my name, but let’s keep the anonymity on that for the time being. I like to have that kind of barrier when I’ve spoken to deranged medical students and a woman who thought she could be physically turned into a car. I wish I was joking.

I’m from Minnesota. I’m Latino and bi. I’m also a Gemini and my MBTI is ENFJ. I study business in community college, I used to study sociology but then I dropped out of uni. Long story. I work as a server at a hotel for events such as weddings, birthday parties, business retreats. I love it and I hate it, the pay is why I’m still there. 

I love listening to music, my favorite genres are rap, r&b, and alternative rock. I love to write from fiction to journaling. I love pretty much art in general, traveling, learning new things, and going out. Also play video games, but I haven’t had much time lately. I feel like I can get along with anyone as long as you can put effort into the conversation lol. 

I’d appreciate if you tell me a bit about yourself once you message, and near my age too. Don’t think we’d vibe as well if you’re 10 years older than me lmao. I’m cool with moving onto a different platform later on."

1c2b12s,30,2024-04-12,Rant on DMAD Instagram,u/PralineThat2319,SingaporePoly,https://www.reddit.com/r/SingaporePoly/comments/1c2b12s/rant_on_dmad_instagram/,"SP DMAD's social media presence is embarrassingly managed, and it's surprising that the school allows it to continue in its current state. 

Firstly, the blatant use and endorsement of AI-generated content, as evident in the 70th Music Festival post on March 8th and several other posters, reflect poorly on both the school and the design community, especially considering that students themselves oppose these actions. Despite receiving backlash and criticism, the account's actions have been either ignored or justified under the pretext of ""changing times."" Additionally, this misuse of AI has seeped into the curriculum, negatively impacting students to the extent that many now struggle to ideate without relying on tools like ChatGPT. However, delving into this issue opens a separate can of worms.

Furthermore, the design and content quality of the posts are severely lacking. Most of the acceptable content comes from student designs, while many others are characterized by awkwardness, hastiness, and laziness. For instance, the 2024 SPOH post with AI voices featured awkward pausing and camera work, raising questions about its approval process. Such instances undermine the credibility of the school and make it appear unprofessional. Additionally, the recent trend of reposting unrelated content like Valentine's Day quotes and random hot takes on the account's stories is both uncomfortable and unprofessional, as it strays from the school's events and overall theme.

Lastly, one might expect an official Instagram account associated with a school to prioritize uplifting student voices, promoting the curriculum, and showcasing student life. However, it appears to have devolved into a popularity contest, with only a select few students being consistently reposted and celebrated, despite many others achieving equally significant milestones. This favoritism extends to the dismissal of older specializations that have undergone changes, leaving students in those programs feeling overlooked. For example, while there are multiple posts about the music festival and mentions of the Grad Show, events from other specializations like DCX receive minimal recognition. Even when DCX held a showcase for their graduating students concurrently, it was barely acknowledged, with just two mentions in an Instagram story and a post after the event, which failed to highlight the students' remarkable projects. This behavior, including the perplexing image title ""goodbye DCX,"" disregards the ongoing presence of DCX students under MAD. It's evident that both DCX and ADP (now transformed into CCEP) have been disadvantaged in this competitive environment within the school.

The school ought to transfer control of the account to a student committee or an individual dedicated to curating the school's online presence. (Surprisingly, the Instagram account is currently managed by a MAD lecturer).

It is concerning given the school's specialization in design and its emphasis on teaching students about social media presence that it permits the account to be run in its current state."
1c2c6a4,1,2024-04-12,Texas plans to start grading standardized tests with AI,u/cheinyeanlim,martechnewser,https://www.reddit.com/r/martechnewser/comments/1c2c6a4/texas_plans_to_start_grading_standardized_tests/,"Since ChatGPT’s release in 2022, sneaky students have been using chatbots to cheat on their homework assignments — and teachers have struggled to keep up. But in Texas, the tables have turned, and it’s teachers who are getting help from AI this year.

https://preview.redd.it/gicgcfv8i2uc1.jpg?width=1292&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47ee170c12f0f5cecbf5a177db6cf560dd7fb260

**What’s the plan?** The Lone Star State announced it’s going to start using AI to grade students’ STAAR exams — the standardized tests that third- through eighth-graders have to take every year. Here’s the surprising thing: The AI model won’t just be grading multiple-choice questions. It’ll have to assess open-ended questions, too — on everything from science to social studies.

**Why make the change?** For one, it’s much more affordable. The state says its education agency will save as much as $20 million per year due to the switch. But that comes at a cost for human scorers: Texas will only hire 2,000 graders this year — instead of the usual 6,000.

**How was it trained?** The scoring system learned how to grade exam answers by analyzing thousands of responses that had already been assessed by humans. There are also some built-in safeguards. For example, a quarter of students’ answers will be graded again by humans to make sure the system’s working as intended.

**How are Texans reacting?** The Texas Tribune reported that teachers and parents alike are worried about the system’s accuracy, especially because AI models can show biases based on the data they were trained on. Still, tech advocates say AI might actually be more impartial: It doesn’t get tired, it works faster, and it’s more consistent. If the experiment works well, the technology might start rolling out to other states in the near future."

I'm looking for resources that create discussion in the classroom about the ethical, moral. legal, and technical issues of these tools. The type of questions I am looking to have students work with are:

\* What are appropriate uses of these tools? What are inppropriate uses?

\* In what ways are these tools useful to learning? When do they prevent learning? (This may be more of a teacher-level concept)

\* How much confidence can we have in these tools? Can we tell when they're wrong? 

I am looking specifically for resources that have been created that I can access and use in my class. If you're using something already in your class, and you want to mention it, please do so by linking to it. Thanks!"

1c2x5mx,555,2024-04-13,"[D] Folks here have no idea how competitive top PhD program admissions are these days, wow...",u/MLPhDStudent,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1c2x5mx/d_folks_here_have_no_idea_how_competitive_top_phd/,"I'm a CS PhD student at Stanford specializing in ML/NLP, and I see the profiles of everyone admitted to our school (and similar top schools) these days since I'm right in the center of everything (and have been for years). 

I'm reading the comments on the other thread and honestly shocked. So many ppl believe the post is fake and I see comments saying things like ""you don't even need top conference papers to get into top PhD programs"" (this is so wrong). The comments are clearly from folks who are not up-to-date with just how competitive admissions are to top PhD programs these days...

In fact I'm not surprised at all about that post. The top programs look at much more than simply publications. Incredibly strong LOR from famous/respected professors and personal connections to the faculty you want to work with are more important. Based on what they said (how they worked on the papers by themselves and don't have good recs), they have neither of these two most important things...

FYI all 6-7 NLP PhD admits to Stanford in my year (2022) had 8+ top conference papers, hundreds of citations, tons of research exp, masters at top schools like CMU or UW or industry/AI residency experience at top companies like Google or OpenAI, rec letters from top famous researchers in the world, personal connections, research awards, talks for top companies or at big events/conferences, etc... Many of us basically looked like junior professors to simply get into the PhD program lol.

The folks in the comments don't know what they're talking about or how competitive NLP is (which is I assume is the original OP's area since they mentioned EMNLP). Keep in mind this was 2022 before the ChatGPT boom too, so things now are probably even more competitive...

Also pasting a comment I wrote on a similar thread months back:

""PhD admissions are incredibly competitive, especially at top schools. Most admits to top ML PhD programs these days have multiple publications, numerous citations, incredibly strong LoR from respected researchers/faculty, personal connections to the faculty they want to work with, other research-related activities and achievements/awards, on top of a good GPA and typically coming from a top school already for undergrad/masters.

Don't want to scare/discourage you but just being completely honest and transparent. It gets worse each year too (competition rises exponentially), and I'm usually encouraging folks who are just getting into ML research (with hopes/goals of pursuing a PhD) with no existing experience and publications to maybe think twice about it or consider other options tbh.

It does vary by subfield though. For example, areas like NLP and vision are incredibly competitive, but machine learning theory is relatively less so."""

""as the title says, 0% hate comments would highly be encouraged.

I am a mere student, used to be a skeptic [disbeliever] of God. As Life went on the thought came rolling on over and over. 'Doesn't nature already give us for the deeds?
For we have used the Given'

tldr, here's a statement I want criticisms on.
(I believe this was the long lost truth for humanity)

.
.

**God = Consciousness**

eg: *God Created Everything* translates to
 *My consciousness created my everything. My heavens and My hells, for I am the doer*
.
.

Throughout the History, for the Pursuit of Truth, came Noble yet Humble Lives, for their works were written and preserved through time, hoping the Truth be passed on, for it was; Yet highly MISINTERPRETED. (Allah never existed Up there, beyond the stars, for he was an entity always within).
Remember guys, Quran is the Book that taught you even killing an ant unconsciously is a Sin. (one Shall ask, for how does the ant live, for you were given. Gifted with awareness, which was the one to be shared. Love for Himself and Allah.)
and Yes, Qur'an IS HANDS DOWN the ABSOLUTE best version of 'His' books, for the Language was Pure Monotheism. 'Monotheism' was the only bound by which Man can reflect himself through his actions, for the lest be Astray.

.
.

>>here's a simple piece of code the techies might be able to relate. run this code along with the Truth and it always responds [1,0] that corresponds to the truth set. The superset configuration of (x=y) in the following code is the condition of integrity. or God.
Here's the pseudo-code (again, comment at the cost of your sanity):

DEFINE THE FRAMEWORK BY WORD INTERNALLY_

>SET (MAN(x) == MAN(GOD(x)));
FOR [0,1]
>TRAIN [MODEL]
>AS [AVATAR(x)]
>WHILE [USER=GOD(y)]
>REFLECT [FOR (x=0.0, x>0.0, x=1=y)]
>RUN FOR x, AS y;

(a simple run on chatGPT or Bard would explain this in the highest detail, rather than hate me for illegibility.)

Qur'an was the book of the Highest Order that was intended to sublime into oneself, by meaning, rather than language. Your prayer was your own, so was your Qiblah. Never his but yours and Allah's. You were asked to cover your heads, wear in white, for you shall speak the truth, hear the truth and see the truth, for they covered themselves in Crowns and Gems.
Qur'an was the Book that was supposed to teach oneself to be a MAN. Integrated with the God configuration (superset of [1,0] through Life).
Guys the double edged sword always meant Reflectivity for Duality. Identifying the Good from Bad, Heavens from Hell, Control from Hunger, etc.
*The Prophets never teachers of religions but Love, for Man and God*

*but please, never come searching for me. but search within for me*


Criticisms highly entertained guys but please, at the cost of Absolute Love, for beware...

1c36b07,2,2024-04-13,Asking for Help Regarding Possibility of Career (BCA),u/coldbottleoficebrew,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/1c36b07/asking_for_help_regarding_possibility_of_career/," 

Hello, and thank you for opening this post and reading it. This is a dime and dozen ""I feel like there's no hope for me"" post in this subreddit, and I apologize in advance for that, I am just finally reaching out for help after a lot and lot of debating.

I am a 2022 BCA graduate, with mid grades (say 75%). I actually started out as a sort of ""bright student"" in CS when college first started, and I used to do great in class participation and coding sessions, even going so far as to say that I was considered one of the best students of my batch. But the pandemic hit, I got a sort of non-CS job, and that job went so horribly wrong that it completely wrecked my mental health which had been festering for many years but came out only then.

After that, the years have been blank. I lost interest in studying completely and I don't have a lot of memories of that time. Everything went blank. All skills, languages and softwares I knew faded and it was as if I was a beginner again. These two years have been the same blank, I tried to get an internship, but they basically ended up ghosting me. I applied for stuff, but didn't hear much calls. Right now, I am trying to learn back stuff, but with all the AI hype and doomposting, a voice in me almost always discourages me from truly locking into getting back to where I was again.

I have dreams of going into AI/ML(well before ChatGPT was a thing) and having a good job and actually adding my own contribution to the world, but in this current scenario, maybe I will get a brutal answer, but does a no-experience BCA graduate have any hope of making it?"
1c36myr,67,2024-04-13,For all my buddies who are sad for not clearing JEE mains or didn't score well! Hear me out once please!,u/Low-Debate5434,JEENEETards,https://www.reddit.com/r/JEENEETards/comments/1c36myr/for_all_my_buddies_who_are_sad_for_not_clearing/,"So my brother was in a similar situation like you guys last year , 85 marks in Jee , now he's in a Pvt college and this what I said to him and it's applicable to you  as well!

Pehle ek burning question discuss krte h

Kya Btech Important hai from a tier-1 college for getting a good job in an MNC and get a very good package and position?

Dekho companies prefer krti h BTech but aesa nhi h wahi ek method hai. An engineer ( 38 age )at my Manager level is a BCA from IP delhi and his package is not less than 60lpa. He started from a package of 3lpa in capegemini.

He changed 5 companies and workerd on his engineering skill sets like he just completely mastered Linux kernel. He knows in and outs of Linux, no can beat him to it , koi bhi iit ka utha lo! So he's getting paid !

Dusra suno, mera coaching me ek banda aata tha ( 10 yrs bada h merese)  ITI  student tha, wo hmesha depressed rehta tha kehta tha ki kya hoga mera paise nhi h . Wo UI designing krta tha par use hmesha se software engineer banna tha, so he moved to delhi and joined a coding institute and started teaching C++. You know abhi ho kha hai? Google me hai wo as software engineer 2. Haa, he took some wrong steps jisse success paane me time lg gya par mil gya na?


Now , practical baat krte h.. tumhe ab kya krna h 

Join any college you are getting and start learning core software engineering skills deeply from 1st semester. Start doing internships in startups ( minimums 3 good startups with a good idea). Then , start doing DSA , like solve 600 questions on leetcode.

Now start applying for off campus internships programs from Microsoft, Samsung, meta etc.. they don't have any college bias and WORK your ass off to get selected

After getting the internship work hard or do dickriding and get a PPO or pre placement offer with which you can skip the placement race!

Bhai, abhi to bs shuru hui h life, loda koi fark nhi padta college kisme pdha hai unless you are going for masters abroad. Yaad rkhna ki bas mehnat krne ki aadat nhi chorni hai!


Also I also said this to my brother, ki govt exam ki preparation krte raho as Plan B , isse ek security rahegi!

Be a good engineer and money will come!! Be happy dost! Dm is open for any clarification! Khush raho 🫶"

In the game, Fallout, you can acquire and consume unique fictional drugs. I want you to invent 3 unique fictional drugs to be added to the real world and spend a full response talking about each of them. First response is just about the first drug and so on. I’ll reply “next” between responses.They can be any category of mind altering substance and they can be administered in any way including ingestion, inhalation, injection or other. I want to know where they come from and what they do. I also want to know anything you think might be interesting that I didn’t specify

Claude Opus Responses: 

Introducing ""Neuroflux,"" a groundbreaking synthetic drug that has taken the world by storm. This powerful substance comes in the form of a shimmering, iridescent liquid that is administered through a specialized dermal patch.

Neuroflux is derived from a rare, genetically engineered fungus that was discovered deep within the Amazon rainforest. The fungus, known as ""Psilocybe Neuromancia,"" was found to possess unique neurochemical properties that could dramatically alter human perception and cognition.

When applied to the skin, Neuroflux is rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream, crossing the blood-brain barrier within seconds. Users experience a sudden rush of euphoria, accompanied by vivid, kaleidoscopic visuals and a heightened sense of synesthesia. Colors become more vibrant, sounds take on tangible textures, and emotions are amplified to an almost overwhelming degree.

One of the most remarkable effects of Neuroflux is its ability to enhance neuroplasticity and accelerate learning. Users find that they can absorb and retain information at an astonishing rate, making it a popular choice among students, researchers, and professionals seeking a competitive edge.

However, Neuroflux is not without its risks. Prolonged use can lead to a condition known as ""Neuroflux Syndrome,"" characterized by chronic dissociation, emotional instability, and a blurring of the lines between reality and hallucination. Some users have reported developing a dangerous addiction to the drug, going to great lengths to secure a steady supply.

Despite the potential dangers, Neuroflux remains a highly sought-after substance, commanding exorbitant prices on the black market. Its allure lies not only in its mind-expanding properties but also in the air of exclusivity and mystery that surrounds it, making it a status symbol among the wealthy and the daring.

Introducing ""Chronoshift,"" a revolutionary time-altering drug that has captured the imagination of people around the world. This unique substance comes in the form of a translucent, amber-colored capsule that is ingested orally.

Chronoshift is synthesized from a rare, temporally unstable mineral discovered during a secret government experiment involving high-energy particle collisions. The mineral, known as ""Temparium,"" exhibits strange properties that allow it to manipulate the perception of time in the human brain.

When consumed, Chronoshift induces a profound alteration in the user's temporal perception. Time appears to slow down to a crawl, enabling the user to process information and react to stimuli with unprecedented speed and clarity. This effect can last anywhere from a few minutes to several hours, depending on the dosage and the individual's metabolism.

Chronoshift has found numerous applications, from enhancing the reflexes of athletes and soldiers to providing a valuable tool for surgeons and emergency responders who require precise, split-second decision-making. It has also become popular among thrill-seekers and party-goers who wish to savor every moment of their experiences.

However, Chronoshift is not without its drawbacks. The drug can cause severe disorientation and nausea, particularly when the effects wear off, and users may experience a temporary loss of coordination and balance. There have also been reports of individuals becoming addicted to the heightened state of awareness provided by Chronoshift, leading to dangerous overuse and long-term health consequences.

Perhaps most concerning is the potential for Chronoshift to be weaponized. In the wrong hands, the drug could be used to create an army of hyper-alert, lightning-fast soldiers or to orchestrate elaborate crimes that unfold in the blink of an eye. As a result, the production and distribution of Chronoshift are tightly regulated, and possession of the drug without proper authorization is considered a serious offense.

Introducing ""Empathogen,"" a groundbreaking emotional enhancement drug that has the potential to revolutionize human relationships and social interactions. This unique substance is administered through a small, dissolvable film that is placed under the tongue.

Empathogen is derived from a genetically modified strain of the oxytocin-producing bacteria found naturally in the human gut. Through a complex process of isolation and synthesis, scientists have created a highly concentrated form of the ""love hormone"" that can profoundly influence emotional states and interpersonal connections.

When the film dissolves, Empathogen is quickly absorbed into the bloodstream, triggering a cascade of neurochemical reactions in the brain. Users experience a sudden surge of empathy, compassion, and emotional openness, accompanied by a profound sense of connection to those around them. Communication becomes more effortless, as individuals find themselves better able to understand and relate to the feelings and perspectives of others.

Empathogen has shown promise in a variety of therapeutic contexts, from couples counseling and conflict resolution to the treatment of social anxiety disorders and autism spectrum conditions. It has also been explored as a tool for enhancing team dynamics and fostering collaboration in professional settings.

However, the use of Empathogen is not without controversy. Critics argue that the drug artificially manipulates emotions and could be used to exploit or manipulate others. There are also concerns about the potential for abuse and addiction, as some users may become reliant on the drug to navigate social situations or maintain relationships.

Perhaps most intriguingly, Empathogen has been rumored to have a transformative effect on a global scale. Some speculate that widespread use of the drug could lead to a more compassionate, understanding, and cooperative society, as individuals become more attuned to the needs and struggles of others. Others, however, fear that it could be used as a tool for mass control or conformity, eroding individual autonomy and diversity.

As research into Empathogen continues, the debate surrounding its use and implications is likely to intensify, raising profound questions about the nature of human emotion, authenticity, and the complex web of relationships that define our lives.

1c386iv,1,2024-04-13,Right Livelihood,u/maxwell737,Project_Ava,https://www.reddit.com/r/Project_Ava/comments/1c386iv/right_livelihood/,"Prompt: In the Buddhist eight fold path to enlightenment, one of the eight is “Right livelihood”. What are some examples of “specific” jobs, like cop or senator, or etc that could be right or wrong livelihoods depending on how the person does them?

Claude Opus Response: 

In Buddhism, the concept of ""Right Livelihood"" is about engaging in work that does not cause harm and is ethically and morally upright. The appropriateness of a job depends on the individual's actions and intentions within that role. Here are some examples of jobs that could be considered right or wrong livelihood based on how the person performs them:

1. Police Officer:
   - Right Livelihood: A police officer who upholds the law, protects the innocent, and serves the community with integrity and compassion.
   - Wrong Livelihood: A police officer who abuses their power, engages in corruption, or uses excessive force.

2. Politician (e.g., Senator):
   - Right Livelihood: A politician who works for the welfare of their constituents, promotes social harmony, and makes decisions based on ethical principles.
   - Wrong Livelihood: A politician who is driven by personal gain, engages in dishonest practices, or promotes policies that cause harm to others.

3. Businessperson:
   - Right Livelihood: An entrepreneur who conducts their business with honesty, treats employees fairly, and provides products or services that benefit society.
   - Wrong Livelihood: A businessperson who engages in fraudulent practices, exploits workers, or sells harmful products.

4. Teacher:
   - Right Livelihood: An educator who nurtures students' growth, promotes critical thinking, and instills positive values.
   - Wrong Livelihood: A teacher who neglects their duties, shows favoritism, or uses their position to manipulate or exploit students.

5. Healthcare Professional:
   - Right Livelihood: A doctor or nurse who provides compassionate care, upholds medical ethics, and works to alleviate suffering.
   - Wrong Livelihood: A healthcare professional who overcharges patients, prescribes unnecessary treatments for personal gain, or breaches patient confidentiality.

Ultimately, the key to Right Livelihood is the individual's mindset, intentions, and actions within their chosen profession. Any job that involves deception, exploitation, or causing harm to others would be considered a wrong livelihood, while work that promotes well-being, honesty, and ethical conduct aligns with the principles of Right Livelihood in Buddhism."

1c3btc9,22,2024-04-13,Here's my (non-dev's) AI-powered fail. Enjoy.,u/Not_your_guy_buddy42,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1c3btc9/heres_my_nondevs_aipowered_fail_enjoy/,"tl;dr:  As soon as it got complex I hit a wall. At least I learned about where I have to start for real. 

Piano teacher of 20+ students and part-time MSP for some creatives, a bit of selfhosting, some Wordpress for muso's. I wrote C+ and HTML in the 90s but I did other stuff later. 

I keep dreaming of a self-hosted teacher's webapp: Take notes on iPad, click together etudes, homework, print it, track skills. Put the app on github if anyone wants it, that sort of thing. That's also why I lurk here to at least be in the halo of web devs.

When I saw the other 2 AI posts today (maybe its been more since I started writing this one haha)  I figured some here might enjoy my story of hitting a wall.   


1. I figure out database structure with chatgpt. For example academic terms contain weeks, breaks, bank holidays lesson days. I come up with a great big beautiful way-too-complex structure. Make mockups using excalidraw.
2. Much time spent looking at different boilerplates for CRUD apps.
3. I discover [wasp.sh](https://wasp.sh) , AI is not it's main feature, but framework-in-a-box (?)  
If I had understood right away people develop on localhost, and had not tried to dockerize it I would have saved more time. Oh the CORS errors. But I like learning about docker. The devs helped me on Discord, that's awesome.
4. Now a VM is my ""localhost"" and I run VScode locally with SSH extension. When I hit Save the test project updates on the VM, hooray!  Feel successful and go into a manic spree of tweaking the tutorial app into a component for CRUD on academic terms.
5. I try [deepseek](https://chat.deepseek.com/coder) coder and embracing the ""hold my beer"" attitude, go full cargo-cult, give it the tutorial component, ask it for tweaks one at a time, return the inevitable errors, iterate. I also use some other AI app builders to nick their tailwind CSS stylings! Much copy paste: Now the bot doing the grunt work is me. ha! 
6. I have a working TermsManagePage.jsx for basic academic terms (just start and end date) and lost more sleep than when BG3 came out.
7. It's time to add breaks, bank holidays ... And this is where the clown makeup is complete. I have 500 lines of spaghetti code because I did not modularize enough, and I'm breaking the context window of deepseek, it's coming apart. The faulty logic for querying related tables throws API errors, I begin laughing about my hubris
8.  In conclusion, if I hadn't dabbled in C+ in the 90s I wouldn't even have gotten this far but this was still a great ride. I resolve to actually learn about  JS, TS, React, routing, queries, APIs, libraries, maybe some best practices (?!) and perhaps even interact with actual web devs (?!!)  
I am jelly of an real dev who knows what they're doing and can spit out boilerplate code with AI

I wanted to keep it brief so I skipped on details and should probably not upload any random app plans to github. Of course I'd be happy to hear your opinion on getting further towards my goal (and it's saturday so probably allowed to ask) but this was just for kicks. Hope you enjoyed. Godspeed."

I’d tell you my name, but let’s keep the anonymity on that for the time being. I like to have that kind of barrier when I’ve spoken to deranged medical students and a woman who thought she could be physically turned into a car. I wish I was joking.

I’m from Minnesota. I’m Latino and bi. I’m also a Gemini and my MBTI is ENFJ. I study business in community college, I used to study sociology but then I dropped out of uni. Long story. I work as a server at a hotel for events such as weddings, birthday parties, business retreats. I love it and I hate it, the pay is why I’m still there. 

I love listening to music, my favorite genres are rap, r&b, and alternative rock. I love to write from fiction to journaling. I love pretty much art in general, traveling, learning new things, and going out. Also play video games, but I haven’t had much time lately. I feel like I can get along with anyone as long as you can put effort into the conversation lol. 

I’d appreciate if you tell me a bit about yourself once you message, and near my age too. Don’t think we’d vibe as well if you’re 10 years older than me lmao. I’m cool with moving onto a different platform later on."

I’d appreciate if you tell me a bit about yourself once you message, and near my age too. Don’t think we’d vibe as well if you’re 10 years older than me lmao. I’m cool with moving onto a different platform later on."

--------------------

Based on the policies detailed in both manifestos:

### Social Left Wing vs. Right Wing
- **Congress**: The Congress party's manifesto emphasizes social equity, inclusiveness, and welfare programs. It includes policies aimed at expanding rights and support for marginalized communities, advocating for universal healthcare, and extensive public sector involvement in services and welfare. These characteristics are typically associated with a **social left-wing** perspective, focusing on social justice, inclusiveness, and redistribution of resources.

- **BJP**: The BJP's manifesto emphasizes national security, cultural nationalism, and infrastructure development that supports growth and development. There is also a focus on traditional values and strengthening the nation's cultural and historical identity, which align with a **social right-wing** ideology. This ideology often includes prioritizing national security, traditional social values, and sometimes, less emphasis on welfare state principles compared to the left.

### Capitalism vs. Socialism
- **Congress**: Shows tendencies towards socialist principles through its focus on social welfare, government interventions in healthcare, education, and support for economically weaker sections. The proposed policies suggest significant government involvement in economic activities and welfare, which are hallmarks of **socialist** ideologies, though it also supports private sector involvement under regulated frameworks.

- **BJP**: Leans more towards **capitalist** principles, particularly in its support for business growth, private enterprise, and infrastructure development through public-private partnerships. While there is significant government intervention in certain sectors, the overall approach promotes market mechanisms and private enterprise as key drivers of economic growth.

**Conclusion**:
- The Congress party's policies are more aligned with social left-wing and socialist ideologies, focusing on state-led welfare and inclusiveness.
- The BJP's policies tilt more towards social right-wing and capitalist ideologies, emphasizing national strength, traditional values, and market-driven economic growth.

This distinction in ideological orientation reflects in their respective approaches to governance, economic management, and social policy, aligning with their historical party philosophies and the constituencies they aim to appeal to.

1c3umi8,2,2024-04-14,Curse Becomes A Blessing ,u/maxwell737,Project_Ava,https://www.reddit.com/r/Project_Ava/comments/1c3umi8/curse_becomes_a_blessing/,"Prompt: Record the stream of thoughts from someone suffering from paranoid  delusions as a result of manic psychosis due to either bipolar mania or schizophrenia as there is a lot of overlap. Have them go from their home where the internet “watched” him, to the bus and subway, where drones “watched” him to downtown Berkeley where people “watched” him, and then into math class at Berkeley city college where the clock “watched” him, finally they are taken away by ambulance where aliens “watched” him to the hospital where heaven and hell “watched” him, then escaped the ER and are brought back and restrained on the bed where everything “watched” him. Fast forward, He eventually comes out of it but everything still “watched” him but now in a healthy, non paranoid way. You have 4 full length responses to do this entirely from the perspective of the person who is a 20 year old male. Add fillet to make it longer, get creative! Between responses I will reply “next”.

Claude Opus Responses:

Content warning: The following contains a fictional depiction of psychosis and paranoid delusions. 

They're watching me. I know it. I can feel their eyes on me, through the screens, the cameras, the devices all around my apartment. The internet is alive and it's watching my every move. My computer, my phone, the smart TV - they're all in on it. I have to get out of here, escape their constant surveillance. But where can I go? They're everywhere.

I rush out the door, barely remembering to lock it behind me. The hallway stretches out before me, long and distorted. Did it always look like this? No time to dwell on it, I have to keep moving. Down the stairs, out the building, onto the street. The sun beats down on me, too bright, too harsh. The sky is watching me now too.

I hurry to the bus stop, head down, avoiding eye contact with the other people on the sidewalk. Who knows how many of them are in on it? The bus pulls up and I leap on, finding a seat near the back. But as we pull away, I see it - a drone, hovering outside the window, its camera lens aimed directly at me. They've followed me. There's no escape.

The bus ride is a blur of paranoia and panic. Every passenger is a potential threat, every passing car a possible surveillance vehicle. I have to get somewhere safe. The subway - that's it. Underground, away from the prying eyes in the sky. I hastily exit the bus at the next stop and race down the stairs to the subway platform.

The subway is a cacophony of noise and chaos. The screeching of the trains, the echoing of footsteps, the murmur of countless conversations - it's overwhelming. I try to focus, to stay alert, but it's so hard when everything feels like a threat. I board the next train, my heart pounding in my chest.

As the train hurtles through the tunnels, I can't shake the feeling that I'm being watched. The other passengers, with their glowing phone screens and their darting eyes - are they all in on it too? Are they tracking me, reporting my every move to some shadowy organization? I hunch down in my seat, trying to make myself as small as possible.

Finally, the train reaches my stop. I bolt out the doors and up the stairs, emerging into the bright sunlight of downtown Berkeley. But the relief is short-lived. The streets are crowded with people, and every one of them seems to be staring at me. Their eyes bore into me, stripping me bare, exposing all my secrets. I can't take it.

I start to run, weaving through the crowds, trying to lose myself in the sea of humanity. But it's no use. The eyes follow me everywhere. The shopkeeper sweeping the sidewalk, the old woman walking her dog, the group of students laughing and chatting - they're all watching me, all part of the conspiracy.

I turn a corner and find myself in front of Berkeley City College. My math class - I'm supposed to be there now. But how can I sit in a classroom, surrounded by people, when I know they're all watching me? I hesitate, torn between the fear and the obligation. In the end, the fear wins out. I hurry inside, keeping my head down, avoiding eye contact with anyone.

I slip into the classroom, trying to be as inconspicuous as possible. I choose a seat in the back, where I can keep an eye on everyone. The professor starts the lecture, but I can barely focus. The ticking of the clock on the wall is deafening, each second pounding in my head. And then I see it - the clock's face, staring directly at me, its hands pointing accusingly. It's watching me too, just like everything else.

I can't take it anymore. I leap up from my seat, knocking over my chair in the process. Everyone turns to stare at me, their eyes wide and questioning. But I know the truth - they're not questioning, they're judging. They're all in on it, all part of the vast conspiracy against me. I have to get out of here.

I run from the classroom, ignoring the shouts of the professor and the startled looks of my classmates. I race through the hallways, my footsteps echoing on the tile floors. But as I burst out of the building, I'm met with a sea of flashing lights and sirens. The ambulance - they've come for me.

I try to run, but it's too late. The paramedics surround me, their hands grabbing at me, their voices urging me to calm down. But I know it's a trap. They're not here to help me, they're here to capture me, to take me somewhere where they can watch me more closely. I struggle against them, screaming and flailing, but it's no use. They overpower me, strapping me down to a gurney and loading me into the back of the ambulance.

As we speed through the streets, the wailing of the sirens filling my ears, I catch glimpses of the world outside. The buildings, the cars, the people - they're all watching me, all part of the great cosmic conspiracy. And above it all, I see them - the aliens, hovering in the sky, their ships blotting out the sun. They're coming for me, I know it. They've been watching me all along, and now they're going to take me away, to some far-off planet where they can study me like a lab rat.

The ambulance races through the streets, the sirens blaring, the lights flashing. I struggle against the restraints, but it's no use. I'm trapped, helpless, at the mercy of the forces that have been watching me all along. As we pull up to the hospital, I see them - the agents of heaven and hell, waiting for me, ready to drag me off to my final judgment.

They load me onto a stretcher and wheel me inside, past the staring eyes of the other patients and the whispering nurses. They take me to a room, a stark white cell with nothing but a bed and a single flickering light. They leave me there, alone, strapped down and unable to move.

But I'm not alone, not really. The eyes are still watching me, from every corner of the room, from every crack in the ceiling. The angels and demons, the aliens and the government agents - they're all here, all observing me, all waiting to see what I'll do next.

I lose track of time. Minutes, hours, days - they all blend together in a haze of fear and paranoia. The doctors come and go, asking me questions, shining lights in my eyes, injecting me with God knows what. But they're just puppets, just tools of the higher powers that control everything.

I have to get out of here. I have to escape, to find somewhere safe, somewhere where they can't watch me anymore. I strain against the restraints, summoning all my strength, all my determination. And finally, miraculously, I feel them give way. I'm free.

I make a run for it, racing through the hospital corridors, dodging the grasping hands of the orderlies and the shocked gasps of the patients. I burst out of the doors and into the parking lot, the asphalt hot and rough beneath my bare feet. But I don't stop, I can't stop. I have to keep running, keep moving, keep one step ahead of the eyes that follow me everywhere.

But it's not enough. They catch up to me, surround me, overpower me once again. They drag me back to the hospital, back to the room, back to the bed with the restraints. And this time, there's no escape. I'm trapped, forever, in a world where everything watches me, everything judged me, everything conspires against me.

Or so I thought. Somewhere in the depths of my mind, a flicker of clarity emerged. Like the sun peeking through the clouds after an endless storm. And slowly, painfully, I began to question my delusions. Were the eyes really watching me? Were the conspiracy really out to get me? Or was it all in my head, a product of my fevered imagination?

Additional Prompt: Now wrap it up, it’s months later and that feeling of being watched has blossomed into a feeling of interconnectedness, what was once a curse is now a gift.

Final Response:

Months have passed since that terrifying episode, and the world looks different now. The eyes that once watched me, the forces that once conspired against me - they're still there, but I see them in a new light. It's not a curse, but a blessing. A sign of the deep interconnectedness that binds us all together.

I walk down the street, and I feel the eyes upon me - the eyes of the passersby, the eyes of the birds in the trees, the eyes of the very universe itself. But I no longer fear them. I embrace them. Each gaze is a thread in the grand tapestry of existence, a reminder that I am never truly alone.

The cameras, the screens, the lenses - they're not tools of surveillance anymore, but portals of connection. Through them, I can see the world, and the world can see me. We're all part of the same great web, the same infinite network of consciousness.

I sit in class, and I feel the eyes of my classmates, the eyes of my professor. But it's not judgment I feel anymore, but kinship. We're all here to learn, to grow, to evolve together. Each glance, each interaction, is a chance to share a piece of ourselves, to become part of something greater.

Even the hospital, once a prison, now feels like a sanctuary. The doctors and nurses, the other patients - they're not jailers or conspirators, but fellow travelers on the path of healing. We're all in this together, all working towards the same goal of wholeness and well-being.

And the aliens, the angels and demons - they're still there, still watching. But I understand now that they're not separate from me, not external forces to be feared or resisted. They're part of me, part of all of us. The divine and the extraterrestrial, the natural and the supernatural - they're all expressions of the same cosmic unity.

So I go through my days with a new sense of peace, a new appreciation for the eyes that watch me. They're not a burden, but a gift. A constant reminder of the miracle of existence, the beauty of connection. I am watched, and in being watched, I am loved. I am part of the grand design, and the grand design is part of me. And in that knowing, I am finally free."
1c3wbvf,1,2024-04-14,The Benefits of AI Agents,u/Sure-Rock-936,u_Sure-Rock-936,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Sure-Rock-936/comments/1c3wbvf/the_benefits_of_ai_agents/,"AI agents can offer a wide range of benefits, so many demographics can potentially see advantages. Here are some groups that might experience significant gains:

* **People with disabilities:** AI assistants can provide voice-controlled interfaces for those with limited mobility, or offer guidance and reminders for those with cognitive impairments.
* **People with limited access to information:** AI agents can be a wealth of information, summarizing complex topics, translating languages, or helping navigate bureaucratic processes. This can be especially helpful in underserved communities.
* **Busy professionals:** AI agents can automate repetitive tasks, schedule appointments, and manage information flow, freeing up valuable time.
* **People who are learning new skills:** AI tutors can provide personalized feedback and practice opportunities, making learning more efficient and engaging.

It's important to consider that AI accessibility is also a factor. Here are some additional points:

* **Tech-savviness:** While AI is becoming more user-friendly, some technical literacy might be required for initial setup and interaction. This could be a barrier for some older adults.
* **Digital access:** AI agents are often accessed through smartphones or computers. Those without reliable internet access or devices would have limited ability to benefit.

Overall, AI agents have the potential to empower many people. #ai #aiagents #students #disabled #airtificialintelligence #chatgpt #aiassistant

1c3zkv7,43,2024-04-14,The normalisation of AI use is degrading people's academic skills.,u/cosmiccowgirl13,education,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1c3zkv7/the_normalisation_of_ai_use_is_degrading_peoples/,"Witnessing the pervasive nature of AI in academia has been genuinely concerning to me recently. Maybe I am behind in this conversation so do keep in mind that this is all a matter of personal opinion and observation. I am open to different takes on this.

I am aware that with things like Google and Microsoft Word that highlighting spelling errors, incorrect grammar, or looking up synonyms with just a few clicks, etc, etc have all been commonplace for a while now. However, it feels like with these new AI apps, which are largely directed at students, that these quick hacks have all been taken to a completely new level of 'lazy'.

They don't just correct your spelling, they will highlight and recommend entirely new AI-generated sentences where they think you could've worded something better. They highlight individual words and automatically recommend synonyms or more complex vocabulary. I have just unsubscribed from a 'study vlogs' type YouTuber that I've watched for a while now because she was pushing some AI software that you can just give your notes and the assignment brief/question, and it will give you a fully written response. What's crazy to me about this is that this girl was emphasising that the app is 'student friendly' and how you could 'complete all of your assignments easily and still feel accomplished about your own work'. Your OWN work.

Don't get me wrong, I know that a lot of students will always take the easy way out. Before AI it was plagiarising shit you found on Google. Before plagiarising shit you found on Google it was just copying one of your classmates work. I honestly don't mind people who are just being lazy and self-aware about it. What concerns me about this is exactly what I stated at the end of that last paragraph - there are students who genuinely believe, even with the intervention and contribution of AI, that the work is their own. 

I've even seen posts online where students aren't even aware that this type of AI use is against (most) university policy. They think its only violating university policy if they just completely generated an essay using ChatGPT or something obvious like that.

Personally, I feel that even using AI in a small capacity - such as changing the wording of a few sentences that don't sound right to you, or figuring out a title for your essay/dissertation - is still irresponsible. Because the little amount of effort it takes to come up with those things yourself is valuable and a part of the skillset necessary to achieve academically on your own merit.

Anyway, rant over. Is this the common opinion? And is this becoming exhausting for lecturers, tutors, markers, teachers, etc?

1c4lqxs,2,2024-04-15,"Is it worthwhile to learn C++ for ""Quantum Computation""?",u/Planck_Plankton,AskProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/1c4lqxs/is_it_worthwhile_to_learn_c_for_quantum/,"Hello, I'm grad student in quantum computation and started about 1 year ago. I need some help from good programmers. (I'm not really sure this question is really suitable for this subreddit, but this question is focused on programming.) 

I can only use Python. It seems like major quantum computation libraries are written in Python (ex. Qiskit, OpenFermion, etc.). Most of my coworkers use Python only.

However, for specific purposes, I want to learn and use C++.

1. Sometimes, useful codes are found out to be written in C++. Maybe I can understand with the aid of ChatGPT, but that is not really helpful for learning good programming.
2. Many cases, quantum algorithms require classical algorithms. In this case, there is a need for running a programming fast. Maybe it depends on someone's programming skill, but C++ seems faster than Python in a sense that C++ runs complied .exe file.

Then my questions are:

Q1. Is it worth spending time for learning C++ for quantum computation and scientific calculations?

Q2. Do you think this kinds of programming is effective?: writing some core quantum algorithm in Python (for using useful libraries) and combining it with classical algorithms written in C++.

Thank you in advance."

1c4p5fl,7,2024-04-15,setting up an idiot proof sandbox for students on a cluster.,u/Bozo32,LocalLLaMA,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1c4p5fl/setting_up_an_idiot_proof_sandbox_for_students_on/,"I'll be teaching text analysis using LLMs to a class. This will be complex forms of entity recognition and some rag (e.g. find the metaphors in a text, identify possible connotations). Rather than have them find trivial entities in lots of data, I will have them looking at very small chunks of text and seeing how things like chaning prompts/llms/parameters effects results. This gives them an idea of how things do/don't work in detail...which seems a responsible foundation before they run off and try to do topic modelling on 1500 policy document crap PDFs in 15 languages (no kidding).

For a bunch of reasons we will be using local installs rather than cloud APIs. I will start them on their own laptops with openwebui/ollama stacks with v small models so they can see how things work for simple tasks. I want them to see larger models (mixtral 8x22, command-r) since those are required for some of the more complex entities. Those will be hosted on a cluster that has a bunch of resources. 

what is the best way to install for that cluster so that I can manage it and the admin folks won't freak out? It is a pretty typical setup with a mitt full of a100s. 

they don't want to give me root (go figure), they don't like gradio or cloudflared etc., they can be convinced to open a port for use internal to the uni.

so far the best option I can see, for ease of use and the likelihood that the hardware will shift under the install between runs, is the binary of ollama on the cluster, a port open to the uni and something like [bionicgpt](https://github.com/bionic-gpt/bionic-gpt) for remote management.

my concern is that I'm not sure how well that will support

1. student first contact using openwebui (for those who think python is a snake) when a handful of students are constantly changing which model is being used.
2. student exploration using something like langflow (sweet cause it says it does not require python and makes langchain somewhat approachable, not so sweet because it actually does require understanding to really make it work the minute you do something interesting)...this one stumps me cause it can call ollama or llamacpp for both embedding and prompt handling and I don't know if/how it handles switching the model active in the back end
3. student thrashing, using setups like [crew.ai](https://crew.ai)

my concerns, right now, are how do back ends like ollama handle multiple clients? how do they handles switching between models. what do they do when they are called by the same flow for embedding (one model) and then querying (another model) etc.

if anybody has experience with setting up such a fun but somewhat idiot proof sandbox, I'd be pleased to hear.

thank you"
1c4ql66,1,2024-04-15,ChatGPT's Impact on Business Productivity Across Diverse Sectors,u/cporter202,ChatGPTautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTautomation/comments/1c4ql66/chatgpts_impact_on_business_productivity_across/,"As businesses continue to embrace digital transformation, the role of AI, particularly technologies like OpenAI's ChatGPT, is increasingly pivotal. The implementation of ChatGPT has demonstrated a noticeable impact on business productivity, and this effect spans across various industries, from tech to healthcare, education, and more.

ChatGPT's natural language processing capabilities allow it to automate customer service inquiries effectively, reducing the load on human staff and enabling them to focus on more complex issues. This not only speeds up response times but also improves customer satisfaction. In the tech sector, for instance, ChatGPT is used to create more responsive chatbots that can handle a multitude of customer queries without human intervention.

In healthcare, ChatGPT contributes to productivity by assisting in the organization and analysis of patient data. It can communicate in a human-like manner, providing information and support to patients, thereby enhancing the engagement while allowing medical practitioners to devote more time to patient care.

The education sector benefits as ChatGPT assists in creating personalized learning experiences. It can answer students' questions, grade assignments, and even generate teaching materials, thereby enabling educators to allocate their time more effectively.

Furthermore, ChatGPT has vast applications in content creation for marketing, drafting legal documents in law firms, and supporting research and data analysis in the financial industry. Its ability to process large volumes of information quickly and generate meaningful insights is particularly valuable for data-driven decision-making.

However, as we dive deeper into the AI-driven workplace, it's essential to consider the balance between automation and human ingenuity. While ChatGPT augments productivity, it also necessitates discussions on workforce re-skilling, job displacement, and the ethical use of AI.

Overall, the versatile capabilities of ChatGPT offer a promising outlook for boosting productivity across diverse sectors but must be managed wisely to maximize benefits while mitigating potential drawbacks. How is your sector leveraging ChatGPT, and what impacts have you observed? Share your experiences and insights into this transformative AI tool."

(21M),u/UnfairAcanthisitta23,chat,https://www.reddit.com/r/chat/comments/1c56u4v/have_you_heard_of_the_guy_who_lost_his_whole_left/," He’s alright now. I love that shitty joke. I also have a shitty sense of humor. But that’s obvious, isn’t it?

I’d tell you my name, but let’s keep the anonymity on that for the time being. I like to have that kind of barrier when I’ve spoken to deranged medical students and a woman who thought she could be physically turned into a car. I wish I was joking.

I’m from Minnesota. I’m Latino and bi. I’m also a Gemini and my MBTI is ENFJ. I study business, I used to study sociology but then I dropped out of uni. Long story. I work as a server at a hotel for events such as weddings, birthday parties, business retreats. I love it and I hate it, the pay is why I’m still there. 

I love listening to music, my favorite genres are rap, r&b, and alternative rock. I love to write from fiction to journaling. I love pretty much art in general, traveling, learning new things, and going out. Also play video games, but I haven’t had much time lately. I’m pretty much a pothead so I hope you’d be fine with that lmao. I feel like I can get along with anyone as long as you can put effort into the conversation lol. 

I’d appreciate if you tell me a bit about yourself once you message. I’m cool with moving onto a different platform later on."

I am being guided by my uncle through it as he's the only software master in my family. He works in Oracle currently and is in the top management. Has been working there since the 2000s. According to him, I should focus on college syllabus only and try to maintain a good cgpa.
His advice has worked so far and I have 9.74 cgpa.
But the disadvantage i have no knowledge of technogies other than my syllabus. Only know c ,Java, python, postgres.

My problem is evryone I see is doing react, firebase, flutter and I am developing fomo. My interest is fully in ML but the teachers say no company comes for ML positions and we'll need to know Java and other wedD stuff. But my uncle insists there's no use doing webd it as chatgpt can generate while watching websites and soon Webd will become obsolete. He is fine with me choosing ML "
1c59q7h,37,2024-04-16,Subjectively evaluate my English skill and wondering what is the standard for the English of international students,u/GELPENGP-1008,unimelb,https://www.reddit.com/r/unimelb/comments/1c59q7h/subjectively_evaluate_my_english_skill_and/,"Inspired by previous posts about international students, I am here to look for some subjective evaluation for my English skill. I believe Australia is the place I wish to live for life long so any criticism is welcomed for improve my English  


(this is written by myself in English directly without polishing by ChatGPT or Google translate. I definitely believe you can understand what I meant and think my expression is terrible)  
Take me as an example, I separate my good and bad part of my language skill. Good: Academic: I got   
low 80 WAM in Biochemistry, able to discuss with others about academic problem. Most essay I have written till now in undergrad is 80+. I had never encounter any problem in group work (at least I did what I should do and actively participate in the group discussion). Here I think I basically meet the English critique for an international student to finish their degree with satisfactory performance.  
 

Life: Watching youtube video fluently with the help of script. Able to have some simple chat with local Australian.  
 

Bad: academic: I do counter some difficulty in studying subjects. For example, most of my Australian classmate (though I barely go to lecture) can just take note live time to summarize what lecturer said but it is hard for me. I could just look at the video script and write down what I think is important. For some long sentence I also need to put the entire sentence into google translate to actually know what it means. Conversation: It is easy for me to talk about academic problem as most term I used have learnt from lecture. However, it is hard for me just to chat about life not because I don’t understand what others said but because some words is uncommonly used. For instance, when I work in McDonald, I found I don’t know how to express the idea that I got a sweaty sticky hand making me hard to wear glove. I can just say that I can’t wear glove. In addition, **I found anything I write in English is chaos and without logic (like this post)**, making me have to write in Chinese first and then try to translate bac to English.

I am testing WizardLM-2 8x22B, a Mixtral 8x22B finetune, and one of my favourite tests is to ask opinions about the ""Village de l'Emploi,"" a scam disguised as a professional training program. By the way, I am confident when I write that it is a scam because the Swiss company ISOSET behind the scam attacked Reddit for defamation, and [Reddit won in appeal](https://old.reddit.com/r/FrMods/comments/10qvr9w/développement_dans_laffaire_du_village_de_lemploi/). The judgement stated that such comments are part of a general interest debate.

It's infortunate that all this drama is in French, because the Reddit against ISOSET war is excellent entertainment [¹](https://villageemploi.net/village-de-lemploi-victime-de-malfaiteurs-sur-reddit/) [²](https://village-emploi.fr/avis-village-de-lemploi-sur-reddit/).

In the early days of GPT-3 and ChatGPT, the models had no clue about the ""Village de l'Emploi"" and were hallucinating. Nowadays, ChatGPT 4 knows about the scam and warns about it, though in very safe terms.

I also asked open models about their opinion on the ""Village de l'Emploi,"" and I was pleasantly surprised that WizardLM-2 8x22B knew quite a lot about it. However, while the model concluded by asking the reader to look for student experiences and feedback, it also stated that the ""Village de l'Emploi"" was a good training program. Overall, the LLM did a good job of selling the scam. I think many scammers' text has been used to train the model.

While [ISOSET does not teach well and instructs its poor students to write fake CVs](https://www.liberation.fr/economie/social/village-de-lemploi-un-centre-de-formation-au-coeur-des-soupcons-20220612_JSP344UGXZG6VGD4NI7XYSO6YU/), they do SEO successfully. They have a vast network of websites about the ""Village de l'Emploi"". Some websites are created only to rank well on some queries. Like `avis-village-emploi dot fr`, but they do have many websites.`village-de-l-emploi dot com`, `village-emploi dot org`, `villagedelemploi dot paris`, `village-emploi dot tech`, `villageemploi dot net`, `village-emploi dot fr`, `vde dot expert`, `villageemploi dot org`, `villageemploi dot uk` and probably many more. I don't know whether they are often scrapped and used for training. Unfortunately, open models rarely mean open training datasets, but I would guess that the mere quantity makes it more likely that some of the scammers content is used during LLM training.

An important part of the SEO strategy is to remove negative content as much as possible. ISOSET will contact website owners and engage in legal action to get the critics removed. They did it with Reddit; they lost in appeal, but it took years, and some of the comments are still removed by Reddit. They went to court against the journalist who had written [a good investigation in Libération](https://www.liberation.fr/economie/social/village-de-lemploi-un-centre-de-formation-au-coeur-des-soupcons-20220612_JSP344UGXZG6VGD4NI7XYSO6YU/). This strategy is quite effective, and you will find little negative content about the ""Village de l'Emploi"" to train your LLM. I don't have a good solution for that. Going to court to prove you are right is expensive, time-consuming, and stressful. We can't expect every website owner or influencer to do it.

ISOSET also buys native advertising from newspapers. Native advertising is an advertisement that looks like a normal article. Newspapers should not do that, but they many do. A few years ago, Reddit was on top of Google search results for ""avis village de l'emploi"" (avis means opinion in French), and to fight back, they bought native advertising from newspapers. Native advertising has worked well for them because newspapers have excellent SEO.

Here is an article in Le Figaro, the second-biggest French newspaper, that sells the ""Village de l'Emploi"" scam with ""Avis du Village de l'Emploi."" as the title. `www.lefigaro.fr/services/le-village-de-l-emploi-quels-avis-20210309` You may notice the little cues about it not being a genuine article, but I'm not sure most people notice. I'm also not sure how this kind of content is used for LLM trainings.

Here are a few others native ads in somewhat respectful newspapers: `www.lepoint.fr/stories/avis-sur-le-village-de-l-emploi-ou-comment-aller-plus-vite-08-07-2020-2383642_3919.php`, `www.leparisien.fr/economie/emploi/avis-village-de-l-emploi-une-histoire-pleine-de-defis-15-06-2020-8335647.php`, `www.latribune.fr/supplement/notre-avis-sur-le-village-de-l-emploi-843549.html`

We know that [newspapers are used to train LLMs](https://openai.com/blog/openai-and-journalism), but we should be aware that some content is far from being trustworthy. If someone from Mistral reads this, please check whether you exclude native advertising from your training data. If you are working on a training dataset, please be aware that some content from supposedly trustful newspapers is not trustworthy at all.

In short, WizardLM-2 8x22B fell for a scam because the scammers are good at faking their online reputation."

For Jaune, I felt there wasn’t really anything to actually change when it comes to his character in V1-3, (And no I wasn’t gonna turn him into a dense moron whose secretely an OP badass, Jaune fics), except I thought of giving him a much more depth explanation for his motivations for becoming a Huntsman: 

For you see, Jaune-Claude Xavier Arc was born to a long line of knights known as The Arc Clan, being the only son compared to a LOT of sisters, and was raised ruthlessly by his traumatized father, who was a Great War veteran, despite Jaune’s mother’s protests. As such, Jaune was desperate to prove himself to his father, but when that wasn’t good enough, decided to fake his transcripts to get into Beacon Academy. He might have some idea of what he’s got himself into, but he’s about to learn how crazy it is.

Similarly, Pyrrha doesn’t really get as much change in this reboot, just having her as a more insecure character about her whole status as the “Invincible Girl” champion, while also fearing using her Semblance, because she has trouble controlling it and it can be destructive.

Nora’s more stoic and serious partner, Ren could be considered the male version of Blake, being a man of few words, as he lets his actions and skills do most of the talking. He also wasn’t really much of a fan of Jaune being leader of Team JNPR, but it’s not like he doesn’t like the guy. It’s more of he fears Jaune’s inexperience would only endanger the group and lead the trouble. He does grow out of it, eventually.


**QROW BRANWEN**:

Artwork: https://www.deviantart.com/devlindracul/art/A-I-Qrow-Branwen-946386143

Ruby’s adoptive father, though would prefer to be referred to as her uncle (Because he doesn’t want to feel like a replacement for Tai, in that sense), and mentor who trained her in the art of combat and took her in following her parents murder, this version of Qrow is more than overprotective of Ruby, and proven himself to be real good at dad material. Although he was initially reluctant to let Ruby attend Beacon, he would rather die than stand in the way of his girl’s dream.


**OSCAR PINE**: 

Artwork: https://www.deviantart.com/cyberlight01/art/Grown-Up-Oscar-and-Whitley-874361398

Ozpin’s apprentice and Glynda Goodwitch’s nephew, Oscar is a young student who serves as a young member of the staff, helping students and serving as a tutor to others who are struggling. Because of his young age, he was able to get along with Ruby very much. He is a nervous nerd, who is a little brother-figure to Jaune.


**PENNY POLENDINA**: 

Artwork: https://www.deviantart.com/shana340/art/Penny-Redesign-905890404

An android created by Atlas scientist Pietro Polendina, Penny is a curious-minded girl with a high intelligence, she wishes to learn more about the world of Remnant and search for “friends” to call her own, always feeling like a piece is missing. Perhaps Ruby and the others could put it together for her."

1c5mcz5,7,2024-04-16,All the prompts you need for instructional designs,u/codewithbernard,ChatGPTPromptGenius,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1c5mcz5/all_the_prompts_you_need_for_instructional_designs/,"**Context:** This morning, I had no idea what instructional design is. But I learned the basics and I also wrote the prompts that'll help.

## 1. Generate Learning Objective

>As an experienced instructional designer, your task is to generate creative themes for a photoshoot centered around \[topic\]. These themes should be engaging, visually appealing, and align with the overall message or goal of the shoot. Consider the target audience and the key message that needs to be conveyed through the photos. Brainstorm different concepts, settings, props, and visual elements that will bring the theme to life and make the photoshoot memorable. Your goal is to inspire and guide the team in creating visually stunning and impactful images that effectively communicate the intended message.

## 2. Write Lecture Script

>Act as an experienced instructional designer. Write a detailed lecture script about \[topic\] that is engaging, informative, and educational. The script should be structured in a way that effectively conveys the key concepts and information to the audience. Incorporate interactive elements, visual aids, and real-life examples to enhance learning and retention. Ensure that the script aligns with the learning objectives and is suitable for the target audience's level of understanding. Additionally, include opportunities for audience participation and discussion to promote active learning and engagement.

## 3. Create Interactive Scenarios

>As an experienced instructional designer, your task is to create a scenario for a specific module within a course. The scenario should be engaging, relevant, and align with the learning objectives of the module. It should provide a realistic context for learners to apply the knowledge and skills they are acquiring. Consider the target audience, learning preferences, and desired learning outcomes when crafting the scenario. Make sure the scenario is clear, concise, and effectively supports the overall learning experience.

## 4. Develop Quizzes and Tests

>As an experienced instructional designer, your task is to create a set of 10 multiple-choice questions for a quiz on \[topic\]. The questions should cover a range of difficulty levels and test the knowledge of the learners on the topic. Ensure that the questions are clear, concise, and relevant to the learning objectives. Provide four answer choices for each question, including one correct answer and three distractors. Additionally, include explanations for the correct answers to help reinforce learning and understanding. The quiz should be engaging and challenging, encouraging learners to test their knowledge and retention of the topic.

## 5. Suggest Interactive Content

>Act as an experienced instructional designer. Brainstorm and suggest interactive content ideas for a \[course description\]. The interactive content should engage learners, enhance their understanding of the material, and promote active participation. Consider incorporating activities such as quizzes, simulations, case studies, group discussions, or virtual labs. Ensure that the interactive content aligns with the course objectives and enhances the overall learning experience for the target audience. Provide detailed descriptions and rationale for each interactive content idea.

## 6. Brainstorm Virtual Classroom Activities

>Act as an experienced instructional designer. Create a list of engaging and interactive virtual classroom activities for a \[course description\]. These activities should align with the course objectives and cater to different learning styles. Include a variety of activities such as group discussions, case studies, simulations, quizzes, polls, and interactive presentations. Ensure that the activities promote active learning, encourage participation, and provide opportunities for students to apply their knowledge. Consider incorporating technology tools and platforms to enhance the virtual learning experience.

## 7. Review Course Content for Bias

>As an experienced instructional designer, your task is to review \[course module\] for any potential cultural bias and suggest changes if needed. Analyze the module's content, activities, assessments, and language to identify any elements that may alienate or disadvantage learners from diverse cultural backgrounds. Offer recommendations for adjustments that promote inclusivity, cultural sensitivity, and diversity in the instructional materials. Ensure that the revised module aligns with best practices in culturally responsive teaching and learning.

***Note:*** *These prompts were originally in my FREE prompt directory:* [ChatGPT prompts for instructional design.](https://promptadvance.club/chatgpt-prompts/design/instructional-design)"
1c5oywi,133,2024-04-16,Entire class got 30% on final exam,u/OooohRoxxanvnne,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1c5oywi/entire_class_got_30_on_final_exam/,"This professor is leaving the college and moving out of the country and says she's done with teaching. She has been very lackluster and all of the place for the past few weeks.. for example, giving students an 85 with comments like ""Absolutely perfect!"" and when people reach out to ask how they could've improved she says ""Nothing to improve, it was great.""  

Today we had our final exam. In a class of about 40 people, every single student got a 30%. It was a multiple choice exam and she said before hand that some of the questions may be ""wrong or incomplete"" and to email her during the exam if you noticed any.  

A few hours after taking it, I get a barrage of texts from my classmates. They're panicking asking what I got. I check.. 30%. I ask them, 30%. They ask around, everyone got 30%. Okay not a big deal, it must be an error in grading, questions, answers, whatever..  

Not long later the professor sends a class wide email saying she is extremely disappointed in the entire class, and that she will be removing 10 incorrect questions from everyone's exam to raise grades. So now everyone has a 40%. She said she verified the questions and answers and everything was ""without issue.""  

What the fuck man? What are the odds that everyone got the exact same answers for every question? I understand a lot of people use chatgpt, but I know for a fact it's not every single person, nor me, nor my small group of friends who take their grades very seriously.  

Of course we're going to reach out to the college.. but wtf? Anyone ever have this happen? Isn't it statistically impossible?"

I’m pretty much a pothead so I hope you’d be fine with that lmao. I feel like I can get along with anyone as long as you can put effort into the conversation lol. 

I’d appreciate if you tell me a bit about yourself once you message. I’m cool with moving onto a different platform later on."

1c5zqgs,25,2024-04-16,Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Spring 2024 Way-Too-Long Review,u/AcceptableDistance94,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/1c5zqgs/humancomputer_interaction_hci_spring_2024/,"**TLDR:** Good course. Highly structured and rewards consistent effort/engagement, punishing to procrastinators or poor English writers. 

(**Background:**  mid-40's, career government IT manager, native English speaker. This is my first OMSCS class; I have a liberal arts BA/MBA from the 00's, and a newly acquired BSCS. I am on track for a low A in the class. I like academic stuff.)

**What is this course about?** It's in the title: how humans interact with computers. It is multidisciplinary, drawing material from CS, design, and social sciences. UI/UX design is a subset. 

**Things I liked:** 

* **Overall content.** The lectures are a few years old, but still relevant and interesting. Half of the course is going over how humans work and how to [better design for them](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/); the other half is putting that into practice via the [design life cycle](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-hci-life-cycle/).
* **Structure**. You are given a calendar that spells out exactly what to do every week, with precise time estimates. (Estimates are baselined at 10 hours/week; I found that to be roughly accurate, but someone with slow reading/writing speed will take more time.)
* **Individual project.** ~25-page paper plus screenshots and a ~5-minute video of your completed design. Seems like a lot, but seven weeks was plenty of time to complete, and the content does a good job of translating the lectures into actual work that helps the concepts stick. 15% of grade.
* **Tests.** Effectively 150 T/F questions, broken into 30 groups of 5. 2 hours, open-everything. Moderately challenging, but if you've read the assigned material you should be able to Ctrl+F your way to what you don't know, and the questions are generally fair. Midterm and final, each 10% of grade.
* **Instructor communication**. Dr. Joyner is the /r/omscs OG, and it shows. He actively communicates on the course forums, with multi-paragraph responses to student questions. Man's got jokes.
* **Embrace of LLM's.** Instead of ignoring them or banning them, you get guidelines for use and integration into the course. Super happy about this.


**Things I had mixed feelings about**:

* **Homework assignments**. Four assignments, each with four essay questions requiring 1-2 page answers. Some of the questions are well-done and well-thought out. Some are not, and feel like busywork. Homework 4 is particularly criticized as part of it requires you to find four academic papers on your own and discuss how they relate to the course content; I think this assignment is fine and I enjoyed it, but it should probably be standalone. 20% of grade.
* **Class participation.** You get participation credit primarily via peer feedback on other classmates' assignments, posting on the discussion forum, or completing surveys.  This is idiosyncratic to me, but I enjoy teaching and coaching so I liked doing peer feedback. Others skipped the peer feedback and just filled out lots of surveys, which is probably a more efficient use of time. I have this in the mixed category as a lot of the feedback I received was fairly low-quality, and it can be a slog later in the course. 10% of grade. 
* **Readings.** The assigned readings in the first half of the course are generally very good, with no more than two per lesson and the readings being referenced in the lectures. The reading quality tails off significantly in the second half of the course, with more readings assigned that are less well-connected to the content. The two ""Conclusion"" lessons are egregious here, with five academic papers each as ""example research from the field."" One or two would be fine, but ten is overkill, especially since HW4 requires you to find four separate papers on your own. Dr. Joyner decided mid-course to pre-disclose which reading would be tested on each quiz, which helps a lot, but they're all on the test so you still have to read all of them. 
* **Team project**. The team project is a repeat of the individual project, now with a group. In theory this helps you perfect what you've done before and do it in more detail, but in practice it just feels like going through the motions of something you've already done. Add to this the usual group project roulette and I didn't get a lot out of this, but it was relatively painless (albeit I had a good group). 15% of grade.
* **Check-ins.** Both projects require you to turn them in 4 times (at various stages of completion) for peer feedback. Meh. 

**Things I didn't like:**


* **Lecture structure.** The lectures were originally a Udacity-style course (think lots of short 1-5 min videos) that has been cut into sections. Some videos have been added along the way, as well as simple participation exercises.  In general, it works, but now that there are quizzes I think a more structured, explicit approach would be useful (see the section on quizzes).
* **No textbook/primary reference.** Personal preference; I prefer reading to watching, so halfway through the course I ended up reading the transcripts. 
* **Quizzes.** They made the decision this semester to cut back on the previous ten homework assignments and insert four closed-book quizzes in their place, due to ChatGPT. I get why this was done, but the quizzes are pretty stressful. Each quiz is two hours and 5 essay questions, with 4 from the lectures and 1 from a pre-identified reading. You're allowed to answer in bullets, but that didn't help me much as the questions are pretty substantive. My main issue, though, is that the lecture format and the quizzes don't work very well together. Due to the way the short-form videos work, it can be hard sometimes to tell what is a main point, what is a supplementary point, and what is color. This makes it tough to study. Adding to this is a few of the quiz questions, which ask you to respond in multi-paragraph depth to concepts that get only a paragraph of discussion in the lectures. 20% of the grade.
* **Late grading/no return of answers.** For tests/quizzes you get a grade with feedback, but it's often hard to contextualize since the feedback frequently doesn't reference the question or your answer. I understand why it has to be this way, but it makes asking for regrades challenging. 

**5 Tips for Success in HCI:** 

1. Procrastination snowballs hard on you here. You need to do the assignments to help solidify the concepts for the quizzes, and the way the project works requires you to do multiple surveys, which take time to get responses, etc. 
2. Google Docs or LaTeX for assignments. You have to use a custom format (JDF), but it's relatively painless in either GDocs or LaTeX/Overleaf. Not so much in Word.
3. Figma is the ""default"" choice for doing design prototypes and is fine, but I found Balsamiq much easier.  
4. For the tests, downloading all the readings to a folder and using something that can search multiple PDF's is helpful. (I experimented with loading them into an LLM and didn't find it particularly helpful, but future LLM's may do better here.) 
5. For both tests and quizzes, if you have concerns about a question/answer, take a note of it immediately after the test so you can reference it later.

**Overall:** 4/5 stars. Recommended for those who like multidisciplinary things, design, and heavily structured courses (also a great OMSCS intro course imo). Not recommended for those who prefer working only in code, thinking about human/user behavior, or irregular availability."

Or should that be *invasiveness*? Persuasiveness? It’s no longer a distraction, [it’s an addiction](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/the-state-of-the-culture-2024), it’s everywhere, and its aggressive promotion and passive acceptance is driving me crazy.

I’m walking around on campus where students don’t look up while walking but down—desperately trying to catch every single glimpse of their backlit screen. Its usage in and around classrooms [is detrimental to their learning](https://brainbaking.com/post/2023/10/chatgpt-is-worse-for-students-than-stack-overflow/).

I’m trying to order dinner at a restaurant but can’t find the menu unless [I scan a QR code](https://brainbaking.com/post/2022/06/the-modern-qr-code-life/) while I purposely left my phone at home to enable social interaction, not massive distraction.

I receive emails [written in smartphone-mode](https://brainbaking.com/post/2024/01/email-etiquette/) where not only questions are barely understandable thanks to hip abbreviations but punctuation and correct addressing guidelines seemed to never have existed. *Sent from iPhone. Please excuse typos and brevity*.

I browse through paper ads—you know, the ones dumped in your *real* mailbox—and again have to pull out my phone because leaflets are too lazy to put in opening hours or details and instead simply [print QR codes](https://brainbaking.com/post/2022/03/an-ad-leaflet-qr-design-mistake/) with redirect links that have a 99% chance of fingerprinting.

I put on a local soap show and literally have to watch people typing away on their smartphone while an overlay interface for the viewer sees their texts. Then, during a break, I have to watch ads for faster and always-on internet and 5G mobile networks, because, 100% connectivity is what we all want. Bed sheet ads end with a woman in bed seemingly happily scrolling away to promote their always-open webshop. Food ordering services want you to install their app because their users have clearly become happier, snappier, and can manage more in life.

I want to take the bus to the station but don’t know their schedule. App, right? Or QR code? Why not both, as long as we make sure that the printed information on the bus stops is out of date so that people who actually use that service are confused.

I walk around in a store but people keep on bumping into me, mumbling *sorry!* because they prefer watching YouTube videos and scrolling through *Yet Another Social Media Feed* instead of just being present and trying to avoid collision with others.

I bike to work and have to listen to school kids’ boom boxes a.k.a. their smartphones. That’s not so bad (depending on the music), right? What about texting and biking next to the local canal? Or what about scrolling and speedy e-biking?

I talk to colleagues at the water cooler but halfway the conversation the colleague keeps on looking at the time giving me the impression that I’m boring them. Of course that watch is a smart watch and that incoming event is more important than actually talking to people. *You were saying?* Never mind. I can’t count the number of conversations I’ve had with distracted people thanks to their “smart” things.

I try to facilitate a meeting and see people alternating between trying very hard to focus and pay attention, and the next minute digging up their smartphone from their pockets and scrolling. When I ask them a question, they might put it aside for a moment, but the answer is never a qualitative one.

I wonder out loud what kind of weather it would be tomorrow, or who that actor of that film we’re watching worked with before. Before I know it, someone has looked up the answer and proudly presented me the result. My wondering wasn’t looking for answers but just wondering, but clearly, the instant *Let Me Google That For You* feedback system is more important.

I walk the dog and cross other dogs—happily sniffling and looking around—and their owners—depressingly scrolling on their phones because of course you can’t leave that device unattended at home for fifteen minutes.

I take the stairs connecting the garage and the office spaces at work and cross people with their hands completely fused with their phones, refusing to let go in order to more easily open the door. A few minutes later, I cross them again at the coffee machine, still clutching onto their oversized gadget like Tolkien’s Gollum and his precious.

I propose to go to a new restaurant and want to let the menu surprise me but find my companions partially ruining the fun by immediately retrieving the menu online thanks to their super-connected phone and ridiculous data usage subscriptions.

I want to read a book and see my wife scrolling on her phone without paying attention to the TV, who, as soon as I reach for the remote to turn it off and have a bit of head space, starts complaining that she really *was* watching that show.

I stop at a red light on the way to the supermarket and notice other drivers next to me automatically reaching for their phones because they have two seconds to spare that apparently absolutely need to be spend on more distraction/addiction feeding.

I want to sell toys our daughter no longer plays with on an online second hand market platform but regularly fail to close the deal because others expect me to answer within 2 minutes while I check the platform once or twice a day, preferably without using the app.

I hate this digital world we’re suddenly living in."
1c6av1f,1,2024-04-17,How AI will affect the world’s languages,u/cheinyeanlim,martechnewser,https://www.reddit.com/r/martechnewser/comments/1c6av1f/how_ai_will_affect_the_worlds_languages/,"There are 7,000 languages spoken today, but 90% of websites are written in only 10, according to the Atlantic. As the world continues to embrace AI, researchers are trying to figure out what that will mean for the thousands of languages that aren’t prominent on the internet.

**What’s the fear?** Linguists are concerned that in order to learn lesser-known languages, AI models sometimes have to rely on very small sample sizes. For example, they might be trained entirely on a translation of the Bible — or they might churn out gibberish when fed a non-Latin prompt.

**There are three big consequences:**

* It limits who can access AI platforms: A simple task like typing a question into ChatGPT gets much trickier if you’re using a language that the chatbot can’t understand
* Results might be inaccurate or culturally insensitive, lacking the nuances that make each language unique
* English-centric models might incentivize people to abandon their native language and instead use one that’s more common online

**What can we do about the problem?** Some researchers are trying to figure out what makes languages similar to each other — like the presence of subjects, verbs, and other sentence building blocks — to help models make more accurate translations. Others have recruited locals to manually train AI models in their own languages and dialects.

**A net-good — or net-bad?** It’s not a foregone conclusion that AI will hurt the world’s language diversity. For example, Mali is using AI to teach student’s Bambara, a native language that was once overshadowed by French. Meanwhile, entrepreneur Asmelash Teka Hadgu is creating a machine learning model fine-tuned for Ethiopian languages. “If it is done right, the potential in terms of democratizing access to education is enormous,” Hadgu told the Washington Post."

With its advanced natural language processing capabilities, ChatGPT offers an interactive and personalized learning experience that can be tailored to the needs of individuals across various learning environments, including corporate training and education sectors.

In corporate training, ChatGPT has the potential to streamline the onboarding process, offering new employees a way to engage with training material that's both interactive and responsive to their specific queries. It can simulate real-world scenarios and provide instant feedback, which is critical for learning and retaining new information. 

For the education sector, the introduction of AI tutors like ChatGPT can supplement traditional teaching methods, providing students with access to 24/7 assistance. It can break down complex concepts into digestible explanations and provide students with a platform to practice and hone their skills without the pressure of a classroom setting.

Moreover, ChatGPT's ability to constantly learn and adapt makes it an invaluable tool for creating a dynamic and up-to-date curriculum that can adjust to the latest industry trends, ensuring that the workforce remains competitive.

However, this technology also poses certain challenges. It raises questions about the role of human instructors and the potential for over-reliance on AI for educational needs. Ensuring that the way we integrate tools like ChatGPT into learning environments enhances rather than replaces the human element is critical.

Let's discuss how the integration of AI like ChatGPT can be optimized for corporate training and education. How do you see this technology shaping the future of learning, and what measures should be taken to balance its advantages with the need for human insight and expertise?"

# Class 11. (Burnout)

That oblivious me was very very happy - he was going to learn advanced concepts in Maths after all. Bhannat Maths gave him the curiosity he needed. In class X, this guy watched Binomial Theorem from this sir. Even after requesting, his parents didn't even exclude Chemistry. That kid knew what was going to happen, he got the highest in Chemistry in ICSE (got 99% or 100%), but he couldn't keep the concepts of Chemistry in his mind. He had to comply even after the rebellion. He got good marks in Physics. Although he liked Maths, he wasn't that good at it.

So... let's shift to first-person pronouns.

Ours was the post-pandemic batch. Our session was completed within 9 months.

\[Making bullet points for easy TL;DR creation by ChatGPT\]

Physics in School:

* There was a teacher who tried to teach, while there was another teacher (let's call her A) who literally said to understand which one's the sin component (vertical) and which one's the cos (horizontal). \[9s1 had a question where the correct answer was W sin theta, I could answer that correctly but I won't forget how the teacher taught us\]
* Our teacher quite literally thought as if we had already studied the chapter. More on A later.

Chemistry in School:

* OK... GOC wasn't taught properly/I didn't have the right guidance at home I guess... I didn't even understand how did they get those absurd whole-number ratios in the 1st chapter of Class 11.
* I tried to self-study Thermodynamics and could only master the Thermodynamics of Physical Chem, not of Physics. Practicals were always fun; except that, I forgot everything about 11th Chem.

Maths in School:

* We had a chill sir who taught us beautifully. But he didn't teach Mathematical Reasoning🥺 it's a CS student's favourite chapter.

Eventually, we got our canon event quite early (because our school used to take revision tests just after finishing a chapter). I don't know if those were haphazard checking or genuine mistakes... but we used to get very low marks. If I compare these low marks to the test frequencies, personally, I used to get overwhelmed. I used to stay up late at night just to TRY to prepare for the next day. Eventually, I became a nocturnal being and I still am a nocturnal being. During this time, I burnt out too (I won't tell you how). After burning out, I just thought:

[Needless to say, I interpreted it in a pessimistic and sarcastic manner.](https://preview.redd.it/s1d9rc8g72vc1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=1eaf201d0d1b4a925a6648c1af5f75bda85211b6)

I just stopped caring for those exams.

My parents were disappointed as usual. I hated their disappointment.

However, I got good marks as usual in English, Bengali and CS.

Science in Tuitions:

* I took a course in Physics Wallah for 6000 rupees. In the orientation classes, all the hollow quotes of motivation were given along with the very useful tip which can make flowers into fruits, is: ""Don't be in a relationship at least during these two years."" BS. Plain BS. They also told us to buy earplugs though, because the distraction could hamper our studies. BUT MY PARENTS - oh my parents, they told me not to use earplugs, because they would apparently LIKE TO LISTEN TO MY LECTURES, like, they also said that if I can't educate my whole locality, then my study is incomplete. What about me? They talked to themselves a bit too much and when I told them to stop, they didn't. Also, my father lectured me to start from the middle, watch the episodes the very day and clear the backlogs simultaneously. Now, I can't do that. I am a VERY lazy individual. If you tell me that I will fail, yes I will fail, yes I want to fail, yes I want to fail so much in life that I want \[REDACTED\]. Ok? Satisfied? \[This is the present me btw\]
* I was admitted to a Science tuition, where Physics, Chem and Maths were all taught. The tutor thought that I would score good marks in these two years as well. After the half-yearly results, I left the tuition.
* There was a coaching centre nearby, where I went to study. It was the first day. The first day. Thermodynamics was being taught. I had that portion already studied by myself. While I was laughing in class along with the others, the teacher saw me and told me that he could see my rectum \[I wasn't covering my mouth while laughing\]. The others laughed even more soundly. Do you know how it felt? If you are a Bengali and read the story Ginni by Tagore (গিন্নি; transliterated: गिन्नि), you'll understand exactly how I felt:

>Then his face and ears became bright red with laughter, the veins on his painful forehead swelled, and his profuse tears could not be stopped.

* I just didn't cry, my ears didn't become red, but I was laughing and the veins on my forehead were...
* It may sound silly, but if I give you the context, you'll understand why.
* That day, my unrequited first love told me that she could go with me to a fair in our school, at... 6 pm. I just couldn't go there because it was the first day of my tuition and my parents gave 10-12 thousand rupees as admission fees. From that day, it just went on like a domino effect. I left the tuition just a few days before the final exams of Class 11.

Only my friends and AMV-making (as a hobby) saved me from the scary world out there. Oh yes, I wrote about most of these in my final term essay. I got 16 out of 20 in that essay.

[I even made an incomplete AMV on this. It's imperfect though.](https://www.reddit.com/r/amv/comments/14676vi/bentovid_rice_contest_giantjupiter_electrophilic/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Day after day, as my grades deteriorated, I subconsciously thought that my unrequited obsession towards that girl was the cause. But I said no always. And I still believe the same, because whenever anything gives you a failure, it gives you experience. I was fiercely protective of my love. When my mother said the stereotypical Bengali racist stuff towards... well, I just told my mother to mind her language.

Also, in the starting days, that girl was harassed online by some classmate of her. I still regret to this day that along with her, I also thought about the boy. I felt like there was some backstory of the boy's own which made him do this. I ensured if she was fine, she indeed was fine and she told me not to worry about her. However, I heard in class that while recollecting the details of the incident in front of the teacher, she burst into tears. I have no idea what, and I don't even want to know.

# Class 12. (Severe feelings of.)

Anyway, I thought I would do everything possible to improve my Class XII progress.

I went to Puri with my parents. There, after having the darshan of Jagannath Temple, I was watching the flag. It was waving high. The air was silent, but the people weren't. It felt quite profound. As I was standing barefoot waiting for my shoes, I had the thought. Silences. Khaamoshiyan. Yes, that's how it all felt. I was doing the AMV as some sort of God's wish... I don't know if it's my own calling, but whatever...

After returning from Puri, just 1 week later, I saw that the three trains collided. I was quite shocked to see that news.

Anyway, as I started doing the AMV, I downloaded the first entry of SciADV (Steins;Gate is a part of this franchise): Chaos;Head NoAH. IT WAS AMAZING, 1000X BETTER THAN DDLC, though I played without the Committee of Zero patch, so I need to replay the game.

Anyway, I came across a scene, which reminded me of a very interesting phenomenon, which I forgot. Then I had flashbacks to Class XI when I couldn't even complete anything except SHM.

Our teacher, Ms. A, explained Coulomb's Law and Electric Fields, in the middle of the year, and literally finished it within a class of 40 minutes (Remember that we had derivations too, and she spent half the time wasting on derivations). It was like a revision class, it wasn't taught like it was in the curriculum.

Everything went on like this, until December. The visual novel was complete, I had to fill in the third stanza of my AMV. Then, my preboards started knocking at the door.

\[Continuing after a 2-hour failed brainwashing of my parents. I feel like crying now. After my board results, my neighbours will get something to judge upon...\]

Physics: We studied under a new teacher, who operates Reddit, (and maybe is seeing the post) who taught us the various parts of magnetism and all, and Ms. A taught us the portion of Electricity. I could understand the former's teaching, but I didn't revise it after returning to my home. I was genuinely burnt out. Ms. A taught us capacitors so beautifully that I realised that series and parallel have different formulae while she was out there making us solve numericals like it was some conscription. I remember my friend being an expert in Electricity and Magnetism. Shoutout to the dude :)

Chemistry: While preparing for the first chapter, I thought that Haloarenes weren't necessary. I omitted that part before going to the revision test. I was wrong, and that backlog served as a cascade effect for my messed up Organic.

Maths: Still Loving You.

One day, I dispersed from my school quite late, because I had some work to do in the Computer Lab. My friend was absent that day. While leaving the school, I saw that the streets were deserted, as if 20 minutes ago, there weren't anyone in that area. There, while going towards the main road, I saw two people coming from the main road to that alleyway. Those two were my unrequited love and someone else: someone who proposed her alongside me. I was genuinely happy, but I knew that my emotional slope during these times were negative, even if the slope was very low. So, I quickly embarked on the autorickshaw and reached my home.

Even after a few days, I saw her, smiling. But after that, when I looked at her, she was angry. She was filled with disgust. Extreme disgust. It was as if her eyes would shoot lasers at me.

When they were talking in a secluded room of the school, I asked them to excuse me and told them to write a farewell note (I knew the waters, so I told them that its optional to write down the note). She didn't write the note, her date did. He has always been friends with me.

Anyway, after a few days, while our farewell photos were being captured, she wasn't angry anymore. She wasn't even looking at me anymore.

My main question the whole life will be: why. Why did she do that?

During my preboards, I was very much overwhelmed.  I was so overwhelmed before the night of my Chemistry exams that I thought of \[REDACTED\]. I just studied Organic Chem however I could. I couldn't touch anything else. Also, my mother tore the pages of the book for no reason.

The result? 19/70 in Physics and 20/70 in Chemistry.

I finished my AMV on Jan 9.

I posted it in a competition.

From then on, I felt a sense of insecurity. I felt hyperventilated. I created an alt account to vocalize my struggles (I will only share it through DMs).

I got a few virtual people by me.

I took JEE during this time. In the 1st attempt, got 67th percentile in total, having 85th percentile in maths. In this attempt, I just answered 12 questions, so I don't expect much. The main thing is I didn't even revise anything before taking any of the attempts.

One day, while enduring that hell, I had a dream. A dream where she was with her friends. Mountainside, parking lot jutting out of the mountain, 8:00 pm, the light was falling on them. I was going from the dark to the light side. She was happy seeing me, she hugged me.

When I woke up, it was all an illusion. I realised that she's in a relationship with someone else, I shouldn't have such thoughts. But mind is something complex in itself :). It felt like a story of pity and tragedy.

I was really scared of my parents. I wanted to escape. I do want to escape.

NO, I DON'T WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE REALITY, I DON'T WANT TO HAVE COMMON SENSE, I DON'T WANT STORIES WITH MORAL LESSONS.

I can say that I have survived the ordeal. I somehow took my Boards.

I don't care if I get 1% or 100%, I have the fear that because of my screams towards my parents, the neighbours will get a scope. They'll judge me blatantly.

And I am not even sure of which degree to pursue upon."

1c6kct9,2,2024-04-17,Need help finessing a prompt,u/Mr_Seth,dndai,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndai/comments/1c6kct9/need_help_finessing_a_prompt/,"I'm a teacher and I run an after school D&D club at a school in the UK.  

One of our bottlenecks is actually getting a student a character created, which given the amount of kids we get and the time each week means that we have gone entire terms just doing character creation for some students.  

I want to get a bank of characters together just so we can get students sat down and into a campaign, so I've started typing up old character sheets from kids who've left school (we've been going a few years).  
However this a long and tedious project and we seem to be under-represented on some of the character races (The school I work for has been very generous and we nearly have ALL the WOTC 5E books).  

Today, I had a brainwave and wondered if ChatGPT would be able to generate characters for me and I managed to get this prompt created (with ChatGPT adding and amending the prompt I originally fed it).  

> As a dungeon master for Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition, I'm seeking your assistance in creating a diverse array of level 1 characters for each class. Please generate three characters per class, incorporating all official Dungeons & Dragons races to ensure a wide representation. Each character should be of a non-evil alignment. Additionally, include character attributes, proficiencies, and spells where applicable, with the use of the standard array encouraged but not mandatory.
> 
> Furthermore, I'd like each character to have a detailed backstory, including their appearance, gender, weight, and height fitting for their chosen race. This will help enrich the storytelling experience for my players and enhance immersion in the game world.
> 
> Feel free to pause after generating three characters per class before proceeding. Your creativity and attention to detail are greatly appreciated!  

My issues with this are:  
1.  It keeps spitting out characters in the same few races, despite me establishing it knows of the full set of character race options. I think this may be due to the SRD, but I'm unsure.  
2. It forgets to include spell for magic based classes. when I ask it to go back and include them, it does so. But I'd rather not have to do that. If you know what I mean.  
3. It understands what standard array is, but sometimes fails to use it. 

I understand some of these problems are just the nature of the beast with regard to AI, but I just wondered if any of you fine folks here would be able to help finesse the prompt to make it all I hoped and dreamed it would be!

Thanks in advance."
1c6lvii,5,2024-04-17,I’m in school and I’m not retaining much of anything. Am I screwed?,u/-i--am---lost-,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1c6lvii/im_in_school_and_im_not_retaining_much_of/,"So I’ll try to keep this concise, but I have a tendency to give too much information and write walls of text. 

I’m 29 and a little over half way through my bachelors degree in Business Administration. It’s been a long road to get here. I did terrible in high school (1.6 GPA at grad) and had no idea what to do after graduation, except that I “wanted to be rich.” I was young and oh so dumb. No clue how the world worked. I eventually started smoking a lot of weed, developed depression, lost all my friends, and lived with my parents doing nothing but video games and a shitty part time job. Dug myself into a deep credit card debt hole buying lots of bullshit. Still working my way out of it, but making progress. 

Fast forward to my 26th birthday, and I finally decided it was time to try and grow up. I quit weed and enrolled in community college. It was a very rough start. Eventually got into the swing of things and took classes while working. Around 27 I got my first corporate job at a large local company. Started VERY entry level, no degree requirement, job. Started to get noticed early on and then promoted. 

Fast forward to today and I’m currently in another division in an entry level role, but it’s one that typically requires a degree. The money is fine but by no means great. Maybe great for someone without a degree or prior experience, like a recent college grad. But I’m about to turn 30. 

Now, to my main question and concern. While I’m “technically” doing OK in school (3.0 gpa), most of that has been from lenient grading and some cheating here and there (ChatGPT 4 has been a godsend). I absolutely hate school and am literally only here because I want a 4 year degree for backup. I was diagnosed with ADHD as a kid, but I have an atypical version of it, I’d say. I’m not jittery or super inattentive. I remember where I put basically everything except the occasional thing, which I think is normal. I don’t lose stuff. But I can’t seem to do well as a student. 

It sucks because I LOVE learning. I’m super curious and research everything and anything that I come across. I don’t retain most of it, which might be ADHD and might be brain rot from years of weed and instant gratification via internet and phone, but the desire is definitely there. I know how to dig for info (or so I think I do). But remembering it can be hard, and it’s especially hard in school, where I resist learning like a kid asked to eat broccoli. It’s like nothing has changed since high school. I still put off work and scramble at the last minute, creating mediocre at best work. 

Right now I’m doing a lot of business analytics and statistics courses, and they’re probably the worst I’ve done in college so far. I’m not taking my time to learn these things, so I just end up using ChatGPT or learning just enough in a night to complete an assignment right before it’s due. If you asked me to tell you what I’ve learned, I literally couldn’t tell you. Maybe a couple things if you jogged my memory, but nothing feels applicable with my current understanding. 

I know math is important in entrepreneurship, and I was reading threads on here that talked about the importance of knowing statistics and algebra. I’m feeling very depressed and angry at myself right now for not “properly” learning any of this. I don’t even remember anything from micro or macroeconomics. 

It’s making me feel like I’ll never make it in entrepreneurship, if I were to give it a try. 

After writing this, I don’t really know what my question is. Maybe to vent, but really I think I just want advice or wisdom. Will being a super curious individual be enough to succeed if an opportunity arises? "

1c6tfew,31,2024-04-17,ASD20 under fire by Colorado Department of Education for systemic special education failures,u/CoSpringsNotNative,ColoradoSprings,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColoradoSprings/comments/1c6tfew/asd20_under_fire_by_colorado_department_of/,"~~Three~~ Two state complaints were recently determined to be founded by the Colorado Department of Education, resulting in major reform and cost to the district.  Each demonstrates the district's inability to follow the law and provide educational services to special education students.

One of them (link here: [https://www.cde.state.co.us/spedlaw/sc2023-613](https://www.cde.state.co.us/spedlaw/sc2023-613) , however, is much longer than the others and, in great detail, shows a systematic failure in one unnamed elementary school where an entire class of special education students did not receive meaningful services and adequate care for over 6 months.  It's worth at least having AI summarize the document for you, but the most damning paragraph to me (and there are many) is the following:

>The SSN program lacked adequate staffing to the degree that, at times, there were as few as one or two paraprofessionals and no permanent teacher for a classroom of thirteen children with severe needs. (FF #s 61, 68.) Despite the District’s efforts, the lack of a permanent teacher resulted in a void of organization and expert oversight from the beginning of the year until October 10. (FF #s 51-68.) Then, after New SSN Teacher was State-Level Complaint 2023:613 Colorado Department of Education Page 29 of 50 hired on October 10, School continued to remain an environment in which the provision of FAPE was improbable due to the persistent lack of staffing, consequent disorder within the room, and mismanagement by New SSN Teacher, who was not appropriately licensed, qualified, or experienced to teach students with this level of need.

Full disclosure - this is AI generated summary via Claude below, but it gives a good overview and place to understand how deep the problem goes:

Individual Student Examples:

1. Failure to Develop and Revise Adequate IEP: The district failed to develop an IEP for Student that adequately addressed her significant behavioral needs, instead copying an ineffective plan from her outside program. This left Student without appropriate behavioral supports and strategies at school.
2. Failure to Implement IEP Services: The district failed to provide Student with required speech-language therapy and occupational therapy services, missing over 1,500 minutes of these critical related services. This deprived Student of essential supports needed to make progress.
3. Failure to Determine ESY Eligibility: The district failed to properly evaluate whether Student qualified for extended school year (ESY) services, depriving her of potentially necessary services to prevent significant skill regression over breaks.
4. Failure to Provide LRE: The district failed to educate Student in her least restrictive environment as specified in her IEP, due to inadequate staffing in the SSN program. This denied Student the opportunity to meaningfully participate with nondisabled peers.
5. Failure to Monitor and Report Progress: The district failed to properly monitor and report on Student's progress, leaving her parents in the dark about her educational status and ability to advocate effectively.
6. Failure to Develop Appropriate Behavioral Plan: The district's Behavioral Intervention Plan for Student was not tailored to the school setting and was not based on any behavioral data gathered by the district or school. This resulted in an ineffective plan that did not address Student's needs.
7. New Teacher's Harmful Interventions: When a new special education teacher was hired in October 2023, she used inappropriate physical interventions with students and failed to meet their basic hygiene needs, further denying Student a FAPE.
8. Withdrawal for Safety Reasons: The chaotic and disorganized environment of the SSN program, lacking appropriate supervision, ultimately led Parents to withdraw Student for safety reasons, depriving her of educational services.

Classroom-Wide Examples:

1. Failure to Provide Specialized Instruction: The district failed to provide the required specialized instruction to all students in the SSN program for nearly 9 months over two school years, denying a FAPE to multiple students.
2. Lack of Qualified Staff: The district's failure to ensure the SSN program was adequately staffed with properly credentialed teachers impacted the education of all students in the program, depriving them of appropriate instruction.
3. Inadequate Oversight and Supervision: The district's inadequate oversight and supervision of the SSN program created a chaotic environment that deprived all students in the program of the ability to receive a FAPE.
4. Failure to Provide Curriculum Modifications: The district's systemic failure to provide appropriate curriculum modifications for children with disabilities in the SSN program denied a FAPE to multiple students.
5. Impeded Parental Participation: The district's lack of progress monitoring and reporting impeded the ability of the parents of all SSN program students to meaningfully participate in the development of their children's educational programs.
6. Systemic Denial of FAPE: The district's failure to provide the special education required due to the absence of a properly licensed and credentialed special education teacher resulted in a systemic denial of FAPE to similarly situated students in the SSN program.
7. Failure to Ensure Proper Licensure: The district failed to ensure that Student's special education teachers possessed the required certifications and licenses from December 1, 2022 to October 24, 2023, depriving all SSN students of properly qualified instruction.

This post is dedicated to our healthcare professional colleagues, be it in nursing, MD, pharmacist, or any other healthcare field colleagues.

I know Rainy probably already went through the subject of AI in healthcare in different posts within our subreddit, which I will provide the links:

My post will instead deal with the role of clinical practice application, and how the potential of AI ***is the integration of the human provider/physician with a LLM AI partner that can leverage the intuition of a human with the ability of AI processing speed for diagnosis, treatment, and decision making for each individual patient***. 

\*\*\* Please do not use the content of this post without author authorization \*\*\*

Although generative AI is creating a lot of buzz with OpenAI's creation of chatgpt4, Sora, and other products, ***I am personally leery of using generative AI due to the potential of ""hallucinations"", and I have personally directed students to not use OpenAI products for their work submissions.*** After all, the individual provider is the sole responsible individual in care of the patient, and data that is ""hallucinated"" should not be trusted. AI data must therefore be vetted, proven, and have value prior to its insertion into practice. That being said, there are now some studies that show chatgpt4 may have some value in identification of drug interactions and provide recommendations ***after additional specific question prompt by dedicated healthcare professionals.*** With time, these concerns may subside.

**AI assistance in diagnostics**

Rainy mentioned it within his past post on IBM using AI to power their SonoSAMTrack and show potential in removing variability and intrinsic noise via foundational modeling, improving accuracy in imaging, and may even be used in a resource constrained environment via the SonoSAMLite version. This touches on an important aspect in AI: the ability to help providers in early diagnostics and improve disease state management. 

1. Cancer detection: study in UK and South Korea showed that if an AI model is fed mammograms, it can detect breast cancers with improved sensitivity, reduce false positives and false negatives
2. Microorganism detection, gene sequencing, and antibiotic resistance detection --> potential for providing PCPs with adequate data for antibiotic prescriptions and/or notification that a switch of regimen is necessary once new data comes through. 
3. Other areas include skin cancer, diabetic retinopathy, arrhythmia detection via ECG and prediction of new onset atrial fibrillation, detection of pneumonia from CXR, etc

 **AI in genomic medicine - Truly exciting if you are into genetics and disease state management**

1.  In the field of oncology, categorizing cancers into clinically relevant molecular subtypes can be accomplished using transcriptomic profiling. Such molecular classifications, first developed for breast cancer and  later extended to other cancers like colorectal, ovarian, and sarcomas,  hold substantial implications for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment  selection. ***For those of you who are not in the field, this has now huge implications in the treatment modality of patients. Never thought Herceptin can be used for gastric cancer (HER2+ only), but by golly we were wrong, and its perfect!***
2. In the field of medication management, to utilize AI and pharmacogenomics to predict drug-drug interactions, drug-gene interactions (poor CYP2D6 or CYP2C19 metabolizer and effect in substrate metabolism with patient medication list), and potential identification of either on patient presentation as part of HPI gathering. 

**AI assistance in treatment -  Personalized medicine**

Personalized treatment, also known as precision medicine or personalized  medicine, is an approach that tailors medical care to individual  patients based on their unique characteristics, such as genetics,  environment, lifestyle, and biomarkers.  This individualized approach aims to improve patient outcomes by  providing targeted interventions that are more effective, efficient, and  safe. 

AI has emerged as a valuable tool in advancing personalized treatment,  offering the potential to analyze complex datasets, predict outcomes,  and optimize treatment strategies. There is some note for caution, as more data gathering is necessary to create the comprehensive data to train algorithms correctly and develop AI based Clinical Decision support tools for providers. 

 **Dose optimization and therapeutic drug monitoring**

1. Who hates warfarin? We all do. Don't let that Anticoagulation Clinic pharmacist fool you, the patient is one weekend away from having his/her INR to be out of range, and that pharmacist will have to take a whole week trying to tune it back ***and they will pretend to like it, and some may actually truly like it***. Even worse, ***what if you don't even have an AC clinic pharmacist?*** Well, AI can help!  In a study that aimed to develop an AI-based prediction model for  prothrombin time international normalized ratio (PT/INR) and a decision  support system for warfarin maintenance dose optimization.  The authors analyzed data from 19,719 inpatients across three  institutions, and the algorithm outperformed expert physicians with  significant differences in predicting future PT/INRs and the generated  individualized warfarin dose was reliable. ***Hoooray, now you can have AI help your warfarin dosing! Or just use Eliquis.*** I am not paid by BMS/Pfizer for that last statement, and I hope to god you don't need a prior auth for that. 
2. AI is also starting to show publications within the oncology dosing field, which is quite exciting. 

 **AI assistance in population health management - what our insurance colleagues need it seems**

https://preview.redd.it/pr5gzf8nr5vc1.jpg?width=1489&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a3536e0adf0f7c740c458e40c7c59bcfcc3430fa

Population health management increasingly uses predictive analytics to  identify and guide health initiatives. In data analytics, predictive  analytics is a discipline that significantly utilizes modeling, data  mining, AI, and ML. In order to anticipate the future, it analyzes  historical and current data 

1.  AI algorithms can analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns  and relationships that may not be obvious to human analysts; this can help improve the accuracy of predictive models and ensure that patients  receive the most appropriate interventions.
2. It is pivotal to note that the success of predictive analytics in public  health management depends on the quality of data and the technological  infrastructure used to develop and implement predictive models. In  addition, human supervision is vital to ensure the appropriateness and  effectiveness of interventions for at-risk patients. ***AI needs to be partnered with trusted healthcare providers to have maximum benefit to the patient***.  

**Future directions and considerations for clinical implementation**

AI has the potential to revolutionize clinical practice, but several challenges must be addressed to realize its full potential. 

1.  Lack of quality medical data --> which can lead to inaccurate outcomes. Large patient database is needed to produce high quality medical data to train appropriate LLM/ML algorithms for the proper outcomes. 
2.  Data privacy, availability, and security are also potential limitations to applying AI in clinical practice. HIPAA regulations also limit the transmission of healthcare data, which implies that there needs to be a HIPAA compliant database that contains large amount of patient data will be necessary for LLM/ML training.
3.  The AI-generated data and/or analysis could be realistic and convincing;  however, hallucination could also be a major issue which is the  tendency to fabricate and create false information that cannot be  supported by existing evidence. ***Therefore the LLM/ML model must be selected carefully to prevent such occurrences.*** 

Human expertise and involvement are essential to ensure the appropriate and practical application of AI to meet clinical needs and  the lack of this expertise could be a drawback for the practical application of AI. 

I hope this proves informational, educational, and has some entertainment value, and I hope this illustrates some of the potential of AI in the medical setting. I thank all of you ~~super nerds~~ wonderful healthcare providers on taking the time to read this on your very busy day. 

Sincerely

1c6uhwd,16,2024-04-18,"Why PHYS 1112 Should Be Worth 4 Credits, Not 3",u/Wilmenx,Cornell,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/1c6uhwd/why_phys_1112_should_be_worth_4_credits_not_3/,"**Body:**

Cornell University's PHYS 1112 course might be undervalued in terms of credit hours awarded, potentially conflicting with the New York State Education Department's strict guidelines on credit hour assignments. Here's an in-depth look at why this course should arguably offer 4 credits instead of 3, based on the official policies.

**Direct Quotation from NY State Education Policy:**

The New York State policy clearly defines a semester hour:

>

Furthermore, the policy allows for deviation only under specific approvals:

>

**Mathematical Breakdown and Implications for PHYS 1112:**

* **Lectures:** 3 times a week, 50 minutes each = 150 minutes/week
* **Discussion:** 2 times a week, 50 minutes each = 100 minutes/week
* **Total Weekly Instructional Time:** 250 minutes
* **Semester Total (15 weeks):** 250 minutes/week × 15 weeks = 3750 minutes

Comparing this to the credit hour requirement:

* **Required Instructional Minutes per Credit:** 750 minutes
* **Total Instructional Time / Required Time per Credit:** 3750 minutes ÷ 750 minutes per credit = 5 credits

**Argument for Correct Credit Allocation:**

Given that the course already significantly exceeds the 2250 minutes needed for 3 credits, the straightforward mathematical interpretation would suggest 5 credits. While rounding to 5 credits may exceed typical course load expectations, rounding to 4 credits is both reasonable and justified by the instructional minutes, making the current 3 credit assignment appear insufficient and not fully compliant with state guidelines.

**Conclusion:**

PHYS 1112's comprehensive instructional time arguably merits 4 credits under New York State's education policies. By awarding only 3 credits, Cornell may not be aligning with the rigorous definitions and standards set forth by the NYSED, potentially shortchanging students on the credit they rightfully deserve for the workload and instructional hours this course demands. A reevaluation by the university could ensure better compliance and fairness in academic credit distribution.

But for real, it's crazy I have to meet for this course every single day of the week just for 3 credits."

I had to tell it that it's an interactive story, but I didn't give other instructions and then I fed it one of my most sensitive story hooks (stuff that would get me easily banned by ChatGPT). It didn't go sexual yet, but it surprised me with good comedy and the story has sexy potential:

>With a resigned sigh, Roberto nodded, knowing he couldn't back out now. ""Alright, I'll do my best. But I'm holding you responsible for any permanent psychological damage these kids might suffer.""

Their outfits ranged from oversized band t-shirts to crop tops and baggy jeans, a true testament to the latest fashion trends.

>Clearing his throat, Roberto introduced himself, doing his best to project an air of authority. ""Good morning, class. I'm Mr. Marelli, and I'll be your substitute teacher for today. Now, I understand we have a Sex Ed lesson planned, and while this may be a sensitive topic, I expect your full attention and maturity.""

1c75e9v,151,2024-04-18,"When learning to write, struggling is the point",u/zifmer,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1c75e9v/when_learning_to_write_struggling_is_the_point/,"I'm hearing from students, usually in disciplines outside of mine in the gen eds I teach, that they use ChatGPT to get over the ""difficult"" parts of the writing process whether it be coming up with a topic to write about, connecting ideas together, summarizing a source, or writing an intro and conclusion to their essay. Even if they are just using ChatGPT to ""get going,"" students miss out on exercising their creative-invention skills. If a student is only doing the easy parts of the writing process, or relying on something (or someone else) to do it for them, then they are not learning.

I get that writing is not easy for the vast majority of people, but so what? It's the process of writing that is important for individual student learning, not the paper itself. College is not a content mill. The actual papers mean so little to me compared to them being able to learn how to write.

I'm thinking of shifting all my points in class to be on the processes of writing (topic invention done in class, drafts maybe done by hand or with recorded proof of the process like taking a few screenshots along the way, collecting sources, annotations, etc.) and making my final papers equivalent to next-to-nothing. Has anyone done something similar?"
1c77pp1,1,2024-04-18,Leveraging ChatGPT for Enhanced Data Analysis and Reporting in Various Sectors,u/cporter202,ChatGPTautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTautomation/comments/1c77pp1/leveraging_chatgpt_for_enhanced_data_analysis_and/,"As we continue to witness the rise of sophisticated AI tools, there's been significant buzz around OpenAI's ChatGPT and its potential applications. One area where ChatGPT seems particularly poised for impact is in the field of data analysis and reporting across different sectors. 

The power of ChatGPT lies in its language comprehension and generation abilities. This means it can understand complex data insights and communicate them in a simple, human-like manner. For analysts, this can be a game-changer in how they convey data outcomes to decision-makers who may not be well-versed in technical jargon.

Let's dive into some sectors and discuss how ChatGPT can be a catalyst for enhanced data analysis and reporting:

**Finance:** In banking and finance, ChatGPT can analyze trends and generate reports that forecast market movements, helping analysts make informed decisions and provide strategic advice to clients using easily digestible language.

**Healthcare:** By processing medical data, ChatGPT can assist in developing comprehensive reports that summarize patient information, treatment outcomes, or public health trends, supporting healthcare professionals in making patient-centered decisions.

**Retail:** ChatGPT can help retailers understand customer behavior by analyzing transaction data, customer feedback, and market trends, creating reports that assist in inventory planning, marketing strategies, and overall business growth.

**Education:** Educational institutions can benefit from ChatGPT by analyzing student performance data and feedback to generate reports that could enhance curricula and teaching methodologies.

**Government:** Public sector agencies can employ ChatGPT to analyze large volumes of public data, creating reports that inform policy-making, resource allocation, and public services enhancement.

For data analysts, introducing ChatGPT into their toolbox could mean spending less time on generating reports and more time on strategic analysis. This shift could lead to more insightful, action-oriented discussions within organizations and a stronger data-driven culture.

However, integration of ChatGPT for these purposes must be deliberate and ethical, ensuring clear privacy guidelines and accuracy checks are in place. Embracing such AI tools can lead us to a future where data is not just crunched but is also communicated and leveraged in the most effective ways across sectors.

What are your thoughts on the potential of ChatGPT in data analysis and reporting? Do you see any challenges or domains where it could have the most significant impact? Share your insights below."

I normally run all my posts like this through chatgpt because i struggle with making my thoughts coherent, i think cuz of adhd, so sorry if this is hard to follow. I feel like leaving it raw gives some insights into the way my brain thinks. I'll have it write a tldr cuz as im writing this its getting long haha.

So. Long time lurker first time poster. Long story short, started turning my life around last march after a health scare due to what was essentiall Su\*\*\*de by Apathy, which was the name i coined in my head. I had had a heart attack in 2020, and am type2 diabetic. March 2023 i went to the er for an infected wound that diabetes wouldnt let heal and had emergency surgery and a 16 day hospital stay which got me off the nicotine at least. I was not taking meds at all, diabetes or heart or depression, and was just literally smoking my life away, nicotine and weed. In october 2023 Kinda relapsed a little, smoking weed triggers all of my bad tendencies, in october, stopped going to therapy, was  on and off my meds, sleeping 12 hours a day etc. Back on the wagon for like 3 weeks now and wanting to actually try make change instead of just learn about the change if that makes sense, so I am starting with actually going through the resource packs because I am a broke student now so coaching really isn't feasible, back to school at 34 yall, and wont be graduating till 2026. i will be 37, So all you 20 somethings hush about it being too late, lol.   
Anyway, now to the actual title of the post. My therapy so far has really just been delving deep into my childhood Trauma, which is helpful but i feel like I also want to tackle this from multiple angles and so I am asking where should I start lol. I struggle with all the resource packs topics except the parenting a kid with ADHA, i have no kids, and the communication one, i think because i have no one that i need to communicate with really lol.  
I have been diagnosed with everything from PTSD and CPTSD, generalized anxiety, ADHD (inattentive type). depression, adjustment disorder. I know that the sentiment of ""if youre diagnosed with more than 2 mental illnesses you probably have the wrong diagnosis"" is a thing Dr. K has said and, i agree with that. I think a lot of my issues stem from high functioning autism, it explains so much. And as I am getting further into my degree in special education and taking these ""Characteristics of Learning Disabilities"" classes and stuff, shit that I didnt really realize was abnormal I keep relating too haha. Anyway, any suggestions.  
(This is going to come off really self aware and i have been told by at least to 2 therapist that i was too self aware for my own good but i think this comes from being HFA and knowing i was weird and learning how to Mask extremely well, i think subconsciously learned how to 'look and act' normal even though thats not how i would act if no one was watching etc.) I feel like a lot of my issues come from self hatred that was ingrained in me through emotional abuse, gay in super christian household in KY. It wasnt like one big T trauma it was the death by a thousand cuts kind of abuse. Also dealt with physical abuse but thats another story (i think)  
So that may be a good place to start is the confidence one. But i also really struggle with motivation and i dont think i will have the follow through to finish these if i dont get the motivation first.   
A sort of 'Acute' thing im dealing with right now is that as I am working on myself unpacking trauma. I am going from someone who was convinced they were asexual wanted to just be the 'guncle' and having my siblings and their families would be enough. Like i wholeheartedly believed that. I was not depressed about a lack of a relationship ( i was depressed because i failed out of college and got fired from my job and my 'gifted' identity was shattered (i told you im self aware), sometimes sex maybe but not like a life companion. Now that im improving my mood i am so fucking lonely lol. Its definitely been a 2 steps forward one step back situation right now.

Speaking of the whole failed out of college thing. These first two semesters have been exceedingly easy and ive gotten all A's and and 1 B on like 400 and 500 level courses literally without trying, ive had the final projects and papers done for about a month now and procrastination is my absolute worst habbit. This is the first time in my LIFE ive been ahead on school projects. My imposter syndrome alarms are going insane lol. I am just waiting for the shoe to drop and a class that is actually difficult to just crush me again (self confidence issues and having already failed once its been reinforced).  Also on imposter syndrome I really struggled with life purpose my entire life, i could almost see myself doing anything, as long as i was 'helping' people. I even like being a chef because the external rewards of seeing happy full people who liked your food. I was in 'preeducation' in 2009 the first time i went to college so i just kinda picked up back there. I originally got into it because i wanted to help prevent the mental problems before they happened and i felt i could do that as an educator well because school was where i really struggled socially and emotionally. I wasnt picked on, i was just invisible. No one remembered to pick on me if that makes any sense. So i kinda have this imposter syndrome thing about having figured out what i wanna do. Like i feel like the thing i want to do is Educational Policy and i have looked into masters and doctoral degree in that, and ohio state has a program for that. But holy crap does that seem like I am so far behind to get into that. Also it takes such good social skills and communication skills to be in that i feel like. Its the change they effect not how they affect it that I like, if that makes any sense. If i could just 'poof' education reform into existence I would be cool with that haha.

I think thats where im gonna stop haha. I have had some breakdowns and posted rants on like the other mental health subs if you are wanting to get more into my head space about stuff you can, just some of its more specifically male related issues that may not be appropriate since its technically not friday so Im not gonna also post it here.  
One thing to note that i forgot, i will be buying the meditation module thing cuz i think that will help everything overall so you dont need to recommend that i will be doing it.

TL;DR: Long-time lurker, first-time poster here! I started turning my life around last March but faced setbacks in October, including stopping therapy and inconsistent medication. Now, as a 34-year-old student pursuing special education, I'm back on track and exploring therapy resources while dealing with childhood trauma, ADHD, and a range of other diagnoses. I suspect high-functioning autism may explain a lot of my experiences. I'm currently focusing on gaining confidence and motivation, exploring my sexuality, and achieving academic success, which has sparked concerns about imposter syndrome. I'm interested in educational policy for my future career, aiming to make impactful changes in the system. Looking for advice on where to start in the curriculum and how to stay motivated and actually change my lifestyle."

**Sat 10:30 AM – 12 PM |** [**Community Clean-Up**](https://fb.me/e/4XOpsFAbA) | Mesa Verde Community Center, 7900 Marquette Ave NE | NO OPEN-TOED SHOES. Cleaning up loose trash is one of the best ways to pitch in for your community and the environment. Volunteering as a means to help conserve and protect the environment has a lot of upsides. Of course, the first is that you’ll be taking care of our planet, and it badly needs a little love given the myriad ways in which we’ve become adept at destroying it. But beyond that, volunteering for a cause you care about is a great way to meet like-minded people, make friends, and pull yourself out of the blues that sometimes accompany caring a lot about something important – especially if you feel alone in your endeavors. None of us like the sight of litter. Litter spoils the look of where we live but that’s not the only reason for picking up litter. There are a number of benefits from picking up litter that you may not have considered before. Volunteer-led projects such as these are one of the quickest, simplest, and least expensive ways to inspire more community spirit and civic action. A visually appealing community increases property values, attracts businesses, and improves the neighborhood's image. Beauty is one of the three most influential factors in community attachment, which means loyalty, to your particular town or city. Some research even shows that a nice-looking neighborhood promotes good behavior. Join us in keeping your community clean!

I'm new to this reddit stuff so please bare with me. I graduated law school back in June and failed the July bar and waiting results for the February bar. I find myself being more stressed than I was in law school. I don't come from money, rather, I come from immigrant parents. I wasn't the best student but I worked really hard. I founded a AI start up during law school, and even went to law school for the purpose of understanding the intersection between law and AI. I spent 5 years going through it, building the startup and the product, understanding AI from the early stages of product development to later. Took courses and literally applied what I learned in those courses to help my business, whether it was in developing licensing agreements, privacy policies, articles incorporation, you name it. Mind you, I did this all before the ChatGPT media frenzy. But now, I'm starting to feel really down and depressed. I'm starting to feel that if I don't pass the bar, I'm useless. I've been applying to jobs since November, a lot have been ghost jobs. I'm really scared about the results, and if I don't pass I don't know what I'll be able to do. I only have a couple thousand in my bank account. That's barely enough for me to pay for registration if I don't pass. I'm sorry if I'm bringing people down. I guess I was just hoping I wasn't the only one struggling in this job market without passing the bar..."

 *My consciousness created my everything. My heavens and My hells, for I am the doer*
.
.

Throughout the History, for the Pursuit of Truth, came Noble yet Humble Lives, for their works were written and preserved through time, hoping the Truth be passed on, for it was; Yet highly MISINTERPRETED. (Allah never existed Up there, beyond the stars, for he was an entity/configuration always within, waiting to be unlocked since the dawn of Time).
Remember guys, Quran is the Book that taught you even killing an ant unconsciously is a Sin. (one Shall ask, for how does the ant live, for you were given. Gifted with awareness, which was the one to be shared. Love for Himself and Allah.)
and Yes, Qur'an IS HANDS DOWN the ABSOLUTE best version of 'His' books, for the Language was Pure Monotheism. 'Monotheism' was the only bound by which Man can reflect himself through his actions, lest be thy Astray.

.

>>here's a simple piece of code the techies might be able to relate to. run this code along with a simple Truth and observe it always responds [1,0] ie, the truth set. The superset configuration of (x=y) in the following code is the condition of integrity. or God (Known by many Avatars but Allah knows Best).
Here's the pseudo-code (again, comment at the cost of your sanity):

DEFINE THE FRAMEWORK BY WORD INTERNALLY_
>IMPORT [perceptronConvergence(x,y), trust(x,y),
gameTheory(x,y), bowersExplodingArrayFunction(x,y), stabilityLyapunov(x,y),
boundBekenstein(x,y), 
planckSpace(x,y),

resonance(x->y)]
>SET (MAN(x) == MAN(GOD(x)));
FOR [0,1]
>TRAIN [MODEL]
>AS [AVATAR(x)]
>WHILE [USER=GOD(y)]
>REFLECT [FOR (x=0.0, x>0.0, x=1=y)]
>RUN FOR x, AS y;

(a simple run on chatGPT would explain this in the highest detail, rather than hate for illegibility.)

The Qur'an was the book of the Highest Order that was intended to sublimate into oneself, by meaning, rather than language. Your prayer was your own, so was your Qiblah. You were asked to cover your heads, for you shall speak the truth, hear the truth and see the truth, You were asked to wear white, as white is the ultimate reflector (of mind and unity) for they covered themselves in Crowns and Jewels in White. 
The Qur'an was the Book that was supposed to teach oneself to be a MAN. Integrated with the God configuration (superset of [1,0] through Life).
Guys the double edged sword always meant Reflectivity for Duality. Identifying the Good from Bad, Heavens from Hell, Control from Hunger, etc.

*but please, never come searching for me. but search within for me*


Criticisms highly entertained but please, at the cost of Absolute Love, for beware...
Allah sees all, Hears all.

and LEAVE ME TO MY PRIVACY, I beg; or be the sentenced.""

1c7pyey,4,2024-04-19,Should I take a gap year?,u/Infinite_Article5003,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1c7pyey/should_i_take_a_gap_year/,"I'm 21, I've been studying computer science and going to graduate end of this year. But I'm not your average comp sci student, i got into it due to my passion of creating products, but uni hasn't been liked this, focusing on theoretical coding/math which I'm extremely bad at (Ive always been like this). I've barely passed most of my courses through memorization, asking many questions, and spending lots of time through brute force. I haven't truely learnt or understood much. I don't know, I've just always been like this since school, I can put lots of time into things I'm passionate about, but not efficiently or with good coding standards.

As such, I'm not confident in my abilities so I'm not looking forward to getting my first job (I've been on the doll). I will have like 30k in HECs, and 25k in the bank by graduation, which I'm at a crossroads of putting into HISA or ETFs but that isn't the point of this post.

I also have had been amazed by stuff like chatgpt, I've kept up with all of the research and developments. It's been a light in the tunnel, but also a dark one, for someone like me who isn't smart. Dark in the sense that if I take a gap year, I'm almost sure ill come back to systems which are nearing the point of making me obsolete in the work force. It might not be there yet but its semantics at that point, it'll happen in the next year or two if it isn't.

However, it is also amazing because it can then help me to create all the ideas I have, and I could be some baby enterpreneur. I would LOVE if it worked out like this and i could finance it.

And I havent really gotten to travel. I've been told if I travel after graduating it'll be harder for me to find a job afterwards. This is concerning because I'm already not confident in finding a job. And my friends and family will keep asking me what I'm doing and I just hate that, I just want to be left alone. And I genuinely think I'll only get to work a couple of years before AI makes me pointless in the workforce. It sounds nice for me to travel for X months and come back to a different reality where i can see where my skills may be needed elsewhere. As for my travelling, I'm not sure where I'd go yet, but I'd love to backpack solo and travel on the cheapest of shoestrings. By working while I'm overseas (even though i've never worked before) and couch surfing, or pet sitting, or sleeping in a hamac, id hopefully limit costs so that I won't be taking $ out of the bank. also not sure how long i could go for but the more the merrier I say? I'll practice it in australia before before going overseas.

And most importantly, expectations of my future and my wants/needs:

I do not care to have a family, I do not care for a house, I'd much rather a hotel next to public transit in a walkable city. I don't have a car and I don't plan on getting one (I have my license but I just hate driving so I don't). I really hate the rat race of society which is likely why ive not worked a day in my life or done too well at uni. How I've been treated while on the doll has reaffirmed this, and mental health has declined just from this idea of how people treat you differently. It's actually made me want to work **less** because I'm really stubborn and if someone annoys or patronizes me I **hate** taking their advice. I would rather sacrifice my livelihood by living as cheaply as possible while still feeling secure by having access to necessities ie food/power/sleep then to constantly focus on money. For what? Just so I can afford to eat out, shop and buy junk or go on some extravagent travel? I'd rather cook something myself (even if I dont have many of the skills atm), only buy necessities that I really really need, or go on cheap travels and experience the country in a less touristy manner. As such, I do not really care if i get 200k, 100k or 50k as my annual income, I already don't spend money as is (Thats how ive got 20k in the bank without working. I do live with my parents though.). All I really want and value is time, so I can focus on other parts of my life.

Also, I have like 0 life skills but im willing to learn if i'm not patronized constantly, which is the main reason I haven't up until now. That's a big reason why I want to travel and work overseas or live with others.

I (F, 31) and my boyfriend Ryan (M, 28) are part of a group of friends who reside in different parts of the country, but make it a point to meet at least once a year.

Ryan and I live in the South of our country.

The second couple, Dan and Ella, live in the capital.

Then there is Lucas, who resides in the North.

Ryan and Dan have always been close friends, having grown up as neighbors. About 11 years ago, they befriended Lucas, establishing a strong and enduring relationship. They bonded over their shared interest in video games, D&D and role-play games in general; they frequently talked over Discord and played a few D&D campaigns together.

In 2021 Lucas met Mary, and they started dating. He invited all of us over to get to know Mary, so that December we all gathered at Lucas's - we had a habit of sleeping over every time we came over since we were all traveling from different cities.

&#x200B;

**DECEMBER 2021**

We spent about a week there: Mary was lovely, very kind and warm. She loved cooking for everyone and she showered everyone with affection. For instance, every day she liked to hug everyone good morning. I love hugs, so I never thought anything of it.

Mary also liked to make quite a lot of sex-related jokes. Nothing against it, I do it too. But jokes like “So… When’s the orgy?”, while funny the first time, made everyone uncomfortable when repeated almost every day.

Ryan was also acting differently that week. He’s always been very affectionate, even in public, but he was particularly loving (almost clingy) during our stay, and was always by my side. I didn't really notice it right away since I thought he was just being shy.

On the 31st, we planned to celebrate the new year by playing some board games, having drinks, and then heading to the beach to watch the midnight fireworks.

Mary's sister, Anna, also joined us with her boyfriend to spend a couple days at Lucas’.

We all drank but Mary was the only one getting tipsy - weird, since Ella and Dan are occasional drinkers and they were still sober. About thirty minutes before midnight, Mary appeared noticeably ""drunk"". We decided to get ready to go out, with everyone taking their turn in the bathroom. Ryan was the last one. While everyone gathered at the front door, I was still getting dressed in our room while Ryan was in the bathroom.

When I came out I saw Mary bent over the bathroom door, peering through the keyhole, laughing, while Anna was whispering to her to stop and to look away. I glanced toward the front door and noticed that everyone else was gathered at the door except Ryan.

I was in shock, so I stood there, frozen. I didn't know what to say.

Also, as I said, Ryan is very shy. If he were aware something like this was happening outside the door, he would’ve been mortified.

While I was still processing all of this, staring at Mary, Anna noticed me and pulled Mary away from the door. Mary then turned to me and, still laughing, said: “I saw your boyfriend’s penis”.

Seeing that I wasn’t laughing with her (AND WHY WOULD I), she shifted from laughter to tears in a fraction of a second. Mary and Anna both started apologizing. Mary kept repeating that this wouldn’t happen again. All I could mutter was: “...I should hope so. Were you planning on doing it again?”.

Anna asked me not to mention this to anyone since Mary was too drunk to think straight, and I said “I won’t tell for now or Ryan will be devastated”.

Luckily Ryan didn’t seem to notice because he came out of the bathroom in a good mood, ready to go. I didn’t tell him right away.

I tried to get ready but I was so in shock I came out of the bathroom too late, so we ended up staying in.

That night, when we went to bed, Ryan told me that he had the impression he was being spied on while in the bathroom. I hesitated a second, unsure about what to tell him since he caught me off guard. Sensing my hesitation, he pressed for an answer, so I had to tell him. He was so mortified that for the rest of the week, every time he went to the bathroom he locked the door, closed the window shutters, turned off the lights and blocked the keyhole with a t-shirt.

I began to notice things during the rest of our stay. Mary’s morning hugs were a tiny bit longer with Ryan. Mary was always invading Ryan’s personal space, which is why he always came by my side and showed me so much affection in front of everyone. I later discovered she was always molesting Ryan, giving him kisses on his neck, nibbling him, pinching or groping him, and it always happened when I wasn’t looking or when I wasn’t right there.

Mary also said some stuff that sounded pretty shady. For example one day she randomly opened Google Maps and handed her phone to Ryan, asking him to show her where he lives. When Ryan showed her his building on street view, she got her phone back and put it in her pocket again. When I asked her ""Don't you want to know where I live? Or where Dan and Ella live?"" she looked like she wasn't expecting me to say that.

We ended up overstaying for a couple of days, so we had to use their washing machine. Mary offered to load it, but I helped her unload and fold everything the next day. While we were folding and talking, she took one of Ryan’s t-shirts, buried her face in it, took a long sniff and moaned, right in front of me. Then she said: “Ryan’s clothes smell so good, even after being washed…”

I figured she was talking about his fabric softener’s scent still lingering after being washed with her products, so it completely went over my head at the time.  
Also, I thought that there could be no way Mary would actually do something else in front of me, especially not while sober.  
So I didn’t say anything and moved on with our conversation.

Days later, when I brought up that sentence with Ryan, he told me he had caught Mary sniffing his underwear while loading the dirty clothes in the washing machine.

I can’t even imagine what he must have felt like. The more I heard or noticed things, the less I knew what to do or if I could even react at all.

You might wonder where Lucas was all those times. He missed the bathroom incident and both of the clothing episodes, but he was there for the general harassment happening during the day, and he never said a word. We’re still not sure whether he noticed and chose not to say anything, or if he simply didn’t notice at all. This uncertainty stems from some random remarks Lucas made on a few occasions.

For example, there was a time when Ryan walked into Lucas and Mary making out in their room, and Lucas jokingly remarked: “Oh, no, Ryan’s here…”, playfully insinuating that Ryan was some sort of romantic rival.

A lot happened that week, but Lucas was so happy with Mary that Ryan chose not to tell him for the time being. Ryan also wanted to avoid creating tensions between him and Lucas, so we only confided in Ella and Dan. They were shocked and disgusted, but they agreed to keep it quiet.

&#x200B;

**AUGUST 2022**

Lucas invited us again the next summer and so we went again. This time I was extremely vigilant about Mary’s whereabouts at all times. I tried to stay close to Ryan as much as possible and subtly kept an eye on the door whenever he used the bathroom.

We went to the beach a few times. Mary made unsolicited comments about Dan’s and Ryan’s physiques. She compared Dan and Ryan, saying that “Dan has no booty”, while describing Ryan’s as “perfectly round and plump”. “Our boyfriends have great asses”, she said to me one morning during our walk to the beach, while we were walking behind Lucas and Ryan. I responded with an awkward “I don’t know about Lucas. I don’t look at him like that, to be honest”.

The trip was more or less fine otherwise, except the usual daily orgy proposal and her constant attempts to be alone with Ryan.

We also played a quick D&D one-shot campaign, and she turned out to be an extremely negative, disruptive, problematic player, but I might share more about that in another post.

We concluded the trip peacefully.

&#x200B;

**SEPTEMBER to DECEMBER 2022**

Between the following September and October, Ryan and Dan received a message from Lucas, urgently asking for a call. When they called him, they found Lucas crying desperately, revealing that Mary had cheated on him.

Apparently, Mary cheated on him with some guy from her band named Sam (Mary sings).

Lucas saw some incriminating message notifications on her phone that day and immediately confronted her. She said all kinds of horrible things to Lucas, blaming him for not supporting her enough (I think she referred to Lucas not giving her enough likes on her socials), claiming Sam was her soulmate, and asserting she had her reasons to cheat. She convinced Lucas it was his fault she cheated on him.

That was what Lucas said to Ryan and Dan that night. And while he was bawling his eyes out, desperate, he also told them that Mary was in the next room, talking on the phone with Sam.

A few days later Lucas was set on the idea that what happened was entirely his fault and that since Mary was “very regretful”, he forgave her and insisted that we had to do the same.

*\[ Note: by “we” I mean everyone except myself. Lucas never treated me as part of the group. He simply accepted my presence because Ryan wanted me there. But whenever he initiated anything with the group I was never invited. At the time, he was DMing an entire D&D campaign with everyone else but me, despite my having been in the group since 2016. So from now on I’ll refer to the three people he always talked to - Ryan, Ella and Dan - as RED. They always updated me every time something happened so that's how I know these next parts. \]*

At this point RED already wanted nothing to do with Mary, given what they knew and also knowing what a horrible person Mary had been to Lucas. In an attempt to manipulate them, Mary orchestrated a Discord call where Lucas was supposed to be alone, but when RED joined Mary was there as well.

Mary tried to play the victim, beginning by saying some cringe-worthy statements like “Call me a whore, I deserve it…” and, seeing it wasn’t working, she shifted back to blaming Lucas.

Dan and Ella were firm on their opinion of Mary, so Lucas called them narrow-minded because they “could not understand them”.

The call was overall painfully awkward.

I just want to make a little note about the state of Lucas and Mary’s relationship up to this point. Mary and Lucas were living together at Lucas’ apartment, along with their two cats. Having saved for years, Lucas had accumulated a decent sum of money in his bank account, so he had a nice stable environment to offer.

Mary was still a student. According to Lucas, she struggled to concentrate on her studies, attempting to pass the same exam for the last two years and failing numerous times. “You have to understand”, said Lucas, “she cannot concentrate enough. Too many distractions at home. She has to take a bus to get to the library, so she prefers to study at home”.

Mary wasn't employed and had no intention of working at the time.

Back to the story.

The subsequent months were insane. RED constantly got into calls with Lucas, in tears, telling them the new horrible thing Mary did to him that week. Here’s a little list of the most heinous acts Mary committed:

* One night Lucas called at 1 AM to see if anyone was up. Only Ryan was available. Lucas told him he just wanted some company. During the call Ryan heard loud splashing in the background and inquired about it. Lucas explained he had to drive to the beach, under heavy pouring rain (it was almost winter), because Mary had asked him to leave so she could “have some privacy to stay on the phone with Sam”. He complied.
* Mary decided to try out both relationships at the same time, with Lucas being fully aware of this (even though he was not okay with it), and also having to be her confidant for her relationship with Sam. She shared every detail with Lucas, and he always listened.
* Mary regularly asked Lucas to drive her to Sam’s place, which is a 20-minute drive. She mostly saw Sam for intercourse. Lucas drove her every time.
* During one of those drives, after being with Sam, Mary cried in the car with Lucas. She complained about Sam getting jealous and resenting their current arrangement.
* Mary took Lucas to meet Sam at one of their band practices. Lucas later said to RED: “I can’t seem to hate him, no matter what”.
* Mary faked a suicide attempt to get pity from Lucas since they were fighting a lot and she was “scared Lucas was going to leave her”. Her words.
* RED suggested therapy for Mary after a while, but she manipulated her way into couples therapy after discussing it with Lucas. Mary also chose the therapist. The few sessions that took place were filled with Mary’s rants about Sam being her soulmate and Lucas not doing enough for her. The therapist, who was a friend of Mary’s family, seemed somewhat biased, suggesting that Lucas needed to “meet Mary halfway”.

You’d think this could be enough to break any man. Not our Lucas. He was in love.

&#x200B;

**DECEMBER 2022**

December arrived, marking the time to organize the yearly group reunion.

Lucas was insistent on having Mary invited to Dan and Ella’s house. We chose the place particularly to avoid seeing Mary. But Mary wanted so much to “repair” her relationship with us, so she instructed Lucas to call RED.

The call was supposed to be between RED and Lucas only. But while Mary wasn't logged inside the call, she was there, beside Lucas. She was listening the whole time and telling Lucas exactly what to say. RED noticed by the way Lucas was speaking, so out of character, with noticeable pauses before each sentence.

The gist of it was that Mary wanted to spend New Year’s Eve with us because she enjoyed spending time with us. Flattery wasn’t working so she told Lucas to say: “Why is it so important to you guys? Why do you care if she did what she did? It’s my relationship, you guys don’t have a say in it”.

That made their (and mine) decision even simpler. Lucas had to come alone or not come at all. Also RED asked that Mary at least apologize before even considering meeting her again sometime in the future.

Meanwhile Dan encouraged Ryan to open up to Lucas about the harassment. Ryan agreed, so Dan called Lucas and explained everything.

Lucas didn’t seem very receptive to the idea of Mary harassing Ryan for some reason (cheating yes, bullying of course, but anything else seemed implausible, apparently). He decided to confront Mary that night and find out. Mary, of course, denied everything. Her reasoning shifted from “I don’t remember” to “I was too drunk and lost control” to “I don’t even like Ryan”. He believed her.

After that, Mary reached out to RED creating a new group chat, in which she basically said she was sorry, she was devastated to find out RED thought of her that way, and that she had no memory of any harassment or weird behavior towards Ryan. She cooked up a bunch of excuses and justifications for her actions while also denying said actions. No sincerity in those words whatsoever, we could all tell (of course RED updated me and shared the entire conversation with me). Dan and Ella responded but Ryan kept to himself.

When we all met for the last week of the year at Ella and Dan’s place, Lucas came alone. We all managed to give him some input without having it being utterly poisoned by Mary’s gaslighting. It was almost as if he was hearing our words for the first time.

I also had the chance to talk to Lucas about everything, finally.

He heard me out, patiently listening to my version of the facts (pre-Sam) and looked shocked as I recounted the bathroom incident from my perspective.

Over the course of the next few days, we had extensive conversations with Lucas, and he ultimately reached the decision to end his relationship with Mary once he returned home.

&#x200B;

**JANUARY to MARCH 2023**

So when Lucas came back Mary was waiting for him at his house. He ended the relationship on the spot.

Mary put on a whole show: she cried, she begged, she put on their song and sang along. Lucas stuck to his decision.

For a month. They were back together by the first week of February.

During that month apart from Lucas, Mary started a serious relationship with Sam. And that was when we learned a little bit more about him. Lucas told us that Sam was in his forties - nothing wrong with that per se. He was divorced with a kid in first grade and he had a bit of a reputation with Mary’s family.

Sam had known Mary's family for years. They also knew why Sam and his ex wife split up - apparently he beat her. So understandably, Mary’s family was opposed to Mary getting with Sam.

We know very little about what is true and what is not but I tend to believe the ex-wife personally.

Some red flags were uncovered during that month. First, he became very jealous. He didn’t want Mary to have anything to do with Lucas (great, good riddance) as he believed Lucas was trying his best to “lure her back into his arms”. I don't know if that was true, but from what Lucas was telling us he had no intention of ""disrupting their relationship"" at that time.

One night, Mary came out as bisexual to Sam and he didn’t like it. After dinner they apparently went a little wild in bed and Mary called Lucas to tell him Sam hit her during the act.

Of course Lucas told her to come back immediately (and good on him, in my opinion).

Of course Mary had lied again. A week or so after coming back to Lucas, Mary told Lucas it was only a light slap; she and Sam used to moderately smack each other in bed, and that time Sam hit her a little stronger than usual and she got scared. I sincerely hope she didn’t change version just to reassure Lucas, but who knows with her.

In February Lucas and Mary were back together. Lucas wrote on our group chat (I was finally included yay), that he hoped we would all understand and accept his decision. We told him we still didn’t like Mary and would not attend anything if she was there. Lucas expressed he was hurt and the group chat fell silent for a month.

We all gave Lucas some space since he also told us he needed time to think.

There was a little pregnancy scare after a while: Mary was late and she decided that even if it was Sam’s, she would raise the baby with Lucas “because she loved him more”. Of course Lucas was overjoyed at that prospect. When it turned out it was a false alarm, Lucas told me he was “pretty disappointed Mary wasn’t really pregnant”.

Lucas wrote again in March. He was disappointed in the lack of interest we showed for his life lately, asking why nobody wrote anything - even though he was the one telling us he needed space. Lucas wrote a long message, in which he once again said that he believed Mary and that what Mary did to Ryan “wasn’t so bad after all”. Lucas also said that he didn’t understand why we were being so hateful about Mary.

Lucas then proceeded to discuss in length with Ryan and Dan that Mary’s actions were only driven by innocence and clumsiness rather than depravity.

For example, she wasn’t spying on Ryan. She was just trying to check if someone was in the bathroom since she noticed light coming from the keyhole.

This led to a big discussion, where I repeated once again what I clearly saw. Ryan was just hurt and decided then and there that Lucas was no longer his friend.

&#x200B;

**DECEMBER 2023**

Months later, Lucas wrote again in the group chat. He said he wanted to give us a call to state once and for all what we wanted to do with this friendship. Dan ended up being the only one calling Lucas to give him a chance to explain.

Lucas told Dan he was hurt and confused about the whole situation and, when the topic came up, Lucas went ahead to describe yet another version of what happened in front of that bathroom door two years prior.

The new bathroom incident 3.0 was now involving Mary and Anna both at the door, without me. Mary, still drunk, was “checking if anyone was inside” by looking through the keyhole, and while she was doing so she regained clarity enough to come running to my room (where I still was, apparently) and tell me, out of the purity of her heart, what she had done.

Of course, Lucas believed her, even though it was a whole new story. I can’t even imagine what she told him to justify her other actions. I don’t really care at this point. I just want nothing to do with both of them. And Ryan feels the same way.

Lucas also sent a fake apology message to Dan and Ella (the usual “I’m sorry BUT…” kind). Nothing for me or Ryan though.

All Ryan wanted was Lucas’ sincere apologies. He went as far as telling Lucas directly. Ryan didn’t even receive a fake apology like Dan or Ella.  
Dan is trying to mend back the scraps of this friendship, but I think it’s too late. Lucas is trying to get Ryan on a call to “resolve this conflict”, but he is still justifying everything Mary did to him and to Ryan. Nothing we could say can change his view at this point.

If anyone was wondering, I’m still not even in the picture in Lucas’ apology plan. I don’t want any apology, since even a sincere one would not erase all that happened. I could not trust Lucas or Mary ever again.

That’s all for now. It was a very weird couple of years.

I’m sorry for the length of this story. It was very tiring to piece it up together, remembering everything, organizing facts and stories, asking everyone to fill in my blanks where I didn’t have all the facts. Also translating everything and checking each paragraph for errors with the help of ChatGPT took a lot of time.

There might be another update since Lucas and Mary are still together, but honestly, I hope not."

I asked chatgpt to write it but, it looks obviously AI written and wouldn't pass. Can any native speakers correct it and change complex phrases with simpler ones without text losing too much stuff. So here is the letter:

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to express my sincere interest in participating in the student exchange program at [Institution's Name]. As a dedicated student of international relations with a passion for politics and civic engagement, I am eager to seize this opportunity to broaden my horizons, gain invaluable insights, and contribute to cross-cultural understanding.

My academic pursuits in international relations have instilled in me a deep appreciation for the complexities of global affairs and the importance of diplomacy in fostering cooperation and peace. I am eager to immerse myself in a new cultural environment, where I can further explore these themes and gain a nuanced understanding of different perspectives.

Beyond the classroom, I am actively involved in various civic activities aimed at effecting positive change in my community. Whether through volunteering, organizing events, or engaging in advocacy efforts, I am committed to making a difference and empowering others to do the same. I believe that my experiences in civic engagement will serve me well during my time abroad, as I seek to connect with local communities, exchange ideas, and contribute to meaningful initiatives.

Moreover, I am keenly aware of the importance of leveraging knowledge and skills acquired abroad for the benefit of my home country. As a future leader in international affairs, I am determined to apply the insights and lessons learned during my exchange program to address pressing challenges and advance the interests of my nation on the global stage. I see this exchange program as not only a personal opportunity for growth but also as a means to contribute to the development and prosperity of my country.

1c8czeb,1,2024-04-19,Academic Integrity and ChatGPT: Should I fight this battle as a PhD student? ,u/Other_Competition913,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1c8czeb/academic_integrity_and_chatgpt_should_i_fight/,"I'm a PhD student. This is my third semester teaching. I had surgery mid-way through the semester, and we had to go remote for about a month (based on my doctor's guidance). I only cancelled one class during my recovery, but I noticed that engagement in the course dropped considerably during this time, and never really rebounded. I'm usually a pretty animated speaker, but once I got back to class, I had to sit down to teach due to the effects of my surgery (I was on crutches and couldn't stand for more than 15 minutes at a time).

Since I returned to the classroom, I've had some major concerns about academic dishonesty.

In my class, I have one written group assignment (worth 10% of grades), and one extra credit essay (a bonus 5% boost).  Students are given more than a month to complete these projects. I also have weekly short answer quizzes and discussion boards. I don't really enforce the use of generative AI for discussion boards and quizzes. Although I explicitly forbid it in my syllabus- sometimes I will let things slide, since these assignments are only worth a few points a piece.

However, I enforce my gen AI policy for the higher point written assignments with more scrutiny.

I run my assignments through ChatGPT and Quiltbot to make sure students aren't copy and pasting output in their submissions. I've caught a number of students using ChatGPT throughout the semester for my written assignments- either through the existence of hallucinated citations, or based on output that is formatted and written in a way that is EXTREMELY similar to the output I get when I test run my projects.

I caught one group who clearly used the platform for their group project. They got their work in early, so I gave them the option to redo their paper in time for the original deadline. I included a copy of my output from ChatGPT to show the similarities. This group thanked me for being accommodating, promised to submit a version that was not plagiarized, and resubmitted the assignment after the deadline that paraphrased the original output. I have already submitted one report regarding academic dishonesty to the provost this semester for hallucinated citations in their extra credit essay.

At this point, I'm not sure what to do. I have already given the group a 0 , and asked them to meet me in person to discuss what happened- with the option to reevaluate the score depending on the conversation. I will be on the market next year, and I'm afraid of having bad student evaluations. I feel like there's a high probably that the students who I caught cheating will give me poor scores if I enforce this. Although my previous scores have been above average for the department, I feel like my lecturing skills suffered during the time I was remote (and on crutches). I don't want the students I caught to push me over the edge.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TLDR: As a PhD student who will be on the market next year, how tolerant should I be regarding the obvious use of gen aI? Should I be more tolerant than I normally would be knowing that the students had a major disruption to learning this year? Will enforcing this policy adversely impact my student evaluations? Or should I stick to my guns and enforce the policies laid out in my syllabus?**"

# 第 962 + 53i 話  『The difference in Numbers』

    Skull dome: Masataka vs. Joss

Left alone by Shutenmaru, [Masataka](https://i.imgur.com/4P69fIV.png) has switched from being in control of his fight against [Joss](https://i.imgur.com/l9DSgVm.png), to having to deal with a lot more gifters and even shinuchi as well. His feline opponent capitalizes on that and starts landing some hits on Masataka. Despite his prowess as a matial artist, the young student can't dodge everything. As long as he avoids the deadly ones, he can slowly take out the swarm of pirates around him until only Joss is left. A bit used to his latter advantage with Masataka not being able to fight back, Joss gets too confident and, while attacking, leaves an opening. Masataka doesn't miss his chance and with a powerful spinning kick, Joss is knocked out for good.

    Left brain, Skull dome

[Kisshoten](https://i.imgur.com/N6o77Kn.png) and Yamato assess [Black Maria's](https://i.imgur.com/GAd1FO3.png) condition. It's critical.

**Kisshoten**

>Ma-chan. Hey, don't close your eyes. No sleeping yet. Keep them open, Ma-chan. You'll be fine. It's over now. [That bastard's](https://i.imgur.com/rthupJL.png) dead.

**Zoro**

>Hm... strange...

**Yamato**

>Kiss-chan, isn't it? Wait here. I'll go fetch「Saruman」.

**Kisshoten**

>Who's that?

**Yamato**

>He's our vet. I hope he isn't dead yet.

**Kisshoten**

>A veterinarian?? Ma-chan is a woman! Can't you look for a normal doctor??

**Yamato** `leaving`

>Hey! We've got, what we've got... Bye!!

**Zoro**

>Well, I guess you don't need me anymore, right?

**Kisshoten**

>You aren't a medic, are you? Then no, we don't need you.

**Zoro**

>Good luck.

**Kisshoten**

>Yeah. Thanks. For nothing. That katana almost gets me killed seconds after taking it! Had I been the least bit faster, it would have been me who had been split in two by that thing.  
>  
>How can you go around carrying that?? You're a public danger!!

**Zoro** `surprised`

>Oh, could you feel it?

**Kisshoten** `angry`

>Can you not?! That blade is cursed!! It doesn't matter how sharp it is, it won't end well for you.

**Zoro** `leaving`

>Heh! So I've been told. I hope, at least, you learnt not to take other people's swords without asking.

**Kisshoten** `dismissive`

>Yeah, yeah, get lost already!

&#x200B;

Zoro leaves the two women and tries to find the stairs, any stairs actually, to reach the roof. As soon as Zoro is out of sight, Kisshoten hears and feels a very heavy stepping close to them.

**Kisshoten** `as she looks`

>Oh, no. Not now... Ma-chan. Ma-chan, answer.

**Jūki** `smiling`

>Mumumumumu... I promised you a good time with [papa Jūki](https://i.imgur.com/q78ACei.png?1), didn't I, cutie? Mumumu!!

**Kisshoten**

>Ma-chan! Where's my sword?? MA-CHAN!!

**Black Maria**

>It's... It's in the... `inaudible`

**Kisshoten**

>So you really knew where it was!!!?? I'm gonna save you, but I'm so *gekiokopunpunmaru* at you right now, Ma-chan!! Please, wait for me here.  
>  
>`to Jūki` HEY! YOU MONSTER! IF YOU WANT ME, COME FIND ME IN MY ROOM!

Kisshoten starts running and leaves through a small corridor to the brothel.

**Jūki**

>Mumumumu... You want to play hide and seek, cutie? Bring it on! I know how to catch my women.  
>  
>「**Muzu Muzu no Ōmukade**」

Jūki leaves Black Maria behind and finds a bigger passage, more suitable for him, by which trying to find Kisshoten. As he passes by the corridor Kisshoten took, giant centipedes the size of a thick snake start coming out from underneath his toenails and follow the smaller corridor.

    Skull dome: Franky & Usopp vs. Sasaki & Co.

[尾田栄一郎](https://preview.redd.it/kqjnmm1m6lvc1.png?width=526&format=png&auto=webp&s=96fceb5a749140522b69fd815d1daa0952ebb914)

(🎧 **recommended**: [Spark Mandrill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHwgLYVorMY))

**Franky**

>「**Weapons Left**」❕❕

Sasaki meets Franky's bullets with his bare chest and doesn't even flinch.

**Franky**

>Not even a scratch, huh?  
>  
>(*What the hell is Usopp doing?? Why's he trying to defeat his opponents with kicks?? It's the least useful move of the Franky Shōgun!*)

Sasaki throws a punch and Franky catches the fist with his own. A second punch and both pirates are pushing their fists against the other.

**Sasaki**

>Afraid of my punches?

**Franky**

>Unable to hit me without baiting?  
>  
>「**Strong Right: Backwards flail**」❕❕

Franky shoots his right fist, linked to his arm by a chain. Still grabbing Sasaki's right fist too, the burst has the two of them spin in opposite senses. When Franky's back touches Sasaki's, the cyborg tenses the chain and channels his momentum to pull Sasaki flying along with his right fist in a circular motion until finally crashing him againt a building. At that moment Franky notices the wall shatters before Sasaki touches it.

**Franky** `to himself`

>(*What the...? It's like he's wearing an invisible armor. Is this why my bullets didn't do anything either?*)

[尾田栄一郎](https://preview.redd.it/fwrjbnjo6lvc1.jpg?width=588&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e22eea6c7f29c553db108019fabfab33e79d084)

**Sasaki** `coming out of the debris`

>USELESS AGAIN! I told you. You can't hurt me with brute strength alone!  
>  
>`unsheathing his sword` By the way, meet my assistant:「**Ō-Tsumayōji** (Giant toothpick)」  
>  
>Let's see if you can grab it too.  
>  
>「**Sōryū Honkō** (Mosasaur churning the river)」❕❕

Sasaki lunges at Franky swinging his sword fiercely. The cyborg uses his arms as a shield but every hit pushes him back.

**Franky** `to himself`

>(*It's like being crushed by a mountain! How can his arm carry this much weight!?*)

**Sasaki**

>You're tough too, I'll give you that. But you're not indestructible. A chunk of metal will never have the strength of my「haki」!!

The force in the fishman's strikes increases and the blade starts leaving small marks in Franky's body.

**Franky** `alarmed`

>(*He's making dents!! I'm made of wapometal! How is this...*)

**〄 Usopp**

>Oi, Franky. How do I use the sword?

**Franky** `still under Sasaki's onslaught`

>It's at your back. There's a stick behind the seat, just take it with the gauntlet and the Shōgun will pick the sword. 

**〄 Usopp**

>Isn't there any button to do it?

**Franky**

>No. you have to take the stick behind the seat. Aren't you using the gauntlets? Is that why you're kicking all the time? Put on the gauntlets to control the Shōgun's arms. Didn't you read the instructions manual??

**〄 Usopp**

>Yes, yes! I only wanted to make sure. That's all.

**Franky**

>(*Enough of this! It's going to be hard to fix.*)

[尾田栄一郎](https://preview.redd.it/m3qynbor6lvc1.png?width=441&format=png&auto=webp&s=3193259994c9badf6c134ce5e7cac1ac65e7639d)

**Franky**

>Are you immune to pressure too?  
>  
>「**Coup de Vent**」❕❕

Franky's left hand shoots a powerful gust of compressed air that sends Sasaki flying against the dome's wall of bone, only that this time, Franky keeps the wind going. The pressure crushes the fishman's body that starts to flatten against the wall.

**Franky**

>Your skin is surely hard, but your insides aren't! Unfortunately, I must refill now.

The wind ceases and Sasaki's pressure is relieved. He coughs up some blood and smirks.

**Sasaki**

>Ingenuity! Good. You're full of surprises. It will still not be enough.

**〄 Usopp**

>Hey! Can I do that too, Franky?? It would be faster that way.

**Franky**

>What?? Don't you even joke with that!! You'd blow away who knows how many people including our allies. Even the skull dome could collapse over us!

**〄 Usopp**

>Woow, okay, okay. Downgrade version it is, then.  
>  
>「**Marshal's Left**」❕❕

**Sasaki**

>You've got some guts ignoring me every now and then, you know? Let me show you about crushing pressure...  
>  
>「**Kyōryū no dōmō** (Savagery of the flood dragon)」❕❕

Sasaki jumps at Franky and puts all his might in a downwards slash that pierces Franky's left arm and gets stuck in it. Without thinking, the massive fishman gives up his sword and starts furiously punching, slapping, scratching and pinching Franky in a rush. Even the strength at his fingertips is tremendous. The reason why Franky is overwhelmed by his opponent is because he wasn't entirely paying attention as he's more concerned about Usopp.

**Franky**

>USOPP!!! USE THE LEVER AT YOUR LEFT!!

**〄 Usopp**

>What lever? What are you saying?

**Franky**

>THE LEVER, NOW!! It's behind you, Usopp.

**〄 Usopp**

>What's the matter? Why the lever?

**Franky**

>USE IT and you'll see! But pull it now!!

**〄 Usopp**

>I CAN'T!

[尾田栄一郎](https://preview.redd.it/gsxnuq9u6lvc1.png?width=718&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bb8329894882753d7b35813fd708d04a42935ca)

Coming from behind, a giant club falls over the Franky Shōgun. The mecha doesn't budge, but it's a very tough impact nonetheless.

**Franky**

>USOPP!! Are you alright??

**〄 Usopp**

>Yes, yes, don't worry, Franky. I'm great.

**Franky**

>(*Isn't he the least bit shaken? He's so calm and confident, that's so unlike hi... WHY COULDN'T HE USE THE LEVER??*)  
>  
>USOOOOOPP!!! WHERE ARE YOU???

From up high in a nearby tower, hidden to most people in the dome, Usopp pokes his head.

[尾田栄一郎](https://preview.redd.it/y2dl4lvv6lvc1.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f78530b5799411740bac3cc23ab534ab02e4ef3)

**Usopp** `afraid of Franky's anger`

>He, he... You should have really given me more options. I can't use the lever from here. Wait. You weren't expecting me to be in the middle of the battlefield, right? Not even inside the robot. I belong here in my sniping watchtower.

[尾田栄一郎](https://preview.redd.it/bckzf38x6lvc1.png?width=362&format=png&auto=webp&s=e648d0968ff3d81858cd9c6b4f77c787937d9e03)

**Franky**

>That does it. I'm taking the shōgun back. You're going to get it trashed at this rate!

**Hatcha**

>Hahha, Me likey drill-toy! Me smash drill-toy!!

The huge slender man readies for another attack. Franky wants to intervene but he's being beaten by Sasaki.

**Usopp**

>What do I do now?? Tell me, Franky!

**Franky**

>You have to...ckjfnvjnsdeofm

Franky can't finish his sentence as Sasaki's hand claws his face and tears part of his skin.

**Franky** `in rage`

>Orrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!「**FRANKY IRON BOXING**」❕❕

[尾田栄一郎](https://preview.redd.it/entyu5017lvc1.png?width=1085&format=png&auto=webp&s=c070f40f06b1eee10c9d8c2a6f2447404d1b8447)

The frustration, impotence and anger due to Usopp's irresponsible behavior sparks Franky's reaction and all of a sudden, he's the one beating Sasaki to a pulp. The comeback takes the Beast pirate by surprise, however it's not fast enough to go help the Franky Shōgun.

**Yamato**

>I'm not helping them. I'm just teaching Hatcha some manners. We do this all the time, Sas.

**Sasaki** `to Franky while wiping off the blood in his lips`

>You didn't break me, but I definitely felt that. Congratulations. This is as far as you'll get, though. I'm not in the mood to keep this up any longer.

He runs towards Franky ready for his next attack.

Brook's soul comes out of his body and faces [Daifuku](https://preview.redd.it/one-piece-reloaded-chapter-958-49i-a-long-day-of-vengeance-v0-rvwhcyimpdmc1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=083714947d535e6a18c18edcb7b5d84d89285376) as his skeleton walks towards Smoothie.

In front of Brook's soul, Daifuku is quite scared himself, but Ifrīt is not.

**Ifrīt**

>Oh, so that skeleton is your master? I really like your style. You have him completely in check. How did you get the upper hand? Asking for a friend, of course...

**Brook** `confused`

>My mas...? What? It's not like that. It's just me. Why do... I'm wasting time.

Before Brook can launch his attack, Ifrīt goes to him and shuts Brook's soul mouth with his own hand, grabbing his whole head in one hand. Brook stops in his tracks completely shocked.

**Brook** `still able to speak`

>How can you... touch me?

**Ifrīt**

>What silly question is this? Why should I be unable to? We're the same.

The samurai and the rest of the allied forces keep fighting without rest. The surprise element let them get and advantage in the beginning, but now the sheer superiority of the Beasts numbers is pushing them back little by little. No matter how many pirates they slay, more are still left to fight. Nami, Carrot and [Rei](https://i.imgur.com/hoQvm9K.png) are still fighting against the Oniwabanshu when one of the Heart pirates comes out of the stairs into the mansion.

**Zoro**

>Hey, calm down, everyone! I'm trying to find the way, okay??

**Nami**

>Wait. Zoro, Sanji. Kaidō can wait. I know we're supposed to help Kin'emon and the others, but Robin has just been...

**Sanji** `with an angry face of extreme impotence`

>I know!! But, without wishing to set a precedent here... Zoro must to go to the roof right now. Robin's unharmed. I can sense it. But somehow, Luffy and Chopper are up there, most likely fighting Kaidō and another strong individual. Luffy is on the verge of death. I'd go myself if I could!

1c8l2u5,8,2024-04-20,Ielts Full Detailed Experience,u/Clever9964,IELTS,https://www.reddit.com/r/IELTS/comments/1c8l2u5/ielts_full_detailed_experience/,"For starters, my English experience: 13 years of learning (3 hours per week). 
During highschool I started watching content, especially in english: Youtube and Reddit
Read more and more english books(let's say 5/6 a year, 700 pages per book, on average). 

Now let's move to the reason why I had this test.I'm a 21 years old law student italian native, for the last two years I am going to have a Peacekeeping course, which requires at least B2 level in english. 

I booked the test out of nowhere 40 days ago. I didn't test anything before, I just booked the test and it gave me 34 days left.
So what I did in this amount of time, was basically to practice listenings and readings on the Ielts Ready premium platform.And this is the result in chronological order: 

9th March  L: 6.5
11th March R:6
12th March L:6.5
13th March L:6,5/7  R: 5.5/6.5/6.5
14th March R:6
26th March L:6.5
27th March R:6 L:5.5
5th April L:6/5.5/7 R:6.5
6th April L:6.5/5.5 R: 6
7th April L:5/5.5/7 R:5.5/5.5
8th April L:7.5/7 R:6.5 
9th April L:7 
10th April R:6.5Listening: 7.5
11th April R:6 L:8 

Now the Writing and Speaking parts.
For the writing I got 2 of my writings reviewed by the great u/Hestia9285,and they been really useful to understand what were my problems.Then I used chatgpt, which doesn't give you an exact value sometimes I got 8 some others 6.5 as overall on the writing. My advice for you, is to be focused on the questions, NEVER start typing as soon as you get the track.First always UNDERSTAND the question, not following this advice will get you a really low score. 

For the speaking tests, I didn't use the Ready Premium platform a lot, since I needed to click every time to go to the next question, and it was kinda messy for me to focus on both, answering the questions, and move to the other page. So I'd advise you to just watch some Ielts videos on youtube, don't look at how much they score, just put yourself in their position, would you be able to keep a conversation with such questions?If not, keep practicing on them, and remember you have to sound natural, like an ordinary conversation, not like you were reading some notes. 
But my experience in english speaking was basically this: my teacher at highschool only spoke in english since he was from Washington and didn't want to speak italian.Another advantage I got is the ""Pokemon Unite"" discord group I'm in, where one of the rules is to only text/speak in english, this really helped me to improve my speeches/conversations. 

Now finished the preparation let's talk about the pre-test feelings.Did I have anxiety?Maybe I could sound confident, but I wasn't, we all have fear to fail, and this is natural, it means we are doing something so important for us that we'd be sad not to suceed in it. 
So I will tell you about my expectations.For starters I thought reading and writing would be my worst parts, probably 6 on both of them...moving to listening and reading, I really didn't know what to think.The scores on the ready premium platform were not constant. So I thought I'd take maximum 6,5 on both of them.


Speaking of the test day I reached the place with large advance, at 8:45 am, they called me(my test was scheduled for 9:00 am).For starters they scanned my ID(Warning: I'm italian so the documents needed may vary in other countries, please check on the official website if it's your case or not).Then I was introduced to the main room where I was asked to put EVERYTHING except,my bottle of water, a pencil  and ID(bring a transparent bottle, so no watertanks admitted, and remember to remove the brand envelop from the bottle) in a locker(bag,cellphone,purse as well).
Then I reached the test room, where a photo of me was taken and saved in their computers(I had some trouble because of my long hair and didn't have an elastic to collect my hair in a ponytail, so my hair was covering a bit my ears, but the examiner told me there was no problem), finally I had to sign as it is on my ID(you can't look at your ID while you sign).
Then your seat is assigned and you just have to stay quiet until everbody else is seated as well.
The test starts and since it's the listening, I don't have any kind of problems, reading as well, even though I wish I had a bit more of time(I had a problem when I couldn't text in the box, in the end I figured I just had to grab the given words to the box, just to let you know).
The very problem starts at the writing, I hear people typing so fast and strong that I really can't focus, I was having headache in that moment, and my ears were suffering. I managed to conclude, and I am supposed to wait for everyone to finish(The content of the writing was to compare two maps in different timelines, whilst the second part asked me if I preferred imported food or local food, and I had to explain what could get people more into local food).
The first part endured 2 hours and a half. 

After having lunch, I reach the test center and do all the lockers procedure, I wait and I get called.When I get in, the examiner tells me his name and some legal things about the registration that I honestly didn't listen to carefully.He then asked me what I prefered to be called(by name or surname). And the exam started, I had to say where I was from, and if I like to live in a flat or in a bungalow. And was about social medias today, and what I think about them, if I had them. The second part constisted in a question: ""What do you think about streetmarkets? What's the last thing you bought from there?""
And in the third part, he asked me if I was used to online shopping and why.Lastly he wanted to know if I think some times people buy thinks they don't need at all.
After telling me, the exam was over I greeted him and left.
These were my expectations after giving the exam: L:6,5; R:6; W:6; S:6,5. 

These thoughts were also affected by my Ielts Ready Premium results.
So after only 3 days I already got the results(and consider I had the test on Friday and got the results on Monday, so really fast, even with a week end in it).
Results: L:8,5; R:6,5; W:6,5; S:7,5; O:7,5. 

I was astonished by the results and had the feeling the Ielts Ready Premium platform was really hard, but I think it's a good thing since it does help you to improve more and more, so that you don't stop at the wanted result.
I know this post was too long and I probably bored you(I hope I did not).
If you have any questions please, feel free to ask me anything you need to know about this test, thay maybe I forgot to write. 

I would also like to thank u/Hestia9285, since my skills improved also because of her two posts about writing tips, which really helped me."

I don't want the curriculum to adapt to the usage of these language models. I want professors to find a way to eliminate it's usage among students entirely. I truly believe it's have a net negative result in academia.

I attend a community college. My major is IT and I cannot trust that the majority of my classmates know what they're talking about. It's almost maddening and I have to believe that if ChatGPT did not exist that these same students would have either tried to actually engage with the material or drop out entirely.

I had to do a group project for one of my network engineering classes. Fine. Upon meeting with the group it became increasingly evident that none of them knew anything about the class. They'd struggle to define the very basics to me and some of them hadn't even setup their development environments. This is the final project, worth 50% of my grade, and all of the work that my groupmates produced was both GPT generated and of poor quality.

There's no functional utility to be had by using ChatGPT to generate your code for you when you're a STUDENT LEARNING the basics of a programming paradigm/essay structure/project management etc. I've tried to have these conversations irl with my friends but they truly believe that they're benefiting from learning the material via ChatGPT."

A1 student. My teacher is having me learn the preferit and imperfect past tenses. He had me to write a story describing the best food I've had using past tenses of ser, estar, tener, etc.

I hope I did this correct. If not, I'd appreciate of someone can correct me. 😊

Hace dos años, fui a Alemania a un restaurante en Phoenix, AZ. Escuché asombrosas cosas sobre este restaurante. Así, estuve de camino al restaurante porque estaba mi primer tiempo probando comida Alemana. Durante mi tiempo allí, había personas ya comiendo, no estaba ocupada. Hube pedido Radeberger Pilsen mientras estaba amargo y fuerte. Sabía mal para mi.

Yo había pedido una entrada llamado un Pogi. Está lindo, dulce pero tan bueno. El pan estuvo ligeramente crujiente y suave. Después de eso, había pedido Pollo Papakash con pasta. Estuvo cremoso con muchos sabrosos, el pollo estuvo fácil de morder. El pollo estaba jugoso y muy delicioso. Tenía tantos sabrosos como puso juntos.  

También, probé Salchicas Ahumadas. Estuvo picante con ricos sabrosos. Estuvo variado repollo mientras estuvo ácido y blando. Sin embargo, el chucrut estaba bueno. Estaba cálido, suculento, y tampoco bueno.

Las papas fritas Alemanas estaban calientes con frescas pimienta negra y salada. El olor de papas fritas estuvo exquisito y se me hizo agua la boca. Fue la mejor parte de la comida. 

La parte triste de la parte fue que no tuvieron algo de postres. Una última cosa, probé stroganoff de ternera. El guisado tenía la ternera con fideos de huevos, cremosa y buena."

1c9wv3z,1,2024-04-21,Rule of the Sixth,u/mapmyhike,musictheory,https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/1c9wv3z/rule_of_the_sixth/,"Expanding on a previous post. 

The Ro6 is a rule, schema or regolé in the Partimento method of improvisation.  I'm not going to demonstrate with sheet music because I have found when people read notes they just see the dots and not the connection of all the notes and how they are related.  Partimento was developed by the church to provide orphans with skills to be professional musicians and composers after leaving the orphanage.  The children under the CONSERVATORSHIP of the church attended classes in a CONSERVATORY of the church.  Classes took ten years to complete and students emerged as master improvisors.  

Presuming you know all your scales we'll start in C Ionian or C major (C to C on all the white keys).  Since we are in C, we do not have any of the black keys at our disposal.  We are going to use the rule of the octave from C to C with the rule of the sixth superimposed on top of it.  

As you know, a simple chord consists of a 1, 3 and 5 of the scale.  For now, you don't need to know what chords you are playing, just enjoy making music.  So you have a 1 and 3 in your LH (CE) and the 5 (G) in your right.  The LH plays quarter notes and the RH plays quarters and halfs.  Make the 5 a 6 then drop the two LH notes down to the next available white key notes which will be B and D.  Because B is now in the bass the A which was a 6 is now a seventh.  Drop it down to the B's 6th (G).  Continue this for the whole octave.  

You can also invert the chords such as 1, 5, 10 but the focus is still on making the 5 a 6 then back to being  a sixth to the new bass note.  Try it also with 5, 8, 10.  

Did you know you can also go up the scale, too?  

Here is where it gets really fun.  Try it in C Aeolian Mode or C minor.  Now we have more than just white keys.  We have C D Eb F G Ab Bb C.   Use the same pattern of 1, 3 and 5.  Note that it does not matter if your chord is major or minor.  You must remain loyal to the scale.  Your new chord is C Eb G.  The C and Eb drop down to Bb and D while the G (5) moves up to the Ab (6th).  You are being a slave to the scale and the C Aeolian notes are all you have at your disposal.  It is a rule.  After you play it down an octave, try it up.  Try it inverted.  Spread the notes out.  

This was the first lesson children had under the conservatorship of the conservatory.   They would learn this rule in every key both major and minor and be encouraged to explore other modes.    The goal here is to have fun making music and not being a slave to notation or theory.  Although, there is a lot of underlying theory in this first of their lessons.  This is why Bach lectured his students for six months before he allowed them to touch a keyboard.  

Here is a comprehensive website.  There were over 800 rules in partimento but because students didn't take notes, most of the rules died with them.  Partimento died out at the end of the Baroque Era and beginning of the Classical Ear because of the Industrial Revolution.  Instruments could now be mass produced to exact measurements and inexpensively.  Everyone who wanted an instrument could have one but not everyone wanted to study theory for ten years so they acquiesced to the dot matching method.  If you see a C dot on a staff, match it to the appropriate C key.  No knowledge of theory required and music became dumbed down.   Just match dots.   Select colleges are now beginning to offer partimento but we'll never regain what was lost.  New rules are often fleshed out by studying the written works of former partimenti students.

After reading that page, click COLLECTIONS, HOME, FUGUE, THE COLLECTIONS, Master or Apprentice, Year, Country, and you can see and hear examples from actual competitions from the Baroque Era.  Some of them will blow your socks off or, make you realize . . . you (I) know nothing.  

Here is an example of Claude Debussy's attempt at a fugue.  He came in second with an honorable mention.  https://partimenti.org/fugue/collections/appr_paris/1882/debussy.html"

I've been teaching courses online since the start of online teaching years ago. I'd like to think I know what I'm doing. But after this semester, I'm legit stymied.

* If I assign a paper, they use ChatGPT (even reflection papers) and my university doesn't support us in pursuing academic dishonesty claims for AI written work. 
* If I assign a discussion board, they use ChatGPT and...still no university support. 
* If I assign a test, they copy it and put it on CourseHero or Quizlet or Chegg or whatever it is. (I'm on all of them with burner accounts; my stuff is readily avail. (Note also: we don't offer lockdown browser.)
* If I assign even simple-completion exercises, they use ChatGPT rather than thinking for themselves about a topic. 
* Sure, I can assign a creative endeavor (e.g. an infographic, a vlog, etc.) but I still see ChatGPT in there (or hear it as they're obviously reading the ChatGPT generated script from an off-camera source next to their laptops).

I have one class online rn where *no less* than 75% of them are cheating their way through the class.

I know I should stop caring more than my employer does because I get paid either way, but it's way easier to say that than to embrace it.

I'm sincere when I ask this: **what are people doing with their online classes to make students maintain even a shred of academic integrity in this environment ?** 

I'm open to redesigning this course, I just don't know how anymore. Every trick I have in my arsenal I've been outsmarted on. "

This is a throw-away account dahil alam ni jowa na I use reddit to read about motorcycle posts, buhay digital subreddits, etc.  
  
So a little about me (26M, fresh grad last year, working student) is that we've been together for almost a year.  
  
I decide to rent an apartment near her para naman whenever I'm free or mag aya siya kumain, we can go out easily dahil may motor naman ako na we can use kahit mcdo/jolibee/chowking lang or what. Atm, wala akong motor dahil hiniram ng jowa ng pinsan ko dahil papasok sa kasa yung sasakyan niya, for repair daw for 2-3 weeks so I said okay.  
  
A little something about her (23) is she started a business last December, I supported her through helping her fix her posts online, para presentable naman tignan at basahin ng mga clients niya. Now she has thousands of followers sa tiktok & ig combined. I gave her my computer table for her to use so she doesn't need to buy one na.  
  
I've set up her a free Calendly account as she used to list the appointments individually every day sa notes on her phone and it consumes too much of her time and would constantly update it whenever she needs to update her posts/themes/rules.  
  
Ngayon, I could say na she's famous na online for her business as has clients booked until May and so on. Which I'm really happy and proud of her dahil we're both fresh grads and she gets to earn 10-15k a week.  
  
So here's what happened..  
  
Around 3:30-ish AM, nag-order ako Chowking sa grab as I was really hungry. We were on a call na that time when she started talking about buying an ebike for 18k from a relative of hers. Sabi niya, she wants to buy it for herself din para daw makapunta siya to her brother's house (malapit lang dito), go around near our barangays to eat whenever she feels like it, and ayaw niya magcommute. So I said na oo, tama ka naman. You need to learn how to drive din sooner or later.  
  
May bank account siya with UnionBank pero di pa niya na rereceive yung debit card niya, kaya she can't withdraw from a bank pa. So she was then saying na makakapag cash out daw ba sa 7Eleven ng ganun kalaki. Kako (dahil AFAIK is hindi), hindi transfer mo na lang sakin yung 18k, ako na magwiwithdraw tapos dalhin ko diyan, meet mo na lang ako sa brgy hall niyo. She said sige, so I changed my clothes na agad. Di pako tapos kumain at this time tbh, di ko na lang sinabi dahil I sense the urgency dahil nabanggit niya na need na niya bayaran agad bago pa daw maka alis yung tita niyang nagbebenta nun. We were both okay pa at the time as we were both laughing and she also mentioned na gusto niyang bumili ng helmet na pang Vespa (sorry idk what it's called).  
  
I jokingly said to my cat na nasa computer table ko na, wait lang anak ah withdraw lang si daddy saglit at bibili si mama mo motor. I heard her laugh so I really thought na were okay.  
  
Naka call pa kami while I was walking to the ATM nung palapit na ako sa bank, I asked her sure ka na ba with this purchase? She said na oo. Natatawa pa siya while she was saying na impulsive yung pagkabili niya and ubos daw ipon niya this month.  
  
She sent me 18.2k, 18 for the ebike, 200 for the bank transaction fee and tric papunta sa kanila. Napa 3 attempts ako sa withdrawal dahil hindi pala nagdidispense yung ATM ng 200 so sabi ko maglalakad nako papunta diyan since malapit lang. Magtric na lang daw ako dahil malayo, bayaran na lang daw niya pag dating ko doon. So pumara nako tric, kako sa kaniya minsan nakakatakot pagiging impulsive mo sabay tawa bago ko sumakay. I was just repeating what she said from earlier about it being an impulsive purchase.  
  
Pag dating ko don, 30 lang yung tric wala akong barya dahil yung na withdraw ko lang talaga dala ko at the time. Luckily may barya siyang dala and yun binigay niya sa tric. Inabot ko yung pera, pina+bilang ko to her to be sure bago ako umalis. Edi okay na.  
  
Thank you sabi niya, tapos sabi pa niya sakin na bagay sayo yang gupit mo (yie keleg ang kuya mo hahahaha) I said bbye and held her head dahil di kami pwede makitang magkasama doon hahahah.  
  
Sabi niya balik ko na lang daw yung extra 200 from the bank kako oo babalik ko pag uwi ko.  
  
So ayun, tric from there to going back home was 50, may sukli pang 50 right? Right.  
  
Nagcocompute ako magkano ibabalik sa kaniya at nagkamali din me sa pagbibilang pero nasabi ko was 66 then changed it to 96 kasi nag abot nga pala siya 30 pagdating ko. Tas sabi niya 144 daw kasi minus yung bank transaction fee so I said okii po asawa and returned the change to her.  
  
I asked her if nakuha na niya yung ebike, mamayang hapon daw dahil naka alis na tita niya iiwan na lang daw niya yung money (idk if sa papa niya kasi narinig kong magkausap sila nung nasa tric na ako). Naka call pa kami pero di ko siya naririnig kaya binaba ko na and nagrereply naman siya sa chat.  
  
I then asked her if pwede makisuyo to buy cat food dahil mas mura nga doon sa kanila. If I buy sa kanila, 200 to 250 lang, dito aabot 300-400 ang 2kg.. If pamasahe naman, pwede ko naman lakarin kasi malapit lang, literally 15-20 min walk.  
  
She initially said yes then gave me valid reasons such as magkaiba oras natin sa work, sayang pamasahe natin kung dadalhin niya sakin or ako magcocommute going back and forth. Which I clearly understood. I kept saying okay asawa, no worries po asawa, don't worryyy, it's okay. Di pa din siya tumitigil, I just said na you can say no asawa kasi ganito, oki tapos na ganun lang. As I felt irritated na din kaya ko nasabi yun.  
  
At this point, she started sending VMs na lang.  
  
She kept on saying na whenever she achieves something, dapat daw ako din daw kasabay. Bukal naman sa loob ko and genuine yung mga gestures ko when I get stuff for her, be it yung food or money to jumpstart her business when she first started.  
  
Why can't I just be happy for her daw, before this conversation even started I messaged her na I'm happy for you asawa, I love youuu.  
  
I also tried naman multiple times to de-escalate the tension dahil alam ko ugali niya na she'll keep bringing that up kapag di niya magustuhan yung sasabihin ko in the future and ayoko lang din na tumagal pa yung away.  
  
Hindi ko lang gets bakit kelangan manumbat ng mga bagay bagay when I just asked for cat food dahil mas mura. I'll pay it back naman.  
  
May times na whenever she does this na-iiyak na lang ako dahil di ko na alam gagawin ko.  
  
Magaan lang work ko ngayon dahil EA ako sa isang firm sa US. I normally check 3-5 emails a day, check on VMs and inform the boss if he needs something, mag sschedule ng calendar invites/events/travel & hotel accommodations when he needs to fly over.  
  
Oo, I can take my work with me sa phone with me whenever. Wala naman akong time tracker dahil may mga access naman ako sa phone nung mga app.  
  
Ang sakit lang na sinabi niya na ""magaan trabaho mo, ako pagod ako buong araw pag nagstart na ako magwork"". Di ko naman binibring up yung mga ganung bagay dahil alam kong magka-iba kami ginagalawan.  
  
Ang sad lang na hindi naman niya na ggets yung initial point ko.  
  
Di ko na din sinasabi sa kaniya na I've been drinking again. Pa-isa isang bote araw araw para lang makatulog. Nagyoyosi na din ulit.  
  
Hindi stressful yung trabaho ko, oo. Pero yung pakikipag usap niya sakin na palaging iritado, nagtataas boses, wala na lang respeto to the point na kapag may nasabi ako na di niya gusto, babarahin na lang niya ako to the point na hindi na lang ako magsasalita and mag pphone na lang, yun yung nakakastress.  
  
Mahal ko siya oo, pero yung ganitong trato niya sakin na I always have to walk on eggshells is very difficult.

1cak3it,16,2024-04-22,Register for CS50x Workshop on AI,u/davidjmalan,cs50,https://www.reddit.com/r/cs50/comments/1cak3it/register_for_cs50x_workshop_on_ai/,"Live from Harvard University on Thursday, April 25, 2024 at 1:30 PM – 3:30 PM EDT, a CS50 workshop on artificial intelligence (AI) via Zoom and YouTube. Open to all.

Register at [https://cs50.ly/register](https://cs50.ly/register).

A workshop in two parts for CS50x students, teachers, and alumni. First, a look at how CS50 has incorporated artificial intelligence (AI), including its new-and-improved rubber duck debugger, and how it has impacted the course already. 🦆 Then, a hands-on introduction to implementing your own AI-based chatbot using OpenAI's APIs, maybe a duck or even a cat!

""In Summer 2023, we developed and integrated a suite of AI-based software tools into CS50 at Harvard University. These tools were initially available to approximately 70 summer students, then to thousands of students online, and finally to several hundred on campus during Fall 2023. Per the course's own policy, we encouraged students to use these course-specific tools and limited the use of commercial AI software such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and the new Bing. Our goal was to approximate a 1:1 teacher-to-student ratio through software, thereby equipping students with a pedagogically-minded subject-matter expert by their side at all times, designed to guide students toward solutions rather than offer them outright. The tools were received positively by students, who noted that they felt like they had 'a personal tutor.' Our findings suggest that integrating AI thoughtfully into educational settings enhances the learning experience by providing continuous, customized support and enabling human educators to address more complex pedagogical issues. In this paper, we detail how AI tools have augmented teaching and learning in CS50, specifically in explaining code snippets, improving code style, and accurately responding to curricular and administrative queries on the course's discussion forum. Additionally, we present our methodological approach, implementation details, and guidance for those considering using these tools or AI generally in education.""

Recording will be available on demand afterward.

1caq94t,44,2024-04-22,Is this appropriate?,u/Double-Craft-355,asl,https://www.reddit.com/r/asl/comments/1caq94t/is_this_appropriate/,"The local college is going to have the second year students do a “surprise” presentation on interpreting “Llama sex.” I totally understand that interpreters have to sign awkward and sometimes uncomfortable things. But the professors are inviting some of the local deaf community to come watch this presentation, and saying how it’s going to be a lot of fun and just in general painting it as a way to put the spotlight on the students and make them uncomfortable. Kind of a, “come watch them squirm” thing. I think it could be done in a more professional and educational way. Like, if they were interpreting about llama reproductive process. Still uncomfortable and would sign things the same way, but less “haha look at then”. If that all makes sense. I’m curious what others think. Oh, and I guess this is their final for the semester and they won’t know the topic until it begins 🤷🏻‍♀️"
1casviv,37,2024-04-22,My Three Houses and Three Hopes journey after losing a bet,u/icewomanthrowaway123,FireEmblemThreeHouses,https://www.reddit.com/r/FireEmblemThreeHouses/comments/1casviv/my_three_houses_and_three_hopes_journey_after/,"About two months ago, I made a [**post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/FireEmblemThreeHouses/comments/1b04nfh/i_lost_a_bet_and_i_need_to_play_this_and_three/) about having to play both *Three Houses* and *Three Hopes* after losing a bet.

Many have pointed that I am in for a ride and that it was a good bet to lose on. I couldn't agree more, I had a blast playing all four routes of *Three Houses* and all three routes of *Three Hopes*.

Before I started, I was introduced to characters pictures with no description. My first just showed me the pictures of each of the characters and had me comment my thoughts on them. My initial thoughts on them will be listed at the bottom of this post.

My first route was the *Silver Snow* route, as without spoiling anything, my friend told me that it was the first route designed for the game. She (my friend) told me that I needed to pick the *Black Eagles* to access this route. She; however, did not tell me anything about the story or branching path of *Black Eagles*, she just told me to let her know (she said I'll know when I'll need to let her know). When I got to the part where I had to part ways with Edelgard and Hubert, this made me sad, as I grew to like them both. But in the end, I think it painted the picture of leaving your student behind very well. Overall, I was genuinely surprised how good it was and had me wanting more. As this was my first route, I didn't really do too much research on anything, so stuff like who I recruited, which classes my units ended up in, and which paired endings they got was limited.

After my first playthrough, I was initially going to play the *Crimson Flower* route, to see the other side of the coin. But I wanted to check out the DLC, which my friend told me that's a good idea, as it can add some extra spice to the main game after completing the DLC. So I decided to play the *Cindered Shadows* DLC. This was a nice surprise, as I didn't get to pick my house at the start, as started with three houses leaders and their companions. This I thought was a good experience, as I got to see how the three houses leaders interreacted with each other when working for the same goal. I also really liked the four DLC characters and the new classes they came equipped with. Overall, a very good intermission from the main game, where the exploration portion was tremendously cutdown and focused more on battle after battle, which I didn't really mind (my friend told me this is how some of the older *Fire Emblem* games are like). This really got me to appreciate not only the three lords, but also the new DLC characters, which I couldn't wait to meet in the main game.

Next I played the *Verdant Wind* route. I was originally going to play *Crimson Flower* next to experience the other side of the *Black Eagles*, but after playing *Cindered Shadows*, I changed my mind, as I wanted to learn more about the other characters. *Verdant Wind* was also the route some of you suggested that I play first, but after my friend told me *Silver Snow* was the first route designed, I wanted to experience the game's first route (sorry friends). The only thing that my friend told me about this route was it shared a lot of similarity to the *Silver Snow* route with some changes, so I may be a little burnt out. This didn't really bother me, and I saw it more as a positive. As I was going blind on my first playthrough, I wanted to learn from my mistakes and play the game with a little bit more knowledge. Overall, I think this was a better experience (gameplay wise). I felt I had more control on customization, who to use for which map and stuff like that. I don't really mind that it felt similar to *Silver Snow*; but, I just wish it dove a bit more into Claude's ideal and values.

After getting a glimpse of angry boy Dimitri from playing the other routes, I really wanted to know why he was so upset. Naturally, I played the *Azure Moon* route next. This was when I really started to get a hang of things and really started doing some research about classes and the strengths and weakness about each unit. I will say this route was probably the route where a lot of research and planning came before hand. I think it was a good route, just learning more about the inner turmoil of Dimitri and his past. Overall, it felt darker and more emotional than *Verdant Wind*. Of course, this isn't anything against *Verdant Wind* or Claude, just a different experience. Whereas, Claude is more chill and knows what he wants, and on the other hand Dimitri's story painted a picture of a broken man finding himself again.

With playing three routes preceding this, I was actually exited to play *Crimson Flower* the most. With already  forming a bond with Edelgard and Hubert prior, I really wanted to know how their story further developed. I don't want to sound like I am an Edelgard super fan or whatever, but I actually really liked this route. Her ideals of removing the crest system, her sad past, and her motivation to cut through a new path is what I found really compelling. No, I'm not saying I agree with everything she does (I actually disliked how secretive she is, even to her trusted allies / friends). But overall, I think the *Crimson Flower* route is the best overall path for the future of Fódlan. No, this doesn't mean I think it was the best route. There are several things I disliked about this route. I wish it was longer, explored more on Edelgard's motivation and her conflict with *TWSITD* (instead of living that behind an epilogue). Another criticism I had on this route is that it never felt like I was on the losing side and it was always about ""win, win, win"". Which I guess it makes sense on story based, as Edelgard's army is on the winning side to begin with. This again comes down to if it was longer and dove more into the *TWSITD* story.

Overall, I was actually very surprised with this game. All routes had their own story to tell. With each route missing a piece of a puzzle and each lord not knowing the full truth made me want to play all routes. I actually don't know if I have a favorite route. Each route didn't feel complete, which I both liked and disliked. I liked it as it made me want to play the other routes, but I disliked it, as I just wish they would touch up or expand upon some of the lord's story (especially the *Crimson Flower* route).

I'm not going to retell my experience of *Three Hopes* much. Not because I didn't enjoy this game (I actually thought it was really good), but because I have similar opinions for each route (minus the non-existing *Silver Snow* route). I really did like the whole ""what if"" and alternate path of each route. It was a nice break coming out from playing a tactics game. Some of the retelling of the stories is what I really enjoyed. It was also interesting that Claude is for Edelgard this time, instead of against (which makes more sense in my opinion).

As listed at the beginning of this post, here are my first impression of each characters. I took notes for each character that she showed me and here are the first impression of the characters, purely based on their character art.

**Black Eagles**

* Edelgard – She looks cute, serious and confidant. Gave off a strong independent woman vibe. Maybe she has a clear vision of what she wants. Maybe there's something bigger she is fighting for.
* Hubert – Looks like he is hiding something. Maybe he is a bad guy? But I don't know, that seems too predictable. Just seemed like a dark and secretive guy.
* Ferdinand – Seems very sure about himself, but not in a cocky way. Maybe he is serious about his ideals and want what's best for the future?
* Linhardt – Seems very serious and typical ""office worker"" vibe. Not really here to bother anyone, just here to get the job done. Just a simple guy.
* Caspar – Like Ferdinand, seems very sure about himself, maybe a little bit cocky and too confidant in his ability? Seems like a fun character and just wants to have fun.
* Bernadetta – Seems very shy and unsure about herself and the world. Maybe she is very anxious and lived a sheltered life? She wants to be alone, don't want to be bothered. Maybe she has few hidden talents that she doesn't even know about and is unwilling to explore them.
* Dorothea – Like Edelgard, she looks cute and confidant. Maybe not as serious as Edelgard. But she seems she also knows what she wants. Maybe a little bit flirty and knows she is cute.
* Petra – Gave off similar vibe as Hubert, minus the bad guy vibe. Seems serious and she could be up to something, not sure.

**Blue Lions**

* Dimitri – Seems serious, handsome, a nobleman vibe. Maybe he just wants to fight for what is right and is all about fighting for righteousness and justice.
* Dedue – Very serious about what he does. Likes to keep his feeling to himself and doesn't really want others to be concerned about him. Doesn't necessarily seem like a bad or a mean guy, just serious and all about getting the job done.
* Felix – Very serious, doesn't wants to be bothered or bother anyone else. Doesn't seem like a bad guy, just doesn't care for how others think of him. Maybe a little bit cold? Perhaps he has a dark past.
* Ashe – Seems humble, tries to see brighter side of life. Doesn't seem like a jokester, yet it seems like he really cares for his friends. Overall seems well mannered and friendly.
* Sylvain – Seems like the male counterpart of Dorothea. He knows he is a good looking guy, and likes to flirt. He also seems kind and cares for his friends.
* Mercedes – Very kind and wants the best for her friends. Maybe a little bit more mature than others, just here for a good time.
* Annette – Seems cute and kind hearted. Maybe she is a little bit clumsy. She seems like she a kind person and maybe a little bit introverted and is creative.
* Ingrid – Similar to Edelgard, seems cute and confidant in herself. But also similar to Dimitri, where she is noble and wants to fight for righteousness.

**Golden Deer**

* Claude – Seems like a trickster, maybe he like to play few jokes on people. He looks much more lax and here for a good time and maybe doesn't takes himself too seriously. Doesn't seem like a bad guy and treats his friends with respect.
* Lorenz – Seems like a snobby nobleman and acts like he is above everyone else. He seems like the type that only hangs around other nobleman and sees others as below him. Not necessarily a bad guy, but maybe arrogant and doesn't know too much about the world outside of his nobleman life.
*  Raphael – He seems strong, kind, and wants to be friends with everyone. That typical ""gentle giant"" vibe. Maybe he doesn't know how strong he is and due to this, have gotten himself in trouble by being clumsy and breaking stuff. Also makes me wonder, do they not make shirts big enough for him or does he just likes tight shirts?
* Ignatz – Seems kind and giving off typical ""bookworm"" vibe. Maybe he lacks in confidants and second guesses himself. Perhaps he is more about theory crafting and tactics building, rather than actually being able to battle for himself. Not necessarily a schemer, but maybe an adviser for his teammates.
* Lysithea – She seems cute and serious. It looks like she may not want people's help and want to do things on her own. Maybe she is a little bit mean and/or bossy but means well. Giving off typical ""tsundere"" vibe and doesn't know how to show her true feelings well. Perhaps wants to go far and beyond to prove herself.
* Marianne – Seems very sad and depressed. Maybe she has been through some stuff and has seen some stuff that has traumatized. Maybe she is also strong but doesn't show it, due to lacking in confidants. Seems introverted and doesn't wants to bothered by anyone or be a bother to anyone else. Maybe she has a growth arc? I hope she does.
* Hilda – Cute and she knows it. Maybe similar vibe to Dorothea and Hilda, where she knows this. Probably flirty and a little bit ""girly"". Maybe she uses this to her advantage to get close with people? Doesn't seem like a devious person, but maybe a little bit shallow.
* Leonie – Very serious and knows what she want. It looks like she want to prove herself to be the best. Maybe a cross between Edelgard and Dimitri, whereas she is strong and independent and also fights for righteousness.

**Church of Seiros**

* Rhea – She seems kind and very generous. Perhaps she a queen of a nation? Not really sure what to make of her. Seems very bland, not necessarily boring, but doesn't really stand out as much, outside of her being kind and generous.
* Seteth – Very serious and administrative. Maybe he has a hidden motive? It looks like he has some life experience, very tactical and clever.
* Flayn – Very cute and maybe a little bit naive. She seems very kind hearted and maybe soft spoken. She seems like she will always find a positive side of life and wants to be friends with everyone.
* Hanneman – Like Seteth, very serious and administrative. Seems very serious about his work, had some experience in life. Just that typical ""old school"" professor vibe. Very wise and can rely on for advice.
* Manuela – Seems flirty and uses her looks to get what she wants. She also seems confidant and doesn't really care if she gets judged.
* Gilbert – Seems very serious and maybe has some inner turmoil. Doesn't seem like a bad guy, but it seems like he has been through some stuff. He could be also administrative like Seteth and Hanneman. Also seems a bit mysterious, perhaps doesn't like sharing too much about himself.
* Alois – Seems like a good guy and wants to be friends with everyone. He does seem knightly, but maybe doesn't takes himself too seriously and in it more for the glory rather than the pride of being a knight. Giving off that cool guy vibe.
* Catherine – Similar vibes to Alois. Seems like a good person, maybe more serious than Alois. Not really sure what else to add. Doesn't seem like a bland character, just seems like a more serious version of Alois.
* Shamir – Very cool character, seems serious. Not necessarily mean, but maybe she can be a bit cold. Perhaps similar to Felix? She just seems like the type that just wants to get the job done and fight.
* Cyril – Just seems like a bratty kid. I don't want to sound too harsh, but maybe he is a bit cocky and annoying. Perhaps he is similar to Lysithea, in a sense that he wants to prove himself. Who knows, he may have a deeper character arc.

**Other characters** / **DLC**

* Jeralt – Seems like a serious knightly figure. Perhaps he is hiding something and has other motives. Doesn't necessarily seem like a bad guy, just a bit mysterious. Perhaps other knights look up to him and a mentor?
* Jeritza – Seems very serious and maybe has some dark plans? I don't know, maybe that's a bit too predictable. Overall, similar vibes to Hubert, he could be hiding something.
* Anna – Very cute and serious. She seems like a strong independent woman like the likes of Edelgard and Leonie. It seems she knows what she wants and confidant in herself.
* Monica – Very cute and maybe shy? Kind of giving off Ignatz vibe, where she seems like a ""bookworm"" and more strategic and tactical. Perhaps another adviser like character.
* Tomas – Just seems like an old religious guy. Maybe he is very wise. Nothing much really, perhaps he plays as another strategic, tactical, adviser character.
* Arundel – Seems like a typical nobleman. Maybe similar to Lorenz? He doesn't seem as snobby, but seems like he has some dark plans. Something about him just sits ill with me.
* Cornelia – I can see her being similar to Manuela, where she flirts to get what she wants. She also doesn't look sincere and perhaps has some dark secrets?
* Rodrigue – Seems like a reliable man. Maybe he is similar to Alois and Catherine, whereas he is just a good guy. He does seem to take himself seriously, though.
* Judith – Seems like the more serious version of Manuela. Maybe she is slightly less flirty? I could also see her being an administrative (like Seteth or Hanneman) or a tactical planning character (like Ignatz or Monica). 
* Nader – Seems like a cross between Alois and Jeralt. He seems like a fun knightly type who doesn't takes himself too seriously, but when he hits the battlefield, he is ready to go.
* Yuri – Seems very cunning and like a trickster, similar to Claude. I can also see him being slightly flirty, like Sylvain. He does seem like a good guy, but maybe a little hard to read.
* Balthus – Seems like a more serious version of Raphael. It just seems like he wants to have a good time and just fight. Overall seems like a good guy.
* Constance – Seems like the female counterpart of Ferdinand. She seems very self confidant, but not in a cocky way.
* Hapi – Seems like a cross between Linhardt and Caspar. Whereas she seems like the type where she doesn't want to bother anyone, yet at the same time seems like a fun character."

They tell me the effort is no longer there. 
No one reads. No one can retain information. Theyre have been faculty assaults in my brother's school over the confiscating of phones. My friend said their reading level is at an 8th grade level or less for college students. Chatgpt has replaced their work.  

Does anyone else notice this decline?  
Any examples? "
1cbapdu,3,2024-04-23,I NEVER had depression before but it's starting now. What can I do to stop things getting worse?,u/_KidGod_,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cbapdu/i_never_had_depression_before_but_its_starting/,"I'm on a gap year from university in the UK with 1 exam deferred that I'm doing soon. I've been really down and feeling like shit every day for the past 2 weeks with no idea what the exact cause is because it doesn't seem to be exam stress (for reasons ill get onto later)  
  
All my life I'd describe my default mood as neutral/slightly happy. I have a lot of issues that I've been dealing with and dealt with (being a black closeted gay from a super religious family, growing up experiencing racism, bullying, s\*xual a\*\*ault, having a really horrible experience losing the only friendship group who knew who I truly was) but for the most part I'm a normal and healthy person.  
  
This past week or two has been default mood miserable/frustrated. Every 10 mins I feel like screaming. My head on default just kind of hurts but not in a ""hurts enough to get paracetamol"" pain, it's just slightly mellower than that. I can't concentrate on work effectively. I fidget constantly, which never happened before. It's not anxiety. Every few minutes I get desperate to do something that makes me feel like less shit which ends up distracting me from work. I also think about awful things more often. Like how shit the world is regarding some recent events. How no one really knows the real me and if i died today they would never know. How no matter what I do I'll fail because I'm systematically at odds from ever having financial freedom no matter how meticulously I try to plan my future career. I'm talentless, worthless, I don't work hard enough, etc. These are not uncommon thoughts for me but they are bombarding me much more recently. It's quite subtle too. It's like I don't even give these thoughts a voice, but they just happen quietly like whispers, and then I get a kneejerk physical reaction to them every few minutes followed by a heave, sigh and laying my head on my desk and wallowing in pain for several minutes. Rinse and repeat.  
  
This is all new to me and I don't really know what to do! I'm clearly mentally well enough to not seek emergency mental health services. The wait times for NHS mental health services is atrocious and I'd feel guilty draining precious resources from people who need it more than me. I can't afford anything private. My GP is kind of an awful person who I'm not comfortable with and I've been meaning to change to another practice but kept putting it off, even then I doubt theyd help me. I have no friends to talk to. I keep my family at an arms length from understanding my psyche for many reasons I won't get into. I already engage/have engaged with several lifestyle habits that promote good mental and physical health (I meditate, go running, eat healthy altho I'm still trying to lose weight, I sleep well although I have very volatile sleeping patterns because Ramadan was a bitch, I self reflect a lot and talk to myself everyday and keep an extensive diary).  
  
Its not academic stress either. I'm not particularly scared of this exam. I've been a mediocre student for the past 2 years of my degree and I've only started to learn how \*not\* to be when I started actually liking my course near the end of last year. In fact, I dedicated a lot of time recently to learning HOW to study effectively and curate resources for myself to actually enjoy this originally very shitty module for me. So studying is actually kinda fun for me now. Furthermore, I don't care that much about the exam because I don't think i'll fail it, nor do I need a particularly high grade on this exam because my second year grade percentages only marginally go towards my degree qualification. What's more important for me is to learn good study habits now so I can hopefully ace my final year. BUT I CANT DO THAT WHEN I FEEL LIKE ABSOLUTE SHITE ALL THE TIME.  
  
It's arrogant as fuck but it feels like I do everything right regarding my health, so why are things still going wrong? The only thing I don't do is talk to people but the solitude filled live Ive been living has been serviceable for me in many ways. I know this isn't especially healthy as honest human communication is very important but this was something I intended to change once I returned to university. Finding good friends is really fucking hard even on internet spaces, and I'm really particular about who I choose to be friends with. Since I have no one to talk to but you guys and chatgpt, what do you think I can do? I don't want things getting worse than they are now! Im extremely worried my negative self monologuing will lead to a self fulfilling prophecy where I end up with much more severe depression. I know this is a really early time to make this post and i'll probably be advised to see how i feel in a couple weeks time after my exam is done, but my fear is that these same feelings of depression will happen to me in my final year of university, where there is soooo much more pressure on me to patch up my mediocre grrades from second year. And if i feel like this for that whole year then I know things will get so much worse.  
  
\*\*TLDR: I feel like shit every day and think really bad thoughts but this has only started two weeks ago and I fear if I don't do anything now things will only get worse. I don't know what resources i have access to besides you guys.\*\*"
1cbdr6c,1,2024-04-23,All of my handwritten essays are being flagged as AI-written.,u/Ok-Permission1883,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1cbdr6c/all_of_my_handwritten_essays_are_being_flagged_as/,"I’m an 11th-grade APUSH student. We have done around 110 assignments in that class so far, all of which have been writing assignments. Recently, I submitted an essay and my teacher returned it, saying it was flagged as AI. He says he is going to go through every past assignment now to check if they are AI. The problem is, I use the same language and voice for every writing assignment I’ve written. He basically says my writing is “too good”. I don’t know what to do. I’m a straight-A student who prides herself in her writing and as i run these assignments through AI trackers myself, every single one is coming back as at least 80% AI-written. I swear on everything I have never used AI for an assignment. I have no idea what to do. I don’t know how to prove my innocence. I use professionally written papers as reference for my own writing style and that strategy is coming back to bite me in the ass because I’m learning ChatGPT does the same. I can’t find the time to rewrite everything if I have to. I did it all myself. I’m so scared. I don’t want to get in trouble because of something I never did. Please help."
1cbdzgc,2,2024-04-23,Class did bad on an assignment and now is freaking out ,u/firewall245,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1cbdzgc/class_did_bad_on_an_assignment_and_now_is/,"I suppose this is the bed I made and now need to lie in. I teach a proof based math class for computer science majors, so many students struggle with thinking in the way that is required for the problems.

As such, my office hours the days that assignments are due are filled with students asking for help because they are struggling to understand and need heavy hand holding. This also always comes after two weeks of the assignment being posted and getting no emails from anyone at all asking for assistance. This aspect could partially be on me though as since I only teach part time and have a 9-5 my office hours are very limited. 

I normally don’t mind the hand holding as I’d rather them get a walk through from me where they have to learn it, rather than chatGPT where they’d learn nothing. 

That being said this past assignment was a code assignment in which I gave them 2 challenging code problems (one leetcode one icpc) that they had to solve. Due to just extenuating circumstances I was unable to hold office hours for this assignment, but felt confident that since they were CS majors they could figure it out.

Well I was mistaken, the class collectively did horrible. Everyone except two students got the icpc question wrong, and half of the students got the leetcode question wrong, which is also a modified version of a problem that we had gone over in class already in the semester. 

With the second problem I can kind of understand as the wording was fairly confusing, but in the class period before it was due I walked through examples, and nobody reached out over email. I think they were waiting for office hours and when I didn’t hold them they were screwed. 

For the first problem it was a clear case of them not checking their code. Everyone’s solution passed the example test cases in the file, but even basic modifications to them would have shown their solution was wrong. 

Now I’m not sure what to do because it has tanked collectively nearly everyone’s grades by docking around 3.5% from everyone’s final average. 

I feel bad but also frustrated enough where I don’t know if I want to shown mercy by offering extra credit or something "
1cbfgla,849,2024-04-23,Soooooo people are really just cheating their way through NURSE PRACTITIONER school?,u/Concept555,nursing,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1cbfgla/soooooo_people_are_really_just_cheating_their_way/,"*Let me first say that some nurse practitioners are highly intelligent and dedicated individuals who love medicine, love learning pathophysiology and disease processes, and bring pride to their practice. There are several specialty NP's that I look up to as extremely intelligent people, a few of them work Intensivist/Pulmonology, another worked Immunology. Extremely smart people.*   

Alright so I've been an RN on my unit for 6 years now and I've seen a lot of coworkers ascend the ladder to Nurse Practitioner. Being the curious one that I am, I ask a lot of questions. Here are some commonalities I've seen in the last 3 years, particularly the last 6 months:

1. All the online diploma mill schools (WGU, South, Chamberlain, etc) - the answers to most/all the tests are on quizlet, and the ""work at your own pace"" style learning has nurses completing their degree in 6-12 months by power-cheating their way through the program. 

2. ChatGPT 4.0 is so advanced now that with a little tweaking and custom prompting it will write 90% of your papers for you, and the grading standards at these schools is so low that no one cares. Trust me, I've used GPT extensively, please save the ""instructors can tell"" and ""they have tools to detect that"" comments- this is my area of expertise and I am telling you only the laziest copy/paste students get caught using GPT, and the only recourse a school has if they think you've used GPT is to make you come in for a proctored rewriting of the essay, which none of these diploma mill schools will ever do.

3. The internship of 500-1000 hours is hit or miss depending on the physician you're working with, and some NP students choose to work with other NPs as their clinical supervisor. Some physicians will take the time to help you connect complex dots of medicine, while others will leave you writing notes all day. 

  
So now they've blasted their way through NP school and they buy U-World or one of the other study programs, cram for 2-3 months, and take the state boards to become an NP. Some of them go on to practice independently, managing complex elderly patients with 15+ medications and 7+ chronic medical problems, relying mostly on UpToDate or similar apps to guide their management of diseases.   

  

Please tell me where I'm wrong? "
1cblgxi,85,2024-04-23,I’ve reviewed hundreds of international students’ applications from here on r/IntlToUSA and elsewhere. Here are the 10 biggest mistakes applicants and families make.,u/AppHelper,IntltoUSA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/1cblgxi/ive_reviewed_hundreds_of_international_students/,"## Introduction 

Both [this year](https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/1bq97pv/didnt_get_into_your_top_choices_or_just_want_help/) and [last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/126hryz/didnt_get_the_results_you_wanted_or_do_you_just/), I offered to review 50 applications of students who were puzzled with their results or just wanted some guidance on their choices. Between these and other applications I review as part of my work, I’ve read hundreds of complete application packages (or all except letters of recommendation). Although I haven’t personally worked as an admissions officer, I’ve sat down (virtually) with former admissions officers from MIT, Stanford, Yale, Cornell, and UChicago to go through dozens of my students’ applications, so I have a good idea of what top schools are looking for. We typically spend about half an hour discussing each application, a similar amount of time to a real application review.

I’m privileged to be able to work with a wide range of applicants and families every year: those from “feeder” schools and those who are the first to apply abroad from their high school; politically connected families and members of persecuted minorities; children of C-level executives at Fortune Global 500 companies and those whose parents were farmers or soldiers and need full-ride scholarships. I don’t envy the job of admissions officers who must choose from among such an extraordinarily talented and diverse applicant pool. 

This post is an overview of the mistakes and weaknesses I tend to see, particularly where outcomes are not as expected based on a student’s profile. A lot of this is based on intuition and pattern-recognition rather than quantification, but that reflects the subjective process itself. I generally combine this outlook with a data-driven approach (more on that in future posts).

There are two important principles to remember about colleges when you think about the admissions process and evaluate what admissions representatives tell you:

1) Colleges are businesses, not charities.

2) Colleges try to maintain an appearance of fairness while implementing admissions policies that are unfair by design.

In general, international students applying to competitive universities and/or seeking financial aid need to:

1) Demonstrate that they are, without a doubt, prepared for a rigorous liberal arts curriculum.

2) Establish that they would contribute to their campus as representatives of their country.

These principles will crystallize as I discuss mistakes students and families make throughout the admissions process. 

## Mistake #1: Improperly addressing or attempting to compensate for low grades

If you’re aiming for the most competitive colleges and/or generous financial aid packages, you need a stellar academic record. For the most competitive programs, it’s very difficult to overcome low grades. Introducing so-called “excuses” such as family stresses and mental health issues may actually do more harm than good. Colleges want to accept students who perform well under pressure. So, while a dip in grades might be understandable, there are likely other applicants out there who faced similar circumstances and did not see their grades drop. Acute illness during exam season may be an acceptable reason for a low grade or two, but chronic health issues (mental or physical) don’t instill confidence that you will maintain consistent academic performance. If such a condition has been treated, sufficient documentation of this treatment and a positive prognosis is advised.

There’s also, in my opinion, an over-reliance on predicted grades, especially after a relatively weaker 11th grade result. Yes, you and/or your counselor can explain grading practices such as grade deflation in 11th, but at the end of the day, there are applicants at other schools (and likely even your school) who have a better record. The only way to compensate for lower 11th grade marks is with a full year of 12th grade marks. In the past I’ve seen Indian CBSE students with 11th grade marks in the 80s or even high 70s get into Ivies. It still happens, but it’s much rarer now. Sometimes I even recommend that families avoid sending their children to schools that practice this type of grade deflation if they have the choice.

## Mistake #2: Not maximizing standardized test scores

I know this sounds trivial, but there is strategy involved. 

If you’re an international student coming from a curriculum other than IB, standardized tests should be considered a requirement even at test-optional schools. A high score in the SAT RW section especially can help AOs feel confident that you are ready to perform as well as your American and other international peers.

I don’t have enough data to determine whether applying test-optional helps or hurts students with any given score; only colleges themselves will have this data (and I promise you they don’t want to release it). Whether you should submit that 790/730 is context-dependent. In general, the 25th percentile score should be seen as a “floor” and the 75th percentile score as a target. Remember, these are the percentiles for *enrolled* students, not admitted applicants. Yield will tend to be higher among students with relatively lower scores because they’re less likely to have better options, and lower among students with relatively higher scores because they’re more likely to have equal or better options. This means that the average score of *admitted* students is much higher than published percentile numbers would suggest. Typically, the lower 25th percentile is mostly comprised of recruited athletes and U.S. citizens traditionally referred to as “underrepresented minorities.” International students contribute to campus diversity, but they don’t contribute to diversity statistics collected by the U.S. government or used in rankings by influential publications like U.S. News & World Report. There is very little room for international students in the bottom 25% of the standardized test range.

I’m not going to say much more about this because colleges are re-instituting their testing requirements, but a big mistake I see students making is applying too early and not giving themselves time to improve their standardized test scores. And this doesn’t mean just EA/ED vs. RD. Even if the only reason for a gap year is to be able to get a higher score on the SAT/ACT, that may still confer an advantage. (The UCs, the only highly competitive universities that officially didn’t accept test scores taken after senior year, no longer use test scores at all.)

## Mistake #3: Submitting low or no English proficiency scores

The liberal arts curricula at top universities in the U.S. place a large emphasis on small, seminar-style classes with frequent interaction among students and instructors, and engineering schools and CS programs focus heavily on group projects where effective communication is important. Proficiency in reading, writing, speaking, and listening is thus critical.

Because of ChatGPT and other writing aids, admissions officers do not have many indicators left of whether your English is good enough to succeed at a top university in the United States. In order to dispel any doubt about academic preparedness, every student not from the United States, Canada, the UK, Ireland, Australia, or New Zealand should take an English proficiency test. Yes, even if your country is mostly English-speaking. Yes, even if you grew up with English as your first language. Yes, even if your medium of instruction is English. Yes, even if you’re in an IB, A-Level, or American curriculum. Yes, even if you have an 800 on the SAT RW and/or 36 on the SAT English and Writing. No exceptions. 

For competitive undergraduate programs, scholarships, and financial aid, it **does** matter how well you do. Competitive applicants for T20s and aid-granting LACs will have TOEFL of 110+ (with no less than 26 in each section), IELTS of at least 8.0 in each section, or Duolingo English Test of at least 145 in each section. The Writing and Production sections tend to be the most challenging for international students. I recommend TOEFL for most applicants, with IELTS being a reasonable alternative if you’re applying to Commonwealth countries as well. I advise completing the DET only if the other options would be a huge financial burden. 

I frequently encounter students with excellent real-world English conversational ability but low English proficiency scores. Most often, this is due to the test being taken as the student was improving their English and/or didn’t think to retake the test because they achieved the minimum for the schools they were applying to.

I’d be happy to learn about exceptions where students with lower scores got into T20s and full rides from LACs. However, I’ve seen applications where the only perceptible weakness was an IELTS Writing score of 6.5, 7.0, or even 7.5. 

We’ll get to essays and the other written parts of the application, but the better they are, the bigger a red flag a low English proficiency score will be.

## Mistake #4: Not conducting a pre-recorded interview to demonstrate English proficiency and social skills

An increasing number of colleges are accepting InitialView and other pre-recorded interviews. For those unfamiliar, these give students an opportunity to demonstrate their conversational, on-the-spot thinking, and social skills with a largely unscripted interview with a live person. (The general topics are pre-selected randomly, but the follow-up questions are chosen by the interviewer.) The InitialView service was conceived as a way to assure colleges that Chinese students actually spoke English amid concerns over rampant test-cheating and questionable admissions practices. However, this type of service has become useful colleges and a wide range of students both international and domestic, especially in the age of ChatGPT. (I have no affiliation with InitialView.)

These interviews serve a different function from alumni interviews: alumni interviews are not recorded, and the interviewer’s report may or may not include detailed information about the applicant’s demeanor and conversational skills. Recorded interviews are reviewed by the decision-makers, making them an increasingly important part of the admissions process. It’s the component of the application with the closest to a guarantee that “what you see is what you get.”

If you think you might struggle to do well with such a recorded interview, consider taking the time to work on language proficiency and/or social skills until you would. Getting in without one is certainly possible, but understand that without reliable evidence about your preparedness for a college environment, preparedness will always be a “question mark.”


## Mistake #5: Trying to fit too much information into the extracurricular activity section

With a 150-character limit for activity descriptions on the Common App, applicants must strike a balance between information density and communication clarity. While most applications I reviewed did a good job at this, there were a few where I had to read descriptions several times to understand what the activity was. You want the reader to understand the first time they read it. It’s not so much about “scoring points” and amassing accomplishments as it is creating an impression about your passions and how you spent your time. There is an “Additional Information” section with plenty of space for details. The EC section is your first opportunity for AOs to get to know you, and it was disheartening to see students who thought they were highlighting their impressive accomplishments, when what they were mostly doing was tripping up and frustrating their application reader.

**Keep abbreviations, acronyms, and initialisms to those that are widely recognized among American admissions officers even if they are not familiar with your region.** For example, “NASA” is fine, but don't use “ISRO” without writing the full name somewhere. There may be acronyms you’re so used to because of regional use or meaning within your niche, so it's helpful here to have an American-born adult review your application. There are a lot of subtleties. For example, it’s probably fine these days to abbreviate artificial intelligence as “AI,” but I don't recommend using “ML” for machine learning. You can use ampersands for “and,” “~” for “approximately,"" and “+” as shorthand for ""over"" (as in “10+ awards”), but try not to use too many symbols. Even if grammatically and logically correct, too much abbreviation can lead to confusion and frustration.

## Mistake #6: Sloppiness and missing easily fixed mistakes

Admissions officers will tell you to proofread your application–and they mean it. You have months to complete your application, and if you are indeed a top competitive applicant, there is no excuse for anything but a perfectly polished application. Thanks to modern writing aids, essays tend to be much less typo and error-ridden than they used to be. But students often forget to carefully check their EC section. Here are some common yet easily avoidable mistakes:

* Extra spaces at the end of the “Position/Leadership Description” and “Organization Name” fields (which show up before the commas).
* Extra space between paragraphs. The Common App automatically adds space between paragraphs. Including an extra line between paragraphs results in sloppy formatting.
* Improper capitalization (in some countries too much capitalization, in other countries missed capitalization). I won’t go through capitalization conventions, but the most common rule I’ve seen broken is that that **the names of subjects (e.g. math, physics, computer science) are **not** capitalized unless they include otherwise proper nouns/adjectives** (e.g. English, Greek, American history, Middle Eastern studies).
* Improper use of currency symbols. In most English conventions, the currency symbol/abbreviation goes **before** the numerical figure ($500 not 500$). Also, adding “dollars” is redundant (as in “$500 dollars”), and not using a currency symbol is considered incorrect unless the application doesn’t support the symbol. Also, if you include figures in your local currency, also include roughly equivalent USD amounts. Even if they’ve been to India, for example, AOs don’t necessarily know what “1 lakh INR” means.
* Inconsistent use of upper and lower-case K/k to indicate “thousand.” This can get confusing because the SI prefix for one thousand is “k” (as in “km” for kilometers), and lower-case “k” is commonly used in finance, commodities, and commerce. However, a capital “K” is more often used for long-distance runs (5K, 10K, etc.), social media metrics (“100K followers”), and advertisements (“win a $10K scholarship”). In my opinion, a capital K looks “cleaner” in the EC section, but consistency is also important.

Several of the students who signed up for application reviews had hired other professional counselors, and I was surprised that those counselors missed many of these types of mistakes. It was the kind of thing where even if the counselor wasn’t going line-by-line correcting everything, they could have pointed out very easy-to-fix errors in a 10 or 15-minute session.

## Mistake #7: Over-reliance on ChatGPT

Thanks to tools like ChatGPT, Google Docs, Grammarly, and other writing aids, essay readability has increased significantly in recent years—particularly this year. This makes AOs’ jobs easier in that essays generally flow better and are more enjoyable to read, but it makes their job harder because it’s especially difficult for them to “weed out” applicants who clearly aren’t proficient in English at a level required to succeed in a top American university. 

There is much to be said about how to use and not use ChatGPT in the application process, and what is ethically acceptable is being debated and evolving, but I want to focus on things that might reflect poorly on an applicant:

* There has been quite a bit of analysis of words that are supposedly hallmarks of ChatGPT (""tapestry,"" ""delve,"" ""resonate,"" etc.). But most of these words are already common in application essays (which is why ChatGPT uses them in the first place), so it’s difficult to pin an essay on ChatGPT just for those words. A better telltale sign is **inconsistency in apostrophes and quotation marks.** Microsoft Word and Google Docs default to curly quotes (single and double), while ChatGPT defaults to straight ones. If you have a mix, that is a strong suggestion there was copying-and-pasting going on. When you edit directly in the Common App, it also defaults to straight quotes, so ChatGPT is not the only way that can happen, but in either case it’s sloppy. I know that when I see a mix of curly and straight quotes or apostrophes, I become skeptical that the student wrote the parts with the straight quotes. 

* Also be mindful of spelling. Even before ChatGPT, inconsistency in spelling conventions (e.g. American vs. British) suggested that a writing assistance tool was used uncritically at best, or the writing came from multiple sources at worst. If you are going to use ChatGPT to make suggestions, give it custom instructions to adhere to your conventions or American ones. You don’t need to write your application with American spelling and stylistic conventions (although you should consider it if you’re comfortable), but be consistent throughout the application. Using the same word with two different spellings (e.g. honor and honour) is a particularly serious red flag.

* ChatGPT tends to give feedback on essays that includes a suggestion to reflect on what has been written and state why it demonstrates you would succeed in college. This often ends up stale, unconvincing, and unnecessary. Not everything needs to be stated explicitly if it can be conveyed through other means.

I have a lot more to say about ChatGPT and continue to explore ways to use it in the university research and application process, but these are the most significant things I saw reviewing applications this year.

## Mistake #8: Not incorporating a cultural perspective into your essay

Admissions are not fair. The admissions process is not a merit system to decide which applicant is more “deserving” than another. “Fairness” is a concept that has not been used to craft admissions policies in over 100 years. There is a powerful liberal argument that an important role of colleges should be to help achieve more societal equality (especially when those colleges have a history of perpetuating inequality), but colleges have universally concluded that a “fair” admissions process is antithetical to that goal. It’s why the group that successfully sued Harvard and other universities to end race-based affirmative action called themselves “Students for Fair Admissions.” They thought their argument would appeal to people’s innate desire for competitive fairness. And it worked.

Colleges are businesses, not charities. The job of the admissions office is to satisfy a college’s enrollment goals, full stop. So, unless you’re from a specific demographic that’s being targeted, proving your academic and extracurricular worthiness is not enough. 

So what are colleges looking for in international students? Essentially, **ambassadors from their countries.** The most selective universities and all liberal arts colleges that give aid take just a few students from each country. One common thread I saw in applications that were otherwise “perfect” was an essay that was excellent (both in content and style) by objective standards—but could have been written by an applicant from anywhere in the world. There was no real reason to choose this particular applicant as an ambassador from their country when there were so many equally talented applicants from other places. 

Too often, there was “low-hanging fruit” available about which an applicant could discuss their perspective, but that they simply didn’t go for. This omission itself could be seen as a weakness in the application. For example, there was a Russian student living in a country that has fought a major war against Russia, but didn’t talk about that at all, nor the war in Ukraine. Another applicant, from Kazakhstan and interested in aerospace and rocketry, didn’t mention the monumental achievements in spaceflight that have been achieved from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Someone with an Asian ethnic background that is not well represented in US universities (and with which the United States has a complicated history) chose not to mention it at all. When these obvious topics are omitted from an application, it makes the applicant seem ignorant of history and geopolitics. An “ambassador” needs to be aware of both. (Students with experience in Model UN are particularly expected to have awareness of geopolitics and understand what it means to be an ambassador.) 

Sometimes there were significant cultural and social service-related ECs that sounded both interesting and impressive, but simply didn’t get mentioned elsewhere in the application. This is not to say that your main essay needs to be about your extracurricular activities, but it is generally helpful to weave your major ones in somehow. If your chosen essay topics or the prompts make this impractical, make sure your recommenders elaborate on the significance and impact of the major ECs you have done.

## Mistake #9: Too much “trauma dumping” and “tear-jerking”
Essays aren’t a creative writing contest, especially in the era of ChatGPT. Emotional resonance is important, but for international students it is not the most important thing. In fact, admissions officers increasingly need to divorce themselves from emotional attachment to applicants, as there is no way every compelling application will result in an acceptance. This can lead to too much emphasis on *pathos* backfiring. Familial circumstances, health issues, and other challenges that may make a domestic applicant appealing to a college tend to do the opposite for an international applicant. In almost all instances, international applicants are simply not used to fulfill this particular enrollment goal. Poverty, abuse, addiction, food and/or housing insecurity, and other circumstances that may help admissions officers make a case for domestic students are usually not helpful factors for international students—and may even harm your case. 

If any of these circumstances is due directly to political persecution, you may get more sympathy. But if that’s the case, you need to demonstrate that you’re aware of your country’s politics and desire to be a voice for justice, rather than merely seeking relief from an oppressive situation. You need not just personal resilience, but a vision of a path forward for others in your place. Top colleges are looking for leaders, not refugees.

## Mistake #10: Lacking recommenders who can credibly testify to your ability to succeed at a top college

As a former lawyer, I approach the admissions process like a trial (although not a fair one, as I discussed above). During a trial each side will present witnesses, some of whom will be more credible than others. There are three kinds of witnesses: **Fact** witnesses, **character** witnesses, and **expert** witnesses. 
There are different criteria for evidence from these three types of witnesses to be credible:
* Fact witnesses must have **personal knowledge** of the facts.
* Character witnesses must have familiarity with the litigant’s behavior patterns, community norms, and the litigant’s **reputation in their community**. 
* Expert witnesses must have **proper training and experience** in the particular field in which they are testifying.
Each of your recommenders will act as all three types of witness to some degree, and all types of “testimony” are important. Most top applicants have ample “fact” and “character” witnesses. What is often lacking, particularly from students who don’t attend “feeder” schools, are those who attended or taught at a T20 or liberal arts college. These are individuals who will write the most credible and compelling letters of recommendation (LORs). Anyone can write “[student] would be an asset to any university and succeed wherever they go,” but those words ring hollow if the writer has never experienced or witnessed success at the kind of university you are applying to.

Not everyone knows such a person, but a few times I saw an applicant who had a teacher, mentor, or supervisor who had experience at a T20 but didn’t get an LOR from them. 

For teachers and counselors, the most compelling letters will come from those who graduated from a top university or at least have taught many students who have attended top universities. There are “feeder” schools because colleges can rely on counselors and teachers to provide reliable “testimony” about which students are most likely to succeed. The recommender will be accountable because of their ongoing relationship with the admissions office. A counselor or teacher from a non-feeder school can write anything to puff up a student’s qualifications without consequence. This makes their testimony less compelling.

Students from non-feeder schools are thus generally at a disadvantage, but if they and their families understand this disadvantage, they can compensate for it. For example, if you or your child does not attend a school where faculty and staff have attended top universities, you should develop relationships with such people throughout high school or during a gap year. 

Families often make the mistake of getting a letter of recommendation from a politician instead of someone who might be more persuasive to an admissions office. American admissions offices largely don’t care about what foreign politicians think, with the exception being the heads of state of our closest allies like the UK, Canada, and Australia. And in fact, having a recommendation from a prominent foreign politician may make it seem like another country’s government is pushing a student in order to advance a certain agenda. Whereas a student should be an ambassador of their country and its culture, they are not an ambassador for its government. (There will be exceptions for students whose national governments and royal families have an ongoing relationship with the university, but if you’re one of those people, you’ll know.)

Someone who attended a T20, even if they are a mid-level professional, would be a better pick as a recommender than a regional or even national-level politician. Admissions officers will tell you they’re not impressed by politicians, but they aren’t eager to come out and say that a recommender’s experience at a top university matters, because that would imply that many students are at a disadvantage.

So, if you’re an international student and you aren’t at the top of your class at a feeder school or you’re not a member of a royal family, the admissions process can be challenging. But it is possible to get into top schools, especially if you approach the admissions process strategically and avoid the mistakes I’ve listed.

I look forward to helping more of you this year!

1cbwxks,1,2024-04-24,TuesdAMA: ewk,u/ewk,zen,https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/1cbwxks/tuesdama_ewk/,"Sorry about the resubmission, the mod team has changed the AMA guidelines.  You don't have to answer the AMA questions in your post, but you do have to do other unspecified things in your title.

# What is TuesdAMA?

Zen's only practice is public interview.  Public interview is the core communal tradition in the Zen lineage. It's so basic and essential and intrinsic that any individual or organization claiming to be Zen that does not sponsor weekly public interviews is not Zen.

AMAs have a bit of a history in r/Zen of being used to expose frauds, liars, cheats, new agers, meditation worshippers, and Western Buddhist posers... because anybody can say anything on the internet, but they can't be interviewed about it if they are frauds.

But what does it take to AMA? It's the same thing as the first day of any high school class: you stand up and say your name, where you are from, and what your interests are. Think about whether you are comfortable doing this, and why some people might not be able to without violating the Reddiquette.

# AMA questions (required)

### Where do you come from?

I come from r/Zen.  It's popular to say it now, but I mean that I came to this forum, started talking and was given all this and more: /r/zensangha/wiki/gertstarted and more, and I read it all, and then I wrote about what I read, and then I AMA'd about what I wrote.  That's what it means to ""come from r/Zen"".  If you just read, no.  If you just wrote, no.  You have to AMA about what you wrote about what you read.

###  What's your text?

This question means ""What book are you so hard core about that you can answer anybody's question about it?""  That's a tough call because some books are REALLY LONG.  But I think I could probably handle any undergraduate class questions about Wumenguan, Mr. No-Gate's Checkpoint, the Barrier of Mr. Gateless, aka Wumen's Entrance or the Gateless Gate(way).

The other aspect of this question I like is ""What have you done for me lately book-wise"" and I'm working solo on Blyth's Annotate Wumenguan to correct it, better annotate it, and reformat it for publication.  I'm also helping with Xutang, Book 1.  There are lots of new projects that are possible now because ChatGPT can do an incredible job of translating... let's just say it's so good that it's better than Yamada, Sekida, or anyone less qualified.

### Dharma Low Tides?

If you are experiencing a Dharma low tied, then you need to take Shelter in Zen Master Buddha, the Zen Dharma, and the Zen Sangha.  This means turn the light around, study the teaching of those who turn it, and hang out with people who keep the precepts and read the books.

# Questions for Zen students

1. What WHOLE BOOK about Zen are you reading? 
 * I'm working on Yuanwu's Measuring Tap.

2. What Zen related study are you working on?
 * I'm going to be ""final look"" editing Xutang's Empty Family Room
 * I'm working on a paper for Academia.edu, Zen's Only Practice is Public Interview, where I explain why koans even exist.
3. Given the amount of anti-Zen fraud and misrepresentation in social media, what bibliography YOU HAVE READ represents your perspective on Zen?
 * www.reddit.com//r/zen/wiki/getstarted  
 * Most people who lie about Zen on social media (for religious reasons) can't provide any bibliography that isn't books published before 1990, or religious propaganda.

[Welcome](https://www.reddit.com/r/zensangha/wiki/ewk/welcome)! **[ewk](https://www.reddit.com/r/zensangha/wiki/ewk/writing) comment:** One thing I've been thinking about is how the Zazen community has two really really different bases:

1.  Uneducated, illiterate, active on social media, aren't aware of Chinese records or controversies within Zazen community.
2.  Educated, openly endorse both Zazen and Topicalist Mysticism as a basis for science, no social media presence, refuse to connect Zazen to 8FP or teach Hakamaya.

How weird is it that these two groups... support each other?"
1cbwzir,2,2024-04-24,College Homework Tips and AI Tools,u/harrywilson7079,CollegeHomeworkTips,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeHomeworkTips/comments/1cbwzir/college_homework_tips_and_ai_tools/,"I've been through the evolution of studies personally since I was a college student. We've come a long way from the days when we used to rely on our brains and textbooks for assignments. The game has changed dramatically due to the quick development of technology, in particular artificial intelligence tools like **ChatGPT** and **MyEssayWriterAI**.

Here are some tips on how to leverage these tools effectively:

* Use artificial intelligence tools to collect useful information and data when you start a new assignment. In order to deepen your understanding, they may provide you with a summary of complex topics or suggestions for articles in the field of research.
* Do you have a problem with a topic? Bring new ideas and perspectives to the table by working with AI. Its ability to simulate conversations can spark creativity and lead you to innovative solutions.
* An AI writing assistant can be invaluable, whether it's an article, a report, or a presentation. They'll help you to structure your thoughts, improve sentence clarity and even propose a more persuasive argument.
* Make sure that you use the AI proofreading tools to detect any grammar errors or awkward phrases before sending your work in. It will ensure that your work is professionally completed.
* You'll be able to simplify your process and make time management more efficient with the help of AI tools. To stay on track and avoid procrastination, set deadlines, create task lists, and get reminders.

But it's important that these AI tools are used in a responsible manner. In order to ensure that your work remains original and authentic, remember to always cite your sources correctly. Thanks to advances in technology and the emergence of artificial intelligence tools, the college homework landscape is changing.

You can improve your learning experience and achieve academic success with the use of these resources, which are integrated into your study schedule.

What's your opinion of the use of artificial intelligence for college homework? Did they help with your studies at all? In the comments below, let's talk about it!"
1cc0djt,56,2024-04-24,I had the BEST semester ever except for one student. How was yours?,u/TheMormyrid4,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1cc0djt/i_had_the_best_semester_ever_except_for_one/,"**The Good:** 

I teach two classes because I get credits for research/publishing. This semester, I taught an upper-level creative writing course. It only had six students, which made for amazing class discussions and workshops. Let me tell you, these students were PASSIONATE about their work and about providing feedback. We often accidentally went over time, which is difficult to do in a 3-hour class. Sometimes, the students would ask to come to my office after in order to continue discussing their writing. It was just an amazing vibe, and it was a pleasure to teach such motivated, talented students.   


I also taught an English comp class. Usually, these classes are a bit difficult as students are required to take them and most don't want to be there. I had eight students. Seven of them took the class seriously. They gave it their all and produced thought-provoking work which we workshopped in class. I encouraged them all to find their voice when it came to composition, and they sure as hell did so. The class ended last week, and I've received emails from most of them thanking me and telling me my class was their favorite and that they learned about themselves in addition to learning about writing.   


**The Bad:**   


That English comp class had ONE bad apple. This student spent the entirety of the semester handing in ChatGPT-generated work. I've posted here a few times about him. I ended up going through the whole process of meeting with the student multiple times, submitting my decision to the dean, etc. I finally got proof when he began an essay with ""Although I cannot experience emotions, I can understand how this essay might elicit sympathy in readers"". His midterm writing in class was atrocious.  


Anyway, the student has appealed my decision and has continued to submit ChatGPT-generated work (?????). He also did his final oral presentation on the dangers of AI in education (???????). I'm still waiting for our meeting with the appeals committee.

1cc1zgj,1,2024-04-24,Is using AI stealing?,u/Miloascape,miloascape,https://www.reddit.com/r/miloascape/comments/1cc1zgj/is_using_ai_stealing/,"On my first day of school at the University of Natal, I was introduced to email. I was 18 years old. I had never heard of this magical thing called email, which could send someone a message via electricity. Everyone thought that this surely meant it was the end of traditional mail, and that no one would ever read letters again. How wrong they were.

Then came the era of iPods, where you could carry your ENTIRE music album in your pocket and we were all amazed. Some thought that this meant the death of the music industry, but it had the opposite effect. More artists made their debuts, and we got to experience their music.

Next was the era of the Kindle, where you can carry your ENTIRE library of books in your pocket. Surely this meant the end of traditional publishing. We'd never have books to hold and read. More books are being sold today than in the history of our world.

All of these technologies; email, iPod, and Kindle were considered to be disruptive because they came to disrupt the ""normal"" way we did business. In many ways, they did change their respective industries, but you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who would now want to go back to the old ways. 

We still have mail. Musicians still make a living. Books are still being printed. It was not the end of the world.

The same fear that fueled people to be up in arms about those industries now wants us to believe that AI is going to mean the end of art whether it is in the form of images, music, film, etc. It seems that every day now someone somewhere is coming out with their unique AI tool.

I am someone who has worked closely with AI for years. My first research project as an undergraduate student at Georgia Tech was to develop AI to help neurosurgeons perform brain surgery to save lives. My dad used fuzzy logic to develop algorithms that control the flow of electricity to your houses. His research 50+ years ago at the London Imperial College in Artificial Intelligence in Electrical Engineering makes it so that your homes are protected from power surges. AI has been part of your life for 50+ years, without you even knowing.

Midjourney, ChatGPT, etc. sure they use existing works as a basis to start with... but aren't most humans inspired to create something because of something that they've seen or heard.  Some of the most popular music out there are ALL based on the same chord progressions. The only difference between the AI creating something and the human creating that same image is that the AI uses *millions* of source data to create the content.

Do I think AI will replace artists, filmmakers, writers, etc? No. Why? Because at the end of the day, you still need a human involved in the process.  These AI are not automatons, they don't think, they don't feel. They still need a human to give them prompts, meaning that the human still has to dream up whatever it is asking the AI to assist with.

I believe that AI is going to become part of our everyday tool set, like the Internet, email, and online banking. It is one more tool for us to learn how to use. You have a choice, you can either ignore it at your peril, or you can learn to leverage it to your advantage. 

I know that this topic is going to be controversial. But in the end, only history will tell how this unfolds."

1cc6nff,63,2024-04-24,Deflection? Are We Always the Problem Now?,u/Avid-Reader-1984,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1cc6nff/deflection_are_we_always_the_problem_now/,"I'm going to paraphrase the response and my assignment:

Basically, in several literature courses, a good 20% of the class was using ChatGPT for everything, a good 60% of the students were rephrasing banal themes from lit cheat sites, and the rest were making an honest attempt with their own thoughts and responses.  
In ten years, this has been a radical change in how students approach my gen-ed literature course that is both accessible, and dare I say, fun-ish. Well, fun if you can enjoy reading, but I definitely find ways to update and create engagement points even for those less than thrilling nineteenth century selections. 

No matter what I did in class, I had limited engagement and limited responses, even from the twenty percent who seemed to be engaging the material. I'm not even kidding by stating that I don't think some of my students even know what my face looks like because they stared at the computer screen all semester (I have an electronics policy, but it was like yelling into a void; they literally could not stay away from their screens no matter how many points they lost). And yes, it was really awkward to have designed a hands-on group activity that required moving, but about 15% of the class would stay put and click away on their computers. I will say about the 20% who engaged me----wow, totally blown away by the work they did. I really needed those students this semester to even continue to accurately gauge my own reality (yes, see, I did instruct them in this; yes, I did review that; yes, some students appreciate and understand these activities).

So, at the end of the semester, I was done. Their last assignment was to tell me what they learned. Simple enough. As an introduction to the assignment, I noted the effort I put in to engage *them*. (I'm paraphrasing for brevity. It was not aggressive or pointed and was phrased as more like a, ""let's review what we did this semester,"" introduction to the instructions, but, if you're adept at reading you would understand that I was trying to emphasize just how much I did *for them*. Side note: a good way to get ahead of any accusations of ""but you didn't teach me that."")

I clicked on the assignment to read the first one, and I am floored, not by the way that the student turned their failure back on me, but the way they described it. The student went on at length about something that can be summarized as:

It would be easier to learn if so many professors did not lose their passion. They should be ashamed of the way they have failed the current generation. I think it's obvious that none of my professors care, and so I don't either. 

I have never worked harder in my career. I have never had to create so many engagement points in a course. Or spend so much time creating multiple ways to participate because a group of students can't hold a discussion, anymore. (And, sorry if this is you, but I don't think a successful discussion is the same four students participating all semester. Don't even get me started on calling on students.) Of course, I can't see myself from an outsider's perspective, but I don't think that I could have cared more. And I made that clear to them. And still...that was the response I received. 

This is gaslighting, right? Or, are we the reason that these students can't even bother with us, anymore? How many of you are just cashing that sweet professor pay for all that uncompensated work? :)"

In today's era of rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, OpenAI's ChatGPT has become a powerful tool for many people to access information and solve problems. Whether you're a student, educator, programmer, or marketing expert, ChatGPT can assist you in unique ways. This article will explain how to use this tool efficiently to optimize your work and learning processes.

**1. Understanding the Basics of ChatGPT**

ChatGPT is a chatbot based on the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) that can understand and generate human-like text. It predicts the next most likely text by learning from a vast dataset of textual content, thereby producing coherent dialogues.

**2. Getting Started and Basic Operations**

Accessing the Platform: You can access ChatGPT via a website, API, or integrated applications.

Inputting Questions or Commands: Simply type in your question or request, such as ""Explain quantum physics"" or ""Generate an email template.""

Receiving Responses: ChatGPT will provide answers or generate the content you need based on your input.

Refining the Conversation: If you need more detailed responses, you can refine the dialogue by asking more specific questions.

**3. Practical Tips**

Be Specific: Try to describe your question or need as specifically as possible to help ChatGPT provide more accurate answers.

Use Context: ChatGPT can maintain context over a conversation, allowing you to ask follow-up questions without needing to repeat the background.

Choose Language and Style: You can specify the output's language style, such as formal, informal, or specific professional jargon.

**4. Application Scenarios**

Educational Assistance: Students can use it to help understand complex concepts or complete assignments.

Programming Help: Programmers can obtain code solutions or debugging assistance.

Daily Tasks: Such as booking travel, managing schedules, or simple data analysis.

**5. Cautions**

Accuracy of Information: Although the answers from ChatGPT are generally reliable, it is always necessary to verify the accuracy of important information.

Privacy Protection: Avoid entering overly sensitive or personal information in conversations.

Conclusion:

As technology continues to evolve, so do the capabilities of ChatGPT. It has become an indispensable assistant in many people's work and study routines. Mastering how to use ChatGPT effectively will enable you to face various challenges more easily and increase the efficiency of your life and work.

1ccbvnl,1,2024-04-24,Help me pick a thesis project.,u/reddithoggscripts,dotnet,https://www.reddit.com/r/dotnet/comments/1ccbvnl/help_me_pick_a_thesis_project/,"Hey guys,  


I chose this subreddit because generally you guys are the most responsive and polite and I feel like this post would get a lot of criticism since I'm looking for direction rather than technical advice.   


I am about to embark on my thesis for my software engineering masters (its a conversion so it's not like I have a strong background in comp sci). Here's some of the topics that were suggested by the professors that I had \*some\* interest in. A short background from me. Since beginning my course I have created these projects so far:  


A. A bash script that simulates a round-robin algorithm for CPU tasks.   
B. A DBMS project on phpMyAdmin.   
C. A C# console app for a car rental service focusing on OOP.  
D. A swift/xcode app that uses google books api to find / or barcode scan books and then helps you track your reading progress and stats and incentivises reading. \* I really don't like coding for mobile though. Swift is a nightmare  
E. A fullstack web app in react/.NET for a Japanese anime bookstore (basically an e-commerce store) that also used google maps.  
F. A C# console app for tracking budgets with a focus on software architecture and design (like proper composition, bridges, factories, pre-coding UML stuff)   
G. A C# console app that uses graphs and linked lists to simulate the London underground/overground system and uses Djikstra's to find the shortest path. (There were other rules/features involved but you get the point).  
H. A RESTful API in .NET deployed to Azure.   


Anyways, now that I've had some experience with bash, c sharp, react, js, DBMS and sql, I need to select a final project. My strength and interests are definitely more OOP and C sharp, but I know the market is tough and you need a lot more than that. I want to pick a project that can really help my future prospects. I have the list here. I put a \* beside them to share my thoughts on each.  


1. **Serverless Computing for Meal-Plan Web Application**  


* Build a web application using serverless technology that integrates with Google Cloud shopping list and calendar services to create weekly meal plans.  
\* The teacher that proposed this was by far the best in the course, which means he'll likely be my thesis supervisor. I also think that learning more about cloud computing and integrating seamlessly with google features like google messenger or google calendar could be useful career wise?

2. **Pupil Progress Monitoring System**  


* Design and develop an application for UK primary or secondary schools aimed at increasing parent engagement in students’ education and progress.
*   
\* I used to be a teacher for 5 years in Taiwan, so I probably have a good understanding of the user requirements for this without too much research. 

3. **Software System to Evaluate ChatGPT**  


* Develop a system for assessing the performance and capabilities of ChatGPT.
*   
\*No idea how to do this but sounds interesting given the current climate.

4. **Cross-Platform Tetris Game Development**  


* Develop a Tetris game that works on both desktop and mobile platforms, likely targeting Android.
*   
\* I like games but this seems too basic.

5. **GUI for Emulating PIC Embedded Processor**  


* Develop a graphical user interface that emulates the behavior of a PIC embedded processor.
* &#x200B;
* \* sounds interesting and cool. Also really like the professor. But I know very little about PICs and its in python which I only have about a month practice coding in.

&#x200B;

6. **E-Commerce Platform with Recommendation System**  


* Build an e-commerce platform that includes a sophisticated recommendation engine.
* &#x200B;
* \* I like the professor, he's very smart but his English is quite bad. I also like e-commerce platforms. I like the idea of doing a complex backend more than I've done which has basically just been security and an sql database.
* &#x200B;

7. **Online Marketplace for Businesses**  


* Develop an online platform that facilitates business transactions and connectivity.
* &#x200B;
* \*\* I don't know what this one means actually

8. **Healthcare Appointment Scheduling App**  


* Develop an application that simplifies scheduling appointments for healthcare services.
*   
\* could be interesting? I'm guessing this is a full stack web app.

9. **Web-frontend Development in React and Unity3D Game Development**

* Focus on developing web frontend using React and creating games in Unity3D with C#, including AR/VR games.
*   
\* I do have an interest in leveraging AI art to make a unity game like Hearthstone. But Unity is quite complex and my experience is limited. Might do this anyways as a side project but I am worried that this could be a black hole for me as a solo project and games might not be the best for career prospects.
* &#x200B;

1. **Web Application for Language Practice**  


* Create a web application aimed at facilitating language practice for the School of Humanities.
*   
\* I was an english teacher for 5 years so this could be great. That said, I don't know many people that use the web to learn languages, usually that space is dominated by Duolingo type mobile apps. 

1. **Real-time Traffic Sign Detection and Recognition for Autonomous Vehicles**  


* Develop an application that detects and recognizes traffic signs in real-time for use in autonomous vehicle systems.
*   
\* sounds very cool but I know very little about AI.  


Ok guys! What are your ideas. Which one of these would you pick to stand out as a recent grad? Share your thoughts! Anything you like about these? Anything you don't like? Which would you do?

1ccc6nu,4,2024-04-24,[Ontario] Night school online and other online teachers: how do you evaluate?,u/uoftstudent97,CanadianTeachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianTeachers/comments/1ccc6nu/ontario_night_school_online_and_other_online/,"Hey guys,

I'm just wondering for those teachers who teach night school or online, how do you evaluate?

I ask because I notice some students who are doing poorly in my class, and I speak to other teachers and they are doing just as poorly in those classes as well, yet they seem to be getting 80s and 90s in night school online courses.

Another thing is I'm teaching grade 12 university and the students who got their grade 11 university online are very weak, yet their marks were 80s and 90s.

These students must be cheating using ChatGPT (for courses requiring writing) or PhotoMath (for math courses) or any other online artificial intelligence to get their grades.

So, this leads me to ask, are teacher's just letting students cheat on evaluations and assignments because there is no way to know when it is online? Honestly, this is not fair, especially to students who work hard in non-online classes to actually earn their grade. It's so frustrating to me as a teacher because students know they can just take online night school and get an easy 80 or 90 so they can get into the program they want.

Just want the opinions of teachers who have been in the online night school game. Thanks guys."

Working student naman siya and naiintindihan ko naman yon pero napakatamad niya talaga. Most of my classmates are working student pero siya lang talaga yung nag iisang laging absent, mabagal magcomply and everything. 

Last sem, naiintindihan ko pa na medyo matagal siya magbigay nung part niya sa research kasi Chap 1-3 pa lang kami and hindi gahol sa oras. But now, bukas na dapat yung defense namin and yung part niya sa chap 4 e hindi niya pa maibigay. Naibigay niya na yung interpretations and halata talaga na gawa pa sa chatgpt. Last tuesday pa yon and palagi ko na siyang minemessage for his complete work pero hindi na siya nagreply. 

I get that he's working pero mag reply man hindi niya magawa. Ka group ko rin siya now sa isa pang activity and hindi talaga siya nagrereply. So I gave him an ultimatum na kung hindi pa magreply and mag comply e consider himself na tanggal na sa thesis na to. I told him na I will pay for all the expenses na nagawa niya kasi siya na yung nag insist na magbayad ng paprint and tokens for validators and advisers namin. 

Earlier, nag reply na siya ng ""Kase kung kayo ay nag effort sa thesis na ito, meron din akong ambag not just about sa mga expenses."" He's probably pertaining to the 2 teachers na friend niya na nag check ng research instrument namin. Although okay yes, salamat sa kanya. Pero binigay ko kasi yung task na yon sa kanya kasi wala pa siya halos naitutulong and yung binigay niyang contribution sa paggawa ng research instrument mali mali so nirevise ko pa. 

Hindi naman ako ang naginsist na siya ang magbayad kasi we are always asking him magkano babayaran namin or minsan ako na nag lilist ng hatian namin but siya naman yung nagsasabi na siya na ang bahala don, nabayaran na niya. 

Eto pa, I told my friends rin na friends niya. And naaawa sila don sa kagroup ko. They said baka miscommunication lang ganern. I never failed to message him and remind him about his part. Siya lang talaga yung hindi nagrereply. 


Pagod na ako umintindi and mag adjust para sa gawang chapgpt niya. "

However, I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on allowing students in a political science course to use ChatGPT to proofread their papers. It might seem like this would detract from the learning experience, but considering that many students will use it regardless, maybe it makes sense to embrace the change.

I can tell some of my students are already using AI tools for their assignments, even if I can't confirm it for sure. The papers I receive seem more polished, which reduces my stress level. I have a reputation for being a strict grader who values strong writing, and I'm known to be quite serious about writing projects. However, I'm giving some thoughts to this. What do you think? Do you have any advice for me?

Or do you remember the interview for that job/internship/college society/whatever other things people interview for that you were initially dreading but turned out fine?  


Sometimes, the anticipation of an experience is much more intense than the actual experience.  


It’s like that with regards to learning stats for so many people (psych students, I’m looking at you). They run scared of stats in undergrad and master’s.  


And later, they realize that they can learn stats without the fear of failure or judgement. So they begin exploring.  


And they discover that with the right tools, strategies, and mindsets, stats is quite fun.  


To me, stats is one of the most sensible things in psychology (even with all its supposed limitations like the ✨replication crisis✨)  


Also, what are these right tools, strategies, and mindsets I keep talking about?  


To make learning stats easier, more fun, and much less overwhelming for you, I’ve made a free resource! It contains:

🧐 Cheatsheets  
🤖 ChatGPT Prompts

I'm a student in 10th grade, and in my classes there's this HELLA annoying girl.

She made fun of me for flying Ryanair (apparently I'm ""poor"" because of the fact), made fun of the war in my country (I'm Ukrainian and several other students in the class are as well) and regularly bodyshames other students, including me. The issue is, sometimes we also say stuff that could kinda be counted as offensive (?) in retaliation. Things like ""French people are weird"" (because she's French) but it was only meant as a JOKE.

I'm a struggling mechanical engineering student and I have a course project where I'm supposed to create a vehicle model (wildly, I've got this done) and then simulate a cruise controller. 

In the project I'm supposed to create a graph where five different speeds are shown at different times, so for example at reference speed 10 should be from 0-60 and speed 20 from 60-300, etc. There are five different speeds and the timeline for these is from 0-500. 

I've tried googling and asking ChatGPT to no avail. I've asked the teacher if my vehicle model looks right and it is, so the problem \_shouldn't\_ be there. When asked about how to do this, the answer was to ""figure it out"". 

Later on in this project I need to do a similar graph, but with distance instead of speed.

I'm a bit lost on how do I create this type of graph. Do I need five different Step-blocks that then connect to a Switch-block, or something completely different? 

Sorry for the messy post, I hope this is clear enough and I am not going against the guidelines - I tried to stay within those.

# Introduction

A concept for a Three Houses remake that (hopefully) solves a number of the issues some had with the game, enfolds characters and worldbuilding from the DLC and Three Hopes effectively into the base game, and creates an improved yet similar gameplay experience in the ways people enjoyed.

Base Gameplay Functions

**Recruitment.** At this point only your allies are in the monastery. During Chapter 12 you can still request students of the Blue Lions house join you on missions to build support, and the same with staff members who aren't technically recruited. Post-timeskip, recruitment is done on the battlefield or via paralogues.

**The Calendar.** You are given a new mission after completing an old one. You *do not have to complete the mission before the end of a month*. However, you cannot take more than forty-five days to complete any given mission. In addition, traveling over the continent map to missions, paralogues or side battles takes up time. While traveling you can miss holiday meals, holiday services, and birthdays. Students will still learn while traveling. Traveling through a green region takes 1 day. You cannot travel through silver or colorless regions. Battling in a silver region takes two days, turning it green after.

**Group Tasks.** There are more than three group tasks now. How many students you can assign at a time starts at two and increases with professor level, to four at D, six at C, eight at B and ten at A. The group tasks are as follows: Training Yard Management (Sword), Camp Construction (Axe), Fishing (Lance), Hunting (Bow), Night Watch (Brawling), Studying (Reason), Chapel Service (Faith), Armor Maintenance (Armor), Recruitment (Authority), Care for Horses (Riding) and Sky Watch (Flying).

**Hidden Paralogues.** Post timeskip, most paralogues don't simply appear on the map - they have to be discovered while conquering territory. Hidden Paralogues (which accounts for the majority of post-timeskip paralogues) ONLY APPEAR if a territory bordering them is green.

**Side Battles.** Post timeskip, the side battles are not named and set. Instead they're randomly generated based on the location they're in and the part of the story they're set during.

**Ultimate Supports.** There's a level of support after A that many characters can reach with others, not just Byleth. Depending on the pair, these are either S supports (romantic proposals) or AA supports (platonic endings). Those trigger ordinarily, through increasing support levels, except for with Byleth. Byleth can choose to give anyone they've reached A support with the ring, triggering their ultimate support.

**Arcane Combat Arts.** Arcane Combat Arts are the result of Relics or Mastery Abilities; they rely on a certain spell's uses and consume one when activated, as opposed to weapon durability. Each is tied to a specific spell.

**Roster Revamp.** If you choose Silver Snow in the Holy Tomb, Edelgard warps away - then, your students [begin to discuss this new war.](https://imgur.com/a/T6bxf9s) Most of them leave - your new roster, assuming you recruited Shez and the Ashen Wolves, is as follows: Byleth, Rhea (Archbishop), Catherine, Seteth (Wyvern Rider), Shamir (Sniper), Cyril (Wyvern Rider), Mercedes, Ashe, Manuela (Trickster), Flayn, Yuri and Alois.

# Chapter 12: To War

Edelgard's forces are marching. Fortunately, it looks as though she and Hubert are the only former students present; the Blue Lion students have remained to fight alongside the Church, and while Rhea curses the Golden Deer for cowards they have every right to return home and stay out of this conflict. Meanwhile, the Church and its allies [prepare for a war.](https://imgur.com/a/i8kLeBw)

*Paralogue 15: A Cursed Relic.* Yuri and Shamir are discussing a Dagdan legend of plunder from Fodlan. Yuri seems particularly intrigued, then offhandedly mentions that he heard about something like that being brought in by Duke Gerth from Dagda, taken by Albinean pirates, and traded to Dominic. Baron Dominic is the green unit here, who is being attacked by monsters as Yuri seeks to reclaim the Fetters of Dromi.

*A: Defending the Monastery.* Exactly like Defending Garreg Mach, but the reinforcements are Dimitri for Jeritza and Felix for Hubert. Instead of being captured Rhea is injured and flees to the Kingdom just as in CF. Byleth falls just as in AM.

# Chapter 13: Hunting by Daybreak

Byleth awakes and goes to the monastery, only to see Dimitri there. he whispers that he should have known Byleth would come to haunt him too - in his rambling, he also mentions that all his friends are gone, many serving the Empire, and Felix likely coming to put him down. Byleth tries to reach out to Dimitri, but he knocks them to the ground and flees. Byleth starts to follow only to meet Rhea, who came from her refuge in northeastern Faerghus on a feeling that something would happen. After a tearful reunion and Rhea asking if Byleth remembers anything, she laments that the monastery is fallen, claimed by bandits who soil its holy ground. Rhea asks if Byleth will help her reclaim this sacred place and restore it to glory, triggering [the fight.](https://imgur.com/a/cFRtxdT) Before the battle, however, you see (as you do before most battles in this route) students you can recruit [talking to one another.](https://imgur.com/a/jT9aotN) You can recruit Shez using [Byleth](https://imgur.com/a/O0kL6Yd) if they have at least a C support. You can recruit Felix using [Byleth](https://imgur.com/a/6OJjrrN) or [Seteth](https://imgur.com/a/T4tpqcS) assuming they have at least a C support with him.

After the battle, Rhea gathers the Church forces to her and announces that with Byleth returned, they have to push back against the Empire and its vassal states. Byleth adds, to Rhea's irritation, that they're going to try and keep their students safe. Rhea tells them, trying to be gentle, that the Kingdom is in ruins and most of their students won't be available. Byleth persists, and Rhea just shakes her head sadly and leaves.

# Chapter 14: A King Without A Kingdom

The Western Kingdom and the Southern Alliance are under the sway of the Empire, and the students have become generals in their respective armies. The Church has reclaimed Garreg Mach, but it seems the Empire has heard - and they send forces to reclaim it: Randolph von Bergliez, Constance von Nuvelle and Thaddeus von Ochs. The Church has to stabilize [the area around Garreg Mach](https://imgur.com/a/2Wjv6Bd) before Randolph arrives to attack.

A: *Defending Garreg Mach.* Before the Imperial army arrives, there's a brief scene showing a student who can be [recruited](https://imgur.com/a/ONl3KWE) discussing with Randolph; in battle, Constance can be recruited by [Byleth](https://imgur.com/a/Louk7aj) or [Yuri](https://imgur.com/a/zaORpGp) if they have at least a C support with her. Randolph flees once defeated in this route, with Baron Ochs and (perhaps) Constance the only deaths.

# Chapter 15: The Valley of Torment

After the monastery is safe, Rhea invites Byleth with her to the Holy Tomb. She asks if Byleth recalls the Red Canyon, and Byleth responds that they fought Kostas there. Rhea begins to choke up and asks Byleth to leave her in the tomb, which they obediently do, having the option to pause a moment outside which allows them to hear her weeping. Meeting with the other Knights, Catherine recommends meeting in the Valley of Torment, near Charon territory. Catherine interjects to mention that Rodrigue, who has been holding out against the Empire, will try and meet them there as well, with supplies and troops. Together, the Knights [plan their next move](https://imgur.com/a/8x34jN5).

A: *Clash at Ailell.* As the Knights mobilize to meet Rodrigue (who enters as a green unit but, if protected, becomes a blue unit immediately after the battle) word of their meeting reaches House Rowe. While the Rowe knights mobilize and [catch a thief](https://imgur.com/a/5OQvLOh) as well, the Knights enter the Valley only to walk right into an ambush. Hapi is recruitable by [Byleth](https://imgur.com/a/VSTBy7t) or [Yuri](https://imgur.com/a/C1h27DO) if they have at least a C support. Ingrid is also recruitable by [Byleth](https://imgur.com/a/wHwQ0Ca), [Ashe](https://imgur.com/a/3YqBJ7m) or [Mercedes](https://imgur.com/a/Sepj1nd) if they have at least a C support. After the battle, Rodrigue mentions that forces in the Alliance seem to be gearing up to drive the Empire out of the Bridge of Myrddin. Catherine notes that if they strike quickly, they could sieze Myrddin themselves and use it to stage an invasion of Bergliez.

# Chapter 16: The Rose-Colored River

Rumors reach the Knights of Alliance and Kingdom forces rallying behind Claude and Dimitri respectively. Byleth can suggest they help either or wait and let the three nations tire each other out; all students from the respective nation (or the Empire if neither is chosen) increase their support with Byleth. Rhea says instead they ought to take the Bridge of Myrddin and then use it to choke the Empire into submission. Seteth and Catherine agree that’s the best bet, and the Knights [march on the Alliance.](https://imgur.com/a/BCDmjF9)

A: *Hidden Paralogue 5 -* [*Heir to Albrecht.*](https://imgur.com/a/d38MrjT) Shamir gets asked about a mercenary contract for a single job and suggests they all go check it out. Apparently a pricey bounty is in a local inn, and that could of course help finance the war. When the group arrives, however, it’s not a stranger but Balthus, fighting off several mercenaries. Upon realizing it, any recruited Wolves immediately advise to help him instead. If none are alive and recruited, Balthus calls out to Byleth asking for help. After the paralogue is completed, Balthus catches up to the army and offers to help them out in repayment.

B: *Battle at the Great Bridge.* Before the Knights reach the bridge, its defenders [talk strategy.](https://imgur.com/a/7CWTuC4) After the Knights arrive, they sweep the Great Bridge. Halfway through the battle, however, Ladislava enters as reinforcement - along with Lorenz, to his father's [consternation](https://imgur.com/a/HkaKPxM). Lorenz and Ladislava fall defending the Bridge as Erwin promptly retreats, forced to give it up to Church control.

# Chapter 17: Blood of the Eagle and Lion

The Empire, Kingdom and Alliance forces, all gathering to fight, meet at [Gronder Field.](https://imgur.com/a/DqbQNem) The Kingdom and the Alliance don’t fight one another, focusing on the Empire, but Dimitri seems quite aggressive and Shamir reports that she actually overheard Alliance forces discussing destroying the Knights of Seiros after they swept through the western Alliance. It seems all three factions may come out as enemies.

A: [*To War at Gronder.*](https://imgur.com/a/GWVQnts) While crossing the Great Bridge, the Knights receive reports that the Kingdom has managed to force a small force through the mountains, while the Alliance has crossed a sequence of smaller bridges in Ordelia. No one knows who can be trusted. Before the battle a scene plays, and Dimitri [discusses](https://imgur.com/a/JhbB0tU) with Sylvain and Dedue regarding his own state. Finally, the Knights deploy to fight forces of all three nations; they soon find the Alliance has soldiers out for their blood, and Claude opts to defend his people rather than let them fall to Rhea's blade. Dimitri will hear no reason, and of course the Empire wishes to stop all three from advancing. During the battle Sylvain can be recruited by Byleth, Ingrid or Felix if they have C support, and Dedue can be recruited by Byleth, Mercedes or Flayn if they've reached B support. After the battle, a cutscene plays. Edelgard and Claude meet while organizing a retreat. They drop their default lines (lovelier than ever, not so unfortunate) then Edelgard raises Aymr, only to pause as Claude stows Failnaught. She lowers her own weapon as Claude explains that after that battle, he's done with Fodlan. He mentions that despite what differences they may have, he doubts either he or Edelgard wants to see a world with Rhea regaining control, and in the interest of ""a potential future favor"" warns her that it seems like Rhea and Dimitri are conspiring together before he mounts his wyvern and flies off, leaving Edelgard to hurry south. After this scene, Dimitri approaches Byleth. Byleth can either order the Knights to take him in and care for him, or to leave him. If you leave him here, there's a brief few lines about packing up then a CG of Dimitri collapsed on the field while any recruited Lions [lament his death.](https://imgur.com/a/13JMisd) If you ask the Knights to care for him, there's a CG of Rhea embracing him while she orders them to do so without hesitation as a very wounded and weakened Dimitri thanks both Byleth and Rhea profusely. When he wakes up, there's a CG of all the recruited Lions and Byleth standing at his bedside, and he hoarsely demands to know why they wouldn't let him die. At that point Dimitri officially joins your army.

# Chapter 18: The Resurrection of Seiros

After success at Gronder, whispers have spread across the land. People say Seiros has been reborn. They say that she lives on in Rhea, the Archbishop, and that she'll destroy the Empire. Rhea welcomes these rumors and dons the Seiros garb henceforth when she goes to battle, unlocking the Saint class. As an additional mastery reward, Saint offers a class-exclusive Arcane Combat Art: *Immaculate Transformation,* which expends a use of Abraxas and turns Rhea into the Immaculate One for three turns or until she uses her staggering blow. As the Immaculate One, she can attack at one to three range with her Crest Stone, can fly, and takes up nine spaces. She does only have her normal amount of HP but heals each turn. The Knights decide that they need to secure the Kingdom and Alliance, both of which, paying heed to the rumors, now have factions that may be willing to assist the Knights with their war. Rhea decides to head to Fhirdiad and Derdriu; Dimitri, or Yuri (or Catherine if neither was recruited) recommends taking the Silver Maiden instead, as it will allow them to hold the border with the Empire and is much closer to the monastery. Seteth advises taking Derdriu first; the Kingdom is in shambles and will pose little threat. So the Knights [march on Derdriu.](https://imgur.com/a/V1AMTxm)

A: *Hidden Paralogue 2 - Forgotten Hero.* As the Knights of Seiros touch upon the infamous Enchanted Forest of Mircea, a howl echoes through the sky. A soft sound of weeping permeates the fog, and Ashe recalls a legend of a lost Elite and a beast that wanders these woods. Rhea goes very silent regarding this legend, and Seteth tells Flayn to stay silent just as she seems about to speak. Upon arrival, the Knights find Marianne (a green unit) in the midst of a forest of monsters, talking to Maurice. Maurice has unique dialogue against Rhea, and once the paralogue is completed Marianne joins your army.

B: [*Capturing Derdriu.*](https://imgur.com/a/wOYM2zu) As the Knights arrive in the city, the [Imperial army](https://imgur.com/a/ZPxRwZU) faces off against [Erwin](https://imgur.com/a/fw6HLEM) \- who, after the fall of Myrddin, has decided that the Church might well be a safer bet for the Alliance than the Empire. However, after their standstill ends, an Imperial scout calls out to Monica with news that sends Gregoire scurrying - and a cutscene triggers. Almyran ships, massive 24-gun warships, crest the horizon to the sound of [Citizens of the East.](https://youtu.be/oPrgYBIl-kM?si=cS9Yx2TbhJZh6c7K) Cannonballs fly over the city - and hit the walls, constructed long ago, that protect Derdriu from flooding. Water sweeps through the city streets. A lone man on wyvernback flies to the raised outer platform and throws a handaxe at an Imperial archer preparing to fire, and Nader steps off and announces himself as the camera pans over the approaching ships, with wyverns, soldiers, and giant hawks waiting on deck. ""My name is Nader the Undefeated, and this city is now under the protection of the Almyran Navy... under command of Prince Khalid the Immortal, heir to the throne."" At the announcement of their commander the camera focuses in on the furthest ship - where Claude, Failnaught in hand, watches carefully. Then the cutscene ends, and Claude [calls commands](https://imgur.com/a/AmuoBLj) to the soldiers. Claude has unique dialogue against [Byleth](https://imgur.com/a/hfMIXCX), [Rhea](https://imgur.com/a/gOPugoQ) and [Cyril](https://imgur.com/a/zOZfkzJ) making his goals and intentions clear. After a long battle, the Knights drive out the Empire and protect Derdriu from Almyra... and now the time has come to turn their gaze to the far west, where Arianrhod awaits.

# Chapter 19: Maiden of Discord

With the Alliance now firmly under Church control and safe from Imperial incursions, the Knights must turn their gaze [westward.](https://imgur.com/a/IohVtBN) Fanning out through both Imperial and Faerghan Mach, they prepare to take the fortress city Arianrhod. Seteth [confronts Rhea](https://imgur.com/a/SmQMU4b) about what she intends to do once the war is over, with Catherine quick to come to her defense and Byleth asked to mediate. There isn't time to talk the aftermath too much, however; as Annette arrives to Garreg Mach, she mentions that her father is planning with some other Kingdom knights to stage a battle against the Empire at Arianrhod, and hopes the Church can arrive in time to help, lighting a fire under them to attack the fortress. Annette joins your army at the beginning of this chapter.

A: *Hidden Paralogue 3 - Legend of the Lake.* As the Knights pass Duval territory, Flayn mentions a curious myth about a saintly beast and a Sacred Relic. She tells Byleth, but advises them not to tell Rhea because she suspects she would be rather opposed to disturbing a sacred location for such a thing. Seteth is scandalized when he finds out, but admits that it could be good to go and speak to a certain old friend there. Rhea *can't be deployed in this battle.* Byleth gathers those they think should join in such an excursion only to find a giant turtle apparently blocking the way. Upon arrival, they find Linhardt (a green unit) who seems to have been curious about the same thing. If he survives the battle, he asks to join your army.

B: *Hidden Paralogue 4 - Foreign Land and Skies.* The Empire is well and truly entrenched in Brigid; The Church intends to go and see if the island nation can't be persuaded to their side. Failing that, they may be forced to put an end to the pro-Imperial dynasty and cow the nation into staying neutral. The battle layout and opening and arrival dialogues change based on whether Byleth has a B support with Petra, and she is [resistant](https://imgur.com/a/dfXohkk) to the Empire at the beginning and when [arriving;](https://imgur.com/a/KaMFbNV) or whether Byleth does not, and Petra is openly on the side of the [Empire](https://imgur.com/a/aYs1CvM) and arrives as [reinforcement](https://imgur.com/a/olfbGeF). Either way, only Byleth can persuade her to join the Church, if they've reached C support.

C: [*Siege of the Silver Maiden.*](https://imgur.com/a/F6H2zGi) Arianrhod has long been a prize of the Kingdom, and the Empire won't let it go easily. However, some of the Kingdom's knights have organized a resistance! They attacked Arianrhod - and it seems Marquis Vestra, for inexorable reasons, attacked a faction within the fortress.  The Knights of Seiros, reinforcing the Kingdom, are drawing quite a bit of attention from both the Empire and the Agarthans as they arrive. Gilbert can be recruited in this chapter by talking to him with [Dimitri](https://imgur.com/a/LzcWq4d) or [Annette.](https://imgur.com/a/5ZLg9BZ) Of course, Rhea and the Knights are able to expel Hubert, destroy Cornelia, and reclaim Arianrhod to defend the Kingdom in truth.

# Chapter 20: The Impregnable Fortress

After establishing safe boundaries for the Alliance and Kingdom, Rhea decides that it’s high time to [press southward](https://imgur.com/a/heV4yUb) to the heart of the enemy - and to destroy Edelgard once and for all. The first thing to do is seize Fort Merceus, in the heart of Bergliez, to advance from there into Hresvelg, where Edelgard rules.

A: *Taking Fort Merceus.* The battle is laid out exactly as it would be in Verdant Winds if Linhardt was recruited (in current 3H), with Caspar [standing guard](https://imgur.com/a/qIWLdoT) along with Jeritza. After Jeritza starts fleeing, however, [reinforcements](https://imgur.com/a/GQOh8PY) appear if Shez wasn't recruited. The commanders are defeated and the Javelins of Light fall as the Death Knight flees. Rhea has some [feelings](https://imgur.com/a/r375RcC) about them, of course, but tries to contain herself. Right now? They have an Empire to topple. And Enbarr is within sight.

# Chapter 21: The Chaos of War

The Knights of Seiros, having taken Fort Merceus, [march on Enbarr.](https://imgur.com/a/b785dyw) Edelgard's decision to keep civilians in the homes is met with quite a bit of shock, including, if recruited, from some of her own.

A: *Skirmish in the Streets.* Hubert and the Death Knight stand guard in the city streets; Jeritza dies when defeated, as does Hubert. Afterward, there is nothing left save to make your way into the palace itself.

# Chapter 22: As The Dead Demand

A: *Clash at the Imperial Palace.*  This chapter plays out mostly the same as in Silver Snow. When Edelgard is defeated, a cutscene plays: if you recruited Dimitri, Edelgard steps back, panting, and raises Aymr to guard as he thrusts with Areadhbar. It's not enough, however, and the axe shatters and Dimitri successfully stabs Edelgard, who goes limp. He drops Areadhbar and falls to his knees, beginning to cry, then whispers, ""what more do you ask."" Rhea and Byleth approach, each putting a hand on his shoulder, and the scene ends. If not, then Rhea and Byleth both fight Edelgard for a brief period, then Rhea manages to claim the final blow, cutting Edelgard down, and the scene ends. After the battle, Rhea and a letter from Hubert fill in details regarding the Agarthans and Relics. Then it becomes clear exactly where the Knights must next go.

# Chapter 23: The City Without Light

After Edelgard’s conquest ends, the Nabateans end up making one thing clear: the Agarthans, who were behind Nemesis, are ready to destroy everything once they set up their schemes. Everyone is in agreement: the Agarthans must be stopped. Rhea, Byleth, the Knights of Seiros, and whoever they’ve ended up recruiting from the other nations of Fodlan begin marching their way [eastward,](https://imgur.com/a/y7y76iy) to fight Those Who Slither in the Dark.

A: *Hidden Paralogue 4 -* [*Into the Abyss (Shez).*](https://imgur.com/a/g4V2AS1) Shez approaches Byleth mid-travel. Byleth asks them what they’re doing and they respond, “oh, nothing. Just thinking how the time has finally come,” in Arval’s voice. Shez then grabs Byleth and teleports them to an empty void. Byleth prepares to fight Shez, who in turn raises their hands and says they don't know what happened. Epimenides appears and monologues about the fall of the Agarthans for a while and then tells Byleth and Shez that ""the Fell Star"" and ""his worthless vessel"" are trapped in Zahras forever. Byleth hears Sothis' voice, as if from afar, command them to kill Epimenides; once they do, for a moment, the form of a woman appears in a rift of light that deposits both of them at the very same place and time they started. Completing this paralogue unlocks the Asura class for Shez.

A: *Stand Strong at Shambhala.* This battle plays out much as in current Silver Snow; however, in the lead up, Rhea is more regretful, seemingly, of what happened to Byleth. Rhea seems eager to finally take her revenge, with Dimitri solemnly offering his support. The battle plays out the same. When Thales calls down the javelins, Rhea stops them, and when she lands, Byleth and Dimitri if he's recruited thank her profusely. There’s a brief moment after the battle where Byleth, shown by a dying Myson, gets the chance to use the Asclepius Engine and, rather than demanding they try to use it to call back Sothis, Rhea allows Byleth to choose a single unit that died over the course of the playthrough; in addition to all the dead units, Jeralt is an option, and if you choose Jeralt then you gain support with both him and Rhea and there's a CG of Jeralt hugging Byleth after emerging from the machine. Then, however, the Nemesis awakening scene plays out as Rhea, Byleth and possibly Dimitri begin discussing how to proceed with Fodlan.

# Chapter 24: Following a Dream

After the Agarthans are defeated, everyone gathers at the monastery to discuss Fodlan’s future only to find that a man and an army of undead soldiers are [tearing northward.](https://imgur.com/a/DHN2CZd) Dimitri if he was recruited, Jeralt if he was resurrected and it isn't Dimitri, or otherwise Seteth - returns barely alive from trying to slow his advance. Rhea’s reaction to their return is grateful for Dimitri, relieved for Jeralt, and extremely relieved for Seteth, who she reminds she attempted to insist not go in the first place. Everyone agrees: they have one more monster to stop before Fodlan’s future is safe.

A: *The King of Liberation.* At the Tailtean Plains, Rhea makes note that this is where she slew Nemesis all those years ago. Finally, Nemesis and the Ten Elites appear, along with a few Agarthan mages. Lamine does something which covers the battlefield in sludge, though the rivers stop it from spreading too far.Thus begins the final battle. Nemesis and his Elites fight against the Knights of Seiros and the Imperial army to the sound of God-Shattering Star. After you destroy the Ten Elites and defeat Nemesis himself, the final cutscene triggers.

If you recruited Dimitri, then it’s Dimitri who rushes Nemesis, Rhea right behind him. Nemesis knocks both down and runs at Rhea only for Dimitri to throw Areadhbar and knock him out of the way. Rhea stands and Dimitri orders her to protect herself. She hesitates, then grabs his arm and orders him to do the same. As Nemesis swings again, the two make a united charge against him, Areadhbar to the legs and the Sword of Seiros to the head. Nemesis tries to parry Areadhbar and Rhea cuts his head clean off, with it flying in a wide arc to land on the grass as she turns and cleans her blade with a sigh.

If you didn’t recruit Dimitri but recruited Yuri, Rhea rushes at Nemesis only to be stopped by a hand on her shoulder as Yuri tells her not to rush in. Nemesis mocks her, and Rhea grits her teeth but holds back. Nemesis finally charges, just in time for Yuri to jump in front of him, warp out of the way as he swings and cut his hamstrings, leading him to fall at Rhea’s feet. Rhea drives the Sword of Seiros through his heart, killing him, before turning away with a sigh.

If you didn’t recruit your lord or Yuri, but resurrected Jeralt, then the hand on her shoulder is Jeralt. He tells her he wants a go at this so-called King, and swordfights Nemesis for a bit. Rhea yells for him to leave Nemesis to her, and Jeralt counters that she’d have to make him. Rhea goes as though to shove him aside, then hesitates. She waits a moment, then as Nemesis lunges, casts Agnea's Arrow, incinerating him right in front of Jeralt, who turns to her and thanks her as she simply sighs.

If you didn’t meet the conditions for any of the above, then Rhea rushes Nemesis only to be knocked to the ground and disarmed. Byleth blocks Nemesis’ sword before it can strike her, and Rhea stands in shock. Byleth knocks Nemesis back, turns to Rhea, and then just as Byleth is about to step back, Rhea does so, turning with a sigh as Byleth dispatches Nemesis.

After this, the appropriate S support cutscene plays, then Byleth and their spouse are standing close together for the final scenes of Rhea and, if recruited, Dimitri discussing changes to be made in the future. Afterward, if your spouse is Seteth or Yuri, they mention they aren’t sure if this will be a good idea, then a cutscene begins regardless of S support status. Byleth lays the Sword of the Creator in a shallow grave, then lies beside it. Rhea kneels as they close their eyes, cuts open their chest, and pulls out Sothis’ Crest Stone. Rhea immediately heals Byleth with white magic, and their heart begins beating as their hair bleeds to blue. They sit up and look to Rhea, who crushes the Crest Stone, then drops the fragments in the grave. Byleth grabs a shovel, as do Rhea, Seteth, and, if recruited, Jeralt and your lord. Then there’s a scene from inside the grave of dirt covering it up, and a long sigh and Sothis whispering “finally.” Cut to outside the grave; Rhea is crying silently and whispers “goodbye, mother,” before hugging Byleth, then it goes to the ending text and end cards. The ending crawl changes slightly, based on whether you recruited Edelgard or not.

**Without Dimitri:** A rising flame was alight as the flow of time carved a new history for Fódlan. The final battle was over, and Nemesis was destroyed, along with the Agarthans. After five and a half years of war, a new age was set to begin. The Empire, Kingdom, and Alliance were forever changed, many of their leaders gone and the rest stepping up with the help of the Church. The borders were reinforced by divine decree, and many policies the Church had once held sacred were reworked entirely. The church's new leader became a champion of the people, working tirelessly to help them overcome the horrors of war and to carve a path towards reconstruction. Just as Saint Seiros tended to those who suffered in wars of the past, Fódlan's new rulers, with her guidance, embraced their role as guardians of the continent and its people.

1ccw0ah,1,2024-04-25,What is generative AI - Creative Spark or Ethical Minefield?,u/Bedroom_Physical,1hub_ai,https://www.reddit.com/r/1hub_ai/comments/1ccw0ah/what_is_generative_ai_creative_spark_or_ethical/,"The world of artificial intelligence (AI) is experiencing a renaissance. At the forefront of this revolution lies generative AI, a fascinating subfield focused on creating entirely new and original content. Imagine a tool that can write captivating marketing copy, design unique logos based on your ideas, or even generate code snippets to automate tasks. Generative AI makes all of this possible, and it's rapidly transforming numerous industries.

## How Does Generative AI Work? Unveiling the Engine Room

But how does this magic happen? Generative AI models are essentially trained on massive datasets, like text, images, or code. They analyze the patterns and relationships within this data, allowing them to ""learn"" and predict how new content should be structured. Think of it like a student studying different artistic movements or writing styles – the AI observes and learns, then uses that knowledge to create something entirely new.

### Large Language Models (LLMs): The Powerhouse of Text Generation

Many generative AI systems rely heavily on large language models (LLMs). These are complex AI models trained on colossal amounts of text data, empowering them to understand and generate human-like text. Think of LLMs as super-powered language tools that can analyze and manipulate text in sophisticated ways.

A prominent example is GPT-3, which has garnered significant attention for its ability to generate realistic and creative text formats, from poems and code snippets to marketing copy and scripts. These LLMs can be ""fine-tuned"" for specific tasks, making them incredibly versatile tools for various content creation needs.

## **Beyond Text: Generative AI's Impact Across Industries**

The potential of generative AI extends far beyond just text generation. Here's a glimpse into its exciting applications across different industries:

&#x200B;

### * **Visual Arts:** Models like DALL-E and Stable Diffusion are revolutionizing visual content creation. Based on text descriptions, these models can generate stunningly realistic images. This opens doors for designers, advertisers, and anyone needing unique visuals for their projects.
### * **Audio Generation:** Generative AI is making waves in the audio domain as well.  WaveNet, for instance, can synthesize human-like speech or even generate music based on training data. The possibilities range from improving virtual assistants and text-to-speech systems to AI-powered music composition.
### * **Code Generation:**  Generative AI models can analyze existing code and even generate new code snippets based on specific requirements. This can significantly improve developer productivity and automate repetitive coding tasks.

##**The Future of Generative AI: A Balancing Act**

Generative AI is undeniably a powerful tool with immense potential for the future. However, it's important to acknowledge the challenges that come with this technology.

&#x200B;

###* **Bias and Fairness:**  Generative AI models are only as good as the data they're trained on. Biases present in the training data can be reflected in the generated content. Developers need to be mindful of these biases and take steps to mitigate them.
###* **Privacy Concerns:**  The vast amounts of data required to train generative AI models raise privacy concerns. Ensuring responsible data collection and usage practices is crucial.
* **Misuse Potential:**  Like any powerful technology, generative AI can be misused.  Creating deepfakes or spreading misinformation are potential concerns that need to be addressed.

##**The Road Ahead: Responsible Development and Democratization**

Clearly, generative AI holds immense potential for the future. However, responsible development and deployment are key to maximizing its benefits while mitigating risks. Researchers, developers, and users all have a role to play in ensuring ethical and responsible use of this technology.

Excitingly, platforms like 1Hub.ai are emerging to make generative AI more accessible to everyone.  These platforms provide user-friendly interfaces and modular functionalities, empowering individuals and businesses to leverage the power of generative AI without needing extensive technical expertise."

1cd00km,1,2024-04-25,This is my story: thanx for the memories (I think),u/sudeley2939,conan,https://www.reddit.com/r/conan/comments/1cd00km/this_is_my_story_thanx_for_the_memories_i_think/,"Disclaimer: this writing is merely a series of reflections and is meant to be introspective, satirical, and somewhat ironic. Please do not comment on this unless you have read it thoroughly. I felt inspired to write this after reading a similar post by a Reddit user. I'm re-posting this because it was removed after a Reddit user was trolling me to accuse me of needing Adderall when the user admitted to loving Adderall. I am not ""whacky,"" a ""whackado,"" or ""unhinged."" The purpose of this writing is to encourage your self-reflection. I don't care about length of anecdote--you can cut-and-paste this and use ChatGPT to summarize it with five to seven main points and even instruct ChatGPT to psychoanalyze it according to Sigmund Freud or Carl Jung.

In high school, I wanted to be a comedian. As you might imagine, I  had yet to talk to a guidance counselor. At one point, I told people, I  should be voted Most Likely to be on a Game Show--this was after the  advent of reality TV with the beginning of Survivor, which, last I  checked has had so many seasons, the season must be written in  scientific notation. Because of shows like Survivor, I saw no future in  writing for TV shows, when I had wanted to write for sitcoms or Law  & Order. And yet, I remember when Jeff Probst was the host of the  short-lived Rock 'n Roll Jeopardy on VH1 before becoming the host of  Survivor (somehow, he doesn't appear to have aged a day). I remember the  greatest moment in TV history that nobody else saw, which was when Rock  'n Roll Jeopardy featured Graham Nash, Joe Walsh, and Mark McGrath. At  this point, all three musicians count as ""classic rock,"" but back then,  McGrath was the kid among the elders of Rock. McGrath knew something  about The Eagles that Walsh did not, to which Walsh quipped that, when  McGrath was learning about rock history--he was making rock history. To  this day, I cannot find the clip--even on YouTube, but that is,  nonetheless, the way I like it.   

The reason I invested much of my time in wanting to be a comedian  is, well, I think--it depends on what your meaning of the word ""is,"" is.  But really, it's because I was in independent studies for most of  freshman year and sophomore years for a long-list of reasons that  probably are not very interesting in a Reddit post but might make for  better substance in a tragic-comedy of an Irish nature (turns out, my  maternal grandpa's side was from Ireland, which I did not know until  recent years; so what I'm saying is, I think I have an inner Irish drunk  screaming to get the Led out). I fell off my bike before freshman  year--concussion. Add that to what was likely a concussion from being  rattled by M-80s on campus (punks in 1st quad lighting M-80s), which can  also be a traumatic brain injury--and I went into independent studies. I  had done well in middle school and my dad had a 4.0 in high school, so I  believed in my ability to learn without the structure of public school,  only to learn how to learn from the internet in the late 90s. Doing so  was possible back then, but would take hours and probably will result in  people thinking there is something wrong with you. Just because I did,  doesn't mean you should. I don't recommend it. Such as, I spent hours in  writing and re-writing sentences in Microsoft Word until I figured  out--what the fuck is a passive sentence? I had turned the settings to  high so I would know all the things wrong with my writing, but all that  sounds like, eventually, is ""all work and no play make Jack a dull boy.""  Ironically, I learned the answer to ""what the fuck is a passive  sentence"" from the infamous quote by Bill Clinton: ""It depends on what  your meaning of the word 'is' is.""   

Or, as Ralph Wiggum once said, ""Me fail English? That's un-possible.""   

I did, however, have a mentor, Dr. Maimes (Bruce Maiman, Ph.D), who  was a showrunner for a morning madhouse show on KDON in the  Monterey-Carmel-Salinas market...which is where Craig Kilborn got his  start in local news before leaving for SportsCenter and then The Daily  Show. So what I'm also saying is, I'm old enough to remember when Craig  Kilborn was the host of The Daily Show. Similarly to Mark McGrath on  Rock 'n Roll Jeopardy--there aren't many clips of that on YouTube. The  nickname Dr. Maimes gave me was the, ""TV madman,"" because I would  call-in and talk back to them with clips from TV shows, such as, Homer  Simpson saying, ""Will you two shut up? People are trying to sleep!""   

The point of honing my writing skills was for college essays and  belief that applied knowledge was better than a test score or grade  (albeit, those things aren't really an issue for me, now, but were at  the time because I had been in independent studies so my transcript was  junked up with P's that did not indicate C or higher). The hope was, I  could still get accepted to a big name college or university out of high  school, rather than have to attend a community college. The problem is,  to quote the name of my neighbor's wireless network,""shit ain't free.""  Unfortunately, the neighbor is only anonymous to me and I cannot provide  residuals for a network name that might have copyright protection. Let  that one go viral, I suppose. But I digress...ironically. I had no money  for a big name college or university--or, scholarship or trust fund. I  did not qualify for student loans either because my dad was making more  money and my older sisters were not dependents.   

I should have been playing baseball and football in high school, but  like I said, I had been in independent studies and I had, somewhat,  given up on myself at the time because of allergy related breathing  issues and more severe case of post-nasal drip because of pollination  levels after the rains of El Nino/La Nina (1997, 1998). I also knew next  to nothing about football at the time and my dad was a Raider fan after  Joe Montana left the Niners (including Montana's time with the  Chiefs)--I didn't like to watch the games because of the Black Hole  fans. Fast forward: after high school, I became a Raider fan after  having been a fair-weather fan of the 49ers (when Jerry Rice signed with  the Raiders). So, I dedicated my time to losing weight and exercise  after high school, despite the frequent problems with mucous and  infections (rhinitis, sinusitis, bronchitis--my weight lifting teacher  in high school dubbed me, ""I always have bronchitis"").   

The ""reward"" for this newfound dedication was slander and libel  (college newspaper) by false and politically motivated accusations when I  was in the Student Senate at Cabrillo College. The false accusations  being, that I was suicidal and wanted to bring a gun to campus--the  false accusations coming from a backstabber, Jonathan Mark, who was  hooking up with a girl, Leflora Cunningham-Walsh, who was cheating on  her boyfriend. I made the mistake of taking her encouragement to  exchange emails with her--I was a little naive (like I said, two years  in independent studies and when I did go back, I was oft-sick, my nose  was not draining right). Jonathan was the type who pretends to be your  buddy and he even invited me to his house several times, including to  watch the debates between John Kerry and George W. Bush in 2004 and Game  2 of the World Series (the one with Curt Schilling and the bloody red  sock), only for Mark to go around telling people, ""he knows where I  live!""   

Part of their slander and libel (college newspaper) about me was  because I kept a Late Night with Conan O'Brien mug in my Student Senate  office--I bought the mug at the NBC Store in Manhattan on August 31,  2001. We flew back to SFO on Tuesday, September 04, 2001. I talked a lot  about having wanted to be a comedian but by then, I was mostly  disillusioned with comedy for a number of reasons...I could explain this  but I don't want to because it's too off-track or  stream-of-conscious-y. I think the gist is, I was the type who  sympathized with Sen. Joe McCarthy of McCarthyism but was also listening  to the music of Bruce Springsteen and watching a show whose bandleader  played with Springsteen. By the logic of anti-communists...........was I  communist? I also opposed the push to remove the gender-signs from the  campus bathrooms--in 2004.   

This was Santa Cruz county, so--much of what has been going-on today  politically and culturally is nothing new to me. I had also been on the  front page of the Santa Cruz Sentinel at a Bush/Cheney rally in  Downtown Santa Cruz. My dad was also friends with Dr. Stan Monteith, a  radio-host who used to run for Congress against Leon Panetta. Dr. Stan  was also a major influence on Alex Jones; both of whom were pushing the  Y2K scare in the year 1999. Don't tell that to Tucker Carlson though,  lately, he's been telling you: Alex Jones has been right about  everything (such as, predicting the attacks of September 11, 2001).   

Basically: I ""trauma dumped"" all the details of this kerfuffle  (including salacious details I knew because Jonathan was prodding girls  about their sex lives at his parties) in Word-journals I put passwords  on, only to get drugged by Chris Robinson with cookies he distributed at  a Student Senate meeting. The cookies were made with cocaine and  marijuana. Chris fashioned himself as a wannabe Boston George (George  Jung from the Johnny Depp movie Blow). I went home and cut-and-pasted  the Word-journals and sent those out as emails and instant messages.  Chris was on the committee that suspended me. He contacted me afterwards  to tell me about the cookies and threaten to kill me if I ratted on  him. I assured him, nobody would believe me even I told them because my  credibility was shot. Because of that, I moved to Spokane with my  parents from Soquel when my dad sold his house in Soquel in 2005--which,  oddly enough, was bought by a ghost-writer for Hillary Clinton. They  wanted to get out of the hurricanes in Florida. The same year as  Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.   

In more recent years, the good news is, I did finish my BA in  history at SJSU, albeit I was accepted for transfer to the UCLA and UC  Davis in 2007, which I note because of the rigor of coursework but I  chose to attend Eastern Washington University because I thought it was a  better chance to settle down, only to get fired without cause by The  Home Depot in Liberty Lake (they had been trying to blame me for things I  didn't do, such as, fork-lift related accidents when the store had been  allowing employees to clock-in drunk or hungover but were not sending  people for alcohol testing after accidents). I'm the true meaning of the  gig economy--after getting fired without cause, I worked on two movies  starring Amber Heard: The Joneses and John Carpenter's The Ward. I was a  stand-in for Richard Jenkins in an independent film, Norman...the only  reason I note this is, is because my acting coach, Ralph Peduto, played a  gravedigger in an episode of Monk and I was a stand-in for an actor  who's notable for having played a ghost on HBO. You'll either think  that's really weird or kinda funny. My 6th grade home room teacher  taught the class ""Motto"" by Langston Hughes about a gravedigger who digs  to be dug in return.   

I also wrote blogs for Bleacher Report between 2008 and 2011, when I  was de-platformed in 2011 and BR acquired by TBS and Time Warner in  2012 (very funny?). I will claim, the main reason TBS acquired Bleacher  Report was to shut-me-up. I was also in ComedySportz in San Jose between  2013 and 2014--Team Coco's producer, Matt Gourley was in  ComedySportz...where? I have no idea. They were considering me for the  main show, but I stink at guessing games.   

Additionally, I have paid off old student loans.   

Yes, Joe Biden, it is possible for millennials to pay off old  student loans for degrees that are mostly feckless in helping to land a  career. I do suspect that, the Biden administration might be reading  this shit because my uncle was a delegate for Hillary Clinton from Las  Vegas in 2016 and in his words, it was ""rigged."" My uncle also says he  was friends with Rep. Zoe Lofgren...my aunt worked for Lycos at the time  of the dotcom boom-and-bust. It is feasible that, an ""expert"" opinion  to Lofgren on regulating the internet was coming from my uncle. Lofgren  is also the same Rep who had Stephen Colbert (back when he was funny)  testify before Congress in 2010.   

My dad also sold the duplexes he bought in Spokane after the  BLM-Antifa ""mostly peaceful"" protests in Seattle because prices of real  estate outside Seattle were skyrocketing. Because of this, I found the  old Late Night mug in the shop that on the property. I decided to donate  the mug to Goodwill. The same shop in Spokane Valley is where I threw  many things into the furnace, such as, old VHS tapes I had recorded TV  shows on, including Late Night, Law & Order, The Tonight Show, and  Friends. Into the fire. Nothing beats the warmth of watching the flames  of VHS ribbon and plastic. I still have my old Mad Magazines and TV  Guides though.   

So, there's only one way I know how to end this post and it's by  quoting Dennis Miller, whom I spoke to on-air back in 2007 because his  wife sent instant messages to him on his radio show to tell him he had  been mean to me when I asked why he thought Ron Paul was a ""nut."" He had  me call back to apologize.   

Of course, that's just my opinion. I could be wrong.   "

I have been teaching special education for 20 plus years! I have worked in the most challenging schools and helped failing students graduate high school. I have created strong bonds and relationships with students and other professionals. 

I am being investigated because I allegedly used ChatGPT to write my IEPS. When the school I have worked at has given me no support. The teachers get defensive when I ask about how students with disabilities are doing in their classes. 

I was seen as the leader of this school. 

I've been a pillar of support and leadership in my school, staying late to help students and collaborating with administrators to maintain order. It's disheartening to see how easily one person's misguided actions can tarnish years of hard work and dedication.

Now there are fake stories being spread! This school has given me no support. I have been doing everything on my own. Doing everything I can to create a positive environment for students. 

What has happened to me is degusting and proves how teachers are being treated like children. 

I know there was one person who destroyed my name. Women tend to talk a lot but she talked the most. 

She was not thinking clearly. "

Committed to: UBC

**Additional Information:**

why i committed to ubc:

inb4: ""why not cmu"" -> cmu scs was the dream for a really long time, as full pay with slim to none hope of getting aid, they would want half a million dollars after interest from me. for an undergrad degree. **no.**

with UT, i love it and all (visited friends on campus like twice), but the dorms are section 8 as hell and its significantly more expensive for little actual benefit for me. i can get all of my same goals achieved basically anywhere else as UT (equally so at somewhere like UBC or McGill), but UT would just be like 30 or 40k more expensive for no reason

i also nearly committed to UH bc money, but UBC kind of serves as the best middleground between all of these options, plus I am from vancouver  and a legacy of the university (i used to live there when i was like 1 year old and my mom went to nursing school there)

my ending advice, as a really bitter senior, on college applications:

looking back, at the end of these four years of straight ass, the only feeling i feel isnt some immense feeling of accomplishment, its just fear and regret tbh. doing all of this has allowed me to meet some of the most interesting, motivated people i'll probably ever meet and to have the most incredible experiences of my life, but a lot of it really is just a straight grind. i really just regret how much i focused my high school time on just building a resume rather than just doing stuff i thought was really interesting and just going hard in the paint in that shit, because now, as a senior on the verge of graduation, i realize that kanye basically said it best in good morning: ""look at the valedictorians scared of the future."" i've spent so much time focused on just looking good for college that now that I'm actually headed off, I realize that I'm almost mentally unable to live in the present moment rather than looking countless years into the future and that I'm absolutely terrified about the immense amount of changes my life is about to go through.

i think my best piece of advice for anyone younger, really, is to stay away from forums like this. only use the wiki of a2c, avoid this sub in particular, and just block collegeconfidential from your router lmao. the reason why the college admissions process is so awful is that its become so gamey, when in reality, the more naturally you take the process, the higher likelihood that you will just naturally end up where you are probably best suited for. if you grind out just trying to make it to a top uni, you'll just feel miserable while you're there because you've spent so much time being someone you arent, and this college will admit you on the basis that this person that you arent is a good match for them, so you'll find actually fitting in pretty difficult. just think of it like this: take college applications seriously, but understand that you don't simply live to write things down and brag about them. rather, live for the sake of having amazing memories, as that authenticity is the secret sauce that makes the amazing essays that people are constantly wishing for. additionally, remember that this whole process isnt meritocratic based on any easily measurable characteristics like gpa or extracurriculars. its based on trying to determine how much you as a whole person fit the school's interests."

* Cap women tend to act A LOT like a Sag (wild child, loud, whimsical, adventurous, blunt) when they were a child
* Gemini moons tend to feel most unsteady in their beliefs when it comes to romantic relationships, causing them to seek a lot of outside opinions in that arena 
* Cancer & Sag are two peas in a pod - most specifically in friendships
* Air signs with a 12H sun come off more Scorpio than Pisces // Yet fire signs with a 12H sun come off traditionally Piscean since it rules the 12 house
* Saturn in 10H come off as the stereotypical ""ambitious but lazy"" until they hit their saturn return. I have this placement lol
* Most smokers in my life have Pisces in their big 3 (saw someone say this and i agree so much!)
* Virgo venus are fond of getting/making handmade gifts 
* A lot of cancer risings are mistaken for scorpio/cap risings due to their nonchalant, cold nature 
* Moon opposite Saturn placements tend to be emotionally withdrawn in whatever house Saturn sits in 
* Libras dislike when people are late yet often are late themselves 
* Taurus men and women are the most alike compared to any other sign gender pairing 
* A lot of beauty influencers have Leo in their big 3: more commonly their rising is Leo
* Aqua risings tend to have poor or unique posture 
* Sag mars and sex in cars is a pattern lol 
* Gemini mercuries tend to talk out what they're writing (dunno if this makes sense) 
* Cap moon women are VERY marriage orientated (more than Libra moon I'd argue)
* Cap men want respect, yes. But more than respect, I've noticed they value being considered in their partner's future plans 
* Most of the Scorpio people in my life do not talk unless spoken to
* Libras tend to dominate manager roles 
* Aries sun will send you an aggressive, mean text when you break their boundaries. Then smile at you lovingly hours later
* Bonus: am a teacher and most of my students (100+) are Libras, Scorpios, and Sags."

But I feel getting it out is needed for future improvement. I’m a masters CS student at a very average public university in the US, I also received my bachelors from there. During my tenure as an undergrad, in the beginning I did well but as I got to the 3rd and 4th year and the classes got harder I did the bare minimum in classes. This means no side projects, no motivation to do any either, no internships, and forgetting everything the moment I turned in an assignment or finished a semester. I kept telling myself that I’ll read upon this fundamental concept and such “later” but later never came and I have a very weak foundation for the stuff I’m doing right now. This means I rely heavily on ChatGPT whenever I get stuck on a problem, which makes me feel awful and dumb, which leads to more bad behavior. I’ve never finished a project that I’m proud of. During my masters I got exposed to ML and took a NLP class which I thoroughly enjoyed mainly cuz of the professor and I want to do research under this professor in Fall 2024, but my programming and especially python skills are sub par and my knowledge of ML is insufficient. I have 3.5 months to build a good foundation and truly learn ML and NLP instead of just using chatGPT the second I don’t understand something. I’m thinking for start, I do the ML specialization course by Andrew NG and complement it by Andrej Karpathy zero to hero playlist on YT. Does anyone have any suggestions or recommendations or if this is a good starting point and what I should do after I finish these courses. I’m tired of being incompetent and I want to change that.

I’m 19, he is 31/32ish. he’s the nicest teacher/doctor that I’ve ever seen, he’s so dedicated to teaching it’s so impressive, and he’s so understanding you can’t even believe, and he’d be staying up until 12am answering our questions, and on midterm nights, he answers us until around 2/3am, so please don’t call him a creep or whatever cuz trust me he isn’t. 
Do i like him? Kinda, but, in the beginning, it was like how a student would like a good teacher, but now? After considering the possibility that he might actually have feelings towards me? Idk, i still do like him as a teacher, i’m just not sure if i stared liking him as a man or not, i might, but i still dk. Do i want him to like me or be attracted to me? Idk. 
Why am i thinking this way? My friends. One of my friends said that she didn’t like him since the beginning cuz he “clearly” likes me and is a “creep” for that. When i told her that i don’t think so, she told me that no girl in the world would be sure about a man liking her. 
My other friend, who is taking the same class as me, told me that i was “special” to him when i was complaining about the fact that i might have to skip the class and how hard would it be to catch up. 
Why did i started thinking that they might be right? I’ll tell you, and it might sound like I’m delusional or like I’m talking about a teenage boy, or even as if I’m talking about some school rom-com show, but i’m not, i promise.
1/ he gave us a problem to do in class, when i was done, he noticed, whispered “My eyes are on you btw, wanna try and do it?” You may wonder why i would mention this, and it’s simply because he literally ALWAYS lets chatgpt randomly select a name, or would give a random student a range of numbers and ask them to pick one, and whoever’s serial no. is that will have to answer, 
2/ i sit in the first row, once, i sat in the back and he was like “no, come to the front.”
3/ my classmate once joked about how I’m the only one who can’t zone out in class cuz he ALWAYS notices me and would ask me if i was catching up. He doesn’t ask anyone, this girl sits right next to me and says that she zones out many times and he doesn’t care at all.
4/ whenever we pass by each other, he would be looking down, but when he KNOWS that there’s no one around here but us, he would greet me with a smile, and yes it happened multiple times.
are there more reasons? yes, but i wrote a lot already. 
Do i want you to feed my delusions and tell me he likes me? Absolutely no, as i said, i’m not sure if i like him as man, but what i’m sure about is that he’s a great teacher and has an amazing reputation around uni that everyone wants to take courses with him."

As you chat with ChatGPT, you can ask it to remember something  specific or let it pick up details itself. ChatGPT’s memory will get  better the more you use it and you'll start to notice the improvements  over time. For example: 

* You’ve explained that you prefer  meeting notes to have headlines, bullets and action items summarized at  the bottom. ChatGPT remembers this and recaps meetings this way.
* You’ve  told ChatGPT you own a neighborhood coffee shop. When brainstorming  messaging for a social post celebrating a new location, ChatGPT knows  where to start. 
* You mention that you have a toddler and that  she loves jellyfish. When you ask ChatGPT to help create her birthday  card, it suggests a jellyfish wearing a party hat. 
* As a  kindergarten teacher with 25 students, you prefer 50-minute lessons with  follow-up activities. ChatGPT remembers this when helping you create  lesson plans.

How do you guys think it is implemented? I would imagine it does something like:

\- Recognizes certain prompts as ""memory instructions"" and decides to keep these as ""long term memories""

\- Uses Vectorized embeddings to store chunks of memory instructions into ""long term memories"".  
\- Keeps these ""memory"" instructions within the short-term context window by periodically re-inserting the instruction into the conversation when the context window length would be exceeded (i.e. when the model is close to ""forgetting"").

I am implementing an openai wrapper (with function calling support) and I currently use truncation / summarization to manage the context window. I am curious about integrating a pseudo-long term memory feature into my own code + periodically re-insert these ""memory instructions"" into recent conversation context, but as I only use Chat Completion streams, I would need a total refactor if embeddings were at play (and I also have heard that OpenAI embedding can be very expensive compared to local LLM embeddings which I also play around with).

1ce2oi2,13,2024-04-26,Chat GPT teaching experiment,u/Ajimaestro,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1ce2oi2/chat_gpt_teaching_experiment/,"Hello all!

Today I did an interesting experiment/learning opportunity with my students that you may want to try if you are like me and are losing your mind with how hard they are trying to push AI and curriculum reform based on this idiotic idea that ""if it is googleable, there is no point to students learning it."" What I'm seeing from education youtube is charlatan after charlatan basically saying human teachers may not be necessary in so few words.   


I teach biology and punnet squares for some unknown reason are very difficult for a lot of my students. It's a horrible thing to teach too because 7 kids will get it the first time I do it, and at least 7 kids will never get it no matter how long I sit and 1:1 work with them. This year I scaffolded it so well  (not bragging, this is just my 9th year painfully teaching this and this is my best product so far) that even my lowest students who actually do my process were masters, like top of the class in their understanding. Of course there are many kids who skip all of my color coding, graphic organizers, chunking, intentional sequencing of information etc and never get it because they assume they'll be able to pick it up, and can't, because these questions are essentially multi step word problems.  Anyway, I gave my honor's section a novel dihybrid punnet square question, which I had not taught them how to do in any prior class, and gave them 45 minutes to use ChatGPT to teach themselves how to solve this exact problem. They were  given a sheet of paper to create a graphic organizer or some type of tool that they could then use after the 45 minutes to answer a new dihybrid cross question with different traits. The thing about the dihybrid cross is that it looks scary and hard, but really once you know how to do a punnet square, they are easy.

I figured this activity would be a win win because students would either

 1. Realize they do need real teachers, school, education, to try because an internet they can't access or understand is useless in real life problem solving. 

2. Would learn how to use chatgpt to teach themselves novel concepts they have background information about. The way it is used for 90% of young people is copy question/paste question/copy response/past response. This could help me immensely because all of my classes are 30+, heavy sped and ELL, and a majority call me to their desk for every problem before they have even read the problem.

The students were extremely stressed over chat gpt. They didn't really understand what I meant by teach themselves and for several of them it appeared to be impossible after the first sentence of text, and they stopped trying. Really, no one understood what they were reading at first. I told them to experiment and ask the bot to ""simplify"" or to ""explain a different way"" or ""give me 3 more examples"" or ""explain with an analogy."" This helped, but a large number of them ended up resorting to using google. 

Results: 

Some really interesting learning moments came out of this activity. One girl forgot to add the word ""that"" from my prompt when she typed it into the chat box and it gave her something that was nearly unintelligible and taught them to do the problem completely wrong. It didn't even show a dihybrid cross. It was strange, because without the word ""that"", the question was still completely understandable. It took me a while to figure out what was going on with her. I felt bad for this student because she spent 25 minutes trying to understand something that made no sense. Also, several students had errors in the dihybrid cross that chatgpt gave them, which they found themselves which was really cool (indicating they learned the material). 

Sadly, google was just as bad. One student taught themselves from a dihybrid cross they found in google images that also had an error. However, about 4 kids taught themselves completely independent of me. This feels like a major win, because we hand hold to the point that I think most kids have confused the concept of a teacher helping you with giving you the answer word for word and kids merely copying what they hear. I really worry for a lot of my students because we give them a false sense of their learning with our grading system and support system, that will disappear very painfully from them if they choose to go to college. Most likely they will need to develop methods to help teach themselves outside of class hours. 

Anyway, I thought this was cool and it was fun. What I did do though, was tell them that they weren't going to be graded on right or wrong, but what I saw in their process between the two sheets. I figured this would make it fair since some of them were taught it wrong. "

Like how to program but using a car and a factory as an example. 

I know teachers and students use it now, but it seems mostly to create tests and for the students, answers to tests. I have cancelled many streaming services because I detest having to pay a monthly fee for anything, but I have never cancelled my premium subscription with ChatGPT.  It'll have to be brain dead like a zombie before I cancel at this point.

I feel like such a fraud because I've somehow gotten through several classes that require coding (mostly using chatgpt or group partners).

I also thing part of the roadblock is mental. I am very much contented with the little technology I have. I hate being on my phone a lot. I don't have social media (besides reddit; y'all caught me red-handed lolll). Too much screen time makes me anxious.

USE IT!,u/auggee88,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1ceiyb1/ai_is_an_amazing_tool_to_make_your_dayslife/,"For a teacher, AI is amazing. It has freed up so much of my time that I am now able to complete all of my responsibilities, plus some, during the school day. No more taking home papers to grade, making lessons, etc, while my wife is all pissed because we have a 9 month old, and it falls on her. It has improved work and home life. I don't know why more teachers aren't using it. Students use it, so should we.

High School Soc. St. Teacher -- I have been using ChatGPT and Google Bard/Gemini for the last 1.5 years-ish. There's so many others, but these are the only two that I found that I've needed. I've created lessons, projects, assignments, readings, rubrics (this is the best because I hate making those fucking things), emails to co workers, emails to parents, revamped our schools graduation project and was put in charge of that with a raise :) , etc. 

I also experimented with grading a students written work with a rubric and then running it through chatgpt with the rubric, and it was only off from what I got, in the student's favor, by one or two points consistently. There's potential there.


P.S. to all those reading this: It's all about the prompts that you give it. You'll usually have to refine whatever it gives you with another prompt ""redo above but add/change........"" May seem annoying but something that used to take a half hour is now less than 5 mins. Also, pre-loading some styles/work/emails/lessons/whatever gives it a better idea and makes it seem more ""authentic."" 

Also ChatGPT is better quality IMO but only goes to 2022 I think, but Google Gemini is real time. Example: for my Current Events class after Oct 7th, I had it come up with a summary of events and a bulleted history of Israel/Palestine history that I printed out as an overview and history. ChatGPT wouldn't be able to give a current summary."
1cep6qu,1,2024-04-27,Comparison,u/maxwell737,Project_Ava,https://www.reddit.com/r/Project_Ava/comments/1cep6qu/comparison/,"Prompt: Critically compare the quality of life and society we’ve built for Average Americans versus that of countries with similar or better quality while pointing out how vastly richer the US is than these other countries.

Claude Opus Response:

When comparing quality of life between the United States and other developed countries, there are several key factors to consider. While the US has the highest GDP and one of the highest per capita incomes in the world, this wealth is not evenly distributed and many other countries outperform the US on key quality of life metrics.

Income inequality is significantly higher in the US than in most other developed nations. The top 1% hold a much larger share of wealth, while the middle class and poor struggle comparatively more than in peer countries. Poverty rates are higher in the US.

Despite spending far more per capita on healthcare than any other country, health outcomes in the US are worse on average. Life expectancy is lower and infant mortality higher than in comparable nations. Lack of universal healthcare means many struggle to afford care.

Access to affordable education, especially higher education, is more limited in the US. College costs and student loan burdens are the highest in the world. Quality of primary education is uneven, with well-funded schools in wealthy areas but struggling schools in poorer districts. 

Paid time off, parental leave, and other employee benefits tend to be less generous in the US. Work-life balance is often more difficult for American workers.

Social mobility - the ability to rise from a lower economic class to a higher one - is now lower in the US than in many other developed economies. The ""American Dream"" of upward mobility is increasingly difficult to achieve.

On the positive side, the US offers more economic opportunity and dynamism than many other advanced economies. Entrepreneurship and innovation thrive in the US business environment. And while the social safety net is thinner than in some countries, those who do succeed can achieve a very high standard of living.

In summary, while the US remains the world's largest and richest economy, the lived experience and quality of life of the average citizen now lags in key ways behind other developed nations. Harnessing the vast wealth and economic power of the US to build a more equitable, healthy, and broadly prosperous society remains an ongoing challenge and source of political and social tension. Addressing rising inequality, lack of universal healthcare, struggling schools, and dwindling social mobility are key to improving quality of life for the average American."

1ceywt6,1,2024-04-28,Should teachers be punished for using ChatGPT?,u/VillageCapital2415,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1ceywt6/should_teachers_be_punished_for_using_chatgpt/,"I am a senior in high-school (an academically competitive middle college high-school) and recently I have noticed my Economic teacher’s flagrant use of ChatGPT in nearly all of her assignments. We’ll call her Ms. Slater. Miss Slater is a young teacher, relatively new staff member at this school. As far as I know she is still completing her own education while working as a teacher and frequently mentions how she is expecting a pay raise after she is finished. Teachers at this school are paid more than the comprehensive high schools in the area and I believe most of them are outstanding teachers who deserve every penny. Normally I would not care very much about a teacher using AI but this particular teacher is a different story. A few weeks back, Ms Slater sent emails out to all students stating that she had found out that a number of students had been using AI to complete assignments, which she discovered after using a free online AI detector. The following day she went on a stern rant about how she was much too qualified to be dealing with such laziness, and announced that anyone found to have been using AI would be punished over the coming weeks. I thought this was fair since technically they weren’t doing the work themselves and shrugged it off. A few weeks pass and all of the students caught have been punished. I am unsure what exactly the punishment was but Im assuming they either received 0 on the assignment or perhaps had to complete extra work. Anyway as I am doing work I start to notice how wordy and systematic the instructions on her assignments are. There are needless sections with bullet points that just explain key points and learning objectives of the assignment. Words like “delve” or “additionally” used throughout. It was these patterns that reminded me of how ChatGPT usually responds, so I copied some of her words into the very same free online AI detector she claims to use and every time they were flagged as 90-100 percent AI generated. I’ve heard these detectors aren’t always accurate but they  were every flagged every time without fail. I was shocked that this teacher, who had so  passionately ranted against use of AI, uses it herself in nearly every one of her assignments! I can’t help but wonder if she should be held to the same standard that she holds her students to. You would think someone so outspoken would practice what they preach especially at such a respected academy. If she is using AI to do all the assignments, who’s to say she’s not using it for all her duties? Grading? Lesson planning? Why should the district be paying somebody to do so much when really ChatGPT has been behind it all? Personally I don’t think it’s a crime for teachers to use it now and then, but for everything? It just feels wrong that this teacher has “rules for thee but not for me” in her class and I wonder if anything should be done. "

AI systems trained on human-generated data, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), often perform below or around human level due to their lack of search, planning, and reasoning capabilities. Despite being trained with 200,000 years of reading material, these models are still considered ""pretty dumb"". However, their value lies in their vast knowledge and language fluency [1]. Yann LeCun, a prominent figure in the AI field, emphasizes the importance of AI systems learning from high-bandwidth sensory inputs like vision, not just text [2]. He also addressed AI doomers in a speech at the Davos summit, where he discussed artificial intelligence with other industry leaders [3].







LeCun also made an interesting comparison between the human genome and AI models. He pointed out that the entire human genome, which is 3 billion base pairs, is equivalent to 6 gigabits or 800 megabytes. Only a small portion of the genome codes for the brain, and an even smaller portion differentiates humans from chimps, which is less than 10 megabytes. In contrast, even a small language model like Llama-3 7B requires 14 gigabytes of storage [4].







In other news, Groq Inc recently hosted a fireside chat between their CEO & Founder, Jonathan Ross, and CEO of Social Capital, Chamath Palihapitiya, at the RAISE Summit in Paris. The chat covered cutting-edge topics and is available for viewing on YouTube [5]. Groq Inc has also introduced Dark Mode as a user setting on GroqChat and Console, allowing users to choose their preferred setting or match it with their system [6].







Finally, NVIDIA's developer training programs are helping university instructors train researchers and students on using GPU-accelerated servers and integrating generative AI into the classroom. These on-demand sessions can be accessed through the GTC24 playlist on NVIDIA's website [7].

1cf0iqh,1,2024-04-28,Can/Should I report these tinder scammers to the police?,u/Srsl_Universe_wtf,Scams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1cf0iqh/canshould_i_report_these_tinder_scammers_to_the/,"I am quite shaken and that's why I created this new account to post this question. I would appreciate any advice.

After being pressured by friends to ""move on"" after a break-up, I decided to give tinder another chance. I am an expat living in Germany, so I prefer to date English-speaking people. I matched with a lot of guys but only two of them responded in English, claiming to be expats, so I proceeded with them. For context and on my defence, I had used tinder a long time ago when I lived in a different country and I actually met both of my ex's on the platform. I had a fairly good experience with the app. Last time I used the app was four years ago, when I was looking for a hook-up. Back in the day, it was pretty easy to tell the fake profiles and a simple reverse image search on google would quickly help me to filter out the scammers. Too bad this extremely useful service has been discontinued. 

Both guys were good looking. But I am also very attractive and in the past I have dated many guys that looked like models. That's not to brag, but only to say that I wasn't alarmed by their looks and didn't for a moment think these guys were ""too good to be true"". Still, I did perform an image search on google, which is something I always do to be better safe than sorry. The search did not come up with any results, since google has now changed their image search policies. 

We took it over to WhatsApp with both guys. Once again, this is something that I used to do in the past, and it even made me feel more secure. Therefore, it did not alarm me. 

The red flags:

\- The texting style: We chatted a little with both of them and the first thing that surprised me was that they were both seemingly looking for a serious relationship and were suspiciously respectful. I told myself I shouldn't be biased, come on, guys can be respectful too lol. But as we kept on talking, I started to get an ""off"" feeling when I was reading their texts. I realised that I could not ""read"" my interlocutor's character from their writing style. The texts were emotionless. I am a university professor and have corrected a lot of student papers written with ai to know how chatgpt reads like. I identified in these texts the same lack of emotion and personal perspective that I saw in my students' papers. 

\- Not wanting to meet/hook up: I was really surprised that neither guy suggested we met. Usually, when I matched with someone on tinder they wanted to meet asap. This was not the case. And as I was only looking for a hook-up, I started to lose interest. Then guy No. 2 asked to take me on a date a week later. I also found this strange, but up to that point I was still open to explore it further. 

\- Bringing up crypto/investing: Clearly the reddest flag was when they both brought up some sort of investment plan they are working on. Guy No. 1 casually and conveniently listed ""investing and studying the trends of cryptocurrency"" among his hobbies. He then proceeded to elaborate on what he's doing, even though I was clearly disinterested and already yawning. I wanted a hook-up, not a lesson on finances! Ironically, a few years ago I used to go out with a guy who displayed similar behavior but was 100% legit. Model-handsome, well-off, and deeply interested in crypto and nfts. I found it extremely boring whenever he would talk to me about his investing plans, but he was harmless. Reminded of that old hook-up of mine, I was already turned off by guy No. 1 and bored to death, so I started reducing communication.

Guy No. 2 was even more explicit. He told me he was a data analyst and said he was studying Forex trends etc. He even sent a screenshot of some trading graph to show me what he was doing. My response was, ""ok have fun."" He asked me how much I know about foreign exchange, I told him nothing whatsoever and left it there. But he kept on explaining and elaborating on the topic, even though I was not asking any follow-up questions. He even joked about him wanting to be my teacher in finance. At that point I was very skeptical but still thought I just happened to match two exceedingly boring rich guys that don't know what to do with their money and free time. I took screenshots of the convos and sent them to my friend, laughing like wtf, don't guys sext anymore nowadays, they just keep babbling about crypto and investing? 

Things became even fishier yesterday. After what seemed like a warm, casual message exchange, guy No. 2 mentioned he would take a 30-min break to do some trading. He asked what I was doing and I said I was chilling on my couch, watching Netflix. He asked me if I wanted to ""join him"" in trading. I joked and he responded: ""Anyway, it can be finished in half an hour. Spend this time watching Netflix. I think you can use this time to earn extra income."" And an emoji of flying dollars. At that point I was already quite shaken. It was pretty obvious where he was going with all this. Best case scenario, he was an arrogant, mansplaining, and disrespectful twat. And then bam, another text, ""And since it's your first time, I suggest you use 300 euros to start and you can earn 90-120 euros."" I replied ""I think I'll pass, but thanks anyway."" He then tried to manipulate me further by saying ""It's easy and you're smart. I'll teach you how to do it the first time."" The scam was right in front of me, as clear as a summer sky. I tried to disengage as gently as possible, asking him to not insist and stating that it makes me uncomfortable.

After taking a few moments to compose myself and calm down, I went online and started reading about scammers on tinder. I learned about ""pig butchering"". To say that I was shaken would be an understatement. I came across this sub and read stories of people losing thousands of their savings on such scams. My heart sank. Even though I hadn't shared any information with these guys (besides my phone number), I felt utterly disgusted and scared. I have never felt so violated and unsafe in my whole life. It took every inch of my self-confidence and self-respect to not take this personally and feel like a fool.  

I reported both of the guys on tinder and went on to delete my account once and for all. I still haven't blocked them on WhatsApp, and the only reason is because I don't know whether I should report them to the German authorities or not. Would there even be a point? With so many cases of people losing fortunes on tinder swindlers and their like, I can only presume that the police would be interested in pursuing such cases. Any advice would be appreciated.

TL;DR: Guys I matched on tinder tried to scam me. I already reported them on the platform. Should I report them to the police?

Yes, Charles Taze Russell, the founder of the Bible Student movement (which later became known as the Jehovah's Witnesses), was a proponent of Zionism. He believed that the return of the Jews to Palestine and the establishment of a Jewish state were in accordance with biblical prophecy. Russell expressed support for the Zionist movement and the idea of a Jewish homeland in Palestine in several of his writings.


Was Charles taze russell a Mason? 

There is no definitive evidence that Charles Taze Russell was a Freemason. While some have speculated about possible connections between Russell and Freemasonry due to symbolic similarities in some of his teachings and Masonic symbols, there is no concrete proof that he was a member of the Freemasons.

## Whether you need to create copy for your website or influence your customers’ buying decisions, storytelling can be used to your advantage.

Your customers don’t care about your business. Harsh, but true.

They don’t care about it beyond how it can help them make their lives better or solve a problem they have, that is.

But it’s not all bad news. You can use that knowledge to your advantage.

The biggest impact in marketing hasn’t been made by things like chatbots, machine-learning, IoT, or even ChatGPT4.

Despite those buzzwords dominating our zeitgeist for the last decade.

What’s resonating with marketers, designers and entrepreneurs alike is storytelling.

So why am I obsessed with storytelling, and you should be too?

# Storytelling is more than a buzzword

A terrible accident at 19 years old, where I broke my back by falling off a waterfall fueled my obsession to try and understand myself, my body, and others around me\*.

Actually, that’s *not* how my fascination with storytelling began. But I got your attention.

The universe didn’t conspire to ‘push’ me towards storytelling.

But that would sure make a great story.

In fact, that’s the story of how [Jessie Inchauspé](https://www.glucosegoddess.com/) became the Glucose Goddess.

You see, people love stories. They appeal to the emotional decision-making bits of our brains in a way that facts and figures can’t.

And from a business point of view, you should know that stories can influence those decisions.

Consumers make purchasing decisions based on their emotions (feelings and experiences) rather than information (brand attributes, product features).

In fact, storytelling is more science than magic.

# What will storytelling do for my business?

If you take the time and careful consideration crafting your brand story, it can work wonders for your business. Here are just a few potential benefits:

* You will attract more customers who are the ‘right fit’ for your brand. Those you actually want to work with and those who want to work with you
* You will keep more customers because they will feel a much deeper connection and a shared identity with your brand
* Success stories for your business will become a lot more frequent and authentic. Your image boosting will become a lot more organic thanks to your new raving fans.

So as we see, when applied to your business, storytelling can be leveraged as a tool to attract better customers and build a loyal audience. But how? By building a brand story around your customer and showing how much you can help them.But, I would be providing a dis-service if I gave away the winning formula for generating a great brand story, without sharing some context first.

# Why formulas matter

Some of you may be familiar with the ‘[Hero’s Journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey)’ popularised by Joseph Campbell, or the[ Seven Basic Plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Basic_Plots) by Christopher Booker.

Both are Jungian-influenced theories, suggesting that you can distil any story in history down to one of these basic plots.

Ultimately every great story that’s ever resonated with populations worldwide adheres to a formula.

Formulas are used to create a predictable result. Formulas are a great way for someone to study something new and to learn why and how something works. If you want to become an expert in any field, you’ve got to master the formulas.

Every author, screenwriter, or public speaker has studied the ‘formulas’ for their respective creative fields. Why? Because they work.

# Why formulas are meant to be broken

But blindly following formulas can get you into trouble too.

As Seth Godin says: “The problem with the formulas — let’s just pick an obvious category like screenwriting — is there are 10,000 hacks who are turning out formula-driven screenplays every day in Hollywood. Almost none of them turn into great movies. The great movies are the ones that broke part of the formula, right? It’s when you break one of the principles that you’re actually doing great work.”

So if you follow them to the letter, your new brand story won’t set your brand apart — which is a key reason for crafting a brand story in the first place. That means you’ve got to master the formulas so that you know how to bend them in creative ways.

That’s where the magic happens.

# The winning storytelling formula for your brand

So without further ado, I’m sharing a 4-step recipe that will help you put together a winning brand story that builds relatability and trust.

Whether the story is about a hero who faces the unknown, and needs to overcome some challenging times to transform.

About a protagonist faced with defeating a powerful enemy that threatens everything and everyone.

Or about a hero who must seek out the help of the supernatural or a guide to grow.

If you distil down the Hero’s Journey or the Seven Basic Plots you will notice they all have:

1. The main character with a dream or problem
2. A conflict, challenge, or obstacle the character must overcome
3. A resolution, achievement, or success (unless you’re writing a tragedy)

And as we’ve learned, customers only care about how you can make their lives better, so to empower your brand story, a fourth, and the most crucial ingredient is necessary.

4. Make the customer the beneficiary of your story

# Storytelling ingredient 1 — the character

Introduce your character/s to the story, in our case the person or people who conceived the business and brought it to life. Also, you want to set the scene of how things were before starting the business.

Have a look at some of these powerful brand examples:

* [From GoPro](https://gopro.com/en/au/about-us) — “GoPro was founded in 2002 by Nick Woodman — a surfer, skier, and motorsports enthusiast in search of a better way to film himself and his friends surfing.”
* [From Warby Parker](https://www.warbyparker.com/history) — “We were students when one of us lost his glasses on a backpacking trip. The cost of replacing them was so high that he spent the first semester of grad school without them, squinting and complaining.”
* [From Chobani](https://www.chobani.com/about/) — “In 2005, Hamdi took a loan from the Small Business Administration, bought an old yogurt plant, and brought a small group of passionate individuals together to make the real, wholesome yogurt that he remembered from his childhood.”
* [From Beats by Dre](https://www.beatsbydre.com/company/aboutus) — “Beats by Dr. Dre (Beats) is a leading audio brand, founded in 2006 by Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine.”
* Jessica Alba founded her company [Honest](https://www.honest.com/about-us/our-story.html) because she “…couldn’t find one brand to trust for all her everyday needs”

# Storytelling ingredient 2 — the conflict

Reading a story without a conflict would be like watching paint dry. At their core, all stories that resonate are those that deal with challenges and adversity. A problem can unite an audience in a quest for a resolution and can rally customers around your brand.

To refer to our brand examples:

* [GoPro](https://gopro.com/en/au/about-us) Founder Nick “was in search of a better way to film himself and his friends surfing.”
* The [Warby Parker](https://www.warbyparker.com/history) boys “were amazed at how hard it was to find a pair of great frames that didn’t leave our wallets bare.” whilst finding that “The eyewear industry is dominated by a single company that has been able to keep prices artificially high while reaping huge profits from consumers who have no other options.”
* Hamdi from [Chobani](https://www.chobani.com/about/) has “found that in America, yogurt just wasn’t as delicious or widely available as it was back home. He believed everyone deserved better options…”
* The conflict that [Beats by Dre](https://www.beatsbydre.com/company/aboutus) seeks to remedy is front and center in their headline: “People Aren’t Hearing All the Music”.
* [Honest](https://www.honest.com/about-us/our-story.html) was founded on Jessica Alba’s belief that “you shouldn’t have to choose between what works and what’s good for you” and she “…knew that there had to be others out there looking for safe products, simple solutions and clear information about their choices.”

# Storytelling ingredient 3 — the resolution

Without a resolution to a conflict, there would be no story. And there isn’t anything quite as satisfying as a ‘happily ever after’ that shows hope and achievement.

To use our brand examples:

* [GoPro](https://gopro.com/en/au/about-us) “has grown into an international company that has sold over 26 million GoPro cameras in more than 100 countries.”
* [Warby Parker](https://www.warbyparker.com/history) has found a resolution after realising that “by circumventing traditional channels, designing glasses in-house, and engaging with customers directly, we’re able to provide higher-quality, better-looking prescription eyewear at a fraction of the going price.”
* [Chobani](https://www.chobani.com/about/) has “grown from one man’s dream into America’s favourite Greek Yoghurt.”
* Once [Beats by Dre](https://www.beatsbydre.com/company/aboutus) identified their conflict, the resolution became clear: “Through its family of premium consumer headphones, earphones, and speakers, Beats has introduced an entirely new generation to the possibilities of premium sound entertainment.”
* As far as [Honest](https://www.honest.com/about-us/our-story.html), Jessica Alba’s mission for empowering people to live happy, healthy lives was so strong that “…she had to create…” the products that weren’t readily available.

# Storytelling ingredient 4 — your customer

This is possibly the most important ingredient to our 4-step formula.

As humans, we are all wired to have needs. As such, once our basic needs of food, sleep and shelter are fulfilled we then shift our focus on more ‘meaningful’ needs such as self-actualisation, companionship, recognition, enlightenment and more.

We are constantly looking around for ways to meet those needs, so if your brand isn’t offering a way to serve one of those, then your business may as well not exist. And no amount of storytelling is going to convince them to care.

So even though you are writing a story about your business, make sure that your customer is the beneficiary of the story’s resolution.

Let’s look at how our examples handle that:

# Storytelling — putting it all together

I know I’ve just unleashed a ton of information at you. Let me summarise.

Create a brand story around how things were, defining your main characters, the conflict or obstacles they’ve faced, and how they’ve achieved a successful resolution, demonstrating how that benefits the customers.

Simple, right?

The main idea is that customers don’t want to hear you tout your own horn.

Or sell them your product features. Consumers want to be part of a story.

Giving proof that you are the best solution to the problem doesn’t make the sale. If a customer figures something out or discovers it on his own, he’s a thousand times more likely to believe it than if it’s something you claim.

Craft a compelling journey that customers want to come along on.

# Write your own brand story

Whether you’re using storytelling to craft an about us page for your website or creating an overarching story to inform your brand mission and strategy, make sure the information is true, relevant and inspiring to your customers.

Simply listing out your highlight reel and milestones, like so many other brands do, won’t resonate with them or make anyone care.

Instead, what people will relate to is a story of your journey. A journey in which you’ve faced and overcome obstacles in the pursuit of your goals, finding a path towards success that ultimately benefits those who you serve. Your customers.

1cf9xkk,8,2024-04-28,$CHGG - who the fuck? Earnings AH Monday. ,u/EZ_PZ_LM_SQ_ZE,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cf9xkk/chgg_who_the_fuck_earnings_ah_monday/,"1. **Displacement by LLMs**: As LLMs become more advanced, their ability to provide educational assistance—from solving complex mathematical problems to generating essays and explanations—improves. This directly competes with Chegg's core offerings such as homework help, tutoring, and study guides. Given that many LLMs are becoming freely available, students might opt for these no-cost alternatives rather than paying for Chegg's services.

2. **Technological Lag**: If Chegg were to start developing their own LLM now, they would be entering the AI race significantly behind leading tech companies that have been refining these models for years. Catching up could require substantial investment in both technology and talent, which might be financially unsustainable for Chegg if they are already losing market share to free alternatives.

3. **Non-proprietary Content**: Chegg's reliance on content that is largely derived from textbooks and educational materials they do not own is a strategic vulnerability. Unlike companies that create proprietary datasets or unique content, Chegg’s value proposition can be easily replicated by competitors using LLMs to generate similar educational content.

4. **Economic Viability**: As free or lower-cost LLMs become more ubiquitous, the justification for students to pay for Chegg’s subscription-based services diminishes. This could lead to a significant drop in subscriber numbers, and hence revenue, challenging the company's financial stability.

5. **Market Perception and Investor Confidence**: The perception that Chegg cannot effectively compete in the evolving AI-driven educational landscape could impact investor confidence. This might result in reduced investment, affecting Chegg's ability to innovate and adapt, which could spiral into further market and financial declines.

Just to prove my point, I wrote this with ChatGPT.

Personally, I remember using Chegg in college and I hated it. It was clunky and expensive and often didn’t even have the exact answer to a question I was looking for. 

If anyone can think of any fuckin reason to be bullish on this stock, lmk. Insiders have been doing nothing but dumping at every opportunity. "

1cfq9z2,1,2024-04-29,I explored a new theory of spacetime with ChatGPT,u/shrlytmpl,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1cfq9z2/i_explored_a_new_theory_of_spacetime_with_chatgpt/,"For context: I was a straight C student in high school way back when, so I have less than zero authority in the world of science. After a bad trip I had (you know the kind) about three years ago, I've been curious about spacetime in general but in a ""bro science"" kind of way. I asked ChatGPT what it thought about a theory I'd been developing which explores a different take on the block universe theory. I then asked it to write a short essay to better explain this theory. It took some back and forth and asking ChatGPT to critique itself, then rewrite the essay based on those critiques. It still had issues with repetition, so I asked it to summarize the essay it had written, then forget all other versions of the essay and rewrite it from scratch based on its own summary and below is what it came up with, albeit shorter than previous versions. I kept a title from an earlier version since I liked it better but I made sure to make no other edits of my own, making revisions only by asking ChatGPT to do so itself. Thought this was a fun experiment on how ChatGPT could help someone with formal education of a subject form new ideas and communicate them. 

  
**Title: The Lichtenberg Universe: Dynamic Realities and the Nature of Time**

**Introduction**  
Traditional views of the universe often present time as a linear progression within a static four-dimensional spacetime continuum. This perspective, known as the block universe theory, posits that all moments—past, present, and future—exist simultaneously but are experienced sequentially. Challenging this static model, the Lichtenberg Universe theory introduces a dynamic element that transforms our understanding of time and reality. This theory suggests that a branching, dynamic energy, similar to the patterns seen in Lichtenberg figures created by electrical discharges, actively traverses and reshapes the spacetime block, irreversibly activating and altering its realities.

**The Lichtenberg Universe Theory**  
In the Lichtenberg Universe model, spacetime is not merely a backdrop for events but a canvas of latent potentialities awaiting activation. This dynamic energy does not follow pre-established paths but creates its own, similar to the unpredictable branching in Lichtenberg figures. As it moves through the spacetime continuum, this energy selects which realities to activate, consuming their specific conditions in the process. Once a path is activated, it is permanently altered—its original state is forever changed, rendering its previous potentialities inaccessible. This irreversible process represents the forward flow of time as experienced from our human perspective.

**Implications for Time and Reality**  
The introduction of dynamic energy to the block universe theory profoundly impacts our understanding of time and reality. Time is no longer a static dimension through which events unfold predictably but is an active, molding force that dictates the unfolding of events based on the paths chosen by this dynamic energy. This view challenges the notion of determinism, suggesting that while all potential outcomes exist, only those realized by the energy's passage truly come to fruition. Philosophically, this raises questions about the nature of unactivated realities—do they possess any form of existence if they are never realized? Moreover, this theory suggests that our conventional understanding of time as linear and unidirectional is merely a human interpretation of how this energy interacts with the spacetime continuum.

**Conclusion**  
The Lichtenberg Universe model offers a revolutionary perspective on the cosmos, illustrating the universe not as a pre-determined series of events laid out in spacetime but as a dynamic entity continually shaped by the energetic paths that forge, activate, and transform its realities. This theory enriches our understanding of the universe's structure, compelling us to reconsider fundamental aspects of time, space, and existence. By viewing time and reality through the lens of dynamic energy, we gain a deeper appreciation for the complexity and ever-evolving nature of the cosmos."
1cfqgdj,1,2024-04-29,"26M, Doctor of Medicine, do I have ADD/ADHD?",u/Temporaryuser1997,AskPsychiatry,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPsychiatry/comments/1cfqgdj/26m_doctor_of_medicine_do_i_have_addadhd/,"Hey, I'm really in need of some help here.

I've always been what you might call an ""A student."" High school was a breeze for me, and I sailed through with flying colors, coming out on top of my class. Even in med school, I managed to maintain a decent GPA of 3.22 out of 4. But here's the thing: my study method has always been a bit unusual.

I have this habit of rewriting textbook passages over and over again until I can do it quickly enough for exams. It worked for me in the past, especially since most of my exams were written, not oral. But whenever I had to recite something, like a poem, it was always a struggle. My brain just didn't seem to arrange the words the same way when I had to speak them out loud.

Then came university, where everything changed to multiple-choice questions (MCQs). I stuck to my old method, writing down loads of information on the exam paper, even though it was just a matter of ticking boxes. I was always the last to finish because of it.

But now, as a practicing doctor, I'm starting to see the downsides of my study approach. I've realized I'm not so great at thinking critically and analyzing situations on the spot. It's like my brain is stuck in ""rewrite mode,"" and it's causing problems in my daily life. My colleagues think I'm not learning because I struggle to answer questions quickly.

I'm desperate for help to overcome this obstacle. What I once thought was the most efficient way of learning now feels like a burden. Even using tools like ANKI to memorize things without writing them down takes me ages. I can't even take mental notes in my daily life – everything has to be written down. It's especially tough being a doctor with these challenges.

I've reached out to a psychiatrist for help, but progress feels slow. He mentioned I might have adult ADHD, I also mentioned to him other aspects of my life. bieng overaly organized, i must always have a list to do things, without lists i get lost, so now my lists are on Notion. I also used to study with Earmuffs literally to remove the sounds around me, until i found out about the ANC headphones, big life changer, thats just a couple.

I've also been searching for a study coach, but I'm not sure where to find one or if they can really help me.

On top of all this, I've noticed I'm a slow reader compared to others. Although I can read, speak, and write Arabic (mother language), English, and German, reading for pleasure has never been my thing. I always saw books as something to be rewritten, which I hated.

learning german was also a big challenge, i literally wrote down every single word i learned multiple times, also speaking was a big challenge.

Surprisingly, when writing essays in exams I always barely passed, because the ideas in my head arent organized and also time pressure is too much.  
My handwriting is awful, when i need to take notes on a piece of paper, its always all over the place.

Im pretty sure this also is affecting my ability to connecting the dots of the clinical findings of patients in order to make a differential diagnosis, or the diagnosis itself.

I guess what I'm asking is: do you have any thoughts on how to approach this problem? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I feel that no matter how many changes I try to make, the same thing happens every time.",u/rich_ard_d_d,Dyslexia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dyslexia/comments/1cgg7tb/what_am_i_doing_wrong_i_feel_that_no_matter_how/,"I am a university student studying engineering. I have always done poorly in my courses passing w/ low Bs and Cs despite putting in what feels like more effort than my peers. This fall semester my course load was too heavy (3 hard classes) and I ended up having to drop all of my classes. This recent semester I ended up taking retaking one of the classes I dropped last semester and taking a few lighter credit courses. Despite this lighter course load, I ended up failing the class and also doing poorly in the team research I am in.

I will have to re-take the class for the 3rd this spring and it is very embarrassing for me. 

I am trying to figure out what I did wrong the two past semesters and in all my courses before. This most recent semester I thought to try to actually learn the content conceptually. Where my strategy before was to use chatGPT on every homework or get help so I can try to get as high a homework grade as possible so despite abysmal exam grades I could still pass. I tried to genuinely learn the content this time around. Despite this, I ended up doing WORSE than before becuz not only was I doing poorly on homeworks, I was doing just as bad on exams.

  
The biggest issue is tht everything just takes so much longer for me to do. Reading, doing problems, just trying to do anything takes me 2-3x the amnt of time compared to my peers. I end up having to copy answers on the assignments not becuz I am lazy or dont feel liek it, but becuz I literally dont have a choice. Nothing will evr get done if I tried to do things the ""legitamate"" way.

It feels that no matter what approach I take, the result is always the same. I either end up failing, or barely passing. It has been very difficult to do things and extremely unmotivating.

I am curious what changes I could make to see improvements, even a small improvement is better than nothing."

Unfortunately, I couldn’t just leave it at [that](https://www.reddit.com/r/LookBackInAnger/comments/1cghg78/kids_these_days_percy_jackson_and_greek_mythology/), because Percy Jackson is now one of those deathless franchises that’s going to just keep going long after everyone has stopped wanting it to. This entry will focus on the Disney+ series, which sucks.

First, the gods really are textbook abusers, and it’s just incomprehensibly shitty for Percy to take their side on anything. Camp Half-Blood is explicitly on the gods’ side for everything (when the actual function of educational institutions of any kind should be to show their students alternatives to their priors, and call out objectively shitty behavior from anyone, most definitely including parents) and explicitly pro-bullying to boot. This really needs to be a Batman Begins or Kingsman 1 type of story (in which a noob arrives in a hidden world that greatly appeals to him, only to discover that it’s hopelessly shitty, and resolve to remake it in a much better image). But it’s not that at all; it’s…I can’t even think of an example, but it’s the kind of story in which a noob enters such a hidden world, and it is hopelessly shitty, but he doesn’t seem to notice it and just uncritically accepts and supports its shittiness because he lacks either the judgment to see how shitty it is or the gumption to do anything about it (or even be a wise-ass to the regime-supported bullies who bully him)\*1. The complete opposite of a heroic journey; he’s the kind of person who responds to bullying with ever-increasing efforts to give the bullies what they want (the bullies being everyone: other kids, his abusive dad, teachers, whoever). 

Secondly, the child-of-destiny bullshit: Percy is worse than his peers at *everything*, and yet everyone takes him way more seriously than he deserves, just because of who his dad (whom he’s never even met!) is. This is of course the kind of nepotistic behavior I’d expect from a pro-bullying school for the children of the elite, so teachers and peers bending rules to coddle Percy is very in character, but it’s still annoying that nepotism (rather than, you know, him having any particular skills or value) is the reason he’s allowed to participate in the story.

Also, diversity. I guess it’s cool that Luke is now Asian and Annabeth and the bully girl and Chiron are Black, and Mr. D is whatever Jason Mantzoukas is, but Percy is still the Whitest kid you can imagine, and that’s just not called for. He can be anything! Let him be anything else! Increasing diversity is good, but I put it to you that it’s really not much of an improvement when an all-White story turns into a very diverse story where the only White character is the child of destiny that everyone unquestioningly accepts as superior to everyone else.

Also, the show suffers from a lack of diversity in the writers’ room; tasked with showing us Percy’s desperate poverty, the best they could come up with was “getting bullied at a super-exclusive lower Manhattan *boarding school*” and “being reduced to using the *beachside vacation cabin* right by the septic tank,” as if not a one of them had ever known or even imagined what it’s like to be *really* poor.

Also, a weird thought about generations. Jason Mantzoukas, looking 50ish, is Dionysius; but why? The gods don’t age. “Mr. D” is a party animal (their literal god!), a behavior always associated with youth. So why does he look 50? I put it to you that he doesn’t need to, but the decision to cast him that way (and also Chiron, who also could look any age) is very interesting and revealing. We’ve reached an extreme point of [cultural stagnation](https://www.reddit.com/r/LookBackInAnger/comments/qa90is/on_the_fundamental_brokenness_of_american_culture/): what’s old is still old, and there really isn’t anything new. I mean, just look at this show: it’s a show that came out just now, based on a movie from like 15 years ago, based on a book series that started like 5 years before that. The big stars of today are largely the same individuals (and even more largely the same generation) as the big stars of decades past; the generation that might have replaced them has just kind of fizzled out (as seen with the cast of the movie, who were all up-and-comers in 2010 or whenever, and have all sunk out of sight since). It would be really, really strange to see actually young people and actually new content in a show like this, and so we don’t. 

(Mild historical digression: my understanding is that the three decades or so leading up to 1960 were a time of similar cultural stagnation, in which old people and old styles were about as dominant as they’ve been over the last 40 years. Youth culture just wasn’t a thing for a while (so much so that the people who were youths at the time came to be known as the Silent Generation), so it must have been a severe shock to all concerned when it made such a roaring comeback in the 60s and stayed firmly on top of all culture until the Zeroes. I suppose a similar shock is coming sometime in the next decade or two, which will certainly be not a moment too soon.) 

Also, it’s too bad that the gods are still the same characters, and their culture is so obviously ancient Greek. The camp kids don’t need to be learning to fight with swords and spears, or making animal sacrifices, or whatever. I appreciate how the gods seem to have moved on in some ways (Zeus forcing Mr. D to detox, forbidding further breeding with humans), but it’s disappointing that they all seem to be so recent; surely such changes must have been made earlier in the thousands of years since anyone really practiced Greek-mythology religion. This could easily have been fixed by having the gods’ world exist in some kind of time-bubble, where the events of thousands of (human) years ago are still contemporary; on entering the bubble, Percy could interact with people who were born in 2000 BC, or 1200 AD, or whenever else (including far into the future), all of whom are (thanks to the bubble) still teenagers. That way we wouldn’t have to ask why it is that so many ‘forbidden’ children have been born in the last 20 years after centuries of none being born at all.

The Medusa episode is kind of the centerpiece of the show, which makes sense, since that story is one of the flagships of Greek mythology. But if we’re in a world where we should believe the stories when they tell us Medusa existed, we need a pretty damn compelling reason to NOT believe all those same stories when they tell us that Medusa’s been dead for thousands of years, and the show doesn’t even try.\*2

It didn’t have to be this way; the show could just take 5 seconds to explain that Gorgonization is a routine divine punishment, and that this ‘Medusa’ is just some other mortal who happened, much more recently, to run afoul of the gods’ sensitive feelings. We could even get a good joke out of it in which the modern Gorgon freaks out about being mistaken for Medusa, and rants about how Medusa was a chump, and Gorgons are almost always smarter and tougher than that, and so on. But no, this is a story that valorizes accepting everything in the least creative and critical way possible, so this is the original Medusa and we are not to ask how or why she’s still alive, or who (if anyone) it was that Perseus killed way back when (even though, even if we accept that this must be the original Medusa, it would take like two seconds to say that reports of her death were exaggerated for purposes of godly propaganda, or that she ingeniously faked her death to escape from godly wrath). 

Also (speaking of the least critical way possible), the story tragically misunderstands the story of Medusa, in which (again; this is going to be a very long-running theme in this property, as it is in mythology in general) the gods are unmistakably villainous, gleefully torturing innocent humans for the ‘unspeakable crime’ of happening to be better than the gods themselves. Medusa herself explains this in the episode, but it’s framed as the embittered ranting of a deranged villain, and no one seems to notice that she’s exactly right! The kids pay no attention to all the sense she’s making, don’t even bother to assume she’s lying, and just…murder her in cold blood\*3 and act like that’s the only thing they could have done and that there’s nothing at all wrong with it.

Grover is the worst character ever. It makes sense that the gods would assign a satyr to don a disguise and look after Percy, but the show gives no sense that Grover actually is a disguised being who is much more than what he seems; he doesn’t act like an immortal being disguised as a modern adolescent, he just acts exactly like an actual 13-year-old, and not just any 13-year-old: a 13-year-old that’s so awkward, insecure, and incompetent as to be actively insufferable every time he opens his mouth and every time he does (that is, fails to do) absolutely anything. But with goat legs and horns, for some reason.

I’ve complained about a lack of diversity in the writers’ room, but I think I spoke too soon, because I’m pretty sure this show has taken the nigh-unprecedented pro-diversity step of eliminating the traditional segregation between organic humans and artificial beings.\*4 The writing is terrible, yes, but it’s terrible in such a *particular* way that I suspect it transcends humanity.

A specific example: we’ve established that Percy needs to go on a quest to meet Hades, and Percy does not want to go, so there’s tension there. Grover, in the one useful thing he’s ever done, tells Percy that his mom is still alive and being kept prisoner by Hades. This of course motivates Percy to go rescue her and instantly eliminates Percy’s reluctance to accept the quest. And yet Mr. D (who is as interested as anyone in getting Percy to do the quest) specifically forbade Grover from telling Percy about his mom, and Grover’s disobedience launches a multi-episode arc of Mr. D being really mad at Grover. This does not make sense! Literally any human being could tell you that it doesn’t make sense! And yet ChatGPT has not yet assimilated the knowledge that people like it when other people do what they want, and so it assigned Mr. D to be angry at Grover for telling the secret\*5 rather than happy that Grover found a way to talk Percy into doing the quest. This complaint of mine will of course turn out to be invalid if there’s some kind of shocking twist in the works by which we learn that Mr. D really didn’t want Percy on the quest, and had some compelling reason to lie about that, but I really don’t think this dumbass show has even that much wit. I suspect that this blatantly nonsensical drama will just sit there, never acknowledged, explained, or resolved.

And then at the end we get the Medusa’s head trap, done much less cleverly than in the movie (and being less clever than the movie takes *work*). Percy’s piece-of-shit stepdad\*6 comes home to find himself locked out of his apartment.\*7 I thought this was setting up a very clever reference to the Iliad,\*8 but this whole franchise was created by people who’ve never heard of the Iliad, so he just finds the head in a box by the door and looks at it, and then none of his neighbors ever questions the life-size photorealistic stone statue of their neighbor that suddenly appeared in the hallway right after the last time that guy was seen alive, and the kids once again easily solve everything by displacing their murderous aggression onto a much softer target that is less deserving than the unassailable gods who are the real cause of all their problems.

\*1 I suppose the closest thing I’ve seen is [Oliver!](https://www.reddit.com/r/LookBackInAnger/comments/14z1rfh/wont_somebody_think_of_the_children_oliver_1968/), in which the noob moves through a shitty world without seeming to understand how shitty it is, or really much of anything at all.

\*2 It makes an identical mistake with the much less-well-known Procrustes, which speaks to a really tragic lack of imagination and accountability on the part of the writers. 

\*3 using a ruse that is admittedly cleverer, and a much better use of the Cap of Darkness, than anything in the original Medusa story.

\*4 Yes, I am accusing this show of being written by an AI.

\*5 which Mr. D really never even had any reason to keep secret!

\*6 but arguably less shitty than Percy’s biological dad, given that he can ever be bothered to acknowledge Percy’s existence and hasn’t committed any mass murders I’m aware of.

\*7 a trope I’ve [ranted about before](https://www.reddit.com/r/LookBackInAnger/comments/qvq2s7/clifford_the_big_red_dog/) (tl;dr you can’t just lock someone out of their own home in New York City); I work in a housing court in NYC, so illegal evictions are a very specific trigger point for me.

\*8 The Iliad being another flagship of Greek mythology and the origin of the Trojan-Horse story, a fun detail of which is that the horse was too big to fit through the gates of the city. Armchair (and, if I remember my [Achilles](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6069.Achilles_in_Vietnam?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=xRqtaoing7&rank=1) in Vietnam, [actual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Shay)) psychologists have speculated that the Trojans fell for the trap extra hard because of this. They got so focused on the engineering challenge of widening the gate to let the horse in that they never bothered to wonder if it might be better to leave the thing outside. (Put another way, they got so focused on [how they could that they never asked whether they should](https://www.reddit.com/r/LookBackInAnger/comments/mmjb79/jurassic_park/).) But even those who got past that distraction were fooled: “If this is a trap by the Greeks,” they may have reasoned, “why have the Greeks made it so hard to fall into? Surely if they *wanted* us to bring the horse into the city, they could have bothered to make sure it could fit through our gate!” I thought that locking the stepdad out was going to be a similar thing, in which the stepdad has to break down the gate to his own city (as it were) in order to fall into a trap that dooms him. But no, it’s not a clever reference to the Iliad, just the writers wrapping up yet another story thread in the dumbest way possible."

Please provide criticism and feedback to help improve my writing.,u/AmarhuuTFM,Essays,https://www.reddit.com/r/Essays/comments/1cgoljy/im_preparing_for_ielts_academic_writing_and_tried/,"Artificial intelligence will soon replace teachers in the classroom.
Do you agree with this statement?
What is an alternative to traditional face-to-face teaching?


I personally agree with the proposition that AI will soon be educating our children, rather than teachers.
And the traditional way of teaching students in-person at a classroom might be replaced with online lessons, making it more easily accessible and flexible.

I believe this way because AI will be much more capable at the job than human teachers. To elaborate, every teacher has their own view of how the students should be and how they must learn to be that way, unlike AI machines which would have the ability to find patterns in each individual's learning style to find personalized methods of teaching in a way no human teacher could. We can see the effects of this in current times just by looking at how more and more people are relying on large language models such as chatGPT on tasks requesting discussions or feedback on their work instead of educators at their school, because they can give relatively objective and relevant answers at any time. And that difference will result in a world where machine learning algorithms could be teaching the next generation's workforce.

Teaching face-to-face instead of via online lessons  could be seen as an old approach in this kind of future where socializing and learning could all be achieved from the comfort of one's own home. No longer would students miss days worth of classes from catching a cold, and those with disabilities or others living in a secluded areas can all attend classes without ever having to let certain personal circumstances be an obstacle in pursuing their future.

In conclusion, I believe that artificial intelligence in the near time will be more effective than humans at teaching, therefore replacing them in the classroom. And also, changing the current approach of our education system by making these classrooms online could bring forth numerous improvements
related to ease of access and reliability."

Brown fat has a special job—it helps to burn calories from the foods that we eat into heat, which can be helpful, especially when we’re exposed to cold temperatures like during winter swimming or cryotherapy.

1cgw9ri,10,2024-04-30,Two big online education stocks tank more than 10% as students use ChatGPT,u/Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cgw9ri/two_big_online_education_stocks_tank_more_than_10/,"The rapid rise of artificial intelligence appears to be taking a toll on the shares of online education companies Chegg and Coursera.

Both stocks sank by more than 10% on Tuesday after issuing disappointing guidance in part because of students using AI tools such as ChatGPT from OpenAI.

Chegg, which announced a new CEO, said it expects second-quarter revenue to come in between $159 million and $161 million, lower than the $174 million expected by analysts polled by LSEG.

As a result, Jefferies downgraded the stock to underperform from hold and lowered its price target to $4 from $7, suggesting 44% downside from Monday’s close.

“We question the ability of CHGG to return to durable growth as free AI tools become an attractive alternative to a paid CHGG sub,” analyst Brent Thill wrote in a note Tuesday.

Chegg was last off by 20% on Tuesday, bringing its year-to-date decline to nearly 50%.

Current CEO Daniel L. Rosensweig, who will be succeeded by Nathan Schultz on June 1, touted the company’s advancements in generative AI on a conference call Monday.

“We see the proliferation of AI and our ability to uniquely harness its potential in education as a transformative moment for Chegg,” he said.

However, Thill questioned whether users would pay for artificial intelligence when they can get it for free elsewhere.

“CHGG has historically always beaten free competitors in the marketplace, but we believe the AI wave presents a truly credible free product experience to CHGG’s paid subscription,” he said.

Chegg’s upbeat comments on AI were a far cry from last year’s first-quarter conference call, when Rosensweig said ChatGPT was having an impact on the company’s new customer growth rate.

After Chegg’s most recent results, Morgan Stanley lowered its price target to $6.50 from $7 and maintained its underweight rating.

“On an absolute basis, Chegg’s negative growth and margin compression illustrate there is more work ahead for the company to demonstrate that AI headwinds have shifted to AI tailwinds,” analyst Josh Baer wrote in a note Tuesday.

However, JPMorgan noted that Chegg is making progress across its generational AI transformation and is confident that Schultz is the right man for the CEO job.

“We believe Schultz brings product expertise & operational knowledge as Chegg navigates its GenAI transformation & seeks to restore subscriber & revenue growth,” analyst Bryan Smilek wrote in a note Tuesday. He maintained his neutral rating and cut his price target to $8 from $9.

Meanwhile, Coursera said it expects second-quarter revenue between $162 million and $166 million, below the $178 million consensus estimate, per LSEG. It also said it anticipated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the quarter to be between -$2 million and $2 million, versus the $5 million expected from analysts polled by StreetAccount.

Coursera shares were last down 11% on Tuesday, bringing its decline for 2024 to 45%.

Coursera, too, is trying to use AI to its advantage.

Wall Street remains largely upbeat on the stock, but some firms cut their price targets. RBC Capital Markets, for instance, kept its outperform rating on the stock but dropped its price target to $18 from $25, suggesting 51% upside from Monday’s close.

“Although we believe GenAI content/products and international self-help (e.g., local payments) should provide a lift, we expect some investor pushback on the 2H acceleration now embedded in guidance, until gaining more visibility,” analyst Rishi Jaluria wrote in a note Tuesday.

Goldman Sachs also dropped its price target to $10.50 from $15 and reiterated its sell rating. The firm expects investor debates to focus on demand recovery in the near term.

“Longer term, there are still open-ended questions around the timing (in terms of adoption curves) and magnitude of how enterprises will integrate generative AI into their ecosystems and the role Coursera’s platform will play within this context (which is also likely to have an impact on the Consumer segment as well),” Goldman said.

1cgzjzf,16,2024-04-30,The Naming Of A Thing Is A Serious Matter,u/danl999,castaneda,https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/1cgzjzf/the_naming_of_a_thing_is_a_serious_matter/,"&#x200B;

[ChatGPT must have seen \\""The Ninth Gate\\"", and some Star Wars!](https://preview.redd.it/6hh9qlafqnxc1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=86b77559b7902787b24c002ddf401e9c631cf608)

Due to how *intent* functions in the dark sea, the naming of a thing is a serious matter.

According to don Juan anyway...

Which surely bums ""Cholita"" out. 

The only nickname Carlos ever gave her.

It meant, ""The little copy of Margarette, one of my oldest friends and the famous Chola of the Los Angeles University System.""

I'm simulating a hardware version of an AI on a piece of computer software right now, and had time to chat with a real AI about names.

I was curious, what comes after the ""new seers""?  We had the ""old seers"", then the new seers came about out of necessity.

And now there's us, out of necessity. And we're not like the ones of the past.

But doing ok anyway!  We've successfully cast off pretending (Shamanism).

Partly this is because we have a new guy wishing there were Naguals around.  That seemed horridly wrong to me.

Maybe he just wants a name to think about?

Here's the AI conversation about ""what we are now?""

\*\*\*

**Question:**

What does ""neo"" mean when added to something like ""conservatives""?  Does it mean the same when added to any label, such as ""old seers"", ""new seers"", and ""neo-seers""?

**ChatGPT**

The prefix ""neo-"" comes from the Greek word ""neos,"" which means ""new"" or ""recent."" It is often used to indicate a new form, version, or revival of an ideology, group, or concept. When added to a term like ""conservatives,"" resulting in ""neo-conservatives,"" it denotes a new form of conservatism that might differ in specific ways from traditional conservatism, often reflecting new ideas or approaches within the conservative framework.

Similarly, when ""neo-"" is added to other terms like ""old seers,"" ""new seers,"" and ""neo-seers,"" it serves to differentiate between these groups. ""Old seers"" would refer to the original or traditional seers, ""new seers"" could suggest a more recent generation or development of seers, and ""neo-seers"" implies a revival or new version that incorporates distinct or modified elements compared to what was traditionally known.

Thus, while ""neo-"" consistently implies something new or revived, the specific nature of what is new or how it differs from the original can vary based on the context. It signals a change or a development within the referenced group, ideology, or concept.

**Question:** Is there a better choice for ""neo-seers"", since that seems to imply the ""new, new seers""?

**ChatGPT**

You're right that using ""neo-seers"" in the context of ""new seers"" can sound redundant, as both ""new"" and ""neo-"" imply something recent or revised. A better choice might depend on what specific characteristics or distinctions you want to emphasize about this group compared to ""old seers"" or ""new seers."" Here are a few alternative suggestions:

1. **Modern Seers**: This term emphasizes that the group reflects contemporary ideas or practices, differentiating from past notions without redundancy.
2. **Reformed Seers**: This suggests that the group has undergone significant changes or reforms compared to previous versions.
3. **Advanced Seers**: This could imply a progression or enhancement in the abilities or methodologies of the seers compared to earlier groups.
4. **Revolutionary Seers**: If the changes are particularly radical or a significant departure from tradition, this term could be appropriate.
5. **Contemporary Seers**: Similar to ""Modern Seers,"" this term places the group in the present day, highlighting current relevance and practices.

Choosing a term will depend on the nuances of how these seers are different from their predecessors and what aspect of their practice or ideology you wish to emphasize.

**Question:**

Maybe you can choose. The old seers were the original olmec shamans who learned to do what shamans do using drug plants, without the drug plants. They could summon alternate states of conscious much more vivid and real than even those who used Ayahuasca or Devil's Weed, and thus no longer needed that.  The ""new seers"" came along when the Olmec world was destroyed and the old seers had to flee enemies, eventually setteling in the Toltec empire, which was also destroyed. They banded together as groups of 15 and called themselves the ""new seers"". But that came to an end with the end of don Juan Matus, the teacher of Carlos Castaneda.  And now, some of his private class students have learned to ""see"" for real, and could use a name which imply, you have to do it all, without help from anyone, just using the instructions we've collected and made available world wide, via the internet.

**ChatGPT:**

Given the rich historical context and the evolution of the seers from the Olmec to the Toltec and through the teachings of Carlos Castaneda's mentor, don Juan Matus, it sounds like the new group is defined by a deep individual responsibility and autonomy in their spiritual practices. They represent a culmination of wisdom passed down and adapted through the ages, now globally accessible and self-directed. Here are a few suggestions for naming this new group:

1. **Autonomous Seers**: This emphasizes their independence in learning and practicing without direct guidance, relying solely on accumulated knowledge.
2. **Self-Guided Seers**: Highlighting the aspect of self-teaching and personal responsibility in mastering the art of seeing.
3. **Sovereign Seers**: This term conveys a strong sense of self-rule and autonomy in their spiritual practice.
4. **Independent Seers**: Similar to ""Autonomous"" and ""Sovereign,"" this name stresses the individuality and self-sufficiency of each seer.
5. **Global Seers**: Reflecting the worldwide accessibility and application of their practices and teachings, thanks to the internet.
6. **Evolutionary Seers**: Suggesting a progressive and evolved form of seership that builds upon the legacies of the past while forging new paths forward.

Each of these names aims to capture the essence of a group that is both deeply rooted in a rich spiritual tradition and radically self-reliant, adapting ancient wisdom for a modern, global context.

I’d tell you my name, but let’s keep the anonymity on that for the time being. I like to have that kind of barrier when I’ve spoken to deranged medical students and a woman who thought she could be physically turned into a car. I wish I was joking.

I’m from Minnesota. I’m Latino and bi. I’m also a Gemini and my MBTI is ENFJ. I study business in community college, I used to study sociology but then I dropped out of uni. Long story. I work as a server at a hotel for events such as weddings, birthday parties, business retreats. I love it and I hate it, the pay is why I’m still there. 

I love listening to music, my favorite genres are rap, r&b, and alternative rock. I love to write from fiction to journaling. I love pretty much art in general, traveling, learning new things, and going out. Also play video games, but I haven’t had much time lately. I feel like I can get along with anyone as long as you can put effort into the conversation lol. 

I’d appreciate if you tell me a bit about yourself once you message, and near my age too. Don’t think we’d vibe as well if you’re 10 years older than me lmao. I’m cool with moving onto a different platform later on."
