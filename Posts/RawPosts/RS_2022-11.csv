## Introduction

Katu Veo, wastelanders! We continue to talk about the history of the Fallout world, settlements and factions. Today's article will be devoted to the history of the Cajon Pass sub-region, which became the setting for *Fallout New California* – a total conversion story fan mod based on *Fallout New Vegas*. Unfortunately, the mod cannot boast of the accuracy of the story lore. A deep study of the exposition and the plot revealed a plethora of errors in dates and relative events, so many things will have to be thought out or changed in order to preserve the logic of the canon. However, generally speaking, the lore of this mod is very important to the story, as it links the historical lore of *Fallout 2*, *Fallout New Vegas* and *Fallout 3*.

## Cajon Pass - Geography

Cajon Pass is a sub-region of the New California Wasteland on the site of the pre-war region of the same name and the **Black Bear National Park**. The region is located west of the Dune Sea and north of San Berdoo sub-region, being separated from it by the **San Gabriel Mountains**.

## The Great War

On *October 23, 2077*, a hail of nuclear warheads hit the world. Cities have been destroyed, millions have died, and society has fallen. Traditionally, we will begin to look at the history of the region from vaults and other shelters of the nuclear Holocaust period. 

## Vault-Tec Vaults

There were 2 Vault Tec vaults on the territory of Cajon Pass.

**Vault 14**. It was incredibly small and consisted of only two rooms. In one room, there were two people without food and water, in the other – one person with food and water. The duo had a device that could generate a hologram with which they could harass the lone person. It is not clear how and why this was technically done. Maybe they needed to drive him crazy, kill him, completely deprive him of sleep, and then some door would open and these two could take food and water. According to the lore of *Fallout New California*, this vault was numbered 16, but Vault 16 was already used in *Fallout 1.5*, released 4 years earlier, and therefore, for the time being, the closest free number for this vault (14) will be used.

**Vault 18** on the **Onyx Point**. Its experiment was to allow vault residents to observe other vaults revealing to them the true purpose of vaults, so that the residents were to fall into depression, and then activate a self–destruction sequence of the vault. Enclave Senator **Andrew Oran** and his daughter **Annai Oran** were supposed to arrive in this vault, but they got into an accident on the way to the vault. When they, wounded, reached the geardoors of the vault, they were already closed. Vault 18 was partially funded by Andrew, so that there was a bust of him installed in the central hall. The vault doors should have been closed for 80 years.

## Other shelters

**Fort Daggerpoint** is a dam and a military base. Before the war, **Project Brazil** was developed here. As part of this project, a parasite was bred, which, being implanted into the human body, could absorb radiation, regenerate the host's tissues and maintain its vital activity, including preventing it from aging. Annai Oran, the daughter of Senator Oran, was infected with this parasite. Perhaps she was dying of an illness or something, and a parasite was implanted in her, because there was nothing left to lose. During the war, scientists and the military took refuge in Daggerpoint for a while.

There was a fictional town of **Athens** in the region, and there was **Athens Uranium Mine**. When the Great War happened, the workers took refuge in the mines. This group of survivors is later transformed into a faction of **Survivalists**. The Survivalists are an imperialist, xenophobic, and totalitarian faction that captured outsiders in the region and used them as their slaves. 

There was also a shelter at **Athens High School**. At that time, there was an epidemic of blue flu in the city and the school was converted into a hospital. When the bombs fell, there were no doctors left in the city. Probably, they were evacuated, and the residents were left to die. Only the sick and a group of military remained at the school.

**Vance Family** took refuge in **Uncle Figs' Scrapyard**. As the years passed, they were eating ghouls, believing that it restores their health, and were engaged in incest for generations, reproducing themselves as the Peacock family in Sonora.

Although this place is not located on the west coast, but it is worth saying about it in the context of the history of *Fallout New California*. Even before the war, Enclave had its own **Bunker Bragg**, which is located in **Boise, Idaho**. A huge number of civilians were settled in the bunker, and were being raised as patriots of America and Enclave in particular. 

Considering that the fictional pre-war city of **Union** **City** was not damaged during the bombing, some of the people who later formed the **tribe** survived the war in it.

## History of the Cajon Pass Region: 2077-2242

## 2077

*October 23*. The overseer of the Vault 18, **Clarence Duvnic**, leaves the geardoors of the vault opened longer than they should have been, allowing the evacuation of the military personnel, who, according to the Vault Tec plan, had to be left outside.. 

*October 24.* The Vault Tec agents infiltrated in Vault 18 did not like Clarence's initiative, and they broke into his office, forcibly stuffing a cyanide capsule into his mouth. In their opinion, with the presence of the military, the experiment was compromised. When the military burst into the office, led by officer **Clint Dixon**, one of the agents tried to activate the self-destruction sequence of the vault, for which he received a bullet in the head. The rest were arrested and Dixon became an acting overseer.

People in Vault 14 die of dehydration, though they managed to cause irreparable damage to the mental state of the sole guy in other room. He was going to live a long and miserable life, full of madness, loneliness, but in any case, the vault is technically dying. 

On *November 9*, the military in the Athens High School decide to evacuate. They finish off sick dying patients and leave.

Fort Daggerpoint is also dying out for some unknown reason.

*November 25.* Residents of Vault 18 discover monitors, terminals, and cables. Clint Dixon was already aware of the experiment, and therefore, in order not to provoke other residents into depression, learning the miserable fate of other vaults, he ordered most of the cables to be cut and the terminals be blocked.

Quite early, a lower caste of people appears in the system of the hierarchy of Survivalists, who were sent down to the mines to grow food and extract ore. They consist of both deposed Survivalists and, in the future, captured wanderers in the wastelands. Over the years and generations, the underground inhabitants will become vulnerable to sunlight as Slags, and their skin and eyes will become pale. 

Somehow, Annai Oran, mutated under the influence of the parasite, gets to Enclave Poseidon station. The mechanism of the parasite was that it forced its host to mutate, turning them into a kind of non-killable super mutant. However, in this form, the carrier becomes a bloodthirsty and hungry monster that begins to hunt people and animals to eat them. The protein is used to grow a clone inside the carrier, which eventually brakes out, and the carrier returns to its human state. However, the clone is also immune to damage. In general, Annai, having apparently killed a bunch Enclave soldiers, begins to create her own clones. Thus, a female clone and a male clone are created. Enclave imprisons all three of them and begins to torture and psychologically break them for years in order to turn them into their super soldiers. 

## 2078

*January 4.* The residents of Vault 18 are going to make their first foray to the surface. After all the preparations, they come to the geardoors and find out that they cannot open them. Disappointed, they cancel the expedition.

## 2079

On *May 3*, Clint Dixon permanently shuts down the remaining active terminals. 

On *May 4*, the first democratic elections of the overseer were organized in Vault 18.

## 2089

Poseidon Station. 11 years have passed since the beginning of the torture of Annai's clones. The female clone somehow escapes from the station and claims the identity of Annai. However, the original and the male clone eventually break down and become submissive soldiers of Enclave. The original gets a new name **Chevy Bragg**, and her male clone gets a name **John Bragg**. They are sent to the Bragg Bunker, from the name of which they get their surnames.

## Around 2118

Sometime around of 2118 Union City is seized by Survivalists from Athens, who enslave the tribe living there.

## 2157

On *December 24*, on Christmas Eve, the geardoors of Vault 18 open, and an enthusiastic scout squad comes to the surface.

## 2158

*January 3.* A week and a half later, the only surviving scout returns to Vault 18. All the others were killed and robbed by the Survivalists in an ambush in the wastelands. After that, Vault 18 creates a special detachment called **Wasteland Scouts**, which was supposed to consist of outstanding residents of the vault who were able to stand up for themselves in the wastelands, conduct stealth reconnaissance missions and establish external contacts.

## 2162

After the Brotherhood of Steel destroyed Master, super mutant scientist **Mark** with another fragment of the Master's army went towards Cajon Pass and discovered Fort Daggerpoint, where he stopped. For Mark, who idolizes FEV as deity, Project Brazil with all its laboratory complexes, samples, experimental sites, and data was a paradise. He decided that he should continue the work of Master. He recreates the **Unity II**, and takes an equally pretentious name for himself – **the** **Father**. He immersed himself in the study of Project Brazil and resumed experiments. The super mutants continued to kidnap people in the wastelands and to replenish their army. The Father, just in case, had brought with him a DNA sample of Vault Dweller. He wanted to create his super mutant clone for some reason known only for him. 

## 2180

The Survivalists begin to trade with the mafia clans of Reno. In particular, they establish strong relationships with the Bishops.

## 2200

On the basis of the lower caste that lives in the mines of Athens, **the** **Voiceless** faction appears, after the Survivalists began to cut out their vocal cords for some reason.

## After 2200

Athens was attacked by a group of super mutants. It is not clear whether they are related to the Father's super mutants or just a random wandering group. Nevertheless, Athens fought back and even managed to capture some of the super mutants.

## 2201

*July 17.* There is earthquake in the region. The vaulters are concerned about the structural reliability of Vault 18, as well as its ability to accommodate such an inflated population. At that time, there were already more than 1,300 people in the vault, more than 1/3 than the vault’s designed capacity was. Moreover, they have been making scout missions for a long time and feel quite comfortable on the surface. Quite a large part of the inhabitants of the vault decides to leave it and create several colonies on the surface. But before making an exodus, a special training was conducted with people, after which the people, having got to the surface, had to forget where Vault 18 was located, and in general forget everything, having descended to the level of a primitive tribe. Periodically Wasteland Scouts were visiting them. The formed tribes were part of the so-called conglomerate of **Exodites**. One of the biggest problems of *Fallout New California* lies here. According to various in-game sources, there were either 6, or 7, or 8, or 9 tribes, and also they have different location indications. But we will omit the tedious discussion of the lore writing flaws and the process of finding the most logical lore interpretation. Thus, there were formed the tribes of **Ladl** in the San Gabriel Mountains, **Ares** at **Rice Airport**, **Trix** and **Polaris** in San Berdoo, **Ura** in the east of the Boneyard, **Orian** in the **Mountain Spring Cavern** to the north of Fort Daggerpoint, **Gemini** in **Hesperia**, **California Tribe** in the settlement of **Xiabula** on an abandoned golf course. At the same time, the California Tribe splits in two and the village of **Ooaxaca** is also founded. According to the reports of a group of students captured by the raiders, Ares tribe had a mutation that dyed their hair purple, as well as the tribes had different cultures of memorizing and storing information. So that Ares continued to forget everything at all and absolutely did not record any information, in Orian only elders stored information, some other tribe - on the contrary, systematized everything. However, stable genetic mutations, the development of social institutions and unique perception of the world develop within at best several generations, but not after 40 years, as the tribes were formed after the exodus from the Vault 18. I want to say that in the lore these tribes should have make an exodus long time before 2201.

On *August 21*, Vault 18 organizes scout mission No. 100.

## 2210

The ghouls gathered at the pre-war gas station and established **Odyssey** settlement.

## Before 2240

There is a settlement of **Angels Breakers**, which based their economy on trading, dismantling planes, cars, ships and all kinds of equipment, and selling it.

## 2240 

NCR enters the Cajon Pass region and, after a fierce battle, seizes Union City from the Survivalists, freeing and assimilating the captives from the local population there. Union City becomes a border base for NCR. Among the freed slaves was **William Silverman**, who by 2260 would become a general in NCR, leading the army in his native Union.

## After 2240

After the capture of Union City, NCR annexed Angels Breakers. 

Also, NCR and the Wasteland Scouts form an alliance. NCR promises not to touch Vault 18 during its expansion to the east, because it is useful to have at least some allies in the territory that is not yet controlled in any way.

## 2241

Before *May 21*, Wasteland Scouts create a small outpost of the **Black Bear Lodge** in the pre-war town of **Pinehaven**, which was located close to the Vault 18.

## Before 2242

Some time before 2242, **Kevin Rossman** leaves Vault 47 in Sahuarita. The experiment of Vault 47 was to educate the inhabitants in the Boy Scout culture, so the vaulters were actually trained to survive in a wasteland. Kevin Rossman settles into Vault 18, where he joins the Scouts using his skills and knowledge. With Rossman in the team, the Scouts traveled from Arizona to the Frontier and they got involved everywhere in various adventures and battles so that they became legendary characters in local folklore. NCR even began to print comics about their adventures over time.

For unknown reasons, one of the high–ranking elders and a descendant of Roger Maxson, Jeremy Maxson, is expelled from the Brotherhood of Steel, who, with a group of soldiers loyal to him, gets to the Survivors of Athens. He is accepted according to his high status, and he married **Queen Elsdragon**, becoming the leader of the faction. In marriage, they have a son, **Juan Maxson-Elsdragon**. Everyone in the region hated “**Boss Maxson**"" for his violence and the fuss he was creating in the region.

However, also before 2242, Wasteland Scouts eliminated Boss Maxson. Kevin Rossman blew up a section of Athens mines and buried the leader of Survivalists with fallen rocks. The management of the faction was inherited by Queen Elsdragon, and later by their son - Juan. Under the leadership of Juan, the Survivalists completely lost their composure and started raiding and slave trading with a greater fierce. They became a real threat to everyone in the region. Apparently, they had not been such cruel scoundrels before his reign even under Boss Maxson leadership. 

## 2242

*April 17*. Scouts report No. 189. The Father’s super mutants destroyed Orian tribe. All adults were abducted, and children under the age of four were left in the ruins of the settlement. Moreover, the Father added four babies artificially created in Fort Daggerpoint, **Star** siblings, among whom was the future protagonist of *Fallout New California*.

Somewhere at this time, the first tribe joins the Survivalists to form an alliance – **Psychonauts**. This tribe worshipped a giant spider, and they lived in symbiosis with a spider brood. They used their captives, firstly, as incubators for the babies of spiders - ""moon nymphs"", and secondly – as incubators for larvae of local botflies, with which the spiders were fed. They were milking cobwebs, from which they were making bandages in particular. Under the influence of the drugs they were making from spider venom, they were getting ferocious on battlefields, and the rest of the time, they were engaged in healing the alliance using the medicine produced from the same venoms. With the formation of the Raider Alliance, the name Survivalists becomes generalizing for the association as a whole, and therefore the true Survivalists now call themselves the **Old Guard**.

*June 21.* Vault 10 sends a message to Vault 18, confirming its active state. They are worried that the nuclear cola synthesizer machine has broken down and they are starting to lose weight.

*August 12*. Wasteland Scouts report No. 193. Rossman reports that they found other sixth and seventh tribes destroyed, and the abandoned children died of exhaustion. He also reports that all other Exodite tribes were eliminated earlier. So that the tribes of Ares, Gemini, Trix, Polaris, Ura and Ladl are gone.

After the destruction of Poseidon Station, Enclave is partially evacuated to Idaho, to the Bragg Bunker, and partially to the Navarro base. In particular, the Devil's Brigade and **Leonidas Squadron**, which included John and Chevy Bragg, evacuated to Navarro.

yll2z4,1,2022-11-03,UPVOTE AND I UPVOTE ALL YOUR POSTS,u/Negative_Echo_3068,ReferralCodesForU,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReferralCodesForU/comments/yll2z4/upvote_and_i_upvote_all_your_posts/,"Tons of companies are trying to expand their market share, especially in the app market, by offering cash or cash-equivalent incentives to new users. If one company offers new users a free stock/cryptocurrency/etc., and a competitor doesn't, then the company with the referral program will gain more market share. This gives you the opportunity generate a nice chunk of change by signing up for a bunch of different apps and collecting those bonuses, even if you just want to uninstall the app after!

ylxxkj,16,2022-11-04,"No game today, so let's remember a forgotten Yankee: Floyd ""Bill"" Bevens",u/sonofabutch,NYYankees,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYYankees/comments/ylxxkj/no_game_today_so_lets_remember_a_forgotten_yankee/,"On Wednesday, the Astros threw a no-hitter, the first in World Series history since 1956. Of course, the 1956 no-hitter was a little better -- it was a perfect game and it was thrown by one man, Don Larsen. But a combined no-hitter is, you know, all right I guess.  
   
But did you know that seventy-five years ago, another Yankee very nearly had a no-hitter -- only to lose it, and the shutout, and the game, all on one swing of the bat?  
   
[Floyd Bevens](https://thisdayinbaseball.com/wp-content/uploads/1945/08/99C9B7EA-ADCB-4858-AB89-F1A5F4E1333B.jpeg) got the nickname ""Bill"" early in his minor league career. While shagging flies in the outfield he lost a ball in the sun, and the ball bounced off the bill of his cap and right into his glove. Bevens joked that if the ball had been a little lower, his nickname would have been ""Nose.""   
      
Born in Hubbard, Oregon, on October 21, 1916, [Floyd Clifford Bevens](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/bevenbi01.shtml) was a 6'3"" right-hander who threw a fastball, curve, sinker, and change, and occasionally tinkered with a slider. Early in his career he had a blazing fastball, but arm trouble turned him into a sinkerballer. 
    
""Floyd is big enough to be a right good pitcher,"" *The Sporting News* reported on February 7, 1946. ""He has large hands and wrists; hairy, muscular forearms, and is built like one of those whopping big trees in his native Northwest. He weighs at least 210 pounds and stands six feet three and a half inches tall."" 
  
Floyd grew up on a dairy farm and credited milking cows before school with giving him strong wrists; in the summers he'd work in a cannery, picking up two cans in each hand to stack them on a conveyor belt. He was so strong he could lift a manhole cover with one hand.  
  
As a high school pitcher, Bevens was a phenom, once striking out 23 batters in a game; in semipro ball, he struck out about half the batters he faced. But like many hard throwers, also struggled with wildness. In a student-teacher game in high school, he beaned two faculty members!  
  
Joe Devine, the Yankee scout assigned to the Pacific Northwest, signed Bevens for a $500 bonus and sent him to the El Paso Texans in the Arizona-Texas League, where the 20-year-old would go 16-12 with a 3.05 ERA in 242 innings; the following year, with the Wenatchee Chiefs, he went 14-12 with a 3.65 ERA in 212 innings. In 1939, back with Wenatchee, he went 14-9 with a 4.01 in 211 innings. But he also struggled with injuries, including a ""dead arm,"" the mysterious bane of pitchers in those days before MRIs, that would plague him throughout his career.  
  
Between 1937 and 1944, Bevens pitched more than a thousand innings in the minors, racking up wins (and two no-hitters) but watching teammates getting promoted ahead of him. He was frustrated, hurting, and homesick, missing his wife and young son, and considered quitting. 
  
But in May 1944, with the Yankee rotation depleted by age, injuries, and World War 2, Bevens finally got the call. The 27-year-old had an unimpressive debut, entering in relief of veteran Bill ""Goober"" Zuber with two on and one out in the 7th inning of a game the Yankees were losing 6-2 to the Tigers. Bevens would give up a three-run home run to the first batter he faced, Jimmy Outlaw. That was followed by back-to-back singles. The next batter was pitcher Hal Newhouser, who bunted to advance the runners. Newhouser was thrown out, but a run then scored on an error to make it 10-2. Bevens would finally get the final out, then pitch two more innings, giving up three more hits but no more runs in a 10-4 loss. 
  
After the game, the Yankees sent Bevens back to their minor league team in Newark. Bevens called his wife and said he'd blown his chance. She told him if he kept winning games, he'd get another shot. She was right. Sandwiched around that one awful appearance in the majors, Bevens went 12-6 with a 2.96 ERA and 1.235 WHIP for the Bears, and was back in Yankee Stadium by the end of August. He was 4-1 with a 2.68 ERA and 1.305 WHIP in 43.2 innings, and by the end of the year was penciled into the rotation for 1945. He was a different kind of pitcher than he had been earlier in his career, as his arm troubles had forced him to become a pitcher rather than a thrower -- he allowed just 13 walks in 43.2 innings (2.7 BB/9), but also just 16 strikeouts (3.3 K/9). 
  
The following year, Bevens would go 13-9 with a 3.67 ERA and 1.315 WHIP in 184.0 innings. His best performance of the year came on [August 30](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYA/NYA194508300.shtml) against the Boston Red Sox; he retired the first 18 batters, finally giving up a walk to lead off the 7th inning to end the bid for a perfect game. He then got the next two outs, but Bob Johnson doubled to knock in a run to end the no-hitter and the shutout. But that would be the only hit of the game, and the Yankees would win it, 7-1.   
  
Bevens had gone 17-10 with a 3.48 ERA in 227.2 innings over his first two seasons but against admittedly diminished competition as the war had taken many stars off rosters. But in 1946, with teams back at full strength, he had a career year, going 16-13 with a 2.23 ERA (154 ERA+) and 1.166 WHIP in 249.2 IP. His record is even better than it appears, as nine of his 13 losses were by one run, including being on the losing end of a no-hitter on [April 30, 1946](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYA/NYA194604300.shtml) thrown by Cleveland's Bob Feller. That game was scoreless until the top of the 9th, when Indians catcher Frankie Hayes homered on a 3-2 pitch for the game's only run.   
  
Injuries had caught up to him again in 1947, and he went 7-13 with a 3.82 ERA (92 ERA+) in 165.0 innings, with 23 starts and five relief appearances. Despite his struggles, the Yankees easily won the A.L. pennant, finishing 12 games ahead of the second-place Detroit Tigers and 14 ahead of the Red Sox, and went to October for a classic against the Brooklyn Dodgers. 
  
Bevens had been passed on the depth chart by Frank ""Spec"" Shea and Allie Reynolds, who would start Games 1 and 2 of the World Series, and the Yankees won each game. Veteran Bobo Newsom, who had gone 7-5 with a 2.80 ERA after being acquired mid-season from the Senators, would start Game 3... and get bombed for five runs in the 2nd inning, turning it into a ""bullpen game"" with potential Game 4 starters Vic Raschi and Spud Chandler getting thrown into the mix. The Yankees would battle back but lose the game, 9-8. 
  
Yankee manager Bucky Harris finally turned to Bevens to start the critical [Game 4](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BRO/BRO194710030.shtml) on October 3, 1947 -- would New York take a 3 games to 1 lead, or would Brooklyn tie the series at two games each? 
  
The Yankees would get an early lead on a bases loaded walk to Joe DiMaggio in the top of the 1st inning, and score another in the 4th on a Johnny Lindell RBI double.  
  
As for Bevens, he kept pitching into and out of trouble, walking two batters but wriggling out of jams thanks to his sinkerball producing groundout after groundout. Finally all those walks -- and, ironically, ground balls -- would cost him in the 5th, when he walked the first two batters, then a bunt advanced them to second and third. The next batter hit a groundball to short that Rizzuto made a sensational play on, then threw out the runner heading from second to third, but the runner on third scored. 

With all these baserunners and the game so close, it wasn't until the 7th inning that Bucky Harris realized there was a no-hitter going -- ""when he heard the Dodgers on the bench reminding Floyd of his string, in an attempt to put the whammy on him,"" *The Sporting News* reported.  
  
Bevens would give up yet another walk in the 7th, then finally pitch a clean 8th inning. In the 9th, with the score still 2-1, he was three outs away from baseball immortality.  
  
The first batter, Bruce Edwards, flew out to the wall in left. The second, Carl Furillo, walked. That brought up Spider Jorgensen, who popped out to first baseman George McQuinn, who was ""white as a sheet"" as he made the catch. 
    
With two outs, the pitcher's spot was up. And Brooklyn Dodgers manager Burt Shotton then made one of the gutsiest calls in World Series history -- sending up Pete Reiser to try to do what Kirk Gibson would do 47 years later. 
  
Reiser was one of Brooklyn's best players, hitting .309/.415/.418 in 462 PA to lead the team in batting average and tie for the team lead in on-base percentage. He'd been particularly hot over the second half of the season, hitting .331/.421/.438. But he was on the bench in Game 4. During the previous game, Reiser slid into second base and badly sprained his ankle (or, according to some sources, broke it). He tried to take batting practice before Game 4, but found he couldn't put any weight on it. Reiser is one of the most fascinating ""what ifs"" in baseball history, a supremely talented player who just could not avoid injuries, and here he was hurt again. Seeing how badly he was limping, Shotton told him to take off his uniform and stay in the clubhouse -- he wasn't going to be playing in Game 4. 
  
Reiser did as he was told, at first. But wanting to be with his teammates, he put the uniform back on and limped to the dugout. For the first three innings, he sat on the bench and cheered on his teammates, hoping one would finally get a hit. 
  
But even just sitting there, his ankle was throbbing. Finally he went back into the clubhouse. He'd sit in the whirlpool bath for four innings, hoping the hot water would somehow help his ankle. 
  
In the 7th, he got up, put on his uniform again, and limped back to the bench. The Dodgers were still being no-hit by Bevens.  

As *The Sporting News* reported:  
  
&gt; At this second reappearance of Reiser -- the third time he had been in uniform that day -- Manager Shotton looked surprised and a trifle annoyed. 
  
&gt; ""What are you doing here?"" asked Shotton. ""You can't even stand on your feet.""
  
&gt; ""Maybe I can't,"" replied Reiser, quietly, ""but if you need me, I can give it one hell of a try.""
  
And now, with the pitcher's spot coming up and Bevens one out away from the first no-hitter in World Series history, Shotton had to send up a pinch hitter. 
   
&gt; ""All right, Pete,"" was all Burt said. 
   
Reiser summoned all the strength he could to hide his limp as he walked to the plate, not wanting to reveal just how limited he was. On a 2-1 pitch, Al Gionfriddo -- pinch running for Furillo -- stole second base. Yankee catcher Yogi Berra would have had him with a good throw, but it came in too high and shortstop Phil Rizzuto had to leave his feet to reel in it. (Years later, Rizzuto said he still got the tag down in time; Gionfriddo would insist ""Phil *almost* got me."") 
  
To make matters worse, the pitch was called a ball. 
  
Now it was a 3-1 count. Had the Yankees known Reiser couldn't put any weight on his right foot, they might have gone after him. After the game, Reiser admitted he wouldn't have been able to run if he'd put a ball in play.  
  
But with first base open, Bucky Harris told Bevens to throw the last pitch wide for an intentional walk!
  
That would put the winning run on base, which of course goes against one of the oldest commandments in baseball. But after the game, Harris told reporters he'd rather have Bevens face Eddie Stanky, who was due up next, than have to throw a 3-1 pitch to Reiser.  
  
Harris can be forgiven for thinking Stanky would face Bevens -- he'd only been pinch-hit for once all year. But Shotton went to his bench again, and summoned Cookie Lavagetto to hit for Stanky (and Ed Miksis to run for the hobbled Reiser). 
  
Bevens started off Lavagetto with a high outside fastball that he swung through. The next pitch was in the same spot -- in fact, catcher Yogi Berra said the second pitch was even farther out of the strike zone than the first one. Somehow Lavagetto reached out and smacked it the other way.  
  
""It was thrown right where I wanted to put it,"" Bevens said. ""But he just hit it, that's all.""  
  
Off the bat, Bevens thought he'd done it -- he thought it was a routine fly ball to right field for the final out of the game. But it just kept going.  
  
Just two weeks earlier, Lavagetto's wife had delivered a baby in California, and Cookie hadn't yet been able to travel across the country to see his son yet. Infused with Dad strength, Cookie hit a ball that sailed over the head of right fielder Tommy Henrich! 
  
Heinrich raced back but the ball went over his outstretched glove and bounced off the wall. He played the carom and fired toward home. Gionfriddo, on second, had already scored the tying run, but Henrich thought he could throw out Miksis at the plate as he tried to score from first, which would at least keep the game tied. First baseman George McQuinn took the cutoff and turned to throw home, but saw Miksis was already beginning his slide across home plate.  
  
After eight and two-thirds nail-biting innings, it was all over. It didn't seem possible. Bevens had left the mound to back up Berra at home plate, and after Miksis scored, Bevens started walking to the mound. Halfway there, he realized the game was over. Tears streaming down his face, he walked to the dugout as the Dodgers players and fans poured onto the field. 
  
Even home plate umpire Larry Goetz didn't realize the game had ended. After Miksis slid home, Goetz pulled out his whisk broom and dusted off the plate -- looking up in surprise to see the dejected Yankees walking off the field and the jubilant Dodgers pouring out of the dugout to mob Lavagetto at second base. 
  
&gt; ""Friends, they're killing Lavagetto, his own teammates. They are beating him to pieces. And it's taken a police escort to get Lavagetto away from the Dodgers."" -- Red Barber  
  
As Bevens left the field, bewildered and heartbroken, [the Dodgers Sym-Phony Band](http://historicgreenpoint.blogspot.com/2014/04/the-dodger-sym-phony-band.html) added to his misery by playing an old song called ""Heartaches"". 
  
Bevens said he cried as he walked off the field not because he'd lost the no-hitter but because he'd let down his teammates by losing the game to tie the World Series at two games apiece.  
  
He said his always troublesome arm gave out at some point in Game 4 -- the next day, he couldn't even lift it. On the night before Game 7, Floyd's wife, Mildred, stayed up all night massaging his arm and that put enough life back into it for him to pronounce himself ready to pitch.  
  
Harris said Shea would start the game, but if he ran into trouble, Bevens would be the first man out of the bullpen. Sure enough, Shea was lifted with one out in the 2nd inning with two on and one run already in, and Harris called on Bevens. He'd give up a double to Spider Jorgensen, the run getting charged to Shea, but wouldn't allow another run over the next 2.2 innings before being pulled in the bottom of the 4th for pinch hitter Bobby Brown, who delivered a two-out double to tie the game at 2-2. Joe Page would then finish the game with five scoreless innings and the Yankees would win it, 5-2.  
  
The World Series would be Bill's last big league appearance. In addition to his arm injury, he'd show up at spring training 30 pounds overweight after spending the off-season on the ""dinner circuit."" The Yankees sold his contract to the White Sox, who returned him at the end of spring training. The Yankees then released him. He'd later resurface in the minors, pitching four more seasons. Despite an impressive 20-12 record with a 3.08 ERA in 263 innings with the Salem Senators in the Western International League in 1951, he'd never got another shot in the bigs and retired in 1953, a few weeks shy of his 37th birthday.  
  
After baseball, Bevens moved back to Oregon and would become the manager of a trucking company. He died five days after his 75th birthday, on October 26, 1991, from lymphoma. He was survived by his wife of more than 50 years, Mildred, as well as three sons, eight grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren. 
  
Bevens bits:  
  
* Bevens's eight and two-thirds no-hit innings was the World Series record for longest no-hit bid until Don Larsen threw the perfect game in 1956 against these same Dodgers. The previous longest no-hit bid in World Series history also was set by a Yankee, Red Ruffing, in 1942, who pitched seven and two-thirds no-hit innings against the Cardinals in 1942. And before that, the record was seven and one-third innings, set by yet another Yankee, Herb Pennock, against the Pirates in 1927.     
  
* Had Bevens's near no-hitter happened in Game 7, he'd be remembered alongside Ralph Branca and Billy Buckner as one of the most tragic players in baseball history. To be one out away, only to lose it all -- the no-hitter, the game, the World Series -- on a single swing of the bat would be baseball's version of a Shakespearean tragedy. But luckily for Bevens, it happened in Game 4... in a series the Yankees would win. And Bevens's record of the longest no-hit bid in World Series history would become a footnote nine years later with Larsen's perfect game.  
  
* Some blamed Bevens for the loss -- including Bill himself, who said he didn't deserve to win after walking 10 batters. Others blamed Harris, saying the Yankee manager violated a cardinal rule of baseball by walking Reiser to put the winning run on base. Or Heinrich, saying he could have caught Lavagetto's ball (he had made a sensational catch an inning earlier), or at least made a stronger throw to keep Miksis from scoring from first base. But in the aftermath of the game, it was Yankees third base coach Chuck Dressen who stepped forward and said it was all on him. In the third inning, with two out, Joe DiMaggio was on first base and George McQuinn was the batter. McQuinn hit a tapper in front of home plate that catcher Bruce Edwards threw into right field. DiMaggio, running on the play, hustled into third before the ball was picked up by Dixie Walker... and Dressen waved DiMaggio home. The Yankee Clipper was easily thrown out at home plate. Had he held up, it would have been runners on the corners and two out for Billy Johnson -- who, his next time at bat, would triple. If you believe in the fallacy of the pre-determined outcome, as Michael Kay likes to say, it would have been 4-1 in the 9th inning instead of 2-1.  
  
* Yogi Berra, who caught both Bevens's game in 1947 and Larsen's in 1956, would say as the perfect game was unfolding, he just wanted to win the game -- just as the Yankees had been up just 2-1 during Bevens's game, Larsen's game was 2-0. After Larsen's perfecto, a reporter called Bevens, who had been watching the World Series from his home in Oregon. No sour grapes from Bevens, who was delighted with the outcome. ""Larsen pitched a lot better game than I did,"" he said. 
    
* Game 5, played the day after Bevens's loss, had an eerily similar ending. The Yankees were up 2-1 in the bottom of the 9th with the tying run on 2nd and the winning run at the plate -- in the form of pinch hitter Cookie Lavagetto! But Yankee pitcher Frank ""Specs"" Shea struck out Lavagetto end the game. Shea then gave the ball to Bill. ""I had to strike out Lavagetto for Bevens,"" Shea said.  
  
* In fact, the hit to end Game 4 would be the last in Lavagetto's career; he'd pinch hit in Games 5, 6, and 7, going 0-for-4 with a strikeout and an RBI, then play the next three seasons in the minors and retire.  
    
* Shotton had made three tough calls in the 9th inning: having Al Gionfriddo pinch-run for Carl Furillo and then steal second; sending up Pete Reiser to pinch-hit for the pitcher's spot; and then Cookie Lavagetto to pinch-hit for Eddie Stanky. All three were debatable moves that absolutely would have been second-guessed had they not worked out -- Berra's throw nearly had Gionfriddo for the third out, Reiser with his bad ankle said he'd have been unable to run, and Stanky had only been pinch-hit for once all year. But all three moves worked out perfectly for the Dodgers. Ironically, the only reason Shotton was managing at all was because Dodgers manager Leo Durocher had been suspended for the entire 1947 season due to his gambling problem. If Durocher was at the helm for Game 4, would he have made all the right moves?  
  
* Even though it was a loss, it was still a one-hitter, just the third in World Series history. Ed Reulbach did it in 1906 and Claude Passeau in 1945, both on the Cubs. There's only been one other World Series one-hitter since, thrown by Jim Lonborg of the Red Sox in 1967. Bevens's one-hitter is the only loss of the four.  
  
* Sportswriter Red Smith said Bevens threw 137 pitches -- 69 strikes and 68 balls. He allowed one hit and 10 walks (and one wild pitch) while striking out five batters. The walks set a World Series record, the previous mark held by Jack Coombs of the Philadelphia Athletics with nine in 1910. It's still the record today. 
  
* ""Bill Bevens, in the most strangely beautiful performance ever seen in a World Series, broke three records only to have Lavagetto break his heart,"" sporstwriter Rud Rennie wrote. The three records were longest no-hit bid in World Series history (broken in 1956), the first one-hit loss in World Series history (still standing), and most walks in World Series history (also still standing).  
  
* The 1947 World Series also was the first integrated World Series (Jackie Robinson had made his debut on the Dodgers that year); the first pinch-hit home run in World Series history (Yogi Berra off Ralph Branca in Game 3); the first World Series to be televised, with an estimated viewing audience of 3.9 million; the first World Series to be watched live in the White House, by President Harry Truman, who would make the first Oval Office TV appearance on the same day as Game 6; the first World Series with umpires along the outfield lines to call fair or foul balls; and, surprisingly, the first and to date only World Series in which the Yankees won Game 7 at Yankee Stadium!  
  
* Bevens wore three numbers with the Yankees, two of which have been retired. During his first game in 1944, he wore \#29 -- just the fifth player in franchise history to wear that number, and later worn by 1950s backup catcher Charlie Silvera as well as Catfish Hunter (1975-1979), Jesse Barfield (1989-1992), Gerald Williams (1994-1996), Mike Stanton (1997-2005), Francisco Cervelli (2009-2014), Gio Urshela (2019-2021), and for his three games as a Yankee, Ronald ""Duck"" Guzman (2022). When he came back up in '44, and the rest of the following season, Bevens wore \#21, most famously worn by (and retired for) Paul O'Neill. But other \#21s in Yankee history include Scott Sanderson, Kevin Maas, Ken Phelps, and Jack Clark. For his final two seasons, he wore \#16 -- in fact, the last player to wear it before Whitey Ford, who it is now retired for. Before Bevens, \#16 was worn by several pitchers, including Hall of Famer Herb Pennock. 
  
* In the book *Electric October* by Kevin Cook, Bevens recalled the time as a high school basketball player that he'd ran out onto the court before a big game in his warm-up sweat suit. He dramatically yanked off the sweats only to realize once his pants were down that he'd forgotten to put on his uniform underneath! 
  
* Hit-by-pitch data isn't available for most of Bevens's minor league career, but he was notorious for hitting batters. In high school and semipro ball, Bevens was afraid his fastball might kill someone, and he got in the habit of yelling ""look out!"" if he let one slip. In the minors, a manager told him to stop doing that. ""Keep the fear of God in 'em,"" the manager said. Bevens said he came to understand that his wildness could actually be an asset, as batters never could get too comfortable in the box when he was on the mound. He told sportswriter Kevin Cook that he adopted the attitude that it wasn't his job to warn them to duck; it was their job to get out of the way.  
  
* Another story from *Electric October*: During Spring Training in 1945, veterans Frankie Crosetti and Snuffy Stirnweiss played a prank on Bevens where they invited him on a midnight ""snipe hunt."" The idea was they'd go out into the middle of the woods and split up; at dawn, whoever had caught the most snipes would be the winner. Of course, there's no such thing as a snipe. Each man fanned out into the woods, but the veterans looped back to the start to giggle as they imagined the rookie wandering around in the dark. But ""Bev"" had heard of this gag before, and while the veterans were waiting for him to re-emerge from the woods, he was back in his hotel room asleep!  
  
* After throwing a one-hitter against the Red Sox in 1945, Bevens was offered $150 to appear in an ad for Wheaties, ""providing you actually eat and enjoy Wheaties."" Bevens took the deal and, presumably, ate his Wheaties.  
  
* Once while in a tight spot in a big game, Bevens looked over his back shoulder to check the runner on second and saw second baseman Snuffy Stirnweiss moving his lips. Bevens couldn't make out what he was saying but was inspired by what he thought were words of encouragement from the veteran, and proceeded to get out of the jam. Only then did Bevens realize what Stirnweiss was doing. ""You were praying, you son of a bitch,"" he said to Snuffy as they jogged off the field. ""Yeah,"" Snuffy replied, ""and it worked!""  
  
Bill's son said for years afterward, people would come up to him and ask him about his almost no-hitter, but Bill was never bitter about how close he'd come. Instead he focused on the fact that the Yankees won the Series that year, with Bevens playing a key role in Game 7.  
  
Asked by a reporter how it felt to have been ""one out away from glory,"" Bevens replied: ""I figure I was lucky to be up there in the first place."""

**Shez and Edelgard’s Relationship**

Shez and Edelgard share such a fascinating relationship that I honestly can’t help but adore it. This isn’t like with Byleth where Edelgard feels like Shez is someone above her that she can confide in for some inexplicable reason. Instead, Shez is a mercenary with great talent that Edelgard actually managed to befriend. 

However, I’ll say this. I was a bit weirded out that Edelgard, and Hubert especially, seemed to trust Shez enough to give them a position in a private military unit in the army. Like, why would Edelgard and Hubert, two who had a really strong hateful connection with TWSITD, would trust someone that clearly displayed powers that were nigh-identical to them? It felt weird if anything. Neither of them should have trusted Shez. I was probably trying to rationalize it, thinking that maybe Shez fighting against them was enough, or that the two-year time skip had them observed and they were certain then. But I did have issues still because I felt that Edelgard was giving too much trust to the player avatar again. 

Only for Chapter 9 to hit and put all my issues to ease. 

As it turns out, neither of them trusted Shez at all. Well, they wanted to, or at least Edelgard did, but in the end, the entire military unit that Shez was given command of was essentially a means for Hubert to keep Shez monitored almost constantly. They definitely believed that Shez was a mole planted by TWSITD, and Hubert even gave such a good explanation that I was so thankful for it. 

This makes Edelgard the only lord in 3Hopes that harbored doubts and suspicion toward Shez for their connection with TWSITD. Which makes sense as they would have the most reason to suspect. 

Furthermore, this revelation also opened up a moment I genuinely like. Shez actually being hurt and upset that they didn’t trust them. Sure, Shez can be understanding, but it doesn’t change that it hurt, because Shez genuinely grew to care about and want to help Edelgard and her cause. In both the story and their supports, Shez makes it clear that for a long time, Shez lived as nothing but a simple mercenary with really nothing beyond making some coin with nobles, never understanding or attempting to understand if there was ever more to life. Then Edelgard came and opened up a whole new world and Shez began to understand the weight of responsibilities and also be recognized by other people. 

So to learn that the one that did all that for them didn’t trust them has got to sting. So Shez asks Edelgard and Hubert to trust them, or at least make it clear they don’t so they know where they stand. 

And I absolutely loved how Edelgard clearly looked and was ashamed of herself when she apologized to Shez. 

This is what I wanted. 

And their support conversations are just so good. The B support was honestly beautiful as Shez remarked how Edelgard did prove that the world can be changed because Edelgard changed *their* world. This then goes to their A support when Edelgard also expresses how it was all thanks to Shez that she was able to free herself from TWSITD, calling Shez the missing cog in the turnwheel (Echoes reference?). It evolved from a one-sided gratitude to now a mutual form of gratitude. 

Even when Epimenides took control of Shez and attacked Byleth, while Hubert’s suspicion was now met, and by all means, they should kill Shez, Edelgard admits that she wants to avoid it, even admitting that she might be getting soft. And after the fiasco, Edelgard made it clear that Shez had earned her trust, and at the end of the final battle, it was a lovely scene of watching them finally share a high-five, coming full circle from how their previous battle with Thales had been. 

That final letter from Edelgard, thanking Shez for everything and remarking that she can’t imagine an empire without Shez was really sweet. 

At the end of my playthrough of all the routes, I felt that Shez had the best relationship with Edelgard out of the three lords because I could feel that both Shez and Edelgard grew and developed from their shared bond.

**Edelgard’s Growth**

This might seem weird coming from an Edelgard fan like myself, but I have had criticisms toward Edelgard and how she was in 3H. Yes, to this day, I still support her, her route, and the world she would create, and believe CF is the best ending for Fodlan in 3H. Yet that doesn’t mean that I will not hold criticisms toward how I feel her character was handled over the course, and how 3Hopes has actually managed to fix several of the issues for me. 

One of the issues I had with how Crimson Flower was structured was how it really seemed to struggle with expressing any kind of growth in Edelgard. Sure, they try to express that Edelgard was closer to the Black Eagles and learned to rely on them more, but that was only off-screen or supports. It didn’t feel to be as natural or a sign of growth per se. 

A particularly infamous moment in Crimson Flower was the lie Edelgard told about Arianrhod. Yes, she had a legitimate reason to not tell the truth. The army’s morale would be shot and there’d be serious problems for them as a result, which they did not need when victory over the Kingdom and Church was just around the corner. My issue, however, was that this lie was told to even her own friends. It was just not cool that she kept it from them. Even if this was a thing with wanting to keep information on a down low so that there isn’t a leak, it still feels wrong when the story tries to prop the idea that Edelgard is much closer to them. I know that she could later reveal the truth to them when they finally take on TWSITD, but we never see that on screen. 

3Hopes addresses a lot of these moments by having Edelgard not only reveal to her friends early on the existence of TWSITD but later also admit to Shez that she lied to them about their position after the Prologue. It was good to see Shez call them out and Edelgard feel bad because it really shows Edelgard going a step in the right direction. Not only that, but Edelgard even apologizes to her friends when her plans went awry during Part 1. Throughout the story, she began to realize that things weren’t going to go her way despite how she felt so confident. She couldn’t realize just how much of a struggle she was going to go through until the time came. 

With Claude’s trap with Leopold, Dimitri making his way to get to Count Rowe, and even the Central Church attempting to assassinate Edelgard, it became very clear that Edelgard that she was arrogant to think that she was going to have it go easy. It’s due to this reason that Edelgard felt like she was not only letting herself down but also her friends and felt herself to be lacking as a result. Being able to admit this was a good step for her. She is brilliant, but she’s not infallible, and she’s far more willing to admit her shortcomings here. 

This culminates in Part 2’s beginning when Edelgard approaches Claude and wishes to form a pact with him. Understanding that she’s just not as strong as she likes to think herself to be, and no longer has TWSITD breathing down her neck, she’s actually shown something that she never got to show in 3H, even in Crimson Flower. Edelgard is willing to form a pact with Claude and focus on a joint front against the Kingdom and Central Church, while also showing that Edelgard really is more than willing to allow a nation to be independent so long as they aren’t actually against her. This works so well with how 3H made it clear that Claude and Edelgard very much share a similar ideal. 

Something that was mentioned about Edelgard’s relationship with Byleth in 3H and Shez in 3Hopes. If Byleth represented Edelgard’s relationship with the Nabateans, then Shez represented Edelgard’s relationship with TWSITD. Despite how Edelgard hates TWSITD and for that reason mistrusted Shez, even after learning that Shez is not the same as them. Edelgard admitted to Hubert that even though they want to trust Shez unconditionally, some doubt remains, even showing a moment of emotional vulnerability when she expressed that people are never the same when they get involved with TWSITD. 

This was a good reminder that Edelgard is a **deeply traumatized** girl. Simply because her trauma isn’t as on display as Dimitri’s generally is, or even talked about, Edelgard is just as traumatized and haunted by her past as Dimitri is. Even though in her head, she knows that Shez is someone deserving of her trust, that trauma will always haunt her and make her feel a grip of fear and insecurity that Shez can turn around and backstab her, just like Arundel and Ludwig had. 

Edelgard can’t handle betrayal well. Her beloved uncle got replaced by Thales. And Ludwig ended up just betraying her for power, not even needing to be replaced. It’s why Edelgard struggles to trust. So when Edelgard learned to trust Shez, and even Claude when she made that pact. So I feel for Edelgard when she expressed a kind of anger toward Claude when he betrayed her in the non-recruit Byleth run. She went out of her way to try and put her trust in Claude, and he backstabbed her. Her conversation with Claude in Zahras makes it clear that she genuinely hoped that their relationship could grow into one of genuine trust and companionship. So if Claude betrays her, it hurts. So it’s no wonder Edelgard goes all-out war with the Alliance after the end of SB if that happens. 

Back to Shez again, the best moment is once more the high-five, which is great because it also represents how Edelgard has learned to loosen up a bit more, doing something as simple as giving a high five to someone. It’s also great because it ties spectacularly with the ending of the Prologue, where Edelgard didn’t even know how to give a high five.

**Criticism**

Yeah, as much as I like Edelgard, her route is not without criticism. 

Let’s get this particular one out of the way. 

I don’t like Monica. There’s simp, and then there’s Monica. For someone that came to life after being killed and possessed by Kronya, the idea that Monica’s one and only personality is that she’s an Edelgard simp is just ridiculous. Honestly, when Edelgard admitted to Monica in their support that she would have allowed Monica to be killed by TWSITD, I had hoped that Monica would have been genuinely upset at that and would have taken a stance to still support Edelgard, but will ensure that Edelgard never considers making such a sacrifice again. But no, Monica just doubles down on being a simp. 

Okay, now that’s done. 

The second comes with this. Despite how the premise implied that Edelgard was going to be taking on TWSITD as she fights her war, TWSITD made way too few appearances. TWSITD never appeared during Part 1, and in Pat 2, they only made their move when Edelgard was about ready to conquer the rest of the Kingdom. The implication is that TWSITD didn’t want the war to end just like that (is that why the war lasted for 5 whole years in 3H?), but it really didn’t do that much in the grand scheme of things. Honestly, I half expected TWSITD to originally somehow coerce Dimitri into accepting their aid or getting more involved, but nothing like that happened. It was rather sad, and as much as I enjoyed the finale of SB, I think it would have been better if we had more conflict with TWSITD. 

It honestly would have been better if the story had delved into Edelgard’s friends learning more and more about her backstory with TWSITD and the torture she suffered. Not just from the torture itself, but how she had to spend several years waiting for her chance to start the war and just get everything back in order. Let her friends learn more about her and strengthen their ties so that Edelgard is able to feel like she has formed a new family.

And finally, the last issue I really had problems with. The idea was that SB had to be the story that had split paths depending on recruiting Byleth or not. Why would Claude even remotely be swayed so easily that he’d defect from his pact with Edelgard and declare war on the entire continent? 

Listen, no matter how ruthless we’re to expect Claude to be, roughly half the Alliance was already claimed by Edelgard. I could accept Claude to be able to pull off a stunt like this in GW with the Federation, but not as a mere Alliance leader. Claude might be showing that he’s very gutsy and that he’s actually as ruthless as he claimed he was to Hilda, but it just feels like a gambit with more chances to fail than to succeed. Especially when Claude can have both of his tactics outwitted by Hubert. Hell, Claude and Hilda can very much die, and as a result, Edelgard declares full-on war with the Alliance at the end. 

It just felt like a poor writing aspect for what was a rather compelling story. 

One bonus criticism I have is that I have mixed feelings over how Scarlet Blaze is the ONLY route where other house students die in the story itself. Like, if you pick the other routes, you can recruit or cleverly go a route to spare the students of the other routes, but in SB, Ingrid and Sylvain die. It hurts, but why does only Scarlet Blaze have to be like that? Why couldn’t they have been able to conveniently retreat like the other routes managed to? I just felt it to be rather disingenuous. 

---

And that about does it. This is my final thoughts on Scarlet Blaze. Overall, it is undeniably one of my favorite routes of the three, had a rather solid story from start to end, and honestly was nice to see a story where Edelgard can fight a war that is unmarred by TWSITD. I think Crimson Flower would have been far better if that was how it was written to begin with. 

I hope you all enjoyed the read. I’m really sorry that it took so long to finish this. Writing this stuff, and organizing my thoughts was a lot harder than I thought. 

I don’t know if I intend to tackle Azure Gleam and Golden Wildfire the same way, but I do have full intentions to give my review on those routes. 

The next route will be my 2nd route, Azure Gleam."
ytt9w6,2,2022-11-13,Revamping the Recruitment System Part 1,u/lasereigun,FireEmblemThreeHouses,https://www.reddit.com/r/FireEmblemThreeHouses/comments/ytt9w6/revamping_the_recruitment_system_part_1/,"I have no knowledge on how to make video game mechanics happen, so apologies if the ideas I present in this post seem very complex or unfeasible. What I care most about in a game is always the story and characters, and 3H is unsatisfying in this department wrt the recruitment system. There are a number of issues I could point out, but this mostly started due to Petra. I started the game on Claude's route, recruited her, paired with Claude, and I was happy with the result. Petra was also fine on Edelgard's route. But thinking about her during my AM run was painful, because I saw her special battle dialogue with Shamir and it really bothered me. I didn't want to recruit her on that run, because I don't see a reason for Petra to side with Dimitri in 3H. If only Petra was able to defect to the Alliance without Byleth's involvement...

Because of this, I started thinking of a more complex recruitment system that would make the students feel more realistic and give the player the sense that they aren't following Byleth, even if the dialogue doesn't change.

Despite opening this post with my Petra woes, the foundation of these changes involve the other two professors, Manuela and Hanneman. It does not make sense for them to be recruitable during the school year. Don't they have their own class to teach? Because of this, I propose that they should only be playable as Mission Assistance units before the timeskip. To accommodate recruitment, the player will be able to ask one professor and one of their students for Mission Assistance each month by talking to the professor. During chapter 6, Manuela will be unavailable, but the player can still ask Hanneman for help along with any student from her house.

Additionally, since the professor realistically has to take care of their own class, they will only be playable during skirmishes, or paralogues if the focus character has a support with them (For example, Hanneman or Manuela will be playable during the Dorothea paralogue, depending on who you ask for the month). During such missions, the player will have one more deployment spot. But for main missions, you will only have the student of choice playable and no additional deployment spots.

Hanneman and Manuela will join your army post timeskip if they achieved a B support with Byleth during the school year. I don't think this is an issue in Manuela's case, because her support growth with Byleth seems fast enough to make up for being unavailable during Chapter 6. Since getting a Bishop and a Warlock post timeskip seems pretty crappy, both of them will have access to two additional class lines. I am not sure what these should be, so if anyone has suggestions they want to post in the comments that would be great.

The only exception is that I want to give Manuela access to Dancer, because I think it fits her in terms of the story and gameplay. You won't be able to deploy more than one dancer on the map, but it could be a good option if you didn't get a dancer or yours died pre timeskip on an Ironman run or something.

Additionally, Manuela and Hanneman will have a small support growth with the students in their class that progresses regularly, with the exception of students they can support. Those students get a slightly higher support growth with their teachers. It doesn't make sense that characters in the story aren't supporting just because Byleth isn't there to make it happen.

Furthermore, it doesn't make sense for some students to join Byleth's class when their current professor has greater connections with them. So these small support growths will have effects on recruitment. For example, Lysithea has a support with Hanneman, and it makes sense that she would be interested in studying under a Crest researcher, even if she feels that he's pushy. So when Hanneman is the GD professor, recruiting Lysithea will be increasingly difficult, excluding other factors. But if Byleth achieves a B support with Hanneman, this barrier will mostly disappear and recruiting Lysithea will be easier.

But be warned: If you don't tutor Lysithea enough in her areas of focus, she could return to Hanneman's class (this would just be the skills you choose for Lysithea to focus on and the requirement would be pretty reasonable, like 5 sessions per skill).

I don't plan on actually implementing this system in the game, but questions or suggestions for improvement in the comments are welcome. If there is interest I will continue posting about my ideas and expand upon other aspects like the support system requirements."

Takeaway: Longs behind the SharkLine can work explosively, just as shorts do from the other side....AS LONG AS WE ARE DITHERING ABOUT THE SELACHIMORPHA LINE. (Yes, surfers know the word ""shark"" in 729 languages, even dead ole'latin haha.)

*Remember: the DCI30 is not weighted to large cap, it is 30 coins, all of equal weight. So FTT (now at ""zero"", second in $lashCrash only to LUNA at -98%), moves the index the same amount that BTC does, (financial democracy that, haha). Some ALTS are moving about huge here, check the coins attached to SBFwoes and you'll see that in FTT (if you can find it), SOL, SRM, et etc.*

**=============&gt; THIS IS WHERE YOU BUY LONG IN THE SHARKLINE PROCESS:**

**A NOTE ABOUT LADDER TRADING:**

**I will be producing a DDT Ladder Lesson as soon as I can get to it. Ladder Trading is THE way to trade markets that do not trend hard in one direction. They are also well suited for those who can only check screens periodically, (ie: peeps with day jobs outside this hectic henhou$e). :)**

**I train students in ladder trading as it is an excellent way to introduce them to the world of DDT TA Trading.**

""*Goldman sums it up well: ""The pace of risk-unwinds has picked up in the past 2 sessions (Fri/Mon). In cumulative notional terms, the de-grossing in US equities on Fri and Mon was the largest over any 2-day period since late March and ranks in the 99th percentile vs. the past five years, driven by short covers and to a lesser extent long sales (1.4 to 1).""*

yx75o9,1,2022-11-16,Degree Apprenticeship vs University,u/Freemxn62,UniUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/yx75o9/degree_apprenticeship_vs_university/,"I am a student who has taken a gap year in the hopes of finding a little more direction in what I want to do in life. Firstly, I have completed my A-levels and secured a spot at the University of Liverpool on a foundation year in engineering (I did not do Maths A level) which i then would follow on from into an engineering discipline. This was going to be Aerospace but when the time to go to uni arrived I got cold feet and wondered whether there were better options available to me. Although i know i shouldn’t be, i feel very motivated by salaries as I have a deep passion for Cars and would love to be able to own something impressive in the future (along with the financial freedom of course).  Currently, I see a few options for myself. I could wait it out and attend university next year onto my desired course (i could even go to software engineering if that would benefit me more), or I could try my luck at applying to a Digital and Technology solutions apprenticeship near me at a company called CapGemini, where i would gain a degree in Digital and Technology solutions from Aston University. Or, i could go to BAE systems for an aerospace engineering apprenticeship that awards a Beng in Aerospace Engineering and 2 diplomas. Obviously with both apprenticeships i would have the benefit of free tuition, and experience leading into a job at the corresponding company at the end of the apprenticeship. I would have to move away for Liverpool and the BAE systems routes, so that’s another consideration. I want to make the right choice for my life and not feel like later down the line i could’ve made a better decision by either following into a software role or an aerospace one. I feel consumed by researching “average salaries” for everything i consider and i wonder what the benefit of the “traditional” route would give me. I should also probably note that while i do not know how to code now, id be willing to learn if the compensation of becoming a software engineer is good enough. Also, is there any real world difference between the uni you attend? Is there ANY reason for me to go to Liverpool?
I honestly appreciate any wisdom anybody has for me, even if that’s telling me to get my head out of the clouds. 

TLDR - I’ve got my life ahead of me and the idea of regretting doing one thing or another is consuming me into not doing anything at all. I’ve always been a “science” type of person and i’m just desperate to make the most out of my life."

**9 PM - 2 AM |** [**Mz Worthy**](https://fb.me/e/2BKmbl7nS) | Effex, 420 Central Ave | One of the Original Dirtybird artists Mz. Worthy returns to Albuquerque after 3 years to make her Effex Rooftop &amp; We House Fridays debut. Support By: BadCat + Femme.Antics. 21+ with Valid ID. Cover Charge at Door. No one knows how to push the boundaries of House music quite like Mz Worthy. With a deeply intuitive understanding of production, she’s shown reverence to the traditional form of classic House even while tripping off the mark &amp; sinking into euphoric, less-charted territories of booty-clapping bass. Attaching “Mz” to her name, Mz Worthy marks the new era of her career. With a new relationship to DJing, she connects with her music and her audience like never before. Despite over two decades in the scene, she continuously felt disconnected from the world and her fans. After years of repressing feelings of gender dysphoria, Mz Worthy came out as transgender in 2020. Describing the discovery as pieces of a puzzle coming together, Mz Worthy has invited her fans to join her on her journey in finding herself. Mz Worthy is no stranger to the world of electronic music. She released her breakout track “Irst Te” off Dirtybird records back in 2007, followed up by bangers like “Shy Look” (2012), “Tric Trac” with Eats Everything (2011) and “Dip” (2013). Worthy once again proved her notoriety as a producer with her 2014 debut album, Disbehave. The critically acclaimed album defies genres and pushes the boundaries of the traditional House sound. A veteran to some of the largest music festivals out there, Mz Worthy has the insight to play for her audience every time, cultivating intense positive energy and an energetic dance floor camaraderie. She invites her audience to embrace their true selves, just as she is.

**10:30 PM |** [**AMERICAN MOVIE - the 1999 cult indie doc gem in honor of the late great Mike Schank!**](https://fb.me/e/27Z2XHSbd) | The Guild Cinema, 3405 Central Ave NE | Check out the trailer at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFZOu8rDUQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFZOu8rDUQ) Dir. Chris Smith - 1999 - 107 - ALL SEATS $8. The hit of the 1999 Sundance Film Festival, this great doc that's become a cult fave over the years is the hilarious and intense story of one man's obsession to make movies. Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, is a long way from Hollywood, but Mark Borchardt has a dream. Armed with a driving ambition and nothing to lose, the fast-talking Borchardt enlists friends, local thespians and unwilling family members to help him finish his no-budget horror film, COVEN. The camera doesn't flinch as it captures every emotional crisis and financial pitfall in his two-year odyssey. What emerges is a bizarre, yet surprisingly heartfelt, documentary portrait of a true American character. Welcome to the ""Real World.""

**10 AM |** [**Songs &amp; Stories from the Albuquerque Public Schools Native American Performing Arts Program**](https://fb.me/e/2WTlhDWw4) | National Hispanic Cultural Center, 1701 4th St. SW | AMP is pleased to partner with Instituto Cervantes and the National Hispanic Cultural Center to present the second edition of the Oralidad Festival. Oralidad is born with two essential purposes: to promote the oral tradition of storytelling and to establish a collaboration between artists from New Mexico, Spain, Latin America and the rest of the United States to create new works together and contribute to the improvement of storytelling. The oral tradition of storytelling is a powerful language throughout the world, and is deeply rooted in Spanish culture. These oral traditions have permeated Latin American and Hispanic culture, from flamenco palos to the Vaqueiros de Alzada and the tradition of the juglares (minstrelsy), as well as having a broad impact on Latin American literature. New Mexico is an especially important place for storytellers, due to the mix of Hispanic and indigenous cultures, specifically the oral traditions and histories of the Pueblos. This activity will incorporate music, dance and storytelling into a program that will demonstrate Native American pride and culture. It is an intertribal presentation and will be performed by Albuquerque Public School students. The program will feature two Native American songs, two Winter Stories which include acting, and one Native American dance which allows for audience participation. This activity will also allow students to develop communication and life skills. The Native American Studies program at Albuquerque High School is taught by John Williams. John is a member of the Dakota Sioux tribe and has worked in APS for over 25 years. He teaches Navajo Government, Native American Studies and Native American Leadership. His program sponsors annual events such as Winter Stories, Native American Fashion Shows, and Music Appreciation.

 **The field of text technologies is a capacious analytical framework that focuses on all textual records throughout human history, from the earliest periods of traceable communication—perhaps as early as 60,000 BCE—to the present day. At its core, it examines the material history of communication: what constitutes a text, the purposes for which it is intended, how it functions, and the social ends that it serves.**

**This coursebook can be used to support any pedagogical or research activities in text technologies, the history of the book, the history of information, and textually based work in the digital humanities. Through careful explanations of the field, examinations of terminology and themes, and illustrated case studies of diverse texts—from the Cyrus cylinder to the Eagles' ""Hotel California""—Elaine Treharne and Claude Willan offer a clear yet nuanced overview of how humans convey meaning.** ***Text Technologies*** **will enable students and teachers to generate multiple lines of inquiry into how communication—its production, form and materiality, and reception—is crucial to any interpretation of culture, history, and society.**

yzczg1,16,2022-11-19,Theory on Shubble's Witch Academy,u/MoonOmens22,EmpiresSMP,https://www.reddit.com/r/EmpiresSMP/comments/yzczg1/theory_on_shubbles_witch_academy/,"This is my theory on Shubble's origins and her little Witch Academy.  
Don't read if you haven't watched Season 1, but I'm assuming everyone here already has, but just for safety, spoiler tag will be added as Season 2 is mentioned.

  
As we know in Season 1 of Empires, much like Season 2, there was a Witch or she rather be called a Wizard, GeminiTay. Gem started an academy about a bit over halfway through the season to ""teach"" the magic arcane to her students, those being numerous unarmed Pillagers, Lizzie, Katherine, Fwhip, and Sausage. At the end of Season 1, Xornoth has broken loose from his crystal prison and fought Scott for one last time, Fwhip and Jimmy have set off a chain reaction explosion causing disastrous seismic shocks all over the Empires, destroying some. We then see Gem, her adopted Ender Dragon Daughter Violet, her brother Fwhip, and his two dogs, leaving Crystal Cliffs on the back of one of her Dragon's to escape the decaying land. She states that they headed out to a new place to start a completely new life together, leaving her familiar Gandalf behind, which at the end she states that he was an elder Wizard and stayed behind to look after Crystal Cliffs for future generations. And at the very end, she and her brother created a series of floating islands, guarded by their Dragons and watched over by Violet, where the two lived a simple life of peace, telling stories and bringing joy to villagers.

Now there are two options:

1. The Witch Academy that Shelby (Shubble) attended was that of the Crystal Cliffs Magic Academy, which had been found by a new Witch or Wizard and brought up by Gandalf before opening to future generations and maintaining the academy's status and structure.  
*or*
2. Gem and Fhwip started up a new school of their own in the small village that the two had settled in/above, far away from every where else, helping to bring up future generations of those who could uphold their peaceful legacy. After the two's passing's, many many years later (considering that Gem's lifespan was slightly extended due to her Arcane, and Fwhip's slightly not as much though) their school was carried on, and still remains to today (season 2) teaching new generations of magic users.

Anyways, tell me what you think below.

Musa Al Sadr born on June, 28, 1928 was an Iranian born Lebanese Scholar and founder of the Amal movement which was a prominent Shia based group that was active during the Lebanese civil war who was considered as a high level political figure among shiites which is a sect in Islam. Al Sadr was born in a cheharmdan neighborhood of qom. Iran. He had attended Hayat elementary school in Qom where he attended Seminary classes informally. He started his official seminary education in 1941. His teachers described him as a \`\`quick learner and remarkably knowledgeable for his young age. Al Sadr had started teaching other students as well lower level courses. To have some influence in ""national life"" he concluded that he had to become familiar with ""modern science and the contemporary world"". As a result, he started a ""full secular education"" alongside his seminary studies. He moved to [Tehran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran), where he completed a degree in [Islamic jurisprudence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiqh) (*fiqh*) and political sciences from [Tehran University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran_University) and learned some English and French. He then returned to Qom to study theology and [Islamic philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_philosophy) under [Allamah Muhammad Husayn Tabataba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allameh_Tabatabaei) 

Sadr\`s father had passed away in 1953 and left qom for Najaf to study theology under a Iranian Shia authority named Muhsin Al Hakim and Abdul Qasim Khui. There he had teachers such as: Ayatollah Hakim, Shaykh Morteza al Yasin, [Ayatollah Abul Qasim Khu'i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_al-Qasim_al-Khoei), Shaykh Hossein Hilli, Shaykh Sadra Badkubahi, and others, some of whom became [*Marja*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marja%27) after [Ayatollah Borujerdi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seyyed_Hossein_Borujerdi)'s death. Musa al-Sadr became a [*mujtahid*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mujtahid) in Najaf. In 1955 he traveled to Lebanon where he met [Abd al-Hossein Sharafeddin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abd_al-Husayn_Sharaf_al-Din_al-Musawi). He had met him previously in 1936 when his family had hosted Abd al-Husayn in Iran. The same year he left Iran and returned to Najaf and, in the autumn of 1956, he married the daughter of Ayatollah Azizollah Khalili. 

Following the Coup that had taken place in Iraq in 1958 known as the July 14 revolution by the free officers movement which overthrew the monarchy at the time which was established by King Faisal under the auspices of the British. Sadr had returned to Iran where he had accepted a role as an editor for Darshai Az  Maktab E Eslam which was a journal published by the Hawza of Qom and endorsed by Ayotollah Broujerdi. Sadr had gone to Lebanon where he had continued his activities and in 1974 he along with Hussein El Husseini founded the disinherited movement of disinherited to press for better economic and social conditions for Shia\`s. Al Sadr had made efforts to prevent descent into violence which would lead to the Lebanese civil war by beginning a fast in a mosque in beirut where he was visited by all factions such as the leader of Fatah-PLO Yassar Arafat and the Foregin minister of Syria Abd Al Hakim Khaddam. Sadr\`s attempt at peace was successful where a formation of a national unity cabinet. The Amal movement was also created by Sadr to protect the rights of Shia\`s rights and their interests. In 1976 Sadr had withdrawn his support after the Syrian invasion against Palestinians and leftist Militias. He had collaborated with other Shia Islamist activist during the war. Sadr had also played a role in the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979 which overthrew the Shah dynasty who went to Exile.

Disappearance 

On August, 25, 1978 Al Sadr and his two companions had departed to Libya to meet with government officials at the invitation of Muammar Gaddafi. The three were last seen on August 31 and never heard from. Many Lebanese Shia\`s believe that Gaddafi had ordered his killing through Libya has denied responsibility and had claimed that Sadr and his companions had left Libya for Italy however supporters of Sadr pointed out that his baggage was found in Tripoli and no evidence of his arrival to Rome nor did the Airlines were able to confirm this. Till this day it remains an unsolved mystery what happened to Musa Al Sadr and his two other companions, rather there still alive or dead where Gaddafi was blamed for the disappearance. 

According to Iranian General Mansour Qadar, the head of Syrian security, [Rifaat al-Assad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifaat_al-Assad), told the Iranian ambassador to Syria that Gaddafi planned to kill al-Sadr. On 27 August 2008, Gaddafi was indicted by the government of Lebanon for al-Sadr's disappearance.Following the fall of the [Gaddafi regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaddafi_regime), Lebanon and Iran appealed to the Libyan rebels to investigate the fate of Musa al-Sadr. Gaddafi's regime was overthrown during the invasion in 2011 and following the Arab spring protests against Arab regimes. Political analyst Roula Talj has said that Gaddafi's son, [Saif al-Islam Gaddafi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saif_al-Islam_Gaddafi), told her that al-Sadr and his aides, Mohammed Yaqoub and Abbas Badreddin, never left Libya. According to a representative of Libya's [National Transitional Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transitional_Council) in [Cairo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo), Gaddafi murdered al-Sadr after discussions about Shia beliefs. Sadr accused him of being unaware of Islamic teachings and of the Islamic branches of Shia and [Sunni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam). According to other sources, Gaddafi had al-Sadr and his companions murdered at the request of [Palestinian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_people) leader [Yasser Arafat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasser_Arafat). At the time, the Shias and the Palestinians were involved in armed clashes in [Southern Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Lebanon). According to a former member of Libyan intelligence, al-Sadr was beaten to death for daring to challenge Gaddafi at his house on matters of theology. In an interview with [Al Aan TV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Aan_TV), Ahmed Ramadan, an influential figure in the Gaddafi regime and an eyewitness to the meeting between al-Sadr and Gaddafi, claimed that the meeting lasted for two and a half hours and ended with Gaddafi saying ""take him"". Ramadan also named three officials who he believes were responsible for the death of al-Sadr., [Muqtada al-Sadr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muqtada_al-Sadr), the cousin of Musa al-Sadr and leader of the [Sadrist Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadrist_Movement) in Iraq, announced that a committee has been formed to investigate the fate of Musa al-Sadr.

No human business, that is. This is the beginning of my experience with the supernatural, and my first shift at The Drowsy Spectre. If you ended up here on accident, or are looking for more, click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/z2gw2o/i_had_a_strange_first_shift_at_my_new_job_but_now/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).

\--------------------------------------

I'm a long time fan of r/nosleep and creepypastas in general. Obviously, like most, I take them as fiction. Or at least, I did. I might have to consider something that, until recently, I would have thought ridiculous. I've found myself wrapped in a story of my own, one that I doubt anyone will believe. I can't share it with my family as I am not fond of becoming the butt of every joke, the same goes for my friends.

Assuming I don't get killed for not seeing that a latte was supposed to be made with almond milk (that is a hazard that regular baristas face, nothing to do with the hauntings that plague The Drowsy Spectre), then I’ll just update things here. I’ve been given Tuesday and Wednesdays off, giving me plenty of time to write down whatever weird stuff happens.

So far, I’ve only worked one shift at the new location. I have a long history with one of Richard’s other chains, The Drowsy Student. I’ll start there, where my boss, who is the owner of the chain, came to offer me a strange position.

There I was, working my five hour shift. Short, I know. Most of the shifts at my old job were. Lots of young people that work have to dance around their college schedules. Drowsy Student, where I worked under the same owner, was placed strategically between three different college campuses. If it were me, I'd pick one campus and drop the store right next to it. Richard, the owner, thought it best to place it in a position that would see more morning traffic. Students going to their first class, which made a lot of sense I guess. I don't have a business degree, so I don't know. Never felt the pull to go get a higher education, though that's not to shame anyone who does. I've never had the money, nor the inspiration.

That's probably why I was stuck there, making a passable wage with part-time hours. Most everyone there had classes, went to college, so I felt a bit out of place at times. I made a few friends though. The closing shift is like that. Even if you’re working with people you'd never consider hanging out with, something about late hours and slow business brings people together. Mostly complaining, the greatest common ground any person could find. Richard was a good boss by comparison, but every job had things to whine about.

Anyways, this was one of the few nights that I didn't stay to fully close. We locked the doors at 9:00pm, clocked out and went home around forty five minutes later. Since it was so slow during the late hours, oftentimes one person would be sent out at 8:30. That Friday, it was me. I didn't have any other friends outside The Drowsy Student, nor anyone at my apartment waiting on me. Most got a dog, or maybe a cat. I didn't hate animals, I just didn't have one. That's why I decided to stay; there was no reason for me to go home. Everyone I had was there, closing down the store. I had my phone, scrolling through reddit and waiting for everyone else to finish their shift so we could complain about our lives outside the store. Besides me, there was one other person in the lobby. They had a laptop open, a large book beside them, and a large cup of fuel sitting far too close to their studying tools.

Sometimes Richard parked out back to make a stealth approach through the back door. I wasn't certain if he did that to check on his employee base, maybe to see if there was more talking than working when he wasn't around on the slow closing shift. He'd have us pull out the fridges, scrub the booths. Yeah, those were all smart and reasonable things for the person paying you to request, but that didn't mean any of us liked it.

I could see the office from my comfortable spot at the front of the store, in a corner that guaranteed another customer wouldn't sit near me. That was unlikely anyway, considering the hour, but it was instinct. The back door in the office opened to introduce Richard, who noticed me instantly. Whenever Richard saw someone he knew, he smiled big and waved. This time it was no different.

Much to my dismay, he approached. ""Want me to get you a sleeping bag?""

A joke, but I would have accepted. ""I think we are all going to Waffle House after they close up.""

""Waffle House, huh? I bet they get plenty of business this late. It’s all breakfast food, though. I tried that, but there isn't enough room in the kitchen. The truth of the matter is that we do plenty of business in the morning, it balances out how slow it is at night. Maybe that is it, maybe we need to do more breakfast in the evening."" I hadn't asked about any of that, but this was just how Richard was. ""You mind if I borrow you for a sec?""

I wasn't clocked in and it wasn't worth it to bother him about getting paid for sitting down. If he wanted to talk, I was probably in trouble for something. Wasn't wise to make it worse. ""Yeah.""

""Come on, we'll talk in my office.""

The red chair in his office was cushioned, but that didn't make it comfortable. I was constantly adjusting, which I hoped didn't give him the idea that I was simply uncomfortable in his presence. He always joked that he felt like an intimidating boss, that everyone just needed to relax around him. I was trying to, but the damn chair was set on hurting me. Whenever I adjusted my legs, I had to be careful not to knock over a pile of papers, or kick some cringy trinket referencing how good caffeine was. ‘I don't really rise and shine, I just caffeinate and hope for the best!’ Ugh, kill me. He had talked about putting that on the back of our uniforms too. I'd hang myself.

""So, how are you?"" Richard always started off like that.

""Making money."" That was a stupid reply. Why did I say that?

He laughed, as was polite. A pity laugh. ""Look, I wanted to offer you a position."" That was far better news than I'd hoped for.

""What sort of position?""

""You work nights, mostly. You aren't taking classes, unless that has changed, but you aren't available to come in until around 1:00pm."" Personal preference, but I wasn't going to tell him that. ""If you were able to come in even later, stay into the night, would you? I get the feeling you are a night owl.""

Richard had a few locations, but none of them were open overnight. ""Doing what? Cleaning, or something?""

""No, no. Nothing like that."" Why was he so hesitant? ""Look, there is another chain I own. Not really a chain, I guess, since there is only one of them. Would a drive up by Rose Hill be too far for you?""

If it meant an overnight shift and more hours, it didn't matter. ""Not at all. I didn't know we had anything up there.""

He sighed, then went serious. ""We don't."" Be quiet, the message was clear. ""Some around here know about it, but only those I trust. Naturally, that means that if you refuse...""

So it wasn't an offer, it was an ultimatum. ""Did someone complain?""

""People are always complaining, that's half the business. No, Axel. I have vacancies that need to be filled. Turnover is pretty intense on the overnights. I think you will like it, though. It isn't even open during the day, save for a few hours just before sunset.""

""But why the secrecy?""

""It was my first shop."" He confessed. ""Didn't take off like I wanted it to. This? This is my success, The Drowsy Student. I want to be known for that, not my first failure.""

That seemed a bit extreme, but I wasn't going to bother pushing it. ""And I'd be paid the same?""

""More, actually. There are certain... hazards, working in such a remote place.""

""Remote? You said it was in Rose Hill.""

""By Rose Hill, not in. It is near the highway, off to the side.""

""There isn't a college up there."" It was making sense.

Richard shook his head. ""No.""

No wonder it was a failure; from what I knew then, Richard would have no income there. ""So why put a coffee shop there? What business do you expect?""

""Oh, plenty come through.""

I had to take his word on that. ""And if the place closes down?""

Richard laughed at that, a real laugh. ""Then I'd be in big trouble. It won't, though. But, if it eases your mind, you will have a place here. What do you say?""

It really didn't take that long for me to come to a decision. If what Richard was offering was real, then it was truly the greatest offer I could have hoped for. I shrugged and told him that I accepted, then asked when I would be able to start this new dream position.

""Monday, please.""

""That is perfect, then.""

""Let me get you a packet, then."" He spun in his chair to tear at the disorganized mess that was his desk. Finally, he found a manilla folder. ""Here we are. There are some different products over there, as well as different policies. There is one thing you need to know, Axel; it is *much* more strict over there. I expect the finest adherence to these policies. If I have to let you go, I won't be putting you back here.""

That was fair. ""You can trust me."" Considering it would be completely dead at this other shop, I wasn't really concerned about policies or procedures. I planned to give it a read regardless. ""What is it called?""

""The store?"" Richard stood and straightened his polo. ""The Drowsy Spectre. You can see where this store's title was inspired. I won't be there Monday, but Selene will. She's the manager and is there nearly every night. She’ll show you the ropes."" He went for the back door. ""I expect a survivor, Axel.""

That was a weird thing to say, coffee shops weren't known for killing people. I learned, however. That next morning was a Saturday, and I happened to be off. That gave me two days to prepare, to read up on the papers that Richard had provided. It was a joke, or I had at least thought so at the time. Things like ""Do not, under any circumstances, buy candles from the lady by the lake. When running trash, answer any question she asks honestly."" Or ""When the Heartmin comes in, her order must be completed in two minutes. Otherwise, hide in the freezer.""

Richard had an odd sense of humor, so I didn't think much of it. Important things, like ""Arrive thirty minutes before opening and *do not* unlock the door until opening at 7:00pm"" and ""If you hear knocking at the back door, don't answer unless it's only five raps."" Made sense, considering the obscure location.

Monday came. The shop was just outside of Rose Hill, which was already a country sort of town. Again, I was shocked at the placement of the business. It was twenty minutes out of Rose Hill, which meant the likelihood of anyone making the journey to the Drowsy Spectre was very small. When I arrived, I found that the store was in surprisingly good condition. Considering how long it must have been open for it to be Richard's first business, and the lack of revenue it must produce, it should have been in pieces.

It was rustic from the outside. Made of logs, or at least meant to look so, with soft lighting at the entrance. It was 6:15pm. There was nearly no traffic, but I left early just in case. The door would be unlocked at 6:30 to let me in. I thought it wise to show that I arrived early, displaying my work ethic. Stupid, I know, but that was me. It was locked, as expected, but I could not see anyone inside. I would have expected the manager to arrive early, get things started before the rest of the employees arrived. My car was the only one in the parking lot when I arrived but, when I turned around, there was one other. I assumed they were the manager.

A woman stepped out of a Ford fiesta. It was an old car, probably from the 80's. I am not proficient in cars, however, so I am not sure. Anyway, she waved at me. She was my age, maybe a bit older. Just under her thirties, I guessed. A flower dress was out of place in the cold fall weather, as were her sandals. She opened the back of her car and pulled out a box. I could see, even from my place on the porch, that they were full of candles. She left the trunk open and went towards the drive thru.

She paused. ""I haven't seen your face around here. What's your name?""

The candle lady. The folder said to answer her, I felt inspired to do so. ""Axel, I just started. This is actually my first day.""

""Axel. I like that name. I'm Amber Bucker. I sell candles over by the lake, just by the drive thru. Lots of people here buy them, even Selene. You want to come back and have a look?""

She seemed sweet, but I refused. It wasn't because of the rules, it was just that I wasn't a huge fan of candles. That, and I was waiting on Selene. ""Maybe another time.""

""I'll hold you to that, Axel White.""

I hadn't told her my last name, but I didn't put much thought to it. She came back for a table and another box, then closed her trunk without a word. She glanced at me a few times. Pushed her hair behind her ear and looked away whenever I noticed. Eventually someone else arrived, just one minute before the doors were to be unlocked. A crown vic, old too. Looked like everyone here drove something older than I was. A redhead climbed out, dressed in enough black to scream edgy. Black eyeliner contrasted green eyes, ones that were locked on Amber's car. They fell on me.

""You didn't buy anything, did you?""

""I read the policy on that. We aren't supposed to.""

""That's good."" She put her hands on her hips.

""She seemed nice. Amber, I mean. She said you liked her candles, though.""

Selene scrunched her nose. ""She tells people that. I never bought one though, I don't have a death wish.""

""Death wish?"" That was a bit extreme.

She looked me up and down. ""Look, you've just started. I get it, everything seems super weird. It doesn't get better, but you'll get used to it."" A loud beeping caused Selene to pull out her phone. She had a popsocket with a llama that had... a horn? A llamacorn? That didn't really match with her emo appearance. ""Scoot. I gotta unlock the door.""

More cars pulled in, just on time. They weren't as ancient as the other vehicles. A white truck, a gray sedan, I think the white sedan was a Honda. I am a bit weird, perhaps making first impressions without even meeting someone. Cars didn't really say much about a person, but I still do it. Can't stop.

I met Barrow, Em, and John as they came through the door. Everyone pooled in the lobby just inside, then I realized that we were waiting on Selene to lock the door. She did, just a minute after opening it. Then she turned around and got all serious.

""Don't touch this lock. I don't care who you see outside. Even if they beg you, don't let anyone in."" I nodded. ""Y’all keep an eye on him. This guy here is Hook, he'll show you around. The rest of you? Introduce yourselves. This part is getting boring."" She went on her way, presumably to her office.

Hook sighed and rolled his eyes before taking the lead. ""Barrow, nice to meet you."" He had a well-kept goatee and, when he shook my hand, a firm grip. I was certain I'd get along with him.

""Why'd she call you Hook?""

Glaring in the direction of the office, Barrow answered. ""She's got nicknames for everyone. Lots of turnover here, makes it easier for her to remember everyone. When we met, she thought my beard looked a bit like...""

He trailed off, but I got it. ""A pirate.""

""Yeah."" Barrow was quick to change the subject. He introduced a blonde girl, who awkwardly stuck out a small arm as he spoke. ""This is Em.""

""Hi. Hope you don't-""

""Not yet."" Barrow cut her off. ""This is John.""

""Hey man."" My father always told me you could measure a man by a handshake. I don't know if I believe that, but John wiggled more than shook. He seemed the youngest, but he had an energy I liked. ""Shouldn't have said yes to Richard, just saying.""

""Did you all come from the other locations?""

""Pretty much."" Em nodded. ""Barrow and I have been here the longest. John here started with his brother, who you are replacing.""

""He quit?""

They glanced at Barrow, who seemed to be the leader in the group. ""You could say that.""

It was an odd response, but it was clear that was all I was going to get. ""Overnights aren't for everyone, I guess.""

""Oh, he liked overnights. That wasn't it."" Barrow waved an arm. ""Let me show you around. I assume Richard gave you the folder with our... policies?"" I nodded. ""Policy is a fancy word, it doesn't really have the weight that it should. Rules is a better one. They are rules and breaking them could get you fired, or worse.""

""Or worse?""

""Yeah. Don't worry about that just yet. What do you remember?"" Before I could answer, he waved an arm. ""Actually, I'll just tell you. Easier to learn visually, right?""

I learned by experience, so he was right. ""Sure.""

He brought me behind the counter, the others followed. ""This is the drive thru. The rules aren't really numbered, but we will call this number one because it really is the least of them. Don't open the window unless there is a customer *in* a car. One fellow comes around sometimes and he is mostly harmless, unless you go outside with him. We call him Tall Ben. He'll try to talk you into climbing out the window and it honestly isn't worth the trouble of getting rid of him. Just don't open the window unless someone is in a car.""

That was a bit odd, but we were in a secluded spot. Who knows how many weirdos came around. ""Rule two, we'll call it. There is a blonde lady that comes in, we call her Heartmin. She has a stupid drink she orders every time. It’s gotta be done in two minutes. The list says to hide in the freezer if you don't, but most times you can just cover your ears. She screams... very loudly. Next is the back door. Tall Ben, sometimes someone else, will knock and get you to open it. Don't. If it is someone important, it'll be-""

""Five knocks.""

""Good, you did read them. Next is Tom. He'll come in and bother any female employee. If none are working, he will leave. It is on us to make sure we warn them if he shows up. He'll try to get pictures and, if he does, that is very bad for them.""

""He is a creep."" Em added. ""But yeah, we go to the bathroom or something. He leaves eventually.""

""There are some other... situational ones that we can go over once they come up. Last two, though, are the most important. Don't unlock the door before 7:00 pm, and do *not* buy candles from Amber. That one is super important.""

""Why not?""

""Don't worry about that. You'll be fired on the spot, no questions asked. Do *not* buy anything from her, but make sure to answer her questions. If you don't, she will tell us. You'll be fired.""

""What?"" That was entirely ridiculous. ""Is she Richard's daughter or something?""

""Sure."" Barrow shrugged.

""Hook!"" Selene shouted from her office. ""Lights are out!""

They weren't, I could see just fine. I could see the light coming from the edge of the office door, too. There was a lightswitch outside the door and Barrow flipped it. Nothing happened, but Selene did step out afterwards.

""Thanks."" She offered, then went back inside.

Barrow turned to me. ""Situational. Just flip the switch if she says that.""

""The light was on though.""

""Don't worry about that.""

7:00 pm came around. Selene checked up with me, made sure I was prepared for the shift. Someone was waiting outside the door. They had a hoodie on, I couldn't see their face as the setting sun offered little light. They left just before 7:00, being just out of sight when Selene unlocked the doors.

""We're open."" She stared out into the parking lot. ""And she's here already. That was fast.""

A massive van pulled in. Black, fit for maybe eighteen people. It took up nearly four parking spaces, mostly because the one driving it didn't know how to park the beast. Out came a blonde woman, eyes fiercely locked on the front door.

""Let us handle Heartmin. Just watch and you'll pick it up."" Barrow waved him over. ""Come by the register. I know you worked at Drowsy Student, but it is a bit different here.""

I obliged just as Heartmin pushed open the door. She sighed long when she entered, but she seemed like a normal woman. Heartmin approached the counter and gave Em a fake smile. She made an act of looking at the menu on the wall behind Em, but Barrow made clear that she was a long time regular. Wouldn't she already know what was on it?

""Do you have heavy cream?"" Heartmin asked.

""Still don't. I don't think Richard is able to sell it before it spoils.""

She scoffed. ""Well I will take a large, hot latte. Breve. Do you have honey?""

Em nodded. ""I can put honey in it.""

""Yeah. That'll be it.""

As soon as she said this, Barrow hit a button. I leaned over and realized it was a timer. Em quickly wrote down the order on a cup and let Barrow get to work. Barrow had already steamed the milk and had two shots of espresso ready, so the drink was done in seconds. There was no need for the timer. Barrow put the drink on the counter to his left and called for Heartmin.

""Thank you."" She took it, sipped, and found it acceptable. ""Thanks."" Then, she left.

""Well that was lucky. You never know when Heartmin will come in, she is entirely random. Good first time for you though, sometimes it is during a rush. One time, DeGuire..."" Barrow hesitated. ""Well, he had it hard the first time.""

Someone else came in, then another. Lots of strange people, but more than I had expected. Odd accents, weird clothes, and even stranger orders. John was back in the kitchen, Barrow told me that was his usual station. He came up front when he had no orders, which was often. A sandwich that was just meat. Meat for bread, meat for... well, meat. Meat instead of lettuce and tomato. John brought out a moldy piece of bread and I was going to stop him, but the customer saw the mold and grinned before offering a oddly sexual thanks.

I met Tall Ben, too. He isn't... right. Meeting him made me realize that there was something unnatural around The Drowsy Spectre. Ben was a lanky giant, there was no other way to put it. He was three or four times my height and sure, I am not that tall, but *no one* is *that* tall. I say I met him, but I really only saw him outside the window. He waved, but I didn't open the window. I would have assumed he was on stilts or something, but his head was too big. His whole body was stretched, hands big enough to pick me up if he wanted to. To eat me.

""What does he want?"" I asked.

Barrow hadn't noticed him. ""Probably to eat you."" Just like I guessed. ""Nice not opening the window.""

""Is that mistake made often?""

""Like I said, lots of turnover.""

I was certain there had to be an explanation for Ben's stature. We were in redneck country, who knows what sort of defects happened where society couldn't reach. The doubts of The Drowsy Spectre's supernatural nature, however, were shattered when Em came running from near the front door.

""DeGuire is here!""

""Damn him."" Barrow dropped everything. ""Are we empty?""

""Yeah, no one is in.""

""Lock the door.""

""But-""

""Lock it!""

The door creaked and welcomed a man in a long coat. I had never, until that day, seen yellow eyes. He was pale, like he'd not seen the sun in a long time. He looked around, then noticed Em near the front counter. He slowly approached and Em was quick to hurry behind the register. I assumed this was DeGuire, the fired brother of John. DeGuire was a last name, though. I did not have the privilege of knowing his first. There was tension in the air; it didn't seem like my right to break it, so I remained silent. Did the lights dim? I think they did.

""Changed your mind?"" He asked.”You *know* it is the right thing to do.”

""Get out, DeGuire."" Barrow held a shot glass in his hand, prepared to turn it into a dangerous projectile.

DeGuire stared for a moment. ""You don't have anyone!"" Finally, he noticed me. ""You. You are here to replace me, right?""

""Don't answer him, Axel.""

""You'll take my place?""

I didn't speak, but Barrow reinforced his command. ""Don't speak to him!""

""One of you!"" DeGuire raised his voice. ""TAKE MY PLACE!"" The lights shattered, raining sparks and glass. I protected my eyes and face, as did the others.

Selene had exited her office, a crucifix in her hand. ""Get out, DeGuire!"" She held it out to him. ""Get out!""

He averted his gaze. ""Selene, please! You know me!""

""We all did, DeGuire."" John stood by the kitchen. ""You're gone.""

""IT ISN'T FAIR!"" He begged. ""It isn't!""

I could see Tall Ben outside the glass windows that made up the front of the store. He seemed genuinely interested in the drama.

""Get out."" Selene demanded.

DeGuire hesitated, then backed towards the door. He looked up at me one last time. ""If you want to take my place, if you want to do the right thing, then put this on."" A ring fell from his hand, landing on the mat by the front door. It was a gold ring, maybe a wedding band. When he left, Tall Ben tracked him. He eventually waved at us before tailing DeGuire into the woods.

Everyone let out a collective sigh. ""Well done, new guy."" Selene offered. ""You didn't speak. That is for the best."" She pointed at the ring. ""Just don't touch that, and we will all be fine.""

""You don't want to move it?""

""No, no. It'll be gone when we come in tomorrow. DeGuire stops in sometimes. Just... let us handle him.""

With that, she went back to her office. I was still trying to process DeGuire's haunting visit. None of it was normal, not the yellow eyes, nor the shattering of the lights. Between him and Tall Ben, I was beginning to understand that some things could not be explained. Sometimes weird stuff happened when you got away from the city and it seemed that this store served those weird things.

It was much darker since the lights shattered, so Em offered to fix it. ""I'll get the ladder.""

I had questions, however. ""Barrow, what happened to DeGuire?""

He was hesitant, but I didn't not have to pester to break him. Barrow let out a long sigh, then stared with regret at the woods. ""He bought a candle.""

Nothing more notable happened that night, other than the occasional strange order or customer. I went home, closed my blackout curtains, and took some melatonin. Like I said, I have Tuesdays and Wednesdays off. If something else happens during the weekend, I'll write it all down here. It is... therapeutic. Gets my mind off of why I came here, to Rykar Valley, as well as helps me process the strangest night I've ever experienced.

Thanks for reading, and I'm sure I'll have plenty more to talk about soon."

Haddie: Still waiting on more cosmetics that'll never come. Wait wasn't this about horror movie stereotypes?

Ada: Only cares about Leon and won't help anyone else.

Rebecca: No slander too cute. Her gen perks need a bit of a nerf though.

Vittorio: Probably shit his pants the first time he saw a gen or a flashlight or a flashbang."

z4ldnv,14,2022-11-25,Rating maps as a community Day 2: Monastery Outskirts,u/IfTheresANewWay,FireEmblemThreeHouses,https://www.reddit.com/r/FireEmblemThreeHouses/comments/z4ldnv/rating_maps_as_a_community_day_2_monastery/,"The second map in the game plus the first one where you can actually choose your units: The Monastery Outskirks, first scene in Chapter 1: [Three Houses](https://fireemblem.fandom.com/wiki/Three_Houses_(Chapter)). This map, like it's name suggests, is outside Garreg Mach, in fact if you go into the third person mode, you can see Garreg Mach to the Northeast of the map. The map is mostly open with a few clusters of trees and thickets, as well as two healing tiles. 

In the battle ""Rivalry of the Houses"", Byleth, alongside the house leader and three other units, test their mettle against the other two houses and their students and professor. The Black Eagles will have Edelgard, Hubert, Ferdinand and Dorothea, the Blue Lions will bring Dimitri, Dedue, Ashe and Mercedes, while the Golden Deer have Claude, Hilda, Lorenz and Ignatz. Manuela and Hanneman will also assist one of the other houses as well; Hanneman will always lead the Blue Lions unless their chosen in which case he'll lead the Deer, while Manuela will always lead the Eagles unless you choose them, in which case she'll lead the Deer. Obviously, you won't face the units from your own house, instead you can choose three of the seven students to bring with you. Your house will spawn to the Southeast. To the west, the Golden Deer will take cover in the Thickets, with Claude and Hilda hiding behind a destroyable wall, while their professor will be on the healing tile behind them. Two of their units, Lorenz and Ignatz, will be South of Claude and Hilda, and will likely be apart of the first force you face. If the Deer are your chosen house, the Eagles will spawn here instead, with Edelgard and Hubert taking cover in the thickets, while Ferdinand and Dorothea will be South of them. To the Northeast is the Blue Lions. The professor will be on the heal tile, surrounded by Dimitri, Dedue and Mercedes. Ashe will be more South and will join the two units of the other house in an initial assault against you. If the Lions are your chosen house, Edelgard, Hubert and Ferdinand will spawn here with their chosen professor instead, while Dorothea will join the Deer in their initial attack.

You have a few ways to tackle this map: firstly is attempting to fight both houses at once. Heading straight north of your spawn will trigger both house leaders to start moving towards you at once. Obviously, this isn't usually the best strategy but it can be a fun challenge. Otherwise, heading to the east will only trigger the Deer or Eagles, leaving the other house to the east dormant. I believe if you go to the west first, however, you can trigger the Lions or Eagles first. 

Admittedly, I've never tried this strategy cause, generally, most people will opt to go West first, as the Deer are probably the least threatening house, while Eagles are less of a problem compared to the Lions. While Ashe and Hanneman aren't anything special, and Mercedes is almost laughably bad, Dimitri and especially Dedue are major threats, the latter of whom practically forces you to bring a Mage if you didn't choose the Lions. I find the typically strategy is to first defeat the initial force of Lorenz, Ignatz and Ashe if you're the Egales, Lorenz, Igantz and Dorothea if you're the Lions, or Ferdinand, Dorothea and Ashe if you're the Deer, and then going East to finish off the rest of that house. Hilda, I find, is the most threatening Deer deployed, having a Hand Axe instead of a training axe, while Hubert and Edelgard can make a threatening duo, but you can bait these two out with one unit, then move on to finish off the professor. Once all five units of the West house are defeated, the East house will start moving towards you. Making use of the healing tile and the tree are integral here. If the Lions weren't your chosen house, I find that baiting out an attack from Dedue, while also being out of range of Dimitri, is your best chance to defeat them: have your Mage(s) weaken Dedue and then finish him off, while also doing as much damage to Dimitri as you can. You might lose a unit here, but ideally you'll still have four or all five of your class alive, and as this is a practice battle, fallen units aren't lost forever. Once the three remaining students of the East house are defeated, you can simply head over to the other Heal tile to finish off their professor.

The optimal team is up for some debate, but for the Eagles, Hubert is almost necessary for defeating Dedue. You could also make an argument for Linhardt, Dorothea, Petra and/or Ferdinand. Caspar isn't really needed especially when Edelgard can fill whatever role you were gonna give him. Bernadetta, as this point, isn't to her full potential yet, and I'd find it wiser to just give her Bow to someone else for the chapter. For the Lions, Sylvain and Dedue will be very tanky units, while Mercedes and Annette can bring magic. You could also make a strong argument for Felix as well, since his unique ability will be active by default. Finally, for the Deer, again, Lysithea is basically a necessity for Dedue, while the other two slots could be filled by Marianne for healing, or Raphael, Leonie and Hilda for their tanky stats plus supporting adjacent units.

But that's not where the discussion ends, as this map also serves as a potential auxiliary map. Here, your units will spawn in the same area, though you can now bring 10 units will no forces deployments, as is the same for all auxiliary maps. The enemies will spawn on the right side of the map all the way back to the east healing tile where the boss lies. There isn't really much worth discussing here in terms of strategy; just kill everything. 

And that's the Monastery Outskirks. I like the map tbh. I think the gimmick of forcing you to pick your three best students is fun (though obviously is less limiting on lower difficulties), and it's a solid first chapter that forces players to use the knowledge they've learned in the Prologue chapter. The Auxiliary battle, like many of them will be, doesn't utilize the map very well, with the entire left side of the map going unused. Plus, your units spawning in the same spot as the Chapter battle is a shame too, I think it'd more interesting if your team instead spawned to the North with all the enemies coming from the South.

Cast your votes below, and at the time of this poll going up, the previous poll for ""Outside Remire Village"" is still open should you want to vote for that.

a mild example i can think of is my current history teacher. shoots a lot of passive insults towards me and overall likes to give people a hard time, almost as if he became a teacher just to torment the students 😭, but i really enjoy his dry humor, pretty cool sneakers (sooooo superficial, EXCUSE ME FOR APPRECIATING THE QUALITY AND DESIGN OF SOMEONE’S $200 SHOES. FUCK.), and he’s meaner to the people i think deserve it/don’t like lol.

not only appreciation, but i’m just really grateful i get to meet so many people and see so many different sides of them. maybe it’s not a gemini thing and is instead a human emotion thing, but i feel our duality and all the insane shit that goes on in our heads really helps us see people for everything they are and not just reduce them down to something that only makes up half of what they are.

z8mgl1,26,2022-11-30,Earnings Report for November,u/IvyRoney,beermoneyuk,https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoneyuk/comments/z8mgl1/earnings_report_for_november/,"I hope everyone had a good month of beermoney earning, Here's how mine went:

&amp;#x200B;

# Offers I did This Month:

**(1) Co-op Bank Switch: £125**

Co-op bank upping their switching bonus from £50 to £125 was a huge incentive for many people to complete this offer this month. I'm glad I took the time to do it because I was a bit put off by bank switches in the past as they always seemed quite time consuming to me. This switch requires no deposit and no direct debit switches and only takes about 20 minutes to complete, all you need are the account details of an existing Co-op customer to refer you. It's up there with the Tide offer in my opinion, as it really is a Free £125 for very little effort.

**(2) Tide 2: Electric Boogaloo- £100**

Speaking of the Tide offer, There was a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoneyuk/comments/z1r00m/tide_free_100_you_can_sign_up_again_if_you_have/?sort=new) last week showing how users could sign up to Tide again and earn £100 as part of a Black Friday Promotion. I signed up again, and although I haven't received the £100 yet, I'm hopeful it will come through in a month or so.

# 

&amp;#x200B;

# Main Sites/Methods from this month:

**(1)** [**Usertesting**](https://usertesting.com)

**November Earnings: £33**

With this site, you test out the usability of apps and websites and get paid for it.

Your work consists of interacting with prototype or ‘in production’ websites or mobile apps while speaking out loud to share your thoughts, emotions, criticisms, and suggestions. It probably sounds very different to the type of online work you usually do because, well, it is. It’s certainly a site where the work doesn’t feel like a chore, I would highly recommend it. The pay can be very good and the work itself is actually very engaging. I quite enjoy using this site.

&amp;#x200B;

**(2)** [**User Interviews**](https://www.userinterviews.com/r/gmytloepz) **|** [Non ref](https://userinterviews.com)

**November Earnings: £126**

User Interviews is a site where you get paid to take part in various studies. There are normally a lot of studies available to apply for and the screeners are usually short and sweet.

This one has a high earning potential, due to the vast variety of study topics offered on the site. If you check your homepage frequently enough, it won't be long before you find a study that is looking for an applicant with your background/interests.

&amp;#x200B;

**(3)** [**Prolific**](https://www.prolific.co/participants)**:**

**November Earnings: £47**

I would go as far as saying it's one of the top task/survey/study sites out there. With Prolific you get paid cash for engaging in the research of Academics and Universities from around the world. There are Surveys and studies about scientific research, new products and public opinion. From minutes to hours, to multipart studies over longer periods, there's a respectable range of studies to participate in.

This site pays out to Paypal, has a range of interesting surveys, and studies pay a minimum of $6.50 per hour.

**Notes:** Install the browser extension for chrome so that you get studies while they're going.

&amp;#x200B;

**(4)** [**Outplayed.com**](https://outplayed.com/idevaffiliate/idevaffiliate.php?id=9798) **(Previously called Profit Accumulator) |** [Non ref](https://outplayed.com)

**November Earnings: £177**

This is a Matched betting site, It's a good way to earn £400-£500 in a very short time by completing the welcome offers, and then to continue earning £100-£300 on average every month by completing the daily reload offers posted on the site. Here is a [Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoneyuk/comments/u8n9u8/matched_betting_doesnt_finish_with_the_welcome/) I posted recently which explains the process in detail.

For the time you put in, the reward is great. When I did the initial welcome offers over a year ago and earned £450 for about 6 hours work, I was more than happy to admit to my friends that I was wrong for calling it ""a scam"".

**Note**: After completing the welcome offers, you can still easily make £100s per month, but it requires more effort on your part, Checking your email and the daily offer section of Outplayed.com etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**(5)** [**Appen**](https://appen.com/)**:**

**November Earnings: £21**

So this is a site where you can apply to work on various projects online, the rate of pay is very competitive, with some jobs paying up to $20-$25 per hour. Most jobs pay around $15-$20 per hour (which is still fantastic for online work) and I have not found it difficult to qualify for projects.

The site is legit and it actually feels like real work for good pay. The potential earnings from this site over the course of a year can easily enter the £100s or even £1000s, so if it's not on your radar it really should be.

**Note:** Apply for as many projects/tasks as you can, it's well worth taking the time to apply because even if you get one project, that's hours of work at a great hourly rate.

&amp;#x200B;

**(6)** [**My Tutor**](https://mytutor.co.uk/) **/ Freelance English Classes:**

**November Earnings: £90**

MyTutor is an online-tutoring site, I don’t see this site mentioned a whole lot but it really is a gem. This one is ideal for students and recent graduates, but if you have skills or knowledge in any teachable subject then you should check it out. You don’t need any previous experience as a tutor to work here.

You can earn up to £20 per hour and the work is rewarding and meaningful because you are helping others to learn. It’s also very “social” online work, which some people may see as a nice change.

**Note:** This site isn’t available for everyone, you will need specific skills (Be Studying, Graduated or Certified) to work here.

There is also the option to do English classes, teaching ESL, which you can do a quick TEFL course on and may be worth the investment if you think you'd be interested in that type of work, as it can be quite a good earner too. You can do these classes freelance or work for an online company.

&amp;#x200B;

**(7)** [**Dscout**](https://dscout.com/be-a-scout)**:**

**November Earnings: £28**

So with this site you are rewarded for helping with Market Research. The way this works is that you are given ""missions"" where you offer your opinions/feedback on various products or services in exchange for payment.

The Pay is very good and the payout is received promptly through PayPal. I also like that you answer photo and video questions, it keeps me a bit more engaged.

**Note**: Although the pay is good, I wouldn't say that the frequency of available tasks is its strong point. Check as often as you can for available missions and apply for all of them. It may take a little bit of time to get your first mission but once you do, more and more will appear.

&amp;#x200B;

**(8)** [**Fat Llama**](https://fatllama.com)**:**

**November Earnings: £15**

This is a site where you can rent out pretty much anything. I first discovered it when I was trying to find a cheap place to rent some tools.

You can browse the site and see what kind of things other people are renting out, you'd be surprised by the number of items in your own home that you might not have use for but others would be happy to rent from you for the day.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**TOTAL EARNINGS FOR NOVEMBER: £762**

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any questions at all don't be afraid to ask. I hope this report is of help to some people and I wish everybody luck with the month of online earning ahead!"
