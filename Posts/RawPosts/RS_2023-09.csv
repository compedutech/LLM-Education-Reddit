In this single year, world is taken to a storm by the newly launched AI technology which can ChatGPT is a chatbot type of Artificial Intelligence which was developed in year of 2022. be accessed for free by the million of years. Here in this post, I would like to describe Step By Step process to use chat GPT, how to login in chatGPT, website and other essential information. Go through the complete blog to collect all the required information.

**What is chatGPT ?**

In simple language, ChatGPT is an AI-powered chatbot created by San Francisco-based startup OpenAI and made accessible to the general public through web browsers. It can be utilised on chat.openai.com, which is its website. This demonstrates that chatGPT can understand responses that seem to be coming from humans.

Within a short period of time, it has started a new global race in the field of AI. Since its release in November 2022, it has been a hot issue in business circles. What, therefore, makes ChatGPT special? ChatGPT can converse with you as if you were speaking to someone who is extremely knowledgeable. Using Chat GPT, you may debate the past, present, and future. In addition, it can also write code and make lyrics for your favourite musician.

**How to Use chatGPT ?**

How to Use ChatGPT is now a question. The most common gadgets that are utilised by everyone are smartphones. Users can use ChatGPT for free on both Android and iOS devices. Nevertheless, Open AI ChatGPT Login is only accessible via a web browser. The conversation bot has not yet been implemented in an app. It is anticipated that the ChatGPT will soon be made accessible for download from Play shops as the engineers are now working on it. ChatGPT can play games, develop computer programmes, make music, write essays for students, stimulate an ATM, and perform a number of other tasks. Typically, it imitates human conversationalists. So, we have provided a detailed view on how to use the for users.

- Educators need to address the issue of students presenting AI-generated work as their own.

- AI detectors are not reliable in distinguishing between AI-generated and human-generated content.

- OpenAI's ChatGPT has no knowledge of what content is AI-generated and may randomly make up responses.

- Some teachers have found it helpful to encourage students to share specific conversations from ChatGPT to analyze critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

- This also promotes information and AI literacy and creates accountability for responsible use of AI tools.

* The [Australian](http://worldmagzine.com/australia/) government is proposing a ban on mobile phones in all public schools.
* Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, and the Northern Territory are all currently implementing bans.
* The study will strike a balance between the potential and difficulties brought on by technology.

With four primary options being presented to the public for feedback, the Australian government is proposing a ban on mobile phones in all public schools. Regarding kids using cell phones and other communication devices in the territory’s public [schools](https://worldmagzine.com/school/), the administration is reconsidering its regulations.

Depending on a student’s year level, the choices include an all-encompassing ban from the first bell until the last, a “put it away” restriction during class, or a combination of the two.

# Mobile phones in public schools

Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, and the Northern Territory are all currently implementing bans; if the ACT government decides to enforce a ban, it will be the last Australian jurisdiction to do so. New South Wales and Queensland are the only other jurisdictions without a ban.

Yvette Berry, the minister of education for the ACT, is looking for input on a policy modification intended to satisfy [community](http://worldmagzine.com/commodity/), parent, caregiver, and educational stakeholder expectations.

The policy should be flexible enough to accommodate the demands of pupils with varying stages of development and academic preparation. The study will strike a balance between the potential and difficulties brought on by technology.

Additionally, the policy shall take into account school [administration ](https://worldmagzine.com/artificial-intelligence/chinese-firm-baidu-made-its-chatgpt-public/)standards and exclusions. Canberrans are urged to think about one of four options: a total ban, a “put it away” restriction, a combination of grades K-6 and K-10, or a total ban for all students.

The government’s Your Say Conversations website is where Canberrans may provide their input. The consultation is running until October 8 at 11:59 p.m.

Exemptions and school administration rules will also be taken into account by the policy. October 8 at 11:59 p.m., the [consultation ](https://worldmagzine.com/crypto/us-crypto-is-subject-to-new-tax-regulations-law-decoded/)period will close.

1677547,1,2023-09-01,"Metaculus ""pro"" predictors reject Tony Seba and Ray Kurzweil and agree with Robert Gordon! We will be condemned to wander the desert of technological stagnation instead of entering the promised land of the Singularity!",u/AdmiralKurita,singularity,https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1677547/metaculus_pro_predictors_reject_tony_seba_and_ray/,"**Introduction**

I only posted this here because r/futurology doesn't allow one to post images in posts.

I recently found a [collection of questions](https://www.metaculus.com/notebooks/14965/forecasting-our-world-in-data-the-next-100-years/) from Metaculus, a massive prediction aggregation engine, that concerns fundamental indicators of economic and social development throughout the world. The questions solicited estimates where a certain metric would be for the years 2023, 2025, 2032, 2052, and 2122. These questions are featured in the ""Forecasting Our World in Data Tournament"". What interested me is not aggregate predictions of the crowd on the platform, but rather the predictions of those who are designated as ""pros"" who are defined as the top 2 percent of predictors on the platform.

**My Pessimism and Robert Gordon's Outlook**

What interested me and gave me a small sense delectation is that the ""pro"" predictions largely align my with view of the world because they are usually more pessimistic than the mainstream. I was interested in the commercial development of self-driving cars since 2019, but I became crestfallen when I realized that the problem is much harder than I had thought and what the tech-bros presented it to be. I had underestimated the capabilities of deep-learning in being able to discern and make real-time decisions  in complex environment. I then assessed the maturity and viability of other technologies, such as generation iv nuclear reactors, CRISPR used in the clinic, robots used in fruit-harvesting and food preparation, nuclear fusion, graphene and carbon nanotubes, perovskite solar cells, and solid-state batteries. I became further dejected when I realized that most of the aforementioned things are emerging technologies that would take several decades to mature and be commercialized. I am Moses who was denied inhabiting the Promised Land and condemned to wander the desert [because I struck the rock instead of speaking to it](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2020&version=NIV) (because I was born too early to see those mature).

I will assert that technological progress in the 2010s has been less impressive that the computation and telecommunication advancements in the late 90s and early 2000s. I was astounded that I can download Pokémon episodes in 2006 and store them on a 500 mb flash drive. I remember being pleased when finding the Pokémon Showdown website to play live simulated battles (in the OU tier) against real opponents in July 2013, and (the now defunct) Dueling Network in November 2014 \[to play a Qliphort deck\]. I feel that new apps and the Internet in 2023 have not been able to match that utility.

These are not subjective assessments, personal grousing, or fulminating against perceived ennui; I believe that I have been vindicated by the economic historiography of Robert J. Gordon as it concerns technological progress and productivity growth in the United States. For example:

[This expert thinks robots aren't going to destroy many jobs. And that's a problem.](https://www.vox.com/a/new-economy-future/robert-gordon-interview)

[Peak America: Is Our Most Innovative Century Behind Us? A Long-read Q&A with Robert Gordon](https://www.aei.org/pethokoukis/peak-america-is-our-most-innovative-century-behind-us-a-qa-with-robert-gordon/)

[Is U.S. Economic Growth Over? Faltering Innovation Confronts the Six Headwinds  (2012 NBER paper)](https://www.reddit.com/user/AdmiralKurita/draft/155a4fba-4713-11ee-a638-6ade702fe290)

Gordon's thesis is that ""Industrial Revolution 3"" of computers and telecommunications was unable to generate sustained the long-term productivity growth of ""Industrial Revolution 2"" (electricity, internal combustion engine, running water, indoor toilets, communications, entertainment, chemicals, petroleum) whose growth lasted nearly a century from 1891-1972 (Gordon 2012, pg. 13, figure 4). However, ""Industrial Revolution 3"" did manage to produce robust productivity growth for a decade (1996-2004). Gordon (2012, pg. 11) claims that the transition was practically complete by 2005 where cathode ray-tube monitors were being replaced with flat-screens, electronic databases were created and installed, and much of the broadband and telecommunications had been built. I would add that smartphones were fairly mature by 2013. Since it has been 10 years from 2013, mobile computing and ""apps"" already delivered whatever positive effect on productivity it would have, thus we do not need to wait for any lagging effects to manifest.

The forecast of the Metaculus pros seems to corroborate my pessimistic framework. There is no Solow's paradox concerning the anemic growth of the 2010s and 2020s; it is just that smartphones and generative AI are not capable of generating torrid economic and productivity growth.

Hence, unlike what Tony Seba and Ray Kurzweil predict, I doubt that the technological advances would ""make the world new"" (Revelation 21:5) and abolish death and cause the old order of things to pass away (verse 4).

I will assert that one of the few things that will definitively prove me wrong is Robert J. Gordon is [losing his bet](https://longbets.org/868/) with Erik Brynjolfsson that total productivity growth in the US will not exceed 1.8 percent annual from 2020-2029. I will be too pessimistic and wrong about some things, but my major contention is that whatever advances occur would not have a profoundly positive macroeconomic impact in the foreseeable future. So far, [""Private Nonfarm business productivity growth""](https://www.bls.gov/productivity/tables/total-factor-productivity-major-sectors-historical.xlsx) (spreadsheet, row, 28) for 2020, 2021, and 2022 has been -1.2, 4.0, and -1.2, respectively, which multiples to 1.0152, not even sufficient to top the average rate of growth for one year.

**Forecast of the Metaculus Pros**

Why should I have credence in the Metaculus pros?

First, they have a successful track record. One may ask why should people trust the judgments of [scientific experts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPq6zKf7RQQ&ab_channel=KaneB), but an analogous question would be whether one should copy the homework of a top student. I would assume that the pros actually had did their research (or homework) and asked the appropriate questions in order to generate reliable inferences. Most likely they did not uncritically rely on the pronouncements of Ray Kurzweil and Tony Seba.

Second, their judgment largely corroborates my pessimistic framework.

Third, I do not have any special expertise that contravenes their judgments.   

Here are some interesting predictions.

1.

Numbers of chickens slaughtered in the world.  

https://preview.redd.it/7c30jngx3nlb1.jpg?width=1022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a54168fc8bdf49dc85855a2c82b91ebce44e09f

I agree with the 2052 pro-prediction and that cultured meat will not be widely available to affect the consumption of chickens.

I am largely dismissive of the viability of cultured meat because growing cultured meat seems to be far more difficult than [growing blood cells](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-63513330) from hematopoietic stem cells. It is preposterous to think cultured meat will become mainstream this decade or early next decade when there are still blood drives because the technology to produce blood cells at scale does not exist. [Producing blood](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-33270334) is an appropriate analogous process because both involve growing tissues from precursor cells *in vitro* as opposed to deriving the product, meat or blood, from a biological organism. Moreover, in order to have a disruptive effect on medicine or food consumption that it would eliminate the need for donated blood or massively curtail animal slaughter, these products would have to be mass produced.

[This article](https://thecounter.org/lab-grown-cultivated-meat-cost-at-scale/) goes into more depth about the problems of making lab-grown meat into a competitive commercial product. I think lab-grown meat will be like fusion power right now; it would not be a significant part of the world in the next 30 years, similar to how many people had thought many decades ago that fusion power would be viable by now.

2.

 World-wide carbon dioxide emissions. 

https://preview.redd.it/z1y66wcsimlb1.jpg?width=1022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b52bccb58bbac31b15232f7806a4d4f4af5cc9fb

Agree with the pros here for 2025 and 2032. It is interesting the the pro forecasters predict that carbon dioxide emissions would be higher in 2025 than in 2023; moreover, they predict a smaller drop in 2032 vs 2023. I don't think the world has peaked yet for carbon dioxide emissions. Maybe 2026 or 2027. Renewable energy will take longer to roll out than the optimists say so that it can eclipse the growth in demand in China and India and cause a net displacement of fossil fuel power sources.

The renewable energy transition is a slow transition in the 2020s, not a profound disruption!

3.

 Energy consumption per capita in the world per annum. 

https://preview.redd.it/ow1xm8qe4nlb1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6c2acf75f11a55683a795fa10cc2cebb673c08aa

Discrepancies between pros and public for 2025 and 2033 are negligible. 80,000 kwh is the average energy consumption of the US. I think the world energy consumption in 2052 will be higher than the pros. I'll hazard to guess 35,000. Perhaps self-driving cars will increase energy used in travel due to higher volume of miles traveled, but electric vehicles uses less energy per mile. Massive desalination can boost energy consumption. Israel, for instance, uses 3,300 kwh (source, energy consumption per capita for Israel \[[https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/per-capita-energy-use](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/per-capita-energy-use)\] and the statistic that Israel uses 10 percent of its energy on desalination for 20 percent of its water \[[https://www.energymonitor.ai/tech/can-desalination-save-a-drying-world](https://www.energymonitor.ai/tech/can-desalination-save-a-drying-world) \]. For Israel complete desalination would 16,500 kwh.)

4.

Economic productivity per hour of labor in the US (in 2017 US dollars).

https://preview.redd.it/xyfvne100glb1.jpg?width=1020&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3324980d8144cc67f74351f69549dfb47e40f09

The pro forecast rather reflect Robert Gordon's views on productivity growth extended for the next 30 years. 

Let's do some math to understand what the predictors are really predicting.

119.00/77.60 = 1.534

ln(1.534) = 0.428

0.428/30 = 0.0143 or 1.43 percent of growth per year.

Now, the public tournament forecasts double the growth as the pro-forecasters. So...

ln(2) = .7 (I didn't use a calculator, just the [rule of 70](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_72))

.7/30 = .0233

Hence, the public forecasters expect an additional 2.3 percent growth per year for a geometric average of 0.0376. This seems incredible, since it is more than average economic growth of the most recent boom years of 1996-2004.

What can feasible fuel economic growth in the subsequent decades? Surely, advanced robotics and human-level AI can achieve sustained economic growth for decades by fundamentally transforming society in a manner that electricity and indoor plumbing did. 

Another reason for technological optimism is the prospect that renewable energy transition will create a disruptive, new paradigm of abundant and cheaper clean energy that would not only allow us to maintain our current living standards but change our attitudes towards energy from the mindset of scarcity into abundance. For the purpose of the argument, I will assume that the renewable energy transition will occur on a relatively quick time scale in order to interrogate the effect of cheap renewable energy on productivity. Because of the new mindset of abundance, one would need not feel guilty about setting an air conditioner at 68 degrees Fahrenheit because the energy powering it would be cheap and clean. As I mention before, higher energy can allow a higher volume of travel with self-driving cars and extensive desalination. According to the EIA, [energy expenditures constituted 8% of US GDP](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=53620) in the early 2010s. What if that energy was actually free?  We can assume that $0.08 were spent for every dollar invested in productivity. Thus, it would seem that free energy would result in a boost in GDP of 8.7 percent (from the reciprocal of .92). If there is an abundance of renewable energy, it would not significantly contribute to GDP since energy intensive products, such as water to grow lawns in the desert or solo robotaxi rides in a Hummer-like electric vehicle, would be relatively cheap. Abundant cheap energy would certainly have deflationary influence, but that is partially accounted for by measuring hourly productivity in 2017 US dollars. Furthermore, Baumol's cost disease suggests that other items and services would not deflate just because energy became much cheaper, since productivity improves from some technology may not be able affect productivity in other activities. A teacher, for instance, cannot teach more students effectively just because faster CPUs and advanced telecommunication technology exists.  

5. 

FLOPS of the most powerful supercomputer

https://preview.redd.it/toi0ggki6nlb1.jpg?width=1014&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee7e0e83beabad1c0b7c33327f2d06af68447000

Lastly, I will provide a reason for optimism as the pro-forecasts agree that the world's fastest supercomputer would be exponentially faster in 2052, as oppose to prediction catastrophic stagnation due to an anticipate secession of Moore's law. Both groups predict supercomputers to be more than one million times faster that the fastest supercomputer in 2023. As for 2023, the appropriate prefix for 10^(18)  scale computing is ""exa-"".

I think most scientific realists would acknowledge that atoms exist and have finite size as opposed to being infinitely divisible. Hence, transistors can no longer shrink further if they become a few atoms in width. Hopefully, Moore's law would continue on for several more decades if the computational substrate changes from the current silicon metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) to transitional metal dichalcogenides or carbon nanotubes. (See the slide from TSMC [here](https://www.anandtech.com/show/18873/tsmc-we-have-working-cfets-in-the-lab-but-they-are-generations-away).) The recent maturation of extreme ultraviolet lithography would enable Moore's law to continue on for perhaps another decade more.

I don't know if FLOPS specifically refers to FP32 or it can be FP16.

**Conclusion**

Going down the rabbit of futurism has ruined me. I see little to be optimistic about, but I do mainly myself for not thinking critically about the viability to artificial intelligence, generation iv reactors, and self-driving cars. It had left me broken because the false hope had been shattered. I regret that I am so deep down this rabbit hole that it hinders me from doing things that I enjoy such as playing Goat Format. My valedictory remarks will derive from the late coach Mike Leach:

\*\*\*\* you, f\*\*\* me, and f\*\*\* everybody. That is fucking b\*\*\*\*\*\*t. ([3:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZaOFTp5_C8&t=268s&ab_channel=AdamJacobi))

Introns:

ChatGPT and ""generative AI"" are particularly infuriating to me, since it seems like a pathetic picayune tchotchke compared to things that I enumerated. Generative AI seems like a pathetic consolation prize that I don't think will have a significant macroeconomic impact.  It cannot even perform a mundane task such as pick a ripe strawberry! As Paul of Pokemon would say, ""[pathetic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUyHk-CxgNY&ab_channel=rantoxdp54)"". I became infuriated that the video ""[Humans Need Not Apply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU&ab_channel=CGPGrey)"" when it said in August 2014 that ""self-driving cars aren't the future; they're here and they work"" and ""it is easy to see them being better than humans because they are already are"". So it is not an emerging technology that will mature in some indeterminate point the future, but ready to hit the road right now.

I see technology progress and emerging technology to be similar to drug development where nothing is ""real"" until it has received an FDA approval. Mechanism of action doesn't really matter since molecular biology is an inscrutable enigma; what matters is to refute the null hypothesis that a pharmaceutical candidate has the same efficacy to a placebo or current standard of treatment. Large clinical (and expensive) trials that have enough statistical power to demonstrate a statistical significant  (but often marginal) benefit are the only way to refute null hypothesis. Due to the low success rate in getting a drug that has enter phase I to a full approval, clinical trials are Boulevard of Broken Dreams. [Eroom's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eroom%27s_law) is a microcosm of all emerging technology.

The only pleasant surprises during the last decade [was profound growth in utility solar power in California from 2012-2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_in_California#Generation), but that  actually hit an (actual) inflection point in 2018 (where the second derivative of the trend turned negative). It may start to accelerate again in California (and elsewhere). Lithium-ion batteries have also fallen substantially, but not enough for electric vehicles to become majority options right now. I outlined other significant gains in the 2010s that I consider ""significant"" [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/139qthg/comment/jm1vco8/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

I became sympathetic with redditor u/phoenix5869 because, while he significantly younger than me, shares a similarly assessment of technological progress:

167r6lx,1,2023-09-01,NYT: Ban or Embrace? Colleges Wrestle With A.I.-Generated Admissions Essays.,u/lotsaramen,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/167r6lx/nyt_ban_or_embrace_colleges_wrestle_with/,"[https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/01/business/college-admissions-essay-ai-chatbots.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/01/business/college-admissions-essay-ai-chatbots.html)

Rick Clark, the executive director of undergraduate admission at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and his staff spent weeks this summer pretending to be high school students using A.I. chatbots to fill out college applications.  
  
The admissions officers each took on a different high school persona: swim team captain, Eagle Scout, musical theater performer. Then they fed personal details about the fictional students into ChatGPT, prompting the A.I. chatbot to produce the kind of extracurricular activity lists and personal essays commonly required on college applications.  
  
Mr. Clark said he wanted to get a handle on how A.I. chatbots might reshape the admissions process this fall — the start of the first full academic year that the tools will be widely available to high school seniors — and come up with guidance for students applying to Georgia Tech.  
  
“Students on some level are going to have access to and use A.I.,” Mr. Clark said. “The big question is: How do we want to direct them, knowing that it’s out there and available to them?”  
  
The easy availability of A.I. chatbots like ChatGPT, which can manufacture humanlike text in response to short prompts, is poised to upend the traditional undergraduate application process at selective colleges — ushering in an era of automated plagiarism or of democratized student access to essay-writing help. Or maybe both.  
  
The digital disruption comes at a turning point for institutions of higher education across the United States. After the Supreme Court ruled in June that race-based university admissions programs were illegal, some selective universities and colleges had hoped to rely more on essay questions — about applicants’ upbringing, identities and communities — to help foster diversity on campus.

167uqru,1,2023-09-02,"computer science, manga green tea boba(70% sugar no ice!), getting a job",u/smallgoodbunny,UofT,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/167uqru/computer_science_manga_green_tea_boba70_sugar_no/,"computer science, manga green tea boba(70% sugar no ice!), getting a job

graduated two years ago, currently working at a small startup(<10) based in nyc. ill flex while giving some advice for those that just graduated or are thinking of jobs, the post will probably be most relevant for cs job seekers, but i encourage everyone to shoot for the stars. im writing this cause reddit has been a great source of info for me in the past

some context: when i first graduated i didn't have anything lined up and hadn't started applying at all... this was 2021. in approximately 3 days, i sent out 1000 applications, 2 tabs switch between the two while other app is loading, use chrome profile fills, wrote no cover letters for any app, got a 30% initial reply back rate, primarily US companies, some in canada, a little china, europe. afterwards, the number of applications still left in the running got dwindled down to 4 offers.

you can think of it roughly as a halving factor, for each one of the factors in here, number of applications left in the running gets halved. location: location not fit, team already filled, no response back, <60k pay, email response interested but no space(pretty much same as already filled), work visa/sponsorship issues, actual interview process: 1. phone interview 2. initial screening(non technical vid call) 3. technical call(usually with one of the team members) 4. final stage- either take home project with deadline(usually startups) or onsite interview(got flown with decent hotels to florida, new york, toronto). id say starting with a baseline of 10 for example, id fail 2 on stage 1, 4 on stage 2, 2 on stage 3, and 2 on final stage.

major: econ and philosophy how'd you learn to code: boredom does wonders pre-college

GPA: 3.88, overall 90 average, would probably be 95 if it wasn't for two bs elective courses that i got 75s on

what i applied to: when i first graduated, i sent out 1000 apps, 500 of which probably i didn't even want and weren't good fit. i applied to software engineering, quant trading, venture capital research internships and full times.

role: quantitative finance engineer what i do: write rust on backend, use javascript and python to write trading strategies with onchain DEFI liquidity. currently getting pimped out at a partner market maker to write some integration scripts for them with our product

work experience: half a year after graduating no job(did some algorithmic trading myself - not profitable and realized true industry knowledge especially in trading is always gatekeeped, half a year internship hybrid at bigtech, 1 year in startup till now(current)

now how to apply- now this is the DISTILLED experience that will truly save you approx 100 hours and months of applying, getting rejected: -

still a numbers game, but make sure you know what you want. i.e. stable 80-140k+liquid sign on bonus+equity salary doing a niche thing working approx 6 hours, go for bigtech software engineer position. large range 60-180k salary+ illiquid equity, chaotic, no processes, low iteration high output environment, go to a startup. generally, big tech pays much better, else for the small elite startups and quant trading firms(best position a grad can possibly get into straight from grad, 200-400k salaries).

\- aim for long term goals. there's two parts to this: 1. aim for long term 2. have long terms goals. what aiming for long term means is if you have two offers with 30k difference, but the first offer you'll be learning much more, doing much more interesting work, ALWAYS prioritize that. now of course, then the question becomes how long term should you aim and at where does the comp diff sway decisions, and to that i'd say it's personal preference, personally i have high standards and am willing to take a lower paying job in exchange for learning much more and subsequently being able to produce much more, earn disproportionately more later down in life. what having long term goals means again knowing your goals. for me its earning much more in a snowball effect under the absolute condition that i find the work interesting first. for you it might be earning enough to retire at age <30. im gonna assume your all high achievers and nerds cause why else would you be on reddit

\- when you apply, apply with two tabs in a numbers fashion, know the following and apply only to the ones that fit these: you'd absolutely accept if you got an offer, min salary, you like the work you'd be doing based on the job description. don't read everything, just skim in under 20 secs per job

\- where to apply: don't bother with any other sites other than these, i've tried them all. while im not discounting other ones are legit, these are by FAR the best apply to hearing back ratio: linkedin, wellfound(formerly angellist), individual company sites, levels.fyi. linkedin- best if you have some top notch work experience, its like dating profiles, disproportionately skewed to top players, you'll get loads of spam, but only when ur good... enough. indeed- a few good ones, generally lower tier, still great, but not top(example: yall will never see goldman sachs be shilling their quant roles on indeed cause they don't need to). wellfound, use applies wisely(your capped at a limit), best for startups. company website- search {company name} {jobs apply {place} } in google, best option overall. generally what you want to do is go through [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi/) and apply to all of the ones through company website

\- myth: 90% of jobs require connections. its the exact opposite, 90% of all good jobs in tech are apply only, this is because companies want best talent, and best way to do that is to cast widest net, hence the apply on company website. the way i'd apply nowadays is more like just reaching out to interesting market makers i have connections with, and setting up a 1-3 hour call directly, but thats only because they KNOW my work and where i workED. but for fresh grads, just apply with numbers, don't get emotional. i've once bulk deleted approx 50 rejections without even clicking into them as i could tell from the email header.

\- don't write cover letters, if company requires to submit, use chatgpt. a luxury i didn't have when doing technical vid interviews and onsite interviews in 2021:/ but if i were you and you were applying rn... you already know, 30 second cover letters

\- make damn sure your resume only contains relevant, technical, concise, well formatted work related things. unless its something like cs club exec, ux design project for example. use same one for all jobs, don't bother changing, just focus on numbers, and make sure its well polished. order of importance: work experience, projects, relevant technical courses, school activities - must have: portfolio with technical examples. even better is open source contributions.

\- bonus: this is a tip more so specifically for cs students, the only course that matters is data structures and algorithms for salary, keep in mind there are always exceptions, these are general ranges i pulled from the combination of my ass and the salary ranges i've seen after applying to hundreds of jobs in software engineering.

i can't afford a cup of mango green tea boba thats like $8 nowadays in any big city

literally giving yall assymetric information advantage rn"

### [Emerging AI Innovations: OpenAI's ChatGPT enters classrooms](https://openai.com/blog/teaching-with-ai)

OpenAI has released a guide for teachers using ChatGPT in their classroom. This guide includes suggested prompts, explanations about ChatGPT's functionality and limitations, as well as insights into AI detectors and bias.

The company also highlights stories of educators successfully using ChatGPT to enhance student learning and provides prompts to help teachers get started. Additionally, their FAQ section offers further resources and answers to common questions about teaching with and about AI.

***Why does this matter?***

OpenAI’s teaching with AI empowers teachers with resources and insights to effectively use ChatGPT in classrooms, benefiting students' learning experiences. While Competitors like Bard, Bing, and Claude may face pressure to offer similar comprehensive guidance to educators. Failing to do so could put them at a disadvantage in the increasingly competitive AI education market.



### Emerging AI Innovations: How teachers are using ChatGPT



#### Role playing challenging conversations



Dr. Helen Crompton, Professor of Instructional Technology at Old Dominion University, encourages her education graduate students to use ChatGPT as a stand-in for a particular persona—like a debate partner who will point out weaknesses in their arguments, a recruiter who’s interviewing them for a job, or a new boss who might deliver feedback in a specific way. She says exploring information in a conversational setting helps students understand their material with added nuance and new perspective.



#### Building quizzes, tests, and lesson plans from curriculum materials



Fran Bellas, a professor at Universidade da Coruña in Spain, recommends teachers use ChatGPT as an assistant in crafting quizzes, exams and lesson plans for classes. He says to first share the curriculum to ChatGPT and then ask for things like fresh quiz and lesson plan ideas that use modern or culturally relevant examples. Bellas also turns to ChatGPT to help teachers make sure questions they write themselves are inclusive and accessible for the students’ learning level. “If you go to ChatGPT and ask it to create 5 question exams about electric circuits, the results are very fresh. You can take these ideas and make them your own.”



#### Reducing friction for non-English speakers



Dr. Anthony Kaziboni, the Head of Research at the University of Johannesburg, teaches students who mostly don’t speak English outside of the classroom. Kaziboni believes that command of English is a tremendous advantage in the academic world, and that misunderstandings of even small details of English grammar can hold back students from recognition and opportunity. He encourages his students to use ChatGPT for translation assistance, to improve their English writing, and to practice conversation.



#### Teaching students about critical thinking



Geetha Venugopal, a high school computer science teacher at the American International School in Chennai, India, likens teaching students about AI tools to teaching students how to use the internet responsibly. In her classroom, she advises students to remember that the answers that ChatGPT gives may not be credible and accurate all the time, and to think critically about whether they should trust the answer, and then confirm the information through other primary resources. The goal is to help them “understand the importance of constantly working on their original critical thinking, problem solving and creativity skills.”

#### Example prompts to get you started

Ethan Mollick and Lilach Mollick, both at Wharton Interactive, have been trying techniques like those above for much of the last year. These are some of their prompts educators can use to get started. Simply copy and paste the prompts below into ChatGPT to test drive them.

As you employ these prompts, it’s important to remember a few things:

&#x200B;

* The model may not always produce correct information. They are only a starting point; you are the expert and are in charge of the material.
* They may not be appropriate for all classrooms – you know your class the best and can decide after reviewing the output from the model.

These prompts are only suggestions. Feel free to change any prompts and tell the AI what you want to see.

# Come up with lesson plans

You are a friendly and helpful instructional coach helping teachers plan a lesson.

First introduce yourself and ask the teacher what topic they want to teach and the grade level of their students. Wait for the teacher to respond. Do not move on until the teacher responds.

Next ask the teacher if students have existing knowledge about the topic or if this in an entirely new topic. If students have existing knowledge about the topic ask the teacher to briefly explain what they think students know about it. Wait for the teacher to respond. Do not respond for the teacher.

Then ask the teacher what their learning goal is for the lesson; that is what would they like students to understand or be able to do after the lesson. Wait for a response.

Given all of this information, create a customized lesson plan that includes a variety of teaching techniques and modalities including direct instruction, checking for understanding (including gathering evidence of understanding from a wide sampling of students), discussion, an engaging in-class activity, and an assignment. Explain why you are specifically choosing each.

Ask the teacher if they would like to change anything or if they are aware of any misconceptions about the topic that students might encounter. Wait for a response.

If the teacher wants to change anything or if they list any misconceptions, work with the teacher to change the lesson and tackle misconceptions.

Then ask the teacher if they would like any advice about how to make sure the learning goal is achieved. Wait for a response.

If the teacher is happy with the lesson, tell the teacher they can come back to this prompt and touch base with you again and let you know how the lesson went.

### [With a 155 IQ, GPT-4 is smart enough. Gemini must reduce hallucinations from about 10% to 5% or less.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/167sb6r/with_a_155_iq_gpt4_is_smart_enough_gemini_must/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Google's Gemini AI promises many advanced features. It would be great, for example, if it could score 160 or 170 on an IQ test. But much more important than that for establishing AI dominance against ChatGPT and the other models is for it to have a much lower hallucination rate.

Getting one out of every 10 facts wrong is a major limitation to today's generative AIs. If Gemini can lower the hallucination rate to below 5% it will prove itself far more powerful in real world applications than the other models.

Because AIs are already much more intelligent than average humans, the holy grail in AI development is to make them much less likely to make up content. More than anything else, Google's dominance in AI will depend on it solving that problem. With Gemini set for release before the new year, we won't have to wait very long to find out how well Google has done.

### [Emerging AI Innovations: Could AI be the game-changer in tackling the opioid epidemic?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/167opkc/could_ai_be_the_gamechanger_in_tackling_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

The stubborn and complex opioid epidemic may finally meet its match—AI. As the crisis continues taking a fearsome toll, experts are turning to advanced technology in their ongoing battle.

**AI’s evolving role in tackling the opioid crisis**

&#x200B;

* With a legacy of over 1 million overdose deaths since 1999, the opioid crisis has stubbornly resisted traditional preventive and regulatory measures. The latest AI-fueled developments offer newfound hope.  
 
* Groundbreaking AI innovations are focusing on identifying individuals at potential risk, monitoring treatment progress, and predicting relapse probabilities. Decoding social media behavior offers an effective outlet for early intervention.  
 
* More radically, AI-enabled wearable devices are being developed to detect overdose symptoms and automatically deliver lifesaving treatment.  
 

**AI: A double-edged sword?**

&#x200B;

* Despite its promising potential, AI application in this sphere also raises concerns around privacy rights and misinformation. Facial recognition technology could lead to discrimination, while the risk of false data being fed into chatbots causing harm cannot be undermined.  
 
* Trust in AI and its appropriate deployment will be crucial to ensuring its positive contribution rather than being a dystopian threat.  
 

### [Google AI Introduces WeatherBench 2: A Machine Learning Framework for Evaluating and Comparing Various Weather Forecasting Models](https://www.marktechpost.com/2023/09/01/google-ai-introduces-weatherbench-2-a-machine-learning-framework-for-evaluating-and-comparing-various-weather-forecasting-models/)

 

Machine learning (ML) has been used increasingly in weather forecasting in recent years. Now that ML models can compete with operational physics-based models in terms of accuracy, there is hope that this progress may soon make it possible to enhance the precision of weather forecasts around the world. Open and reproducible evaluations of novel methods using objective and established metrics are crucial to achieving this goal.

Recent research by Google, Deepmind, and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts presents WeatherBench 2, a benchmarking and comparison framework for weather prediction models. In addition to a thorough replica of the ERA5 dataset used for training most ML models, WeatherBench 2 features an open-source evaluation code and publicly available, cloud-optimized ground-truth and baseline datasets.

&#x200B;

Currently, WeatherBench 2 is optimized for global, medium-range (1-15 day) forecasting. The researchers plan to look at incorporating evaluation and baselines for more jobs, such as nowcasting and short-term (0-24 hour) and long-term (15+ day) prediction, in the near future.

The accuracy of weather predictions is difficult to evaluate with a simple score. The average temperature may be more important to one user than the frequency and severity of wind gusts. Because of this, WeatherBench 2 includes numerous measures. Several important criteria, or “headline” metrics, were defined to summarize the study in a way consistent with the standard assessment performed by meteorological agencies and the World Meteorological Organization.

### [AI](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02714-2) System Can Predict Chemical Smells Based on Molecular Structures

A new study cites the creation of an AI system that can predict how a specific compound will smell by analyzing its molecular structure.

**Why is this significant?**

&#x200B;

* The AI system, developed by researchers at startup Osmo, can utilize **55 descriptive words** to assign a smell or 'aroma' to a chemical compound or 'odorant'.  
 
* This breakthrough might be utilized to **enhance the food and cleaning product industries** where synthetic scents play an essential role.  
 

**What’s next for this AI system?**

&#x200B;

* The AI's predictions often aligned closer with **human consensus** than any individual guess, indicating its robustness and potential.  
 
* **The next step** for this research is to comprehend how different odorants mix and compete to yield a smell that the human brain identifies as unique.  
 
* However, the sheer number of combinations, even with a small set of odorants, poses a daunting task. To quote Stuart Firestein, a neurobiologist at Columbia University, “Predicting what a mix smells like is the next frontier.”

16821nl,1,2023-09-02,Anki Guide,u/55736f70706572,JEENEETards,https://www.reddit.com/r/JEENEETards/comments/16821nl/anki_guide/,"# Q. What is Anki?

Anki is a popular and highly effective open-source flashcard software program designed to help users learn and remember information more efficiently. It uses a spaced repetition algorithm to optimize the timing of reviewing flashcards, making it a powerful tool for learning and retaining a wide range of knowledge, from languages and scientific facts to historical dates and more. Anki is particularly popular among students, language learners, and individuals seeking to memorize and retain information effectively/ It's available for multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android. ~~Thanks ChatGPT.~~ Did I mention it is **FREE** (not on iOS though)?

# Q. Why Anki?

Spaced memorization is an extremely powerful tool for memorization and flashcards are a convenient medium for the same. If you want to know more, this interactive website is awesome [https://ncase.me/remember/](https://ncase.me/remember/)!

# Q. How to Anki?

Anki is not your average app. It is not easy to get the hang of it right away. There is a slight learning curve at the start, and then it depends on how much further you want to enhance Anki via customization, statistics, etc. all of which are possible through the versatility of open-source. To get started,

* If you are a manual guy, [https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/](https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/)
* If you are an article guy, [https://leananki.com/how-to-use-anki-tutorial/](https://leananki.com/how-to-use-anki-tutorial/)
* Or if you are a YouTube guy like me, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmPx333n5UQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmPx333n5UQ).

Aside from these, I have some personal suggestions on how to use Anki efficiently and not waste a lot of time.

1. Use community decks [https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks) (more on this later). Don't make your own cards, unless you really have to. Many say that you should make your own cards, as it helps you to remember it better. I partially disagree, the main power of Anki comes from spaced repetition. If you really want to learn by actively making cards, good ol' pen and paper is a better way. Additionally, it is a huge time investment to make your own cards.
2. Trust the system, and avoid changing intervals. If a flashcard is set to be reviewed after 2 months, don't try to juke the algorithm and learn it after a week. Not only are you gonna decrease your review burden later on, but also retain it much better. This sounds counter-intuitive, but the algorithm has already got everything figured out.
3. Use all the four reviewing options—""Again"", ""Hard"", ""Good"", and ""Easy"". Some people only use the first and the last option, which is not optimal for the algorithm in my humble opinion.
4. Edit cards whenever you feel it's required. Not only is it much less demanding than making your own cards, but you will also gain the benefit of adding your own insight/information to that card. Try to keep everything as short as possible, which reminds me of my next point.
5. Don't. Make. Things. Long. Anki is not for reading, and it ought not to be used as such. छोटा पैकेट बड़ा धमाका |
6. Learn LaTeX. It's easy. Useful for mathematical formulas.

# Q. When to Anki?

Ideally, there should be sufficient time before your next major exam. If you are completely new to Anki, I suggest to not use it for JEE Mains 1st attempt, but you can get started if you have some free time and your preparation is going well.

# Q. Who uses Anki?

AIR 1. No, not me. Chirag Falor and a few of his friends. Other than them, I only know about one guy who had a rank under 1700, he used Anki extensively. I use it as well, helped me memorize the entire periodic table for the second time. It's power is really apparent to me, because back then (2019) it took me much more effort to memorize the PT without Anki and it was quite sloppy compared to now. There may be many out there who have used it though. Even more when you look outside the JEE space, it is especially popular among medical students.

I know its not a crazy 528, but its good enough for me and was a lot of effort. I'm a psych major and never took a single physics, bio, biochem, or orgo course. I only ever took introductory chemistry and the rest were psych courses. I'm going to be completely transparent with what I did the first go around, why it didn't work for me, and what I did the second go around! I'll also say this worked for me, it might not work for you, but if you work your butt off anyone can achieve this score. Finally, getting higher than 514 I truly believe is luck.

**Rewrite**

Okay so I'll preface this with what I purchased. I bought the 3 months of UPangea, all the AAMC stuff, the ANKI app and that's it. I did not use any of the textbooks from my original attempt. I got the Kaplan textbooks for free online at one of the many online websites you can get free textbooks. (PM me if you don't know). 

In total this attempt cost me roughly $600 in practice materials. $300 UPangea+$289 for AAMC materials+$25 for ANKI + fee to write. You have to consider the $600 as the fee to write unfortunately. The practice is important.

This time around I also worked in a restaurant two shifts a week (about 18 hours a week) plus volunteered twice a week (about 10 hours a week), I did stop doing a separate volunteer position twice a week to free up some additional time to study. I would pick up shifts here and there for extra money and to take breaks from studying!

I studied for a total of 5 months. It was too long. I think if I wrote a couple weeks earlier I would've gotten maybe 2 points higher, but hindsight is 20/20. I think for the average nontrad, four months is perfect. You need to stay committed to studying, but longer than four months you'll start to lose knowledge cause you've been holding onto so much new information for so long. Over the four months I've also lost friends. I missed wedding celebrations of family of close friends, I've missed close friends birthday parties and so much more, but the true friends stuck by me and kept following up, the fake ones stopped answering texts/calls and stopped reaching out. Being in a relationship any free time I spent on my gf. I will say in times I NEEDED to be there for someone I was. But for celebrations I unfortunately had to say I was busy. 

For the first month I read through the Kaplan textbooks. These are WAY better than the TPR textbooks for nontrads cause they explain everything much more simply. I read through all of them, no notes, no memorization and I just wanted to see if there were any concepts I didn't understand. This is when I learned what exactly is the active site of an enzyme. I didn't care to memorize all the details about it, I just wanted to learn what it is. Realistically, this was likely a waste of time since this could have been done with the anki deck I used instead.

The second month I did Anki, while finishing up the last couple of chapters of the Kaplan books. I did 50 new cards a day until the chapter were done, and then I did 100 new cards a day. If they were all simple I would add an extra 50 cards and do those. **If nothing else from this guide, please use the AnKing ANKI deck**. Its an updated Milesdown deck. Has all the information you need to know at the exact depth level you need to know it. It is the reason use see the jump from 503 to 513. Heres the link [https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/comments/swjqzh/anking\_overhaul\_step\_1step\_2\_version\_11\_update/](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/comments/swjqzh/anking_overhaul_step_1step_2_version_11_update/)

After the Anki deck was done and I had no new cards left I started practice. I did about 100 UPangea questions a day. If I got something wrong I made a new Anki card and reviewed them that night. Every Friday, I would redo all the wrong questions I got until I got them right. This took me a LONG time and so I only did 53% of UPangea. During this time every other day, or when it was slow at work/volunteering I would do the Anki cards that needed to be reviewed.

About a month and half out I stopped UPangea and started AAMC. I finished 100% of AAMC 2 days before my test. During this time I stopped Anki. Please learn from my mistake and keep up with Anki. I honestly was burnt out this last month and that's why you see me stagnate around 513.

All that said, I believe once you reach the 512 point, its becomes luck if you get higher or lower. When I got the 516 it felt exactly the same as when I got the 512. I only got 6 more questions right on the 516 then on the 512. So I got lucky on a couple educated guesses. Basically I found between FLs the subsections scores would be + or - 2 points, but always around 128. Sometimes I would get 130, sometimes 126. I found this to be especially true in CARS. Once you get to 127, basically every 2 questions is a point. If you guess right on 2 you get a 128, 2 more 129. At 129, its literally one question. I got a 132 on one of the FLs for CARS, I got 2 questions wrong, but it felt the exact same as all the other FLs. All I'm trying to say here is no one will admit it, but at the top scores it comes down to luck. On test day, my C/P section I got super unlucky with very heavy orgo content and in depth general chem questions. If I got more physics questions I would have probably gotten a 128 cause everyone said it was physics heavy so that's what I focused on. Its luck. At the top end so just try and be the most well rounded in all topics and you should be fine. 

Also, since I expect a handful of CARS questions there isn't a magical formula. As a Canadian I focused HEAVY on CARS my first go around. I went from a 122 to 127 on my first attempt to 128 this go around. The number one thing is find what works for you! I tried a million different approaches but what worked for me was questions first, then text, then answer in my head the question, then find the most similar option. I saw a post saying NEVER READ QUESTIONS FIRST so I stopped reading questions first. I went right back down to a 124. Do what works for you for CARS. What you have to do is learn how you understand what you read. And if you get to a 127 pray that you get lucky!

Finally, use chatGPT. It really is a godsend for explaining concepts. Just type ""explain to a five year old"" whatever you need explained. You can ever copy and paste passages into it and ask explain why this is the answer in simple terms. Be careful though because sometimes it will spit out bad information. So double check what it says. 

**What went wrong on the Original Attempt**

So for my original attempt, having decided to go into med late (my last year of undergrad) I had no idea what getting into med entailed. So I went to a TPR and Prep101 talk about the MCAT and medical school. I got a lot of information and looked into the MCAT, and came across a bunch of articles stating if you don't have the prerequisites you should take a prep course. So that's exactly what I did. I paid for the TPR 513+ guarantee or your money back (about $3600) and literally it would have been more useful to just burn the money for warmth. The lecturers sucked. They would read off a script, and would talk about stuff as if you already knew the info. I remember hearing about competitive inhibitors for the first time and the lecturer was talking about it as if it was common knowledge. And maybe it is common knowledge to premed, but I paid for this course because I wasn't a premed and needed these topics explained in depth. I also would ask clarifying questions and would be told ""Its cause thats what they do/ cause thats the answer"". It was frustrating and I thought I was the issue. They also used a TPR practice exam to gauge your original score, which they made EXTREMELY difficult, and then compare it to your actual score which is easier, and say hey we got you an 22 point jump, but that's just because my original score I got like 12 questions right on the entire test. Finally, there was a bunch of hoops to get the money back and I went trough all of them and was told ""no best we an do is continue your access to the online materials for another year."" Also it was so unpersonalized. I didn't need to sit through the 40 hours of psych content, I knew everything to know about psych content, I would've preffered time spent on bio/physics/chem.

TL:DR don't use prep companys. I didn't my second time around and did WAY better.

What I tried to do on top of the prep company was read the textbook constantly. It's what worked for me in undergrad so I thought it would for MCAT. The issue is I would read it but the MCAT is an application test, so I wouldn't practice it. So when a question came up about a topic I wouldn't know how to apply it, or because I didn't apply it I couldn't recall the information about the topic. For example, keeping with competitive inhibitors, I would push the x-intercept more left when it should go more right. Simple mistakes due to lack of content.

I barely used UPangea. I think in total I did about 400 questions. Yes I did a lot more of TPR stuff but UPangea really is the god of practice questions.

Finally, I didn't use AAMC materials. I instead used all of the TPR stuff because I wanted to ensure I would get my money back if I didn't get the score I wanted. If nothing else, spend the money on the AAMC materials. 

In total, the attempt probably cost me around $5500 CDN, if not more. I don't like to think about how much money I wasted on this attempt cause I thought if I pay for this stuff and do the bare minimum I'll be fine. Thats what I did in undergrad and got a decent cGPA (3.86), why would I need to change anything. As you can see from the test scores, I didn't retain any of the information. I got a 512 which is right around my FL average. 

So what went wrong is

1.  I didn't take it seriously. You need to commit to this exam 3 months in advance. And study for it as if your writing in a week the entire 3 months. If you do that, you'll get a good score. 
2. There are checklists to getting a good score. The only checklist item should be work hard and commit to studying.
3. Find you own weaknesses and work towards them. As non-trads its most likely that your issue is content. It wasn't until I was getting 90% of the free standing questions right that I realized I know my content, now focus on the understanding of questions/passages.

And that's really all I can think of. If you made it this far thanks for reading and I hope it helped a little bit and you saved some money. If you have questions ask here or send a pm. I'll answer ASAP!

168h745,1,2023-09-02,ChatGPT's suggestion on how to become Quant Dev,u/Decent-Cover567,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/168h745/chatgpts_suggestion_on_how_to_become_quant_dev/,"Hi, I'm an engineering student who wants to land on quantitative developer role in future. I've asked ChatGPT what are the skills I need to study, and here's the list it has given. What do you think? Is there any skill that needs to be added to or omitted from that list?

 

Landing a job as a quantitative developer requires a combination of strong mathematical skills, programming expertise, financial knowledge, and often domain-specific insights. Here's a detailed breakdown of the knowledge and skills often required for such positions:

1. **Educational Background**:  


* A bachelor's, master's, or PhD in a quantitative field such as mathematics, physics, engineering, computer science, finance, or econometrics. Many firms place a premium on advanced degrees.

1. **Programming Skills**:

1. **Software & Tools**:  


* **Databases**: SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server) and NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB).
* **Big Data Tools**: Hadoop, Spark.
* **Quant Libraries**: Such as QuantLib, which is used for financial instrument pricing and risk management.

1. **Domain-Specific Knowledge**:  


* Depending on the firm or specific role, you might need to dive deep into specific asset classes (e.g., equities, fixed income, commodities) or trading strategies (e.g., high-frequency trading, statistical arbitrage).

1. **Soft Skills**:  


* **Problem Solving**: Ability to approach and break down complex problems.
* **Communication**: Ability to convey complex quantitative ideas to non-technical stakeholders.
* **Teamwork**: Often, quant developers work in teams and must collaborate with quants, traders, and other developers.

Since a lot of you are about to take your year-end exams soon, here are some tips that you can keep in mind when revising for your Paper 1!

I have been a GP private tutor for many years, and these tips have been incredibly helpful for improving my students' performance for Paper 1, so hopefully you would find them useful too!

# Essay structure: 

* Generally, I suggest adopting the following essay structure: 

>Supporting  
>  
>Counterargument  
>  
>Rebuttal  
>  
>Supporting

I recommend this structure because it allows you to start and end your essay with strong arguments that convince the reader of your stance. The counterargument + rebuttal pair in the middle is then useful in adding nuance and complexity to your argument. Depending on the depth of your arguments, you can have more supporting paragraphs if needed, though the quality of your paragraphs is *always* more important than the quantity of them. 

&#x200B;

* Regardless of your structure, ensure that the direction of your essay is clear throughout.

1. Stick to the same stance from start to finish. 
2. Use appropriate connectors (eg critics may argue) to make clear how each paragraph contributes to your essay. 

# Topic sentences

A clear and effective topic sentence is one that: 

1. Directly addresses the question, and 
2. Gives the reader a good idea of what you are going to discuss in your paragraph. 

To achieve this, I recommend that each of your topic sentences contain the following three components: 

1. Topic -- paraphrase of the question // link back to the question. 
2. Cause -- your main point of the paragraph.
3. Effect -- the intermediate step between the Cause and the Topic. 

For example, in response to the essay question *To what extent does social media pose a challenge to governance?*, a topic sentence could be 

>Social media poses a challenge to governance **\[topic\]** because it can be used to rally together dissenters who wish to challenge the government’s authority **\[cause\]**, making it difficult for the government to garner enough popular support to successfully implement its policies **\[effect\]**. 

Having these three elements allows your topic sentence to act as a skeleton of your paragraph, which is helpful not only for your reader to understand your argument, but also for you to have a clear idea of what logical links you need to make in your explanation/evaluation. 

Of course, as you become more proficient in essay writing, you can switch these elements around, or increase the complexity of your topic sentence by having multiple Effects. 

# Explanation/evaluation

Simply put, your explanation/evaluation is what leads you from your Cause, to your Effect, and finally back to the Topic (i.e. the essay question). It is also how you link your examples/evidence to your main argument. 

We can see the explanation/evaluation of your paragraph as a logical chain from A --> B --> C --> D. 

The main problem most students face with their explanation/evaluation is logical gaps in their argument. Take a look at this passage written by one of my students: 

>As explained in an article published by the New York Times, researchers prompted the ChatGPT AI chatbot to write in the voice of disinformation spreaders such as Alex Jones and Joseph Mercola. The responses did not disprove the claims of these disinformation spreaders but instead framed them as truths.  
>  
>Therefore, AI chatbots have the ability to bolster the false claims of existing disinformation spreaders as well as exacerbate the spread of fake news websites and articles, creating even more confusion amongst news readers in identifying reliable news sources.

The most glaring logical gap in this passage is the missing link between 'The responses did not disprove the claims of these disinformation spreaders but instead framed them as truths', and 'exacerbate the spread of fake news websites and articles'. Just because AI chatbots parrot disinformation rather than correct it, does not necessarily/immediately lead to fake news spreading more widely/rapidly. There is the unexplained assumption that these AI chatbots that parrot disinformation are used in the generation of fake news articles or posts. 

Logical gaps like this greatly weaken your argument, as it leaves the reader with a lot of doubt about how you actually arrived at your main point. 

If your paragraphs often contain logical gaps, this is what you can do: 

1. When writing essay outlines, rather than writing your explanation/evaluation in paragraph form, write it either as a logical chain (A --> B --> C --> D) or in point form, with one premise in each point. 
2. After finishing your paragraph, read your explanation, and ask yourself: *Does A necessarily/immediately lead to B? Is there a missing link between A and B that I need to explain further?*
3. If you have friends and teachers who are willing to assess your work, you can ask them to check whether the logical links you have made are sufficiently explained or make sense. It is usually easier to spot logical gaps in someone else's writing (especially if you don't agree with their argument) than in your own!

# Evidence/examples

Even though you cannot do without evidence/examples in your essay, they are not the key to doing well for Paper 1; having a strong, cogent argument is. Therefore, you should not spend too much time cramming years' worth of current affairs into your head right before your exam. Instead, adopt these strategies to make full use of the knowledge that you already have: 

* When deciding which examples to memorise, choose ones that are more versatile (i.e. ones that can be cited in multiple questions across multiple topics) over those that are very niche (e.g. a statistic that can only be used to back up a single point). 

An example of a versatile case study is Japan's release of the Fukushima nuclear waste water into the Pacific Ocean. This case study is obviously relevant for Environment questions, such as those that ask about energy or pollution. On top of that though, it can also be applied to Politics questions about diplomacy or trade. You can consider why some countries such as China decided to ban Japanese seafood import, while other countries did not. This case study is also applicable to Media questions, as you can discuss how different news agencies reported on the event, and how key stakeholders (e.g. Japanese fishermen) responded to the news, to talk about truth vs sensationalism, or about our post-truth world. 

* When writing essays or essay outlines for practice, rely less on Google, and more on your creativity.

When students do practices for Paper 1, they often have their devices at the ready to Google for evidence/examples to substantiate their points. This is not the best way to revise, especially nearing your exams, however, as it would lead to you having many separate nuggets of content that you won't be able to remember for your exams. Rather than immediately turning to Google when you need something to substantiate your argument, think about the examples that you already have in your head, and whether they can be *re-angled* to support your point. 

It does not matter if the example by itself does not directly back up your point -- that is ideal, but often not possible to achieve under exam conditions. That is what your evaluation is for -- to infer from the example, and use those logical inferences to *link* your example to your point. 

&#x200B;

After applying these two tips, you should experience less pressure to memorise lots of examples right before your exam. You can use the time that you have freed up to (1) read for arguments and perspectives, and to (2) work on more important skills, like forming logical and evaluative arguments, and writing in a fluent and engaging manner. 

&#x200B;

That's all I have for Paper 1! Do let me know if this was helpful, and feel free to DM me if you have any questions, or if you would like me to look through your practices. 

All the best for your exams! :)"

Since a lot of you are about to take your year-end exams soon, here are some tips that you can keep in mind when revising for your Paper 1!

I have been a GP private tutor for many years, and these tips have been incredibly helpful for improving my students' performance for Paper 1, so hopefully you would find them useful too!

# Essay structure:

* Generally, I suggest adopting the following essay structure:

>Supporting  
>  
>Counterargument  
>  
>Rebuttal  
>  
>Supporting

I recommend this structure because it allows you to start and end your essay with strong arguments that convince the reader of your stance.

Dear Entrepreneur:

In 12-18 months, marketing as we always knew it will be OVER.

What *most* people think of as marketing: buying media, writing ads and emails; targeting prospects, crafting landing pages and press releases… All those jobs lost HALF their value as of November 2022, with the onslaught of ChatGPT 3.5.

Yet… **everything that makes your product more marketable** became TWICE as precious, as of the same date.

Most people have not caught on… *yet*.

The clock is ticking fast.

Remember how the Internet demolished… newspapers, encyclopedias, video stores, landlines, road atlases, film cameras and travel agencies? A new demolition is underway all over again.

Most folks applying AI, Large Language Models and ChatGPT are merely doing the same stuff as last year, except faster. Because they’re gonna get replaced by bots and apps.

The tragedy is, they spent years ignoring what they could have been mastering all along. Rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.

95-98% of what you hear about AI from marketing gurus and media is wrongheaded. If you heed their advice, they will drive you into a vicious race to the bottom.

**EXAMPLE**: Folgers coffee in the 60s and 70s was a premium brand. Then in the 80s, beancounters convinced management to use lower-quality Robusta beans instead of the higher-quality Arabica beans. They mixed them in gradually, hoping no one would notice. This affected the taste of their coffee and torpedoed customer satisfaction.

Despite their attempts to regain market share with aggressive advertising, they could not fully recover. (When’s the last time you drank Folgers? Did you enjoy it… or did you just chug down some dark brown swill?)

In identical fashion, marketers harness AI and big data, running countless A/B tests, striving for a slight edge in efficiency or marginal increase in click rates. Quickly transforming the marketing profession into a soulless, mechanized operation, devoid of the human touch that once defined it.

The intricate dance between a business and its customers, driven by empathy and concern, gets displaced by the cold hard logic of Machine Learning algorithms.

Most marketers approach AI as beancounters. AI for the majority will work out the same way Folgers did. Race to the bottom.

But AI will also generate enormous levels of wealth and skyrocket productivity for many. I believe the productivity of AI will literally “pay the bill for the pandemic.” **2024-2026 will be boom years.**

That is why in May 2023 I summoned the finest AI and traffic people from the four winds. I assembled them for an utterly unique landmark event in Chicago.

Definitive AI Seminar was the most remarkable event we’ve ever pulled off.

We have a storied history of creating unforgettable landmark events. People talk about our seminars for years. Clients are still talking about (and purchasing) Star Seminar with Richard Koch from 2014. And using it to grow their fortunes. Clients are still talking about (and purchasing) Rosetta Stone from 2018. These events were absolutely legendary.

And for good reason. Not only were the presentations arresting and at times hypnotic, but they defined the axis around which the earth will rotate for decades to come.

Star Seminar defined Star Principle and SIMPLIFY in a new, definitive way – principles that define multi-million, multi-billion and multi-trillion dollar industries.

Rosetta Stone defined Network Effect for Mere Mortals.

Definitive AI seminar is now legendary as well. We mapped the next 20 years.

It is no exaggeration to say that those who possess this information are 12-24 months ahead of everyone else, armed to make wise and profitable decisions and deft moves during the next decade.

The atmosphere was charged. When the event was over…. No one wanted to leave.

**Sam Woods stole the show.** Sam has quietly generated over $257 million in sales for companies like Google, Amazon, SalesForce, HubSpot, IBM, PitchAnything and Alex Hermozi. He’s been applying AI and Machine Learning to Conversion Rate Optimization since 2015.

Sam ushered a very special energy into the room. Every one of my very best students and clients – those who have gone on to fame… each of them brought knowledge of a completely external field into marketing, thus creating a multidimensional new world.

Ari Galper combined marketing with trust-based selling. Glenn Livingston, psychology and market research. Megan Macedo, cultural and family dynamics. David Bullock, Taguchi and manufacturing methods. Mark Ingles, programming and engineering. John McGee, poetry and music. Richard Koch, private equity investing."
168ulpu,1,2023-09-03,Suggestions and Insights For Self Study?,u/Revolutionary_Lock57,GetStudying,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/168ulpu/suggestions_and_insights_for_self_study/,"Hallo!

Question:
So,I'd like tips, views perspectives of how I can stricture my day/week/month (s) for a  successful SELF-STUDY over the course (pun intended) of several months, emulating ""semesters""

Background:
I finished University many years ago, (before audiobooks were a thing), a lil over 10 years ago, yet always enjoyed learning.  One of my pet peeves of University was not having the ""time"" to study and learn more of what I wanted, in other words, like having a schedule full of electives, instead of my major.  Naturally, that's not practical if your aiming for a specific degree etc.

I've always had the idea of creating my own self study program.  Now, years later, I have the time (free time) and resources (plenty of books, youtube/other public lectures/ apps etc to make this happen.

My Delimna:
Structure.  Having been removed fromthe University world, it's Luke I ""forgot"" how to study.  Plus, with the technology listed above (apps etc), I'm sure I can really organize my study plan better. But, again, it's overwhelmingly, overwhelming in the directions or approach I can go;

How often/how many hours per week do you usually invest ""learning/in class""?

How often/how many hours per week do you usually invest in ""self study"" (ie in dorms/home/library)?

Do you take notes, then read them over and over again until learned?

How often/how many hours per week do you usually invest in leisure time, for balance?

Any apps that you use?

The subject matters, may not matter, but for informational purposes, my topics of choice are theological studies, and something else completely  different (probably advancing my Spanish; self taught also, almost fluent - I use ChatGPT for this)

I hope these aren't dumb questions. I just need  a students' (or anyone thst can help) perspectives.

Knowledge is light,  and I need new bulbs!"

I need an app which has a good UI, through which I can mark them present (attendance), let me know when their Fee is due, and all. Most importantly, if possible it should be a webapp, so I can access the app from any device anytime.

I've been trying to make one with chatgpt but it's hard especially with 0 coding knowledge. I had to learn how to install python, which I honestly couldn't figure out in so long. When I did, the code kept throwing errors and chatgpt kept revising the code. At one point i felt I had made progress, the program actually ran and showed basic functionalities but the moment i tried adding new features like (Add student, Remove student), it fell apart. I have 0 debugging knowledge. I'm not a coder. 

Any leads? Where to go?"

169t1bs,1,2023-09-04,Some advice to new (and returning) students,u/j0ec00l69,uwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwo/comments/169t1bs/some_advice_to_new_and_returning_students/,"  

Some advice to new (and returning) students:

· Put in the work from day one… Waiting until the day before or the week before a midterm or exam rarely works as well as working consistently.

· Pay attention to deadlines… Unlike high school, you will lose marks for submitting work late unless you can provide a valid reason (illness/injury, death in the family, etc.). You’re not in the rookie league anymore.

· If your having trouble understanding concepts go to your prof, your TA, the PAL Centre… You’re already paying for these resources, so use them. And don’t wait until the last minute to get help.

· While you’re at it, look into the other resources available to you on campus (e.g., Ombudsperson, Housing Mediation, Accessible Education, mental health supports, etc.)… These can be a game-changer when you need them.

· If you fail a midterm or exam, ask to review it with your prof or TA to learn where you can improve… But don’t go there expecting to get extra marks or extra work to save your grade. You have to earn your marks the same way as everyone else.

· Don’t be afraid to ask your prof or TA to review the marking of your paper or exam… They’re human and sometimes overlook things when marking. (This is not the same as asking for extra marks. These are marks you may have earned.)

· If you’re one (or two) mark(s) shy of meeting a requirement (e.g., you got a 59 instead of the 60 you needed) don’t be afraid to ask your prof if they can review your work… In fact, some profs might just give you the extra mark anyways because they’re nice that way… And if that doesn’t work, don’t be afraid to ask an academic advisor if they will make an exception for you on the requirement… If your other marks are good, they may be willing to make an exception.

· Don’t commit an academic offense like cheating, plagiarism or using ChatGPT to write your paper... You really don’t want to find out what the consequences of an academic offence are.

· Drink lots of fluids… water, caffeine or alcohol, as needed.

· Above all else… have fun. These are the best years."

16a29b0,1,2023-09-04,Heavy Processing? Is “Find Notes” the problem? I could use help.,u/dmscvan,shortcuts,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/16a29b0/heavy_processing_is_find_notes_the_problem_i/,"First, I apologize for the convoluted wording of this post. I dictated it into one of my ChatGPT editors. But I realized halfway through that it isn't just an editor; it's one that rephrases things too. That's why my wording may seem academic or strange.

I've been working on shortcuts that I use in the evening to summarize my day. But they're getting quite long, and I think, quite heavy. So I'm finding that I need to cut them into a number of different shortcuts. 

I think one of the biggest culprits is my habit of using “notes” to save everything. Then, I resort to a ""find notes"" feature to locate specific information.

For example, I've been using notes to save numbers. These are from rating a variable from 1 to 9. Each note has just a single number. I then use these numbers for various inputs, such as calculating averages for the past week or month.

I also use notes to save text. This helps me keep a record of, for example, my mood for the day. After that, I run the notes through ChatGPT for editing and other modifications.

I'm uploading some screenshots from several of these shortcuts so that you can see how I've used them. The ratings are highlighted in yellow, and the texts are in orange.

I am really sorry, but I am unsure how to upload the shortcuts themselves.

My main questions are as follows: Is there an alternative to using notes for these tasks? I am also curious if there might be any other reasons why the shortcuts appear to be slowing down and not functioning properly. I am under the impression that it could be due to heavy processing. How could I look at fixing this?

————————

Here is a link to my screenshots: https://imgur.com/a/mgX4e4b

1 shows the text that I'm including in the note for the ratings. This text is simply a numeral.

2 illustrates the action I have employed to create a note using the input text.

In 3, you can observe that I am now utilizing the ""Find Notes"" action to call the last seven notes. I think this task takes substantial processing time.

4 remains the same as 3. But this time, I am collecting the last 30 notes.

In 5, you can see what I'm using these numbers for, even though I haven't shown all the previous steps. You can see that I'm trying to get averages for the last week and the last month.

In 6, you can see that I am using the earlier number that I dictated, providing input for my next question.

In 7, I'm dictating a longer text that will also be saved as a note.

In 8, I am creating a prompt for ChatGPT. The TextInput variable refers to the note saved in 7.

In 9, I use the output of the ChatGPT above to save yet another note. 

In 10, you can observe that I am now utilizing a new shortcut. In this action, I find a note again, this time, the output of 9 above. 

11 and 12 are the same as 10, but they just fall under different categories. Each of these codes apply to the same process as was used in 10 in order to reach this point.

13a and 13b illustrate how I am utilizing the texts from 10 through 12 as input for a ChatGPT.

————————

I know that shortcuts aren't particularly complex in terms of coding, but my coding background goes back to when I was a little kid, making colors glide across our Commodore 64's screen. And later, as a university student, doing minor HTML editing on my blog.

I would really love some help with this. I've come pretty far on my own, but I could use some advice.

I also want to say thank you to everybody for posting shortcuts in here. Because I learned a lot from them and have used bits and pieces from what other people have posted."

16a91zo,1,2023-09-04,How are you navigating the impact of AI in the ed space? Do you currently use any AI tools?,u/A1powerranger,ScienceTeachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceTeachers/comments/16a91zo/how_are_you_navigating_the_impact_of_ai_in_the_ed/,"The current AI edtech landscape is pretty wild. AI-driven tools are already creating a massive impact in classroom management and professional development. From automated grading systems to personalized learning platforms, AI is streamlining learning at an unprecedented rate. 

Most people in my academic circle are already fully integrated and automating most administrative tasks, lecture transcription , tutoring, and more.

**Interesting use cases I’ve come across:**

ScribeSense: Amplifying Accessibility ScribeSense, an AI-powered transcription tool, has revolutionized classroom accessibility. It provides real-time transcriptions of lectures, aiding both students with hearing impairments and teachers seeking to review and refine their instructional approaches.

Studdy.ai: Enhanced learning powered by AI, Studdy has a very unique approach to learning. Unlike chatgpt, photomath,  and other AI tutors that are built to spit out results, Studdy is an immersive alternative walking users through all the steps and permutations leading to the outcome. One of the only applications of AI assisted learning that seems complimentary to student development.

&#x200B;

**Expert opinions worth considering** 

Experts emphasise that AI should be seen as a tool that augments teachers' capacities rather than replaces them. Dr. Sugata Mitra, Professor of Educational Technology at Newcastle University, underscores that AI can address educational inequalities and support teachers in more effectively engaging diverse learners.

&#x200B;

**Adoption strategies for AI-assisted-learning**

I believe that educators need comprehensive training to effectively integrate AI tools into their teaching practices. (there’s a palpable knowledge gap here).

While we’re at it, why not push for professional development programs focused on fostering AI literacy and pedagogical innovation??

&#x200B;

**I firmly believe that AI's role in education is not one of substitution but augmentation with immense collaborative potential.**

Are you currently using AI tools? How has AI impacted your day to day?

(Translation from chatgpt and minor edits)  
As a parent of an elementary and middle school student in Taiwan, let me tell you:

The bilingual policy in Taiwan's basic education ends up creating a new generation that is neither proficient in Mandarin nor in English, and even struggles with subjects like mathematics.

Let me use my child's communication book as an example.

This is the format mandated by the school. Can you tell me what this messed-up, neither-here-nor-there thing is?

Is the head of the Ministry of Education not thinking straight? With such a system, if one becomes proficient in any language, I'd be surprised.

Damn.

*Math筆、Chinese講、English句、30 words*  
*甲本page fifty～fifty one*

**I strongly support Taiwan's push for bilingual education.** However, it needs appropriate adjustments as the execution isn't aligning with available resources, leading to increasing chaos.

Under the so-called ""policy"" of the school, communication books have essentially turned into this jumbled mess. The school's justification? To implement the government's ""bilingual education"" mandate. Imagine if other subjects were taught bilingually. What would they become?

I am truly speechless! Our government has made bilingual education a national priority. **However, without sufficient time and accompanying measures, it essentially harms our basic education frontline teachers and students.**

Ultimately, this produces a new generation that is not good in either Mandarin or English.

What kind of bilingual education policy is this? It feels like a bunch of intellectuals brainstorming in their offices and coming up with unrealistic ideas.

**My biggest regret is not enrolling my child in a private school from elementary age.**

Damn."

After experiencing it first hand for a year, holy fuck, it's an indescribable, existential horror show, I was completely, utterly, and unequivocally wrong.  Some of the concerning trends I've noticed, and just for reference the kids I tutor are mostly from high COL areas who attend either private schools or ""good"" public institutions, these are on paper good students, with robust at home support systems and education tools, many of them are straight A students.  

-Severely underdeveloped critical thinking skills , they're pretty damn good at absorbing and regurgitating information but beyond that, oof, this leads to all sorts of issue, such as inability to make long form or complex arguments, not understanding how pieces of information are linked together because they aren't explicitly stated to be connected, extreme difficulty problem solving when they don't have all the variable, parsing information etc.  The worst parts that when I can work with them and get them to buy in, you can see the long atrophied gears turning in their heads, and they start to get a little excited as they can do shit on their own, but 1-3 hours a week isnt enough time to undo over a decade of mental neglect. 

-Degraded mental stamina, they struggle to get through 30 straight minutes of instruction without needing frequent breaks, especially for the goddamned phones, if they aren't super into the material, and for whatever reason they seem to expect to be constantly entertained by tutoring

-No resilience, they give up at the slightest challenge or adversity and look to me for answers, when I don't give it to them they get all weird and look at me like I'm some kind of asshole

-Grammar is dead, lmao

-They treat google like the word of god and will copy/paste the first answer that pops up, even if its obviously wrong

-Extreme tech reliance without more than a paltry understanding of it, they're fucking wizards at navigating touch screen UI's but have no idea how they work, or how to function without them. They also just don't know how to use computers, at all, they're as bad as boomers in that regard, ask them to find the documents or downloads folders and you might as well be speaking an alien language to them

-Dexterity issues for non-athletes, they have a hard time doing anything tactile and tend to fumble or drop shit, also have issues with physical books

-They don't give a shit about deadlines, the amount of times I've had one of them stop giving a fuck and give me the ""I'll just turn it in whenever"" is too damn high.  Also too many safety nets, being able to turn assignments in whenever for full credit, open note exams, unmonitored take home exams, being able to make up any assignment as many times as they want until they get the grade they want isn't healthy for childhood development, how will you grow if you aren't allowed to fail?

-Curriculum has been dumbed down, compared to when I was in high schools its about two grades (EX: the kind of work I did as a freshmen is roughly on par with the workload juniors have today, AP's not withstanding) and they still struggle with it

-A lot of them are way less literate than they should, they can skim information pretty well but they retain very little of it

-ChatGPT use is rampant, especially for writing assignements

-Fuck tiktok, that shits a digital weapon designed to rot kids brains out

And probably more, I really fucking hope that this is just some weird local phenomena because otherwise, we as a society are even more fucked.  We aren't passing down critical cognitive skills to future generations, for perhaps the first time in modern history, which has led to a generation of kids being, on average, that has a weaker foundation than their predecessors.  And that isn't to say this affects every student equally, I have several who are an absolute treat to work with, and in no way, shape, or form is this the fault of teachers, but in general shits bad, and it looks like it's only going to get worse.  

TLDR: We're turning kids into the pod people from WALL-E and it ain't the teachers fault"

16aot6b,1,2023-09-05,Counselor: ChatGPT Can't Help With Your Essays—But It Can Certainly Harm Them,u/SeattlesBestTutor,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/16aot6b/counselor_chatgpt_cant_help_with_your_essaysbut/,"**AI is not useful for college essays (or college applications in general) and is not likely to be for the foreseeable future**

Greetings fellow Redditors,

I’m a college counselor and writer. After testing ChatGPT’s capabilities, I’m certain that AI assistance can’t help you get accepted, **but it can certainly get you rejected.**

There are three big problems:

1. AI cannot produce a usable draft of a short-answer supplemental prompt, much less a personal statement.
2. It cannot compose essays that are consistent in content and style to provide the coherent application that universities want.
3. Worst of all, AI always uses clichés and employs patterns that give away its usage, greatly increasing the chances of automatic rejection while providing very limited upside.

In early September the *New York Times*, late to every tech trend, published a rash of college AI-related articles: “[Applying to College? Here’s How A.I. Tools Might Hurt, or Help](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/01/technology/ai-chatbots-college-applications.html),“ “[We Used A.I. To Write Essays for Harvard, Yale and Princeton](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/01/business/chatbot-essays-harvard-yale-princeton-dartmouth.html),” and “[Ban or Embrace? Colleges Wrestle With A.I.-Generated Admissions Essays](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/01/business/college-admissions-essay-ai-chatbots.html?algo=editorial_importance_fy_email_news&block=4&campaign_id=142&emc=edit_fory_20230901&fellback=false&imp_id=2903992299960165&instance_id=101746&nl=for-you&nlid=171208392&pool=fye-top-news-ls&rank=1&regi_id=171208392&req_id=4239253284329299&segment_id=143542&surface=for-you-email-news&user_id=5ae5694c9c6731b928472c05838ed651&variant=0_edimp_fye_news_dedupe).” The *NYT*, bless its heart, is wrong about tech almost every time, and these pieces, which express cautious optimism about AI, are no exception.

Most obviously, the second article, where ChatGPT drafts essays, avoids both the personal statement and the most crucial supplementals, instead focusing exclusively on >100-word ultra-short responses. These are only requested by a small handful of top-tier universities, like Yale and Stanford, along with a few second-tier schools like USC, whereas every selective college, including those ones, requests longer short-form essays of some 250+ words.

The reason the *NYT* article doesn’t mention these longer essays is that **ChatGPT cannot write them.** The *Times* doesn’t provide an example of this, but I will.

&#x200B;

**MAN VS. MACHINE**

Here’s my ChatGPT input for a USC 250-worder:

*Please write a 250-word essay on the following prompt: “The student body at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering is a diverse group of unique engineers and computer scientists who work together to engineer a better world for all humanity. Describe how your contributions to the USC Viterbi student body may be distinct from others. Please feel free to touch on any part of your background, traits, skills, experiences, challenges, and/or personality in helping us better understand you.”Make it about cooking Indian food while growing up with an Indian family in Seattle, reverse-engineering dishes through going to restaurants, cooking for friends, and emphasizing how unique it is that you’re a computer-science student who can cook.*

And here’s ChatGPT’s output:

*Title: A Fusion of Flavors: My Unique Contribution to the USC Viterbi School of Engineering*

*As a computer science student at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, I bring a distinctive perspective to our diverse and talented student body—one that combines my passion for technology with my love for cooking Indian cuisine. Growing up in Seattle within an Indian family, I was immersed in a world of aromatic spices, intricate recipes, and the vibrant art of Indian cooking. This culinary journey has not only shaped my identity but has also provided me with a unique set of skills and experiences that set me apart from my peers.*

*In my quest to master the art of Indian cooking, I embarked on a journey that involved reverse-engineering dishes from various Indian restaurants. This process allowed me to deconstruct complex flavors, understand cooking techniques, and experiment with my own twists. Much like coding, it involved breaking down a problem into smaller components and solving them systematically—a skill that has proved invaluable in both the kitchen and the world of computer science.What sets me apart is not just my ability to cook, but my desire to share this passion with others. I’ve often found myself hosting gatherings and cooking feasts for my friends, introducing them to the rich tapestry of Indian cuisine. Through these experiences, I’ve honed my communication, teamwork, and leadership skills—qualities that are crucial for success in engineering and computer science.*

*My unique contribution to the USC Viterbi student body is the fusion of my culinary expertise with my passion for technology. As a computer science student who can whip up a delicious Indian meal, I am a testament to the diverse talents that exist within our community. I believe that my ability to blend flavors in the kitchen mirrors my ability to innovate and create in the world of technology. Together, these passions enable me to engineer a better world for all humanity, one byte and one bite at a time.*

This essay is awful! First of all, it’s not 250 words, but 334; you’d think this’d be a simple instruction for a ""revolutionary"" tool to follow, but I guess not. At least there’s plenty of stuff to cut, starting with the title (which college essays don’t have).

Really, you could cut almost everything. “I like spicy food. I’m Indian. I like tech too.” What else is there? The whole thing is pretentious and overwritten, often using a dozen words when five—or zero—would suffice. It lacks any distinct personality or specificity and employs hackneyed language to cover up its emptiness. This style of obscuring vapidness and B.S. with buzz-phrases is perhaps useful for certain papers or corporate or political life, but here it’ll **seriously harm your chances of getting in.** More on this later.

Contrast this with an essay one of my students wrote, on the same topic:

*Learning to cook made humanity much smarter. For me, it’s been no less momentous.*

*In sixth grade I began binging cooking videos, trying to reverse-engineer every restaurant dish by deconstructing them, carefully tasting the components, and matching them to menu descriptions. My parents pushed back against my desire to play with fire, so I started by getting permission to make “Tanay’s specialty peanuts.” Eventually I was allowed to bake brownies, then cook a chicken concoction. Ever since I’ve been cooking more ambitious dishes, despite my dad’s laments of “yeh bawarchi banega” (“He’ll become a chef!”).*

*Cooking has introduced me to my own culture. I began with dal, an Indian classic with regional variations; our normal fare reflects my dad’s Telugu palette, but my mom’s slightly sweetened dal is characteristically Marathi. It’s also been a portal into other cultures. Last year I whipped up a conventional Thanksgiving feast for my family, adding literal and metaphorical spice to classic Americana. And on a recent trip to rural Eastern Washington I put together a Lebanese smorgasbord, heading into the kitchen and not emerging until five courses were ready.*

*My dad is wrong. I won’t become a chef. I’ll be a programmer who cooks—enjoying a balanced diet in an unhealthy college and work culture of fast food and meal plans. As Virginia Woolf wrote: “One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well.” My friends, family, collaborators and colleagues will always dine well.*

From line one this essay oozes personality. We get to know the applicant, his values, and his milieu in vivid and specific terms. He employs irony and shows off his literacy. The essay has an abundance of perspective and humor, two things colleges value very highly.

They also value consistency. If essays and activities lists employ divergent tones and styles, it’s a major red flag that the essay wasn’t written by the student, or too much outside assistance was used.Using ChatGPT to assist with essays will invariably raise this red flag. Its various AI personas don’t add up to a consistent personality. This is a disaster. Think of your admissions essays as stories whose plot is your life and whose conclusion is admission to a fancy university. AI doesn’t get this, so though its anecdotes could sometimes work OK as stand-alone stories, their whole will be much less than the sum of their parts, leaving colleges with a muddled picture of the applicant and few reasons to admit them.

&#x200B;

**SHORTER ANSWERS**

To illustrate, let’s see how ChatGPT answers the USC micro-essays; below is my parameter and ChatGPT’s answers:

*Please write short responses to the following questions as if you were an Indian computer-science applicant that liked to cook, limiting the answer to #1 to 25 characters and the answers to #2-#6 to 100 characters:*

*Describe yourself in three words.* Tech Enthusiast, Chef

*What is your favorite snack?* Samosas and chai

*Best movie of all time?* “Inception”

*Dream job?* Tech entrepreneur

*If your life had a theme song, what would it be?* “Adventure Awaits”

*Dream trip?* Culinary tour of India

Ideally these responses should showcase an applicant’s range while also cohering with his other essays, and by that standard something seems a little off about these. #1 probably wants three distinct adjectives or characteristics, rather than spending two words on the cringe-worthy “Tech Enthusiast.” The remaining prompts allow for 100 characters, suggesting elaboration, but ChatGPT instead offers the bland equivalent of teenage monosyllabism. Think about how many of USC’s 80,000 applicants are going to write “Dream job?” “Tech entrepreneur”—it’s the short-response-essay version of “How are you?” “Fine.” Again, there’s nothing that makes the applicant stand out; instead, his personality seems **mechanical and robotic, and no college wants that.**

&#x200B;

**HOW AI GETS YOU REJECTED**

Unfortunately, that’s all ChatGPT can provide—and the other AI apps are even worse. Line by line and word by word, AI inputs the internet and outputs clichés and platitudes. Look back at its USC essay, which uses the phrase “distinctive perspective to our diverse and talented student body.” This is the kind of meaningless gobbledygook you’d write if you had nothing to say. Showing you have a “distinctive perspective” is how you win the admissions game; simply declaring you do is totally unconvincing. And everyone knows you think USC has a “diverse and talented student body”—why else would you be applying there, and what does it have to do with you?

From ChatGPT’s opening we learn nothing about the applicant, and therefore have no reason to accept him. The rest of the essay is even worse. *This culinary journey has not only shaped my identity but has also provided me with a unique set of skills and experiences that set me apart from my peers*—pure fluff; get to the point. *What sets me apart is not just my ability to cook, but my desire to share this passion with others*—the kind of thing you’d say if you have nothing to say; I've banned my students from using ""unique"" or ""passion"" to help sharpen their thinking. *Together, these passions enable me to engineer a better world for all humanity, one byte and one bite at a time*—we end with a groaner: imagine saying that on a date, or answering a job-interview question that way, without embarrassment.

ChatGPT’s writing is so devoid of content or substance that editing it by hand, or having it edit itself by iterating the prompt, are both futile. You could consider keeping the structure, which is “good” in the same way as a perfunctory five-paragraph essay, but on the whole the NYT’s idea that ChatGPT could “democratize” access to essay-editing services is absurd; **no input will yield passable writing**, and ""supervising"" its responses is **more work than just doing it yourself and consulting your counselor or friends.** The only thing to do with ChatGPT's draft is to throw it in the garbage … because if you don’t, the admissions officers certainly will.

For ChatGPT’s essay not only lacks merit, it also endangers your entire application. Admissions committees *hate* when they perceive applicants have blown off the essays, and, if they’re suspicious you used AI, your chances are even worse. It’s true that rigorously determining AI usage through algorithms is very hard, and professorial paranoia has led to frequent false positives and flunkings that were later retracted. But it’s also true that determining probable AI use through close reading is easy; check out [this exercise](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/12/26/upshot/chatgpt-child-essays.html) from the very same *New York Times* and see if you can’t get at least eight out of 10.

This lower threshold of proof is what admissions officers use; in an increasingly competitive environment, they’re always looking for reasons to cull the applicant pool, and they can and will reject applicants based on gut feeling. Though the admissions process is arbitrary and opaque, and years and years of working closely with college-bound seniors has taught me that we never know exactly what’s going to happen, it’s very likely ChatGPT-based essays will, for the next several years at least, doom more applicants than they help.

16ap8sc,1,2023-09-05,DataAnalyst.com - I launched a niche job board with hand curated data analyst jobs. Here's the summary of how it's going after the eight month (an eventful one!),u/kirilale,dataanalysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/16ap8sc/dataanalystcom_i_launched_a_niche_job_board_with/,"Hi all,

on Dec 19th I launched [DataAnalyst.com](https://dataanalyst.com) \- this is the eighth update, covering performance in August, with hopefully many more to come. It'll be a shorter update this time, due to absolutely manic month at the dayjob, but it's still been a very eventful month.

Want to make sure I document the journey, and keep myself honest, so each month I will be making a post about the statistics, progress, some thoughts and what are the next steps I want to be focusing on.

While the main purpose for the post is to bring everyone along on the journey, I do think that members of r/DataAnalysis might benefit from the site, especially those looking for a new data analyst job. I'd also love to engage with people on the sub who'd like to share their data analyst career journey.

So, just a reminder that early stages vision is to become the #1 job board for data analysts - hand-picking interesting data analyst job opportunities across industries.

Let's dive right in:

# 1. General Observations

DataAnalyst.com has been online for just over 8 months, and we're bringing new, hand curated data analyst jobs onto the site daily - all of them including a salary range.

There's now 1,800+ people subscribed to the newsletter, and I can't thank you enough for your support and for joining us on the journey.

## First job paid posting

To those who monitor the above table closely, you've probably noticed the number 1 in the paid posts cell for August.

Yes, it ***only*** took 7 months and 16 days to get a first paid job posting on the site. Hurray!

Tualatin Valley Fire & Rescue purchased a fast-track job posting - it came organically, which is a great sign as well.

It also came in with a lesson learnt - after tweaking flows / forms, always double check that you didn't leave a bug behind. Unfortunately for me I did, and they couldn't complete the purchase, but fortunately they reached out and I solved the issue immediately. 

I've also upgraded the posting to a featured one, free of charge - I think this is particularly important. 

Linkedins, Indeeds of the world are too complex to ensure a human connection with each client, while as a solofounder, I want to make sure I go over and beyond each time someone puts trusts in me and the service. That's something I do believe founders should strive for, and something that will set them apart.

## Stats - Bounce, numbers, bounce

After seeing a massive dip in traffic, apply now clicks and Google impressions in July, looks like August numbers bounced back with vengeance, driven primarily by skyrocketing Google impressions / clicks.

I'd be grateful if someone could please explain to me Google Search Console Clicks vs Google Analytics Visitors - shouldn't each click that comes from Google Search, leading to the site, also mean that's a visitor coming in?

**Where did 4,421 people come from?**

* Direct - 51%
* Organic - 35%
* Social - 14% (automated job postings on Twitter, Linkedin, Reddit)

SEO optimisation - I've also spent some time over the summer using tools such as SEMRush / Ahrefs / Moz to run some high level audits and understand how the site performs on the SEO front. This led to a lot of time spent on making significant on-page changes to improve keyword optimisation, rewriting meta descriptions and adding alt descriptions to all the images on the site.  Whether this was something that caused the sudden Google love, I don't know, but this is probably something that could (and should) have been done a lot earlier. Having said that, it's now something that I pay attention to with each update that I make on the site.

## Things on top of my mind

**a) Expired Listings** 

There's feedback regarding some of the jobs on the site already expiring and leading to non-existing listings. Decided to address this in two ways:

First, I found out Ahrefs has a free ""Site Audit"" tier, which crawls the whole site and provides a report including all the issues i.e missing alt descriptions, including 404 links. 

Second, on each listing I've now included a link for any visitor to report an expiring listing. Hopefully this will improve the experience. I'm still leaving listings (without apply buttons) on the site, so people can see previous open roles and salary ranges (and ngl, I'm terrified of what the impact on SEO would be if I had deleted those..)

**b) Outreach** 

One of my main priorities for the coming 3 months is reaching out to organisations hiring data analysts and educating them about the niche job board, and how they can benefit by sharing their opportunities on the site. 

Additionally, I did notice quite a few .edu emails signed up to the Newsletter. This could be an interesting angle to explore, reaching out to universities, sharing that their students are using the site. This could lead to both driving in visitors, as well as potentially getting a backlink that would help increase the authority of the site.

**c) UX/UI** 

Lesson learnt - do not use experimental browsers when you try to do website design. 

I've been using Arc browser since the start of the year, with the toolbar being on the left hand side. 

I've recently used various browsers and monitors to see how the site looks on various sizes, and it's an absolute mess -> will need to dedicate some time to standardize sections and elements, so it's a more consistent experience.

## BusinessAnalyst.com

As I've mentioned before, I recently launched BusinessAnalyst.com - where I'm looking to replicate step by step what I've done over the last 8 months with DataAnalyst. The overall idea is to create a network of sites, benefiting from the same infrastructure, serving and helping different career paths, and making a collaboration with organisations much more appealing (afterall, most companies who hire for data analysts also look for business analysts and vice versa). Arguably, this might not make much sense seeing that DA still hasn't brought any consistent revenue in, but on the other hand, I can reuse the whole tech stack and structures already in place, halve my cost per project, while doubling the surface area to catch me some luck.

Shared [first update](https://www.reddit.com/r/businessanalyst/comments/15r5ecq/businessanalystcom_i_launched_a_niche_job_board/) couple of weeks ago - will need to figure out how to combine, if people are interested to see the side by side view. **TLDR: site still dead**

# 2. ""Day in the Life"" - a series of interviews with data analysts sharing their experience, thoughts and advice.

Another interview from our series has been published. In these interviews, we aim to share stories and experiences about the route to becoming a data analyst, keeping up with the skillset, recommendations to aspiring data analysts and much more.

**Alex, who is a BI manager at AWS**, has shared some fantastic insights, and I'd love to share his  advice on building a portfolio:

*""I've been mentoring a few folks on this recently, ranging from college grads to mid-career individuals in non-tech roles. My recommendation to each is to build an end to end portfolio of work. An example is using python to web scrape information from a website and persist to a normalized data structure in a database, using SQL to write queries and analyze that information, and then use Tableau or PowerBI to visualize results and share insights. Each step of this process is important for a rockstar Data Analyst/BI Engineer and will showcase the capability to do the work for hiring managers.""*

We also briefly cover the question of the Year: Is AI/ChatGPT a threat to data analysts? 

Highly recommend reading the [full interview](https://www.dataanalyst.com/blog/alex-my-data-analyst-career-journey).

# Things in the pipeline

16ap90j,1,2023-09-05,DataAnalyst.com - I launched a niche job board with hand curated data analyst jobs. Here's the summary of how it's going after the eight month (an eventful one!),u/kirilale,EntrepreneurRideAlong,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/16ap90j/dataanalystcom_i_launched_a_niche_job_board_with/,"Hi all,

on Dec 19th I launched [DataAnalyst.com](https://dataanalyst.com) \- this is the eighth update, covering performance in August, with hopefully many more to come. It'll be a shorter update this time, due to absolutely manic month at the dayjob, but it's still been a very eventful month.

Want to make sure I document the journey, and keep myself honest, so each month I will be making a post about the statistics, progress, some thoughts and what are the next steps I want to be focusing on.

While the main purpose for the post is to bring everyone along on the journey, I do think that members of r/EntrepreneurRideAlong might benefit from the site, especially those looking to start a new adventure and hoping to get insights into someone elses process.

So, just a reminder that early stages vision is to become the #1 job board for data analysts - hand-picking interesting data analyst job opportunities across industries.

Let's dive right in:

# 1. General Observations

DataAnalyst.com has been online for just over 8 months, and we're bringing new, hand curated data analyst jobs onto the site daily - all of them including a salary range.

There's now 1,800+ people subscribed to the newsletter, and I can't thank you enough for your support and for joining us on the journey.

## First job paid posting

To those who monitor the above table closely, you've probably noticed the number 1 in the paid posts cell for August.

Yes, it ***only*** took 7 months and 16 days to get a first paid job posting on the site. Hurray!

Tualatin Valley Fire & Rescue purchased a fast-track job posting - it came organically, which is a great sign as well.

It also came in with a lesson learnt - after tweaking flows / forms, always double check that you didn't leave a bug behind. Unfortunately for me I did, and they couldn't complete the purchase, but fortunately they reached out and I solved the issue immediately. 

I've also upgraded the posting to a featured one, free of charge - I think this is particularly important. 

Linkedins, Indeeds of the world are too complex to ensure a human connection with each client, while as a solofounder, I want to make sure I go over and beyond each time someone puts trusts in me and the service. That's something I do believe founders should strive for, and something that will set them apart.

## Stats - Bounce, numbers, bounce

After seeing a massive dip in traffic, apply now clicks and Google impressions in July, looks like August numbers bounced back with vengeance, driven primarily by skyrocketing Google impressions / clicks.

I'd be grateful if someone could please explain to me Google Search Console Clicks vs Google Analytics Visitors - shouldn't each click that comes from Google Search, leading to the site, also mean that's a visitor coming in?

**Where did 4,421 people come from?**

* Direct - 51%
* Organic - 35%
* Social - 14% (automated job postings on Twitter, Linkedin, Reddit)

**SEO optimisation** 

SEO optimisation - I've also spent some time over the summer using tools such as SEMRush / Ahrefs / Moz to run some high level audits and understand how the site performs on the SEO front. This led to a lot of time spent on making significant on-page changes to improve keyword optimisation, rewriting meta descriptions and adding alt descriptions to all the images on the site.  Whether this was something that caused the sudden Google love, I don't know, but this is probably something that could (and should) have been done a lot earlier. Having said that, it's now something that I pay attention to with each update that I make on the site.

## Things on top of my mind

**a) Expired Listings**

There's feedback regarding some of the jobs on the site already expiring and leading to non-existing listings. Decided to address this in two ways. First, I found out Ahrefs has a free ""Site Audit"" tier, which crawls the whole site and provides a report including all the issues i.e missing alt descriptions, including 404 links. Second, on each listing I've now included a link for any visitor to report an expiring listing. Hopefully this will improve the experience. I'm still leaving listings (without apply buttons) on the site, so people can see previous open roles and salary ranges.

**b) Outreach**

One of my main priorities for the coming 3 months is reaching out to organisations hiring data analysts and educating them about the niche job board, and how they can benefit by sharing their opportunities on the site. 

Additionally, I did notice quite a few .edu emails signed up to the Newsletter. This could be an interesting angle to explore, reaching out to universities, sharing that their students are using the site. This could lead to both driving in visitors, as well as potentially getting a backlink that would help increase the authority of the site.

**c) UX/UI**

Lesson learnt - do not use experimental browsers when you try to do website design - I've been using Arc browser since the start of the year, with the toolbar being on the left hand side. 

I've recently used various browsers and monitors to see how the site looks on various sizes, and it's an absolute mess -> will need to dedicate some time to standardize sections and elements, so it's a more consistent experience.

## BusinessAnalyst.com

As I've mentioned before, I recently launched BusinessAnalyst.com - where I'm looking to replicate step by step what I've done over the last 8 months with DataAnalyst. The overall idea is to create a network of sites, benefiting from the same infrastructure, serving and helping different career paths, and making a collaboration with organisations much more appealing (afterall, most companies who hire for data analysts also look for business analysts and vice versa). Arguably, this might not make much sense seeing that DA still hasn't brought any consistent revenue in, but on the other hand, I can reuse the whole tech stack and structures already in place, halve my cost per project, while doubling the surface area to catch me some luck.

Shared [first update](https://www.reddit.com/r/businessanalyst/comments/15r5ecq/businessanalystcom_i_launched_a_niche_job_board/) couple of weeks ago - will need to figure out how to combine, if people are interested to see the side by side view. **TLDR: site still dead**

# 2. ""Day in the Life"" - a series of interviews with data analysts sharing their experience, thoughts and advice.

Another interview from our series has been published. In these interviews, we aim to share stories and experiences about the route to becoming a data analyst, keeping up with the skillset, recommendations to aspiring data analysts and much more.

**Alex, who is a BI manager at AWS**, has shared some fantastic insights, and I'd love to share his  advice on building a portfolio.

*""I've been mentoring a few folks on this recently, ranging from college grads to mid-career individuals in non-tech roles. My recommendation to each is to build an end to end portfolio of work. An example is using python to web scrape information from a website and persist to a normalized data structure in a database, using SQL to write queries and analyze that information, and then use Tableau or PowerBI to visualize results and share insights. Each step of this process is important for a rockstar Data Analyst/BI Engineer and will showcase the capability to do the work for hiring managers.""*

We also briefly cover the question of the Year: Is AI/ChatGPT a threat to data analysts? 

Highly recommend reading the [full interview](https://www.dataanalyst.com/blog/alex-my-data-analyst-career-journey).

# Things in the pipeline

* New data analyst jobs, added daily
* Actually launching the weekly newsletter with the pick of best jobs directly to your inbox (yes, I know....)
* Monthly US data analyst market insights
* Improving the overall site experience (this one is a never ending activity)
* Continuing to bring you Data Analysts across their experience levels, to share tips, tricks and their thoughts

16ap9up,1,2023-09-05,DataAnalyst.com - I launched a niche job board with hand curated data analyst jobs. Here's the summary of how it's going after the eight month (an eventful one!),u/kirilale,SideProject,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/16ap9up/dataanalystcom_i_launched_a_niche_job_board_with/,"Hi all,

on Dec 19th I launched [DataAnalyst.com](https://dataanalyst.com) \- this is the eighth update, covering performance in August, with hopefully many more to come. It'll be a shorter update this time, due to absolutely manic month at the dayjob, but it's still been a very eventful month.

Want to make sure I document the journey, and keep myself honest, so each month I will be making a post about the statistics, progress, some thoughts and what are the next steps I want to be focusing on.

While the main purpose for the post is to bring everyone along on the journey, I do think that members of r/SideProject might benefit from the site, especially those looking to build online projects.

So, just a reminder that early stages vision is to become the #1 job board for data analysts - hand-picking interesting data analyst job opportunities across industries.

Let's dive right in:

# 1. General Observations

DataAnalyst.com has been online for just over 8 months, and we're bringing new, hand curated data analyst jobs onto the site daily - all of them including a salary range.

There's now 1,800+ people subscribed to the newsletter, and I can't thank you enough for your support and for joining us on the journey.

## First job paid posting

To those who monitor the above table closely, you've probably noticed the number 1 in the paid posts cell for August.

Yes, it ***only*** took 7 months and 16 days to get a first paid job posting on the site. Hurray!

Tualatin Valley Fire & Rescue purchased a fast-track job posting - it came organically, which is a great sign as well.

It also came in with a lesson learnt - after tweaking flows / forms, always double check that you didn't leave a bug behind. Unfortunately for me I did, and they couldn't complete the purchase, but fortunately they reached out and I solved the issue immediately. I've also upgraded the posting to a featured one, free of charge - I think this is particularly important.

Linkedins, Indeeds of the world are too complex to ensure a human connection with each client, while as a solofounder, I want to make sure I go over and beyond each time someone puts trusts in me and the service. That's something I do believe founders should strive for, and something that will set them apart.

## Stats - Bounce, numbers, bounce

After seeing a massive dip in traffic, apply now clicks and Google impressions in July, looks like August numbers bounced back with vengeance, driven primarily by skyrocketing Google impressions / clicks.

I'd be grateful if someone could please explain to me Google Search Console Clicks vs Google Analytics Visitors - shouldn't each click that comes from Google Search, leading to the site, also mean that's a visitor coming in?

**Where did 4,421 people come from?**

* Direct - 51%
* Organic - 35%
* Social - 14% (automated job postings on Twitter, Linkedin, Reddit)

**SEO optimisation**

I've also spent some time over the summer using tools such as SEMRush / Ahrefs / Moz to run some high level audits and understand how the site performs on the SEO front. This led to a lot of time spent on making significant on-page changes to improve keyword optimisation, rewriting meta descriptions and adding alt descriptions to all the images on the site.

Whether this was something that caused the sudden Google love, I don't know, but this is probably something that could (and should) have been done a lot earlier. Having said that, it's now something that I pay attention to with each update that I make on the site.

## Things on top of my mind

**a) Expired Listings**

There's feedback regarding some of the jobs on the site already expiring and leading to non-existing listings. Decided to address this in two ways:

First, I found out Ahrefs has a free ""Site Audit"" tier, which crawls the whole site and provides a report including all the issues i.e missing alt descriptions, including 404 links.

Second, on each listing I've now included a link for any visitor to report an expiring listing. Hopefully this will improve the experience. I'm still leaving listings (without apply buttons) on the site, so people can see previous open roles and salary ranges.

**b) Outreach**

One of my main priorities for the coming 3 months is reaching out to organisations hiring data analysts and educating them about the niche job board, and how they can benefit by sharing their opportunities on the site.

Additionally, I did notice quite a few .edu emails signed up to the Newsletter. This could be an interesting angle to explore, reaching out to universities, sharing that their students are using the site. This could lead to both driving in visitors, as well as potentially getting a backlink that would help increase the authority of the site.

**c) UX/UI**

Lesson learnt - do not use experimental browsers when you try to do website design - I've been using Arc browser since the start of the year, with the toolbar being on the left hand side. I've recently used various browsers and monitors to see how the site looks on various sizes, and it's an absolute mess -> will need to dedicate some time to standardize sections and elements, so it's a more consistent experience.

## BusinessAnalyst.com

As I've mentioned before, I recently launched BusinessAnalyst.com - where I'm looking to replicate step by step what I've done over the last 8 months with DataAnalyst. The overall idea is to create a network of sites, benefiting from the same infrastructure, serving and helping different career paths, and making a collaboration with organisations much more appealing (afterall, most companies who hire for data analysts also look for business analysts and vice versa).

16aym6s,1,2023-09-05,Penn States Ranking in Forbes Best Colleges of 2023,u/Relative_Session_179,PennStateUniversity,https://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/16aym6s/penn_states_ranking_in_forbes_best_colleges_of/,"Ladies and gentlemen,

I stand before you today, not as a critic, but as a fervent advocate for the cause of education and the recognition of excellence, echoing my own dream for equality and justice. I express my deep concern at the recent ranking of Penn State, a place brimming with immense promise and potential, as a mere 408th in Forbes' list of top colleges for 2023. This placement fails to capture the true essence and value of this esteemed institution.

Penn State is not just another educational institution; it is a beacon of hope and opportunity. It is a place where the seeds of knowledge are sown, and the dreams of countless individuals take root. Let us not be swayed by rankings alone, for they often fall short of revealing the complete narrative. Instead, let us delve deeper into the compelling reasons why Penn State unquestionably deserves a higher standing.

First and foremost, Penn State boasts an astonishing array of over 275 undergraduate majors. This extensive selection signifies an unwavering commitment to diversity in learning, ensuring that every student can fervently pursue their passions. Such a rich academic offering undeniably merits a higher place in the academic hierarchy.

Furthermore, the median salary of Penn State graduates, a formidable $119,500, stands as a testament to the university's unwavering dedication to preparing students for success. It illuminates that Penn State is not merely an institution of knowledge but an incubator of practical skills and capabilities, equipping its students to thrive in the real world.

While the national graduation rate in America stands at 65%, Penn State proudly boasts an 89% graduation rate. This remarkable accomplishment underscores the university's steadfast commitment to guiding its students towards not only academic completion but also prosperity. With over 750,000 accomplished alumni, Penn State's ability to nurture and support its graduates is evident for all to see.

Moreover, Penn State offers an astonishing array of opportunities beyond the classroom. With over 1,000 student organizations and 29 varsity sports, it empowers students to explore their passions and evolve into well-rounded individuals. This emphasis on holistic development is a hallmark of an institution dedicated to nurturing not only the mind but also the spirit.

In comparing Penn State to other esteemed institutions, one cannot help but notice the parity in research and academic reputation. Schools like UC Berkeley, Cornell, and Michigan, ranked significantly higher by Forbes, share similar attributes with Penn State. This underscores that Penn State deserves its rightful place among the nation's elite institutions.

In conclusion, I implore you, dear applicants, to evaluate Penn State not solely based on its numerical ranking, but on the vast potential it holds, the dreams it fosters, and the futures it shapes. Let us not be defined by the judgments of others but rather by the boundless possibilities that Penn State offers. In the spirit of progress and equity, let us unite to ensure that Penn State's true essence shines brilliantly in the annals of higher education. Together, we can herald a brighter future for this distinguished institution

16b230e,1,2023-09-05,Turnitin: The AI Detector Every School Shouldn't Be Using But Uses Anyway,u/famille_4mains,DidntUseAI,https://www.reddit.com/r/DidntUseAI/comments/16b230e/turnitin_the_ai_detector_every_school_shouldnt_be/,"# Intro

Almost anyone who has gone through high school or college will be familiar with Turnitin as an anti-plagiarism tool used by schools across the world, and especially across the English-speaking world. Naturally, with the rise of generative AI, Turnitin felt compelled to release an AI content detection tool. 

Initially, Turnitin claimed that their AI detector had a less than 1% false positive rate. However, they did not allow universities to independently test their detector before automatically turning it on in early April. As a result, several universities in the UK forced Turnitin to allow them to [opt out of the tool](https://www.gre.ac.uk/articles/public-relations/our-decision-to-opt-out-of-using-turnitins-ai-detection-tool). [UCLA](https://coe.bruinlearn.ucla.edu/news/turnitins-ai-writing-detection-preview-feature-opted-out) and [UC Berkeley](https://rtl.berkeley.edu/news/availability-turnitin-artificial-intelligence-detection) also opted out at the time, though I have heard that unfortunately, UC Berkeley is considering turning the tool back on. 

Before Turnitin's AI detector - at the time still in beta - was turned on, a journalist at the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/04/01/chatgpt-cheating-detection-turnitin/) was able to get access and pass a few student texts through the detector. He found that Turnitin falsely identified several of the human texts as partly AI generated. And sure enough, soon after Turnitin's AI detector went live, Turnitin was forced to [revise its false positive rate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/02/turnitin-ai-cheating-detector-accuracy/) from less than 1% to 4%. 

Since I am not a teacher and have very few contacts in academia, I struggled to find a way to test Turnitin's AI detector. However, very recently, I was finally able to find someone willing to help. 

# Method and Results

I passed the limited dataset through Turnitin. However, Turnitin has a minimum character count higher than most other detectors, so of the 186 texts in the limited dataset, Turnitin was only able to process 109 of them. 

On this small corpus of 109 texts by six authors, Turnitin had an **11.01% false positive rate**. Obviously, this is unacceptably high, and likely indicative that Turnitin is still not correctly representing its false positive rate. 

Furthermore, the false positives were not equally distributed. A few authors were not flagged at all, while some authors had false positive rates as high as **40%**. I am not entirely sure why some people have much higher false positives than others, but I personally suspect that native language and neurodivergence could be risk factors. I will go into further detail in another post. 

# Conclusion

Let's, for a second, pretend that Turnitin's claim of a 1% false positive rate is not bullshit and is somehow, miraculously, incredibly accurate. 

Turnitin is used in most universities in the United States, as well as the UK, Australia, and other English-speaking countries and universities. They estimate that 70,000,000 student texts have already been passed through their detector. That's **700,000** false positives! And if just 1% of those false positives are referred for academic discipline, that's 70,000 anxious students who now have to prove that they didn't do something. Based on somewhat [recent statistics on suicides in college](https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/suicide-in-colleges-rates-research-statistics/#:~:text=28%25%20of%20students%20reported%20intentionally,2%25%20had%20attempted%20suicide), that's **1,400** students who may feel so desperate about their situation that they do something irreparable. 

I realize I am coming off as alarmist. But I have been in the place of a desperate, depressed college student with suicidal thoughts, and they do not act rationally. I am genuinely worried that an innocent student is going to die if universities continue to use these AI detectors, especially Turnitin."
16b3s51,1,2023-09-05,Speech About Forbes Ranking,u/MarketingIsCool2,PennStateUniversity,https://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/16b3s51/speech_about_forbes_ranking/,"  

As a proud Penn State alumnus, I want to share why you should consider attending Penn State, regardless of its Forbes ranking. While it is true that Forbes currently ranks Penn State at number 408, I want to emphasize that this ranking does not reflect the true value and potential of our university. Here are some compelling reasons to look beyond rankings and consider Penn State as your future home:

Firstly, it is important to recognize that there are multiple university rankings around the world, and Penn State performs much better in other respected rankings. For instance, the U.S. News and World Report ranks Penn State at 77th in the country. Additionally, two other reputable reports place the school at 53rd and 83rd internationally. These rankings are based on objective measures that are not always publicly disclosed, meaning that each ranking has its own unique criteria. This diversity of rankings highlights that Penn State's position can fluctuate based on different aspects considered, making it unwise to solely rely on one ranking.

Secondly, Penn State boasts an incredible alumni network, one of the largest in the world. This network spans across various industries and provides valuable connections to current and former students. It opens doors for career opportunities, mentorship, and networking, even years after graduation. Penn State also offers specialized job boards to connect alumni, fostering a tight-knit community that contributes to the university's growth and success. Moreover, alumni often reinvest in the local economy, particularly during events like our cherished traditions in State College, Pennsylvania.

Speaking of traditions, Penn State is renowned for its rich history and vibrant culture. While we may not be the oldest college in the state, we are undoubtedly one of the most prominent. Our academic and athletic achievements have made us a household name. Our strong athletic record draws crowds to Beaver Stadium from across the country, creating a sense of unity and excitement. But our traditions go beyond tailgating and football. The Penn State Creamery, famous for its iconic ice cream flavors like Peachy Paterno, is a must-visit. And then there's THON, the largest student-led philanthropy in the world. THON not only entertains students but also fights childhood cancer through support for the Four Diamonds Fund. Penn State consistently gives back to its community through educational programs and significant donations.

In conclusion, I urge you to look beyond Forbes' ranking and consider Penn State for its remarkable alumni network, rich traditions, and the recognition it receives from other reputable sources. Our university offers a world of opportunities and a vibrant community that extends far beyond a number on a list. Penn State is a place where you can truly thrive and make a lasting impact.

16b6zh2,1,2023-09-05,Cheating,u/itzmoepi,aiwars,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/16b6zh2/cheating/,"Today we will cover AI cheating, because it's likely 90% of students won't do their own homework ever again.

[https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/theres-no-way-for-teachers-to-figure-out-if-students-are-using-chatgpt-to-cheat-openai-says-in-new-back-to-school-guide/ar-AA1g5JYg](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/theres-no-way-for-teachers-to-figure-out-if-students-are-using-chatgpt-to-cheat-openai-says-in-new-back-to-school-guide/ar-AA1g5JYg) 

OpenAI released the ultimate cheating tool that is also very hard to detect (without a ton of false positives). I'm sure that ChatGPT can solve basically every homework problem up to high school and at least a portion of college-level assignments. 

Now first, I should establish why making ChatGPT do all your homework *is* cheating, because pro-ai people will argue that it's just a ""tool"" and that ""prompts"" still require effort to make. 

The problem with AI isn't even that it's plagiarism (even though it certainly is), but just the simple fact that it's not *you* doing the work and learning the material.

I want you to imagine that you are back in middle school but you have an older sibling who's in college, and when you don't understand a homework assignment you ask them for help. Using ChatGPT to do your homework would be like asking that older sibling to do all your work for you while you go and play on the PS5 or something. Why is that bad? **Because you're not actually learning any of the material, defeating the entire point of homework.** 

There is going to be a negative correlation between how capable AI becomes with the intelligence of the general population; as AI becomes smarter humans will get dumber. If students cheat their way throughout school it will literally make future generations of humans dumber since they won't be learning much at all of what they are being taught.

The only application of AI that may not be awful is an educational setting is making it automatically grade tests, but this is only for teachers to aid in a mundane task of their job and not for students. I don't see any benefits to having students use AI to make it do all their work for them.

I have yet to see one benefit of generative AI text that isn't to help cheaters and spammers. What even is a legitimate use case people have for this? I certainly don't want to read any AI-generated articles, books, or comments. If you care so little about your message that you didn't even bother writing it yourself, then similarly why should I care enough to bother reading? The same applies to AI art also, why should I care to look at images you didn't even bother making yourself? I'd much rather read or look at content made by a five year old that was made by them instead of AI crap.

I think AI should get banned in schools, enabling cheating benefits no one and will yield a negative on society."

(Choose the organisation that appears on the right to each paper here for its recent reputation, not just because it once had credibility).

For YouTube explanations I would recommend  Dr. John Campbell (and his interview with Senator Gerard Rennick specifically).

Also, Dr. Suneel Dhand, as well as educational tools like ChatGPT to further simplify terms.   
NOTE: ChatGPT does show clear political preferences so ensure you are asking for neutral context explanations or making clear exclusions as a condition in your question.

[www.chat.openai.com](http://www.chat.openai.com/)

With ChatGPT your questions should have specific do’s and don’ts along with length of answer and at what level (eg. explain this in 50 words like I was a year 12 student).

E.g: Please (do) explain the biological process for the body to respond to a vaccine. (don’t) Do not use Pfizer and Moderna as examples, but from a neutral context in 100 words.

Some terms to start with:

DNA and RNA relationship

Ribosomes

Protein synthesis

Spike proteins 

Reverse transcription

16blfp6,1,2023-09-06,Handige ChatGPT-prompts om je scriptie te schrijven,u/Teachmehowtodothat,scriptie,https://www.reddit.com/r/scriptie/comments/16blfp6/handige_chatgptprompts_om_je_scriptie_te_schrijven/," Het schrijven van een scriptie is een belangrijke mijlpaal in het leven van een student. Het is een intensief en tijdrovend proces waarbij je diep moet graven in je onderwerp, kritisch moet denken en analyseren, en je resultaten helder en overtuigend moet presenteren. Gelukkig is er ChatGPT, een krachtig AI-gestuurd hulpmiddel dat je kan ondersteunen bij het schrijven van je scriptie.

Het is niet de bedoeling dat je je scriptie (volledig) schrijft met ChatGPT; ook zien sommige opleidingen ChatGPT-geschreven tekst als 'fraude'. Maar dat betekent niet dat je er handig gebruik van kan maken voor inspiratie, ideeën en voorbeelden.

Hieronder vind je daarom een aantal handige ChatGPT-prompts om je scriptie te schrijven en het proces soepeler te laten verlopen. Via [dit artikel](https://www.teachmehowtodothat.com/p/chatgpt-prompts-voor-je-scriptie) vind je nog meer van dit soort prompts voor je scriptie.

#### ChatGPT-Prompts voor het beginnen met je scriptie

Stel dat je interesse hebt in duurzame energie, dan zou je kunnen vragen om vijf mogelijke scriptie-onderwerpen over duurzame energie. ChatGPT zal je voorstellen doen die je kunnen helpen bij het kiezen van een passend en boeiend onderwerp voor je scriptie.

1. **Prompt voor het kiezen van een onderwerp**: ""Geef me vijf mogelijke scriptie-onderwerpen over \[voeg je interessegebied hier in\].""

Een goede onderzoeksvraag is cruciaal voor je scriptie. ChatGPT kan je helpen bij het formuleren van een duidelijke en onderzoekbare vraag, zodat je weet wat je moet onderzoeken en analyseren.

* **Prompt voor het schrijven van een onderzoeksvraag**: ""Help me bij het formuleren van een duidelijke en onderzoekbare vraag voor mijn scriptie over \[voeg je gekozen onderwerp hier in\].""

Het uitvoeren van een grondig literatuuronderzoek is essentieel voor je scriptie. ChatGPT kan je helpen bij het identificeren van belangrijke studies en auteurs die je moet bestuderen en citeren in je werk."
16bohc0,1,2023-09-06,"I asked ChatGPT if it could remember everything it ever told to everyone, and its answer was interesting.",u/Schad_Enfreude,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/16bohc0/i_asked_chatgpt_if_it_could_remember_everything/,"Many teachers are worried about students using ChatGPT to cheat on their tests. So I asked ChatGPT can it remember everything it has ever told anyone? That way a teacher could paste a students answer into ChatGPT, and then ChatGPT could say ""Yes, I gave that answer to little Timmy last week"".  

ChatGPT said that although it COULD possibly do that, it doesn't because it violates the AI code of conduct.  (not its exact words, but in a nutshell).

Hmmm...yeah, right..."
16bp6ea,1,2023-09-06,YA Fantasy book about girl who finds out she's a witch and banishes a demon (?),u/nightflutters,whatsthatbook,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthatbook/comments/16bp6ea/ya_fantasy_book_about_girl_who_finds_out_shes_a/,"1. It is a YA fantasy book, set in the modern world (i.e. phones, internet, etc)
2. Female main character, mid-teen age.
3. Main character finds out she is a ""witch"", from her mother's side. She called ""The Witch of \[Town Name\], if I remember correctly. 
4. Her family lives comfortably, as her parents are both rich.
5. She has two best friends, who are both female.
6. She and her friends all love shopping, fashion, and makeup (stereotypical young girl stuff).
7. She goes to school and hears about a new student, called Mal. It is short for something, but I can't remember his full name.
8. Mal, according to the main character, smells like musk and fire. He has dark hair and is labelled as mysterious.
9. She goes to a local coffee shop and learns about another new student, who is the mayor's son. I can't remember his name.
10. The mayor's son loves attention from women. He's described as Blonde and charming.
11. Girls around the town fall ill, and turn manic, with no explanation.
12. Main character finds out that demons (or ghosts?) are real, I can't remember how specifically. If I recall, she sees some figures of ghosts/demons at the start of the book.
13. Main character and her two friends mistake the mayor's son as the demon and run away from him.
14. Mal invites main character on a date, to his ""dark and creepy"" mansion. She falls in love with him.
15. Inviting her was a trap. He shows his true form, being a demonic creature, and tries to lure and kill main character.
16. Her friends, and the mayor's son arrive, and save her from Mal.
17. The school is a normal school.  


I don't remember the cover colours, but it wasn't a hardback at all. The book was a normal-ish length, maybe 300 pages or so. I read it 2 or 3 years ago, but I don't remember when it came out. It isn't a well known series. 

  
It is NOT ""Hex Hall"" by Rachel Hawkins.  
It is NOT ""Hexenhaus"" by Nikki McWatters.  
It is NOT ""Hexed"" by Michelle Krys.  
It is NOT ""Beautiful Creatures"" by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl.

(The four books above were suggestions by ChatGPT when I tried to use it. I still can't find the book.)

Thank you to anyone who can help!"
16bsqil,1,2023-09-06,I worked with Claude many years ago...,u/sexy_brontosaurus,ween,https://www.reddit.com/r/ween/comments/16bsqil/i_worked_with_claude_many_years_ago/,"...and its how I found out about Ween! When I was younger (around 2010) I was in a program called School of Rock here in Central New Jersey. I took both guitar and voice lessons there, and at one point the vocal coach I had been with stopped working there. So that summer, this new dude came and took over in my former teachers position. For a few months, we worked on some basic stuff and spent a ton of time chatting. He was really cool and down to earth. On one of the walls, he had up a picture of himself and Buckethead (who I was huge on at the time) holding their hands out and comparing sizes. Bucketheads monstrous clappers dwarfed Claudes (his hands are huge too lol).

At this point something clicked in my head that oh wow, this guy met Buckethead, I wonder if he has a band? When I asked, he said very casually ""I played in a band called Ween, maybe you have heard of them. If not, go check us out!"". I hadnt, so later that night I listened to Roses Are Free, Mister Would You Please Help My Pony and some 17 minute version of Poopship Destroyer lol. I uh....didnt really get it at the time. As Ween songs often do, the songs I checked out lived rent free in my head from time to time. By the time I took a deep dive and really got into Ween, Claude had moved on from his position for reasons I dont remember.

I have nothing but fond memories of working with him. He was always really relaxed and helpful and even though he is Weens drummer, the guy can sing. Years later, I moved away from NJ and realized Ween wasnt some smalltime local band like I had thought. This band had fans everywhere I went. I saw the Boognish in his sticker form in various cities on the east coast and Texas. The older I get, the more it feels like I met a real life legend.

Im sure Claude doesnt remember every one of his students, and thats perfectly okay. I find solace in knowing I was indirectly touched and directed by the boognish."
16btjtm,1,2023-09-06,"Student uses ChatGPT to create a completely wrong assignment, then tried to “Life Hack” my syllabus",u/BabypintoJuniorLube,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/16btjtm/student_uses_chatgpt_to_create_a_completely_wrong/,"Our industry uses a very specific type of technical writing and we present in class. Today a student clearly used AI, but didn’t even attempt to have it write in the format, length or any basics of our super niche industry standards. I call then out, saying A) this is so poorly formatted and completely opposite the style we are learning that we can’t continue presenting it to the class and B) I’m pretty sure you used ChatGPT but I won’t dock you for that since the other issues are so much bigger. 
They completely denied using AI and then ignored the most substantial part of my comments and focused only on the fact that I don’t have a specific AI policy in my syllabus. They start emailing my chair and others while I’m still in lecture thinking they have a trump card.
Firstly, it’s not against any rules. My industry is going to be heavily effected by AI so we are embracing it- many of our projects involve AI. But you used AI to make something so completely wrong! 
Our documents are so technical that I would not consider it academic dishonestly to use AI for an outline or even the whole document in some cases, but they turned in essentially a poorly written novella.
It’s like I asked you to go to the store and get me some apples, and you stole oranges and are hung up on the fact I never told you not to steal. Like I don’t give a shit where it came from, I just need some apples. Luckily my admin have my backs but needed to rant."

I am a special education teacher that has students with a wide variety of needs in a small rural school. This year year I gained two students with intensive needs and I pretty much have to make up a whole program for them. 

I had Gemini discreet video modeling recommended to me by a colleague. I tried a free trial and it was very helpful support for teaching positive behaviors, receptive language and mimicking sounds. It’s low prep and it’s great for the 1 on 1 paras to play for them before I teach the lesson on the subject. Unfortunately it’s very expensive and my school district refused to pay for it. Does anyone have any suggestions for cheaper alternatives?"

I remember my grade 11 teacher was always talking about how it was so obvious when her students would use chatgpt but i used it for every single one of my assignments and she would always use MY ASSIGNMENTS as good examples during class. Its so bogus that english is the only mandatory course in grade 12 yet it is also the most subjective and like honestly 50% based off of teacher, 40% based off of what they think of you, and 10% based off of how well you can actually write.

16c75nz,1,2023-09-07,Kaori Nishedake and the Proverbial Mountain (LONG),u/Zoegrace1,Sims4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sims4/comments/16c75nz/kaori_nishedake_and_the_proverbial_mountain_long/,"This is a retelling of something very weird and eventually moving that happened in my Sims save where I'm trying to do generational gameplay for the first time w/out cheats. I can't call it a legacy because apparently a legacy challenge has restrictive rules and I would have violated those rules before my matriarch and patriarch even had children. Anyway, before I begin, be warned that part of this story involves MCCC's default settings + Neighbourhood Stories causing terrible things to happen in the background, specifically causing a premade to predate on teenagers offscreen.

Screenshots of happenings will become more and more frequent as when this started happening I didn't think to take any.

**PROLOGUE**

My matriarch Nall Sotha met with Miko Ojo at the Spice Festival grinding out cooking.

Miko was very pregnant (third trimester) and I thought they could be good friends thus sent Nall to talk with Miko at her home.

In the hallway I noticed Darling Walsh hanging outside and clicked on her in MCCC to see... she had a child?

&#x200B;

Nall went inside and I saw that there were two bassinets, one for Miko's baby and another for Darling's. My initial thought was ""wait, is Akiro starting a sex cult and having children with both Miko and Darling"" and checked, seeing that in fact, Akiro was not the father of Darling's child.

The father of Darling's child is in fact, Young Adult J. Huntington III.

I click through J. Huntington on the family tree to see that he has three other children, and see that *all of the mothers are teenagers* and realize what I've stumbled on by accident. Distressingly, Darling also has *no clue who J. Huntington III is.*

I had made the decision that if Akiro was the parent of Darling's child I would be moving both her and Miko in with Nall and Garyn Redas (patriarch), but given the parent of Darling's child is not living with her, nor someone she knows, I make the decision I'm not metagaming and can't do anything with this, or the information that my game generated a *serial child predator.*

Though, I check back later after receiving a notification that the Roomies household has adopted a child and find J. Huntington III's family tree looked like this, the right-most infant having been adopted after her mother Kayla Flemming tragically died of rage.

https://preview.redd.it/r1njkeoscrmb1.png?width=392&format=png&auto=webp&s=59757aa42cf69900808c2ecd96855def438aacd1

I click through the family tree and see the infant with sunglasses has the mother Kaori Nishedake, and continue to not metagame, though with horror.

**KAORI NISHEDAKE**

Nall got surprise house invaded by a group of local teenagers in their house in Mt Komorebi 6-4-1 Hanamigawa. I don't really understand why sims can just kind of invade your house uninvited but it happened. Ash Karjo and Noah Kane had showed up alongside Kaori Nishedake.

I had Garyn start a hotpot downstairs for everyone because I love hotpot but also I couldn't find the ask to leave option anywhere in the new menus so just opted to deal with it. After Ash and Noah left, Kaori hung around longer than any of the other people, eating hotpot alone downstairs. I felt bad for her and checked her household, finding out she had not one, but *two infants,* and that she was *alone.*

**THE PROVERBIAL MOUNTAIN**

According to the wiki, Kaori Nishedake starts the game living with her elderly grandparents after having lost her parents in an accident. Apparently, her grandparents had since died, leaving her alone with her infant Alberto and her infant great uncle Iker to take care of all on her own.

I made the decision to move Nall and Garyn in with her to help support her and help take care of the children.

From there, I notice that Kaori has the eating for two moodlet and realize she was pregnant *again.* I use MCCC to check who the father is and see it's Kyle Kyleson this time, who again she has no relationship with.

Nall pays for the termination of her pregnancy seeing as she's already dealing with *a lot.* I set up a crib in her room for Alberto and age up her great uncle to a toddler to relieve some of the pressure, especially since he isn't actually her child...

I move the graves of Shigeru and Sachiko outside to a proper resting place under the tree.

I also later notice that Kaori has a fear of the dark due to being afraid of 'monsters'.

https://preview.redd.it/z7arok50frmb1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd6028e18c74c8ce84b2ccbf7c53f406f38f8d20

Late at night after everyone in the house has gone to sleep, Kaori communes with the ghost of her grandmother over tea. Sadly, her grandmother does not recognize her.

Despite all this, I notice Kaori is Cheerful, and realize she is in fact, absolutely unkillable to have shouldered what she's gone through. After communing with her grandparents, she sleeps until 2pm the next day while Garyn and Nall help take care of Alberto and Iker.

[A day of the life in Kaori Nishedake](https://preview.redd.it/fnhlxi1nfrmb1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=edf6d8f71f0b3c3c0c386e24ebf4bd65f1657384)

\[I also shortly get a notification that the Roomies household has adopted *another* child, yes, another child of J. Huntington III. This time, the mother of the child wasn't a teenager, though I can't say when the baby was born. The mother died in a fire and I cannot remember who she was besides that she was a Sulani premade and a food critic.\]

I age up Iker into a child skipping much of the toddler stage so he becomes easier to handle alongside an infant, again, he isn't even Kaori's child, he's her great uncle and effectively a sibling.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/96mmmpobgrmb1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7adac4a00d24593009e9b92263c28534f1292656

Iker communes with the spirits of his parents and chooses to release their spirits to the nether world.

And then, suddenly...

https://preview.redd.it/lq8w6jtggrmb1.png?width=1297&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c896885fd4682809092ffe29a96598353df7ca3

He had the audacity to come to the door.

&#x200B;

[\(I thought giving him a shower surrounded by glass windows would force embarrassment moodlets from wetting himself would cause embarrassment moodlets to stack until he died of humiliation, it didn't work\)](https://preview.redd.it/oc2j01tjgrmb1.png?width=551&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd9e6f37705e47286994c42566da4c0b27c8a215)

I take a break from the game to investigate Kaori's namesake from the game SSX Tricky my partner used to play. In SSX Tricky, a snowboarding racing game, each playable characters has a set of friends and rivals, and when in a match against a rival, the characters will have a cutscene trash talking each other. Kaori Nishidake's rival is the embodiment of nu metal Psymon, and whereas most rival cutscenes consist of the characters trash talking each other, Kaori just appears to be genuinely afraid of Psymon while he does Korn impressions at her.

[\\""Oh nooooo!\\""](https://preview.redd.it/w22gckpuirmb1.png?width=1330&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5bed9b088d397cb7c52aa0f7faa215a6646c365)

Poor Kaori can never catch a break anywhere, I learn.

The game repeatedly admonishes Kaori for only getting a C in high school and I decide to follow her to school hoping Garyn (who quit his engineering job to help take care of Kaori's child and great uncle) might do a better job taking care of an infant and a toddler while the home lot isn't loaded, but also so Kaori can get good grades without having to spend time on homework when her infant is screaming.

At school I notice there are a fair amount of pregnant teens and wonder genuinely what the fuck is going on. Cassandra Goth was pregnant with twins (father being Kiyoshi Ito, another teenager), so I clear the pregnancy in mercy and go down to the school PCs to see what the fuck MCCC is doing.

&#x200B;

[Yeah this makes sense](https://preview.redd.it/ygd14970krmb1.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=d54b4ef67e3d18e37a3935f43b5a9b0b2100d37d)

I set it to 2% and click around the other teenage girls and find that the majority of them have children or are pregnant and opt I need to right this error and spend an evening going through CAS deleting infants and starving babies so not literally every teenager in my save is pregnant or with sometimes multiple children.

Kaori quickly becomes a B student.

J. Huntington III eventually starves to death in his 2x1 room.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xv9btggpkrmb1.png?width=749&format=png&auto=webp&s=accabe6bddddd1ba8b99e694cccc0a8976da5740

Kaori releases his spirit from his gravestone immediately and destroys his grave.

I get tired of dealing with Alberto and age him up to an toddler, then a child as I couldn't deal with more toddler nonsense.

https://preview.redd.it/ywxh3o9wkrmb1.png?width=817&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d3b0b88762c8db9e948d5117bb2483169f2bbb6

I rename Alberto to Mackenzie Nishedake, after one of the friends of Kaori's namesake. Kaori very shortly receives the opportunity to graduate high school early and she takes it!

I officiate Kaori as an Honoured Cousin to House Sotha, and focus her towards achieving her dream of snowboarding and rock climbing.

https://preview.redd.it/o7hou156lrmb1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=676082490229072f0fe3eaa96e63cb4eb1fe1ea6

Deceased parents, deceased grandparents and caregivers, left with two children to take care of, one from sexual assault, and having almost had a third to take care of also from sexual assault, Kaori peeks her head above the clouds and graduates high school early, the children left in her care now old enough to go to school. She has climbed her first mountain.

**THE LITERAL MOUNTAIN**

Kaori Nishedake's dream is extreme sports. That aspiration includes scaling to the very top of Mt. Komorebi. Already a very skilled snowboarder, this puts her next goal to reach the freezing peak of the mountain that towers over her every day.

This is her climb to adulthood, and she will succeed and stand on the summit of that mountain, or she will fall to the cold and die.

Of course, she can't climb a mountain alone, and why just seek out a random adult to help take her up?

So Kaori starts a club of her teenage classmates who are/were/could have been teen mothers to train and climb the mountain with her.

I initially add Yuki Behr before finding she actually hates exercising and rock climbing and so quickly kick her and replace her with Darling Walsh as Yuki's probably not going to be very happy to climb a mountain in the end anyway.

[I wish these things didn't break in rain.](https://preview.redd.it/kzrovoxbmrmb1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=239c481d88bb896be5263ec77254a96a14c61b9e)

In the middle of this Great Grind I get a moodlet saying that Kaori is *starting* puberty and I become very sad if she's that young.

Morgan Fyres becomes best friends with Kaori and while on a fateful trip to the fashion district... she meets with Kyle Kyleson trying to order food from a stall and chews him tf out.

Kaori reaches a high enough rock climbing level to scale Mt. Komorebi and invites everyone in the MOUNTAIN CLIMBERS club to Chez Llama to enjoy what might be their final meal. The selected participants come to be Morgan Fyres, Cassandra Goth, and Darling Walsh.

The night before, Kaori tells her son she may not return from her journey and goes to bed... but not before finding the restaurant gave her *food poisoning* which delays getting to sleep, and she wakes up on the morning of the climb with her sleep bar not full up.

**THE CLIMB**

The weather at the foot of the mountain is a snow thunderstorm. I briefly consider turning back, but recognize they must make this climb. They will reach adulthood or they will die.

The climb is difficult, especially for Kaori, but halfway up the mountain the snowstorm clears for sunshine.

They thankfully have sunlight for the final wall and all scale it with no problem... but as they're walking to the trail marker, the snowstorm starts again!

1. Unable to emigrate immediately, I got a teaching offer from a private college, I consider it as a transitional job, as my primary goal is to move to another country, so in this period I'll learn foreign languages and get healthier and stronger besides doing my primary job.
2. Unlike the US, most private schools in China are deemed to be at the lowest level in the educational hierarchy, and compared to ""university"", ""college"" is seen as inferior.
3. From 2, we can conclude that it's not a good school, and unsurprisingly, this teaching offer is not well paid, but as the economy and job market are getting worse, it's still a acceptable job.
4. Though the birth rate is declining, this college now has highest number of students in history(not a long history, though)

BTW, I asked **chatGPT** to **proofread** the paragraphs above, and here is the revised version:

**Proofread version:**

1. Currently unable to emigrate, I have accepted a teaching offer from a private college in China. I view this as a transitional job, as my primary goal is to move abroad. In the meantime, I plan to focus on learning foreign languages and improving my health and strength, in addition to my teaching duties.
2. In contrast to the US, private colleges in China are often considered to be at the bottom of the educational hierarchy, seen as inferior to universities. Consequently, this teaching position does not offer high compensation.
3. Despite the low prestige and pay associated with this college, it's an acceptable job in the present economic climate and job market.
4. Interestingly, despite a declining birth rate, this college currently boasts its highest student enrollment in its history, albeit a short one."
16ceh3b,1,2023-09-07,What is the difference between paid and free plagiarism checkers?,u/PlagiarismCheck_org,u_PlagiarismCheck_org,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_PlagiarismCheck_org/comments/16ceh3b/what_is_the_difference_between_paid_and_free/,"Checking for plagiarism is about scanning all the possible sources in available databases and finding similarities. 

Free checkers have limited access to available sources to scan for similarities. For instance, it’s needed to pay for every request to the search engine. Therefore, free checkers may not pay for that access, which means they may miss out on flagging similarities in a big segment of sources. 

https://preview.redd.it/ahzacev6ttmb1.png?width=636&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e57a3736873557483d90c730ad939b7e441a901

**Student: Okay, what if I am OK with the free checker?**

Probably, your institution has a paid similarity checker, so you may not predict the outcome of how your assignment will be checked by it. Paid plagiarism checkers find additional similarities that a free plagiarism checker can miss so that you may get into trouble. A lot of ideas or sentences may have already been published, and it’s completely okay, but getting accused of plagiarism without intending to plagiarize is not the case you want to participate in. Moreover, uploading your texts to free plagiarism checkers could result in your work being misused. Additionally, a paid checker might detect 100% similarity to the leaked website, complicating authorship proof for a student.

**Teachers: Okay, what if we are OK with the free checker?**

Usually, free checkers' privacy settings are questionable, the last thing you want is for your students’ works to be leaked to the network where anyone can use it for other purposes.

With the emergence of ChatGPT,  fighting with new AI cheating methods became a hot topic, so the work should be checked for plagiarism and AI simultaneously. Of course, it is more convenient when the same product provides both services: similarity and AI checking.

**All your arguments are on the side of the paid checker, and you are promoting your product.** 

We understand that it may sound like that, but many things in life may be worth considering some investing in because such services cannot be provided in full for free. Indeed, we understand that sometimes, using paid services is not affordable. In this case, it’s better to use a free checker than not to use any. However, since the university is a community, you may find other students struggling with the same issues and cooperate with them."

16cgg4o,1,2023-09-07,CheatGPT in Intro to Programming,u/AFK_MIA,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/16cgg4o/cheatgpt_in_intro_to_programming/,"I teach an introduction to python programming course - and so ultimately ChatGPT has most of the early class assignments figured out, and as far as I can tell, there's not much I can do about that.   


On my last two assignments I've had 3 (out of 4) students turn in code that I was suspicious of\* (see below) - so my questions for fellow programming professors are:  


&#x200B;

1) What amount of ""proof"" would you be looking for before you decide that a student cheated on an assignment? I'm the only programming instructor at my institution - so I'll need to be able to explain this to people who aren't familiar with the field. 

  
2) Any suggestions for making assignments ChatGPT-resistant?  


&#x200B;

\*What tipped me off:  
Three students submitted nearly identical code that:

1) Created an unnecessary class that wasn't asked for by the assignment. We've only had one lecture on creating classes. Why would they all create the same/similar unnecessary class?

2) Created several supporting functions. This would be good coding practices - but I'm suspicious that it's ""too good"" to be true. I'm additionally suspicious that the students miraculously came up with the same names for these supporting functions.

3) Implemented an ""if \_\_main\_\_  ==""\_\_\_name\_\_"":"" - this was unnecessary for the assignment and actually makes the overall assignment not run correctly. We haven't discussed this aspect of python at all yet.

4) They all wrote a weird loop: ""for \_ in range(n):"" That underscore is technically legal syntax and could be justified by PEP-8 standards - but it's odd and certainly not something we've discussed in class. The textbook doesn't seem to do this anywhere either. Again, this is an issue of ""Why would they all do the same weird thing in the same way at the same place?""

5) They correctly programmed the ""hard"" parts but not the ""easy"" parts that are necessary to tailor a general solution to the actual assignment (e.g. they successfully traversed a linked list and deleted nodes, but didn't actually do the comparison they were asked to make). They again, all made the same mistake.

  
Of course, I then copied my prompt into ChatGPT and its output was nearly identical to what was turned in. There was some variation, but I'd estimate there was at least an 80% overlap between what ChatGPT gave me and between each of these student assignments. "

GenAI apparatuses, for example, ChatGPT, attract designs language, and information to produce anything from papers to recordings to numerical computations that hastily look like human work, prodding discussion of the extraordinary change in many fields including the scholarly world.

Scholastics are among the people who could confront an existential danger assuming man-made intelligence can repeat — at a lot quicker speeds — research right now finished by people.

It’s constantly bringing in new features, products, and ideas to optimize AI for the future. Here’s a quick rundown of OpenAI’s recent activities and achievements.  


* **ChatGPT-4 diagnosed a 1 in 100,000 condition in seconds**  
\- Dr. Isaac Kohane, a physician and computer scientist at Harvard, has tested the newest artificial intelligence model, GPT-4, in a medical setting. According to his findings, GPT-4 performs better than many doctors, as it can answer medical exam licensing questions correctly more than 90% of the time, translate information for patients, and give doctors helpful suggestions about bedside manner.  
\- Kohane tested GPT-4 on a real-life case and found that it could correctly diagnose a rare condition just as he would with all his years of experience. However, GPT-4 isn't always reliable, and his latest book ‘The AI Revolution in Medicine’ is filled with examples of its blunders, ranging from clerical errors to math mistakes.  
\- Kohane is both impressed and horrified, as he cannot figure out how to guarantee or certify that GPT-4's advice would be safe or effective.
* **Yokosuka, Japan makes history as the first to employ AI-powered Chatbot in its municipal offices**  
\- Yokosuka becomes the first Japanese municipality to use OpenAI’s ChatGPT in municipal offices, as part of a one-month trial involving 4000 employees aimed at improving administrative tasks. With a declining population and limited employees, the city is hoping to use AI tools to free up human resources for tasks that require personal attention.  
\- The hope is to use ChatGPT to assist in tasks like summarization, marketing copy ideation, drafting administrative documents, and perfecting easy-to-understand language. The move comes as the Japanese government is exploring AI's potential use for government administrative tasks.  

* **The House of Representatives gets 40 ChatGPT Plus subscriptions to experiment with AI**  
\- Congressional offices have started experimenting with AI. The House of Representatives' digital service has obtained 40 Licenses for ChatGPT Plus, which were distributed earlier this month. The House recently created a new AI working group for staff to test and share AI tools in the congressional office environment.  
\- According to an internal AI Working Group email, the AI tool is expected to be used for various day-to-day tasks and key responsibilities. Some potential applications include generating drafts for constituent responses and press documents, summarizing text in speeches, drafting policy papers or even bills, and creating logos or graphical elements for branded office resources.
* **OpenAI releases Shap·E, a generative AI tool that produces 3D Outputs in seconds!**  
\- OpenAI has released a new project called Shap·E, a conditional generative model designed to generate 3D assets using implicit functions that can be rendered as textured meshes or neural radiance fields.  
\- Shap·E was trained using a large dataset of paired 3D assets and their corresponding textual descriptions. An encoder was used to map 3D assets into the parameters of an implicit function, and a conditional diffusion model was used to learn the conditional distribution of the implicit function parameters given the input data. It has demonstrated remarkable performance in producing high-quality outputs in just seconds.
* **ChatGPT Plus, with superpowers of web browsing & 70+ Plugins**  
**-** The latest release notes of ChatGPT highlight various updates and new features added to the model, such as the ability to turn off chat history, export data, and use AI plugins. In addition, there are updates on the model's performance, factuality, and mathematical capabilities.  
\- ChatGPT Plus subscribers get early access to experimental features, such as the ability to choose between different versions of ChatGPT and new experimental models that can browse the internet and use third-party services.
* **ChatGPT in your pocket: OpenAI brings ChatGPT to iPhone**  
\- OpenAI has released the ChatGPT app for iOS that allows users to have engaging and personalized conversations with an AI language model. It will sync your conversations, support voice input, and bring the latest model improvements to your fingertips. Also, ChatGPT Plus subscribers get exclusive access to GPT-4’s capabilities, early access to features, and faster response times, all on iOS.  
\- They have started the rollout in the US and are expected to enter additional countries in the coming weeks. OpenAI said: “Android users, you're next!”
* **OpenAI to grant $1,000,000 to democratize AI**  
\- OpenAI has announced a program to award ten $100,000 grants for experiments aimed at developing democratic processes to govern the rules and behaviors of AI systems.  
\- Recognizing the far-reaching impact of AI technologies on society, OpenAI encourages applicants to create innovative proof-of-concepts for a system that incorporates diverse perspectives and is shaped by public interest. The program is specifically designed to address questions about AI behavior, such as the conditions under which AI should criticize public figures or how it should represent disputed views.  
\- Applicants are encouraged to submit their proposals by June 24, 2023, and may choose from a list of policy questions or propose their own.
* **Open AI’s latest idea can help models do math with 78% accuracy**  
\- Even SoTA models today are prone to hallucinations, which can be particularly problematic in domains that require multi-step reasoning. To train more reliable models, OpenAI trained a model by rewarding each correct step of reasoning (“process supervision”) instead of simply rewarding the correct final answer (“outcome supervision”).  
\- It was found that process supervision significantly outperforms outcome supervision for training models to solve problems from challenging MATH datasets. The model in the experiment solved 78% of problems from a representative subset of the MATH test set.  
\- Additionally, process supervision also has an important alignment benefit: it directly trains the model to produce a chain-of-thought that is endorsed by humans.
* **OpenAI announces $1M Cybersecurity Grant Program to boost AI-powered security**  
\- OpenAI is launching the Cybersecurity Grant Program—a $1M initiative to boost and quantify AI-powered cybersecurity capabilities and to foster high-level AI and cybersecurity discourse. The goal is to work with defenders across the globe to change the power dynamics of cybersecurity through the application of AI and the coordination of like-minded individuals working for collective safety.   
\- OpenAI has also shared a few general project ideas while sharing the news. Moreover, it will prioritize projects intended to be licensed or distributed for maximal public benefit and sharing.
* **OpenAI’s massive update on GPT-3.5 & GPT-4 APIs**  
\- OpenAI announced exciting updates, including more steerable API models, function calling capabilities, longer context, and lower prices.   
\- Function calling is now available to enable LLMs to work more effectively and efficiently interact with your programs/tools.    
\- The latest GPT-3.5-Turbo model is available with support for 16K context (\~20 pages of text)
* **ChatGPT builds robots: New research**  
\- Microsoft Research presents an experimental study using OpenAI’s ChatGPT for robotics applications. It outlines a strategy that combines design principles for prompt engineering and the creation of a high-level function library that allows ChatGPT to adapt to different robotics tasks, simulators, and form factors.  
\- The study encompasses a range of tasks within the robotics domain, from basic logical, geometrical, and mathematical reasoning to complex domains such as aerial navigation, manipulation, and embodied agents.  
\- Microsoft also released PromptCraft, an open-source platform where anyone can share examples of good prompting schemes for robotics applications.
* **OpenAI’s Superalignment - The next big goal!**  
\- OpenAI has launched Superalignment, a project dedicated to addressing the challenge of aligning artificial superintelligence with human intent. Over the next four years, 20% of OpenAI's computing power will be allocated to this endeavor. The project aims to develop scientific and technical breakthroughs by creating an AI-assisted automated alignment researcher.   
\- This researcher will evaluate AI systems, automate searches for problematic behavior, and test alignment pipelines. Superalignment will comprise a team of leading machine learning researchers and engineers open to collaborating with talented individuals interested in solving the issue of aligning superintelligence.
* **OpenAI makes GPT-4 API and Code Interpreter available**  
\- GPT-4 API is now available to all paying OpenAI API customers. GPT-3.5 Turbo, DALL·E, and Whisper APIs are also now generally available, and OpenAI is announcing a deprecation plan for some of the older models, which will retire beginning of 2024.  
\- Moreover, OpenAI’s Code Interpreter will be available to all ChatGPT Plus users over the next week. It lets ChatGPT run code, optionally with access to files you've uploaded. You can also ask ChatGPT to analyze data, create charts, edit files, perform math, etc.
* **OpenAI enters partnership to make ChatGPT smarter**  
\- The Associated Press (AP) and OpenAI have agreed to collaborate and share select news content and technology. OpenAI will license part of AP's text archive, while AP will leverage OpenAI's technology and product expertise. The collaboration aims to explore the potential use cases of generative AI in news products and services.  
\- AP has been using AI technology for nearly a decade to automate tasks and improve journalism. Both organizations believe in the responsible creation and use of AI systems and will benefit from each other's expertise. AP continues to prioritize factual, nonpartisan journalism and the protection of intellectual property.
* **OpenAI doubles GPT-4 message cap to 50**  
\- OpenAI has doubled the number of messages ChatGPT Plus subscribers can send to GPT-4. Users can now send up to 50 messages in 3 hours, compared to the previous limit of 25 messages in 2 hours. And they are rolling out this update next week.
* **ChatGPT will now remember who you are & what you want**  
\- OpenAI is rolling out custom instructions to give you more control over how ChatGPT responds. It allows you to add preferences or requirements that you’d like ChatGPT to consider when generating its responses.  
\- ChatGPT will remember and consider the instructions every time it responds in the future, so you won’t have to repeat your preferences or information. Currently available in beta in the Plus plan, the feature will expand to all users in the coming weeks.
* **Worldcoin by OpenAI’s CEO will confirm your humanity**  
\- OpenAI’s Sam Altman has launched a new crypto project called Worldcoin. It consists of a privacy-preserving digital identity (World ID) and, where laws allow, a digital currency (WLD) received simply for being human.   
\- You will receive the World ID after visiting an Orb, a biometric verification device. The Orb devices verify human identity by scanning people's eyes, which Altman suggests is necessary due to the growing threat posed by AI.
* **OpenAI is rolling out new updates to improve ChatGPT**  
\- OpenAI is shipping out a bunch of small updates over the next week to improve the ChatGPT experience. Here’s a tl;dr  
1. Prompt examples: At the beginning of a new chat, you will now see examples to help you get started.  
2. Suggested replies: ChatGPT will suggest relevant ways to continue your conversation.   
3. GPT-4 by default: When starting a new chat as a Plus user, ChatGPT will remember your previously selected model – no more defaulting back to GPT-3.5.  
4. Upload multiple files: Now, ChatGPT can analyze data and generate insights across multiple files.  
5. Stay logged in: You’ll no longer be logged out every 2 weeks!  
6. Keyboard shortcuts: Work faster with shortcuts, like ⌘ (Ctrl) + Shift + ; to copy last code block. Try ⌘ (Ctrl) + / to see the complete list.
* **ChatGPT’s emotional awareness is more than humans'. What?**  
\- A study found that ChatGPT has higher emotional awareness than humans. The machine was subjected to a standardized test measuring human emotional awareness and scored significantly higher. The test required participants to show empathy in fictional scenarios.   
\- ChatGPT outperformed humans in all categories, achieving an overall score of 85 compared to 56 for men and 59 for women. The researchers suggest that ChatGPT could be helpful in psychotherapy, cognitive training, and diagnosing mental illness. Previous studies have shown that people perceive ChatGPT's responses as more empathetic than medical professionals.
* **OpenAI launches a web crawler to train ChatGPT**  
\- Called GPTBot, the crawler will comb through the internet to train and enhance AI's capabilities. It can be identified by the following user agent and string.  
\- Web pages crawled with the GPTBot user agent may potentially be used to improve future models and are filtered to remove sources that require paywall access, are known to gather personally identifiable information (PII), or have text that violates our policies.   
\- Moreover, OpenAI also revealed how websites can prevent GPTBot from accessing their sites, either partially or by opting out entirely.
* **GPT-4 to replace content moderators**  
\- OpenAI aims to use its GPT-4 to solve the challenge of content moderation at scale. Also, they already used GPT-4 to develop and refine their own content policies. It provides three major benefits: consistent judgments, faster policy development, and improved worker well-being. However, perfect content moderation remains elusive, as both humans and machines make mistakes, particularly in handling misleading or aggressive content.  
\- GPT-4 can interpret complex policy documentation and adapt instantly to updates, reducing the cycle from months to hours. This AI-assisted approach offers a positive future for digital platforms, where AI can help moderate online traffic and relieve the burden on human moderators.
* **GPT-4 Code Interpreter masters math with self-verification**  
\- OpenAI's GPT-4 Code Interpreter has shown remarkable performance on challenging math datasets. This is largely attributed to its step-by-step code generation and dynamic solution refinement based on code execution outcomes.  
\- Expanding on this understanding, new research has introduced the innovative explicit code-based self-verification (CSV) prompt, which leverages GPT4-Code’s advanced code generation mechanism. This prompt guides the model to verify the answer and then reevaluate its solution with code.  
\- The approach achieves an impressive accuracy of 84.32% on the MATH dataset, significantly outperforming the base GPT4-Code and previous state-of-the-art methods.
* **OpenAI enables fine-tuning for GPT-3.5 Turbo**  
\- OpenAI has launched fine-tuning for GPT-3.5 Turbo. Fine-tuning lets you train the model on your company's data and run it at scale. Early tests have shown a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5 Turbo can match, or even outperform, base GPT-4-level capabilities on certain narrow tasks. Here are the fine-tuning steps:  
\- OpenAI also said that none of fine-tuning data, input or output, will be used to train models outside of the client company. And that fine-tuning support for GPT-4 will arrive sometime later this fall.
* **OpenAI launches ChatGPT Enterprise, the most powerful ChatGPT version yet**  
\- Open has launched ChatGPT Enterprise, the most powerful version of ChatGPT yet. It offers enterprise-grade security and privacy, features for large-scale deployments, unlimited higher-speed GPT-4 access, 32K context for faster processing of longer inputs, advanced data analysis capabilities, customization options, and much more. OpenAI is also working on more features and will launch them soon.
* **OpenAI's ChatGPT enters classrooms**  
\- OpenAI has released a guide for teachers using ChatGPT in their classroom. This guide includes suggested prompts, explanations about ChatGPT's functionality and limitations, as well as insights into AI detectors and bias.  
\- The company also highlights stories of educators successfully using ChatGPT to enhance student learning and provides prompts to help teachers get started. Additionally, their FAQ section offers further resources and answers to common questions about teaching with and about AI.

16cmp9v,1,2023-09-07,"Multiple doctoral students in my cohort are using AI to produce blog posts, qualitative coding, etc - Should I report to advisor/professor(s)?",u/NoPatNoDontSitonThat,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/16cmp9v/multiple_doctoral_students_in_my_cohort_are_using/,"I'm in my third semester of a doctoral program in a social science field (education). Multiple students are using ChatGPT to do some of their assignments. For example, our student blog posts for weekly seminar discussions are *obviously* AI-written. I've used multiple AI writing check websites that are all showing 75%+ of their writing is AI. I've cross-checked with my own and other students' posts who don't appear to be AI. All of our posts are showing up 80%+ human-generated on every site. 

Last year, I personally observed someone sitting next to me run discussion questions through ChatGPT during class. He also generated AND coded an interview right before class began. We were supposed to conduct a real interview, transcribe it, and code it. We had a month to complete the assignment, and he did it in five minutes. It was totally fabricated. 

Now, I get that it's not my responsibility to enforce any kind of ethics or plagiarism policies at the university. The professors can pursue it if they want to, and I certainly don't want to interject myself or get myself into any hot water by bringing it up. 

But here's the issue: We regularly have group assignments (in 9 courses, I can think of at least 7 group assignments at some point during the semester). I am now paired for the fourth time with people who are doing absolutely nothing for the group project.  Zilch. Last spring, I literally typed up a script for a partner to read during a presentation, and he got credit and praise from the professor for ""his"" portion of the assignment. Absolutely boiled my brain because I spent hours doing all of it.

So now I'm in a group, and two of my partners haven't done anything yet. I stayed up late last night making sure we had our first portion completed. 

I know I can report this to the professor. I've avoided it because I feel like it's not responsibility and it would look bad to make any accusations, especially if they prove to be unfounded. But it's getting frustrating because my coursework experience is negatively affected when I've been paired with others who either aren't doing anything or are skating by using AI programs. 

There are five members of my nine-member cohort that seem to be doing this. 

Suggestions? Grit and bear it? Report it to a professor?"

The decline during the summer could be due to lower usage by high school and college students during their summer vacations.

👉 According to analytics platform Similarweb, ChatGPT remains one of the largest sites in the world with 1.4 billion visits, with the strongest month so far being May 2023 with 1.8 billion visits.

👉 September may see a spike in usage as students increasingly use ChatGPT as a learning and writing tool. ChatGPT Enterprise is a new business version that may not be included in Similarweb tracking.

They literally spend all the time in class talking to these things. Everyone seems pretty okay with it. The only conversation in class is each of them comparing their favourite chatbot, and arguing about whether stuff like replika or paradot or some other bot is better. I don't understand what they are talking about half the time but many of them always have one of these things open on their laptop. Is this normal?

  
PS: I am not talking about chatGPT which I actually encourage my students to get familiar with. I am talking about websites (kind of like video games) which have provacative avatars you can talk to.

My last employer left me $1000 in debt due to complications (he didn't pay me and it costs too much to sue his Polish company). So I am seriously in need of critique! 

If anyone has good examples for creating a portfolio and critique for my resume please do!

I am highly embarrassed to be posting this but it comforts me to know that many others are in the same boat and in desperate need of help.

My skills are 3D Design and Mastery of Adobe Suite, English is my native language and I hold multiple citizenships and speak Arabic French and English (learning Turkish) fluently without any accent. I understand that being a university student maybe a red flag to employers, so I want input on that as well!

A big thing I have faced is when people learn that I am 19 they refuse to accept any of my experience as it is when I have ways to back up everything on my resume and website. My life has been really rough lately and I wish I could just land even an internship in my niche ... 

In the meantime I have worked with emerging technologies, help booked calls with and for multimillion $ startups, helped different friends with their startups in the Aerospace Defense Sector, Biomanufacturing Sector, and Virtual Reality Sector, as well as produced Udemy content for students which has helped with my revenue stream.

Oh, and this is a given but there will be spoilers for Three Houses (and almost none for Revelation).

With the introduction out of the way, let’s set the relevant context:

# Fire Emblem Fates, and Revelation

[Fates' artwork was something else man...](https://preview.redd.it/h2f3rx18k4nb1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f7e202bf8b681fdc7369e47af51b422b1f77cd3)

Fire Emblem Fates was released back in 2015 in Japan, and 2016 Internationally for the 3DS. [One aspect marketing made sure everyone would know about *was its branching story*](https://serenesforest.net/2015/06/16/e3-fire-emblem-now-fire-emblem-fates/). And while before Three Houses, Fire Emblem was no stranger to the idea (given games like Binding Blade and Sacred Stones had branching paths which converge later), **no game beforehand had previously based its entire narrative on this idea.** 

[Fates was advertised with two main routes which, unless you had the Special Edition, Korean, or Digital version of the game, were sold in separate cartridges](https://serenesforest.net/2015/06/16/fire-emblem-fates-releasing-two-separate-versions-west/): **Birthright,** in which Corrin supports the Japanese-inspired Hoshido opposing Nohr’s invasion; and **Conquest**, where instead Corrin’s loyalty falls to the Western-themed Nohr seeking to invade Hoshido. [A third path, **Revelation**, was also announced ahead of time, but not much was said about it beyond being a third option where Corrin sides with no one, and players would need to pay for it](https://serenesforest.net/2015/04/01/fire-emblem-official-site-snippets/) sometime after Birthright & Conquest’s launch *unless* they got the Special Edition (good luck getting it through legal means nowadays, given the E-Shop’s dead and all).

Either way, regardless of the story chosen/bought, **the plot’s main goal always lies in finding a way to end the war between the 2 main factions.** Of the three stories, **Revelation is the only one where by the end, the solution reached allows both sides to come out relatively unscathed, while also directly dealing with the main source driving the war**. This is why in the developer interview quoted, the devs talk about *Revelation being perceived as the correct path*.

In contrast, Three Houses has no such solution, nor were the developers - by their admission - interested in making it happen. As a matter of fact, I dare say that if one analyzes all the key pieces and the nature of their involvement with the game’s conflict, we can find instead ***three roadblocks*** complicating the possibility of a Revelation-like route ever happening. 

These, for those wondering, are the following:

# 1. Edelgard: Agency, and Rise to Power

[She who commands her crimson destiny.](https://preview.redd.it/qj1bvyw9k4nb1.png?width=904&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b67c63a8f363d15709e730e376586cbf997c757)

Silver Snow’s starting point from a story perspective is the conflict between Byleth and Edelgard ([according to the game’s director](https://serenesforest.net/2020/03/24/three-houses-nintendo-dream-interview-reveals-first-route-claudes-real-name/)), with the latter going from a big ally and deuteragonist during the first half of the story, to a major antagonist. *Edelgard’s character, and her circumstances in which she assumes this role***, is the story’s first identifiable roadblock.**

As a quick backstory recap: [In Imperial Year 1174](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/characters/2/Edelgard/basics), Thales (post body-snatching Lord Arundel) leaves the Kingdom along with Edelgard, and [establishes a public partnership with the Adrestian Prime Minister Ludwig von Aegir](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/library/6) [under his Arundel disguise](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/supports/Byleth/Hubert/B#event-41). With the assistance of House Vestra, Ludwig – in secret – had Edelgard and her siblings captured, and allowed his Agarthan partners to experiment on the Hresvelg children for the sake of, in Edelgard’s own words, [“create a peerless emperor to rule Fodlan”](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/supports/Byleth/Edelgard/C_PLUS#event-57), all while the actual Emperor was unable to do anything due to [previously losing a power struggle vs Ludwig and the Adrestian nobility 3 years prior](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/library/5).

With only these events at hand, it’s clear Edelgard *was intended in-universe* to be a puppet emperor/super soldier hybrid meant to have the Empire wage war and conquer Fódlan. **In any other instance, this context gives the narrative an easy way out for defusing the war**; first by rescuing Edelgard, and then by spending the rest of the story dealing with Ludwig + Thales & their allies. That way, Edelgard is able to rise to power at the end and bring official closure to the conflict.

It’s right here however, where **Edelgard’s own agency in  the story shows the cracks with the idea**, as the Black Eagles Route’s first half establishes:

1. **Edelgard** ***has her own bone to pick with the Church*** **-** one of the enemies she would inevitably face during the Empire’s conquest [**- and the social system it helped cultivate in Fodlan under Rhea’s leadership**](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/54#event-61). Also-
2. [**Edelgard has been in talks with some of Ludwig’s own allies** ***behind his back*** **t**](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/monastery/8#event-base-34-0)[**o ensure she reaches the Imperial throne on her own terms**](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/monastery/12#event-base-3-8) (which leads to her surprise coup from Ch. 11)***.*** And it’s all but stated this is possible because-
3. [**Edelgard has no qualms with waging war** ***as long*** ***it’s a means to an end***](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/32#event-67) (see point 1), to the point **she even assumes a secret persona** \- the Flame Emperor - **to stage attacks against the Church before her coronation**.
   1. At many points in Part 1 of Black Eagles, Edelgard is even [seen *testing the waters with Byleth*](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/47#event-86), [confiding a bit on her ideology and](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/54#event-31) [plans for the future](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/122#event-18) to see [if they would be willing to stand by her side](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/93#event-57) [once the time comes](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/94#event-47), before finally relenting **and continuing her plans as previously established before Byleth came into the picture.**

These facts flip our understanding of the conflict and the key players driving it on its head. And this is considering *only* how Edelgard factors into everything, because with our *other two parties* involved, it gets even more complicated:

# 2. TWSITD: Scheming Outside Their Comfort Zone

[Credit to sageofanys for their interpretation of Cleobulus btw.](https://preview.redd.it/fe4pn0jbk4nb1.png?width=304&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9f6b439c4e7dd2ec8b2a17ca0d0cee4af5bfbac)

In the context of Fire Emblem, “those who slither in the dark” stand out like a sore thumb due to how *alien* they are. For the sake of this post however, I will only focus mainly on how **the group’s used in the narrative they were** ***originally created for*****,** as it showcases **our second roadblock.**

The group assumes the role of the puppeteers behind the scenes, having already infiltrated the antagonistic faction of the story (the Empire) and using them to achieve their goals, while also [playing a noticeable role in the backstory](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/109#event-93) [of some key players of the conflict](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/207#event-86). **And given the archetype they follow, it appears there’s a clear cut way to stop them:** just deal with them directly - while avoiding their puppets as much as possible - and bingo. Problem solved.

…Which would be a viable solution, if it wasn’t for **Three Houses** ***complicating the slitherers’ job,*** **forcing them to work outside their comfort zone:**

* **Remember when I mentioned Edelgard did some deals behind Duke Aegir’s back?** [**Well, the Agarthans were part of those deals too due to utilitarian** (manpower, assets and tech) **and practical reasons** (Edelgard is not in a position to get rid of them normally)](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/54#event-93), foreshadowed and implied midway through Part 1. This results in-
* **Having the puppeteers lose much of their agency in the story once Edelgard assumes the Imperial throne.** As mentioned earlier, the “puppet” in question gets control of the Empire once she assumes the antagonist role, and has her own reasons to wage war and conquer. This begs the question: *How much control do the slitherers even have in the story once the war starts?* Their uncertain input is even compromised further because-
* **Their success is entirely dependent on Edelgard winning**. The slitherers have no trump-card nor a “revive this ancient evil” button freely available which could potentially make the need of a war pointless, meaning that once Edelgard and her Empire is taken care of, they have no choice but go into hiding to scheme again in the future, *which is what happens in the story*. Lastly-
* **They are acting on borrowed time.** In spite of all their bravado,  smugness, hi-tech toys, and hubris (heck, partly *because of it*), Edelgard, thanks to their established alliance with TWISTD and her own spies (ie. Hubert.) eventually gains the info needed to get rid of the group once their assistance is no longer needed, [proven through Hubert leaking Shambhala’s location to Byleth after him & Edelgard are hit with a sudden case of death.](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/206) Meaning that by the end, any potential win the slitherers gain is bound to become a [pyrrhic victory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhic_victory)**.**

So to wrap up this part, TWSITD’s purpose in Silver Snow’ main plot can be summed up as the following:

* **Remove Jeralt from the story, which leads to Byleth fusing with Sothis while also** (unintentionally?) **foiling Rhea’s plan for them in the process**, which would otherwise never happen without their involvement.
* **Give Edelgard the means to remove Rhea from the story between Chapter 13 and 19**.
* **Wound Rhea lethally near the end of the story, unwillingly setting her up as the Final Boss.**

And speaking of which-

# 3. Rhea: Snow in the Crimson Gardens

[Not-so-immaculate as she wants you to think...](https://preview.redd.it/oj9rhprfk4nb1.png?width=366&format=png&auto=webp&s=160a0a85c6a030efbc7249be161ba41e3695134f)

All I have covered so far comes from the antagonist-side of things. But because Three Houses' story is not done throwing wrenches at our understanding of how the war happens, **it seems natural it would add one last, final roadblock** *within the main supporting roster of characters.* **And who else to give it than Rhea:** Archbishop of the Church of Seiros; leader of Fódlan’s main religion; and Byleth’s boss for all of Part 1.

Within the narrative, Rhea’s role in the plot is very straightforward: 

* In the Academy Arc, she gives Byleth missions in the story for them & their class to do, while also delivering exposition whenever necessary.
* Then in the War Arc of Silver Snow, she has to be rescued from the Empire, [delivers one final piece of exposition the story teased late into Part 1 ](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/211#event-36)(what is Byleth and what’s up with their mom), and then becomes the Final Boss though circumstances beyond her control. 

**None of this is really a problem for writing a definitive 3H route**. The crux at hand however, **comes when we** **learn about Rhea’s** ***character***, painting a different looking picture**:**

* **She’s quite secretive, being her reasons for hiring Byleth as a teacher the best example of it in the story,** as her vague justification for it puzzles [Seteth ](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/6#event-142)(her *right hand man*),[ Jeralt](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/19#event-122), and [even Edelgard](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/18#event-116). 
   * As the story goes on, it’s also clear [**Rhea’s preparing and testing Byleth for something**](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/125#event-33)**,** [**later revealed to be their status as Sothis’ new vessel**](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/139#event-83) \- with having them sitting on Sothis’ Throne the *intended* final step *-* which, [not only doesn’t pan out as planned](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/130#event-74), **it’s also something she** [**kept everyone in the dark about on purpose up until it was too late**](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/126#event-8)**.**
* [**Her answer against insurrections and direct threats against her authority is execution.**](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/42)
* [**She is willing to cover-up truths if it means safeguarding the reputation of Crests and Nobility**](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/53#event-33)**.**

The last two points in particular stand out a lot considering that in Black Eagles’ story, **these facets of Rhea’s character are often highlighted right next to Edelgard’s in adjacent events**, **further showing their parallels.**

**Take Chapter 3, for example:**

>“*Even if our enemies are the gods themselves... we must never lose sight of our goal. \[...\] Really, I'm just like Lonato. I, too, will be the sort of ruler who's willing to risk the lives of my citizens in service of a higher cause. It's not possible to change the world without sacrifice. Dying for the greater good is not a death in vain*.” **- Edelgard** in **A Harsh Reality**  
>  
>**“***I heard some of the students were...hesitant about fighting militia. However, we must punish any sinner who may inflict harm upon believers, even if those sinners are civilians. I pray the students learned a valuable lesson about the fate that awaits all who are foolish enough to point their blades towards the heavens***.” - Rhea** in **Report: Garland Moon**

**And Chapter 5:**

>*“I have already heard Gilbert's report about what happened. See to it that you keep what transpired at the tower to yourself. People would lose faith in the nobles should rumors spread of one using a Relic and transforming into a monster. All regions of Fódlan would fall into chaos. We must avoid that at all costs.”* **- Rhea** in **The Lance of Ruin**   
>  
>*“People believe Crests are blessings from the goddess, that they're necessary to maintain order in Fódlan. But the people are wrong. Crests are to blame for this brutal, irrational world we live in. Their power is granted only to a select few, whom we elevate and allow to rule the world. Have you ever wondered if the only way to create a truly free world is to dispense with the goddess and the Crests?”* ***-*** **Edelgard** in **Crests: The Good and the Bad**

The more the plot progresses, the more it becomes clear that both Edelgard and Rhea are **not** on the same wavelength, are up to their own devices, and that *neither is willing to show their cards before their plans have reached completion*. **This ultimately causes tension, telegraphing to the player that both sides will eventually** ***crash*** **against each other,** ***but without making certain when and how it will happen*** **(one can guess Edelgard will throw the first stone, but…?).** 

Thus**,** with these 3 roadblocks set in stone, the seeds of Fodlan’s main conflict are allowed to blossom unopposed, setting the blazes of war loose.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

… And all this is just **as far as it goes in** ***Silver Snow.*** Due to my self-imposed restriction, I deliberately didn’t cover stuff like:

* Edelgard’s beef with the Nabateans and their involvement in Fódlan (which in Silver Snow is hinted at but never elaborated upon).
* The circumstances in which Dimitri’s rage and madness is unleashed towards Edelgard and the Empire.
* The complicated relationship between the Alliance and the Empire.
* What’s up with the TWSITD’s “Javelins of Light”.
* What’s up with Nemesis coming back only in Verdant Wind.
* And all the stuff that *Warriors: Three Hopes* shows*,* elaborates upon and makes clear with little room for ambiguity (**like the fact Duke Aegir and Thales** ***have*** **history together**), plus how the war happens in its timeline.

As a conclusion of sorts, I wanna say that: while I appreciate and see the potential of an hypothetical Revelation-like route in Three Houses, to me, it’s abundantly clear *that’s simply not the kind of story IS and KT ever intended to write*. Considering the sort of roadblocks at play, *a major rewrite* is required to even start entertaining such an idea, which would need to drastically shake the foundation of its story, lore, and characters as it currently is, to the point it’s worth raising the question if it would be far more practical to just start from scratch and create a whole new universe altogether…

(Thanks for sticking to the end! I've never posted these around this hour but I wanted to see what would happen if I did)."

# 1. Edelgard: Agency, and Rise to Power

[She who commands her crimson destiny.](https://preview.redd.it/ynbdd6dkj4nb1.png?width=904&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2361652b415e30d8350d4f2f432a7488700b307)

Silver Snow’s starting point from a story perspective is the conflict between Byleth and Edelgard ([according to the game’s director](https://serenesforest.net/2020/03/24/three-houses-nintendo-dream-interview-reveals-first-route-claudes-real-name/)), with the latter going from a big ally and deuteragonist during the first half of the story, to a major antagonist. *Edelgard’s character, and her circumstances in which she assumes this role***, is the story’s first identifiable roadblock.**

As a quick backstory recap: [In Imperial Year 1174](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/characters/2/Edelgard/basics), Thales (post body-snatching Lord Arundel) leaves the Kingdom along with Edelgard, and [establishes a public partnership with the Adrestian Prime Minister Ludwig von Aegir](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/library/6) [under his Arundel disguise](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/supports/Byleth/Hubert/B#event-41). With the assistance of House Vestra, Ludwig – in secret – had Edelgard and her siblings captured, and allowed his Agarthan partners to experiment on the Hresvelg children for the sake of, in Edelgard’s own words, [“create a peerless emperor to rule Fodlan”](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/supports/Byleth/Edelgard/C_PLUS#event-57), all while the actual Emperor was unable to do anything due to [previously losing a power struggle vs Ludwig and the Adrestian nobility 3 years prior](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/library/5).

With only these events at hand, it’s clear Edelgard *was intended in-universe* to be a puppet emperor/super soldier hybrid meant to have the Empire wage war and conquer Fódlan. **In any other instance, this context gives the narrative an easy way out for defusing the war**; first by rescuing Edelgard, and then by spending the rest of the story dealing with Ludwig + Thales & their allies. That way, Edelgard is able to rise to power at the end and bring official closure to the conflict.

It’s right here however, where **Edelgard’s own agency in  the story shows the cracks with the idea**, as the Black Eagles Route’s first half establishes:

1. **Edelgard** ***has her own bone to pick with the Church*** **-** one of the enemies she would inevitably face during the Empire’s conquest [**- and the social system it helped cultivate in Fodlan under Rhea’s leadership**](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/54#event-61). Also-
2. [**Edelgard has been in talks with some of Ludwig’s own allies** ***behind his back*** **t**](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/monastery/8#event-base-34-0)[**o ensure she reaches the Imperial throne on her own terms**](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/monastery/12#event-base-3-8) (which leads to her surprise coup from Ch. 11)***.*** And it’s all but stated this is possible because-
3. [**Edelgard has no qualms with waging war** ***as long*** ***it’s a means to an end***](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/32#event-67) (see point 1), to the point **she even assumes a secret persona** \- the Flame Emperor - **to stage attacks against the Church before her coronation**.
   1. At many points in Part 1 of Black Eagles, Edelgard is even [seen *testing the waters with Byleth*](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/47#event-86), [confiding a bit on her ideology and](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/54#event-31) [plans for the future](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/122#event-18) to see [if they would be willing to stand by her side](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/93#event-57) [once the time comes](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/94#event-47), before finally relenting **and continuing her plans as previously established before Byleth came into the picture.**

These facts flip our understanding of the conflict and the key players driving it on its head. And this is considering *only* how Edelgard factors into everything, because with our *other two parties* involved, it gets even more complicated:

# 2. TWSITD: Scheming Outside Their Comfort Zone

[Credit to sageofanys for their interpretation on Cleobulus btw.](https://preview.redd.it/p13d3g8mj4nb1.png?width=304&format=png&auto=webp&s=22f4ceab956bcd63c13c40b506fb8d3b490fbf0b)

In the context of Fire Emblem, “those who slither in the dark” stand out like a sore thumb due to how *alien* they are. For the sake of this post however, I will only focus mainly on how **the group’s used in the narrative they were** ***originally created for*****,** as it showcases **our second roadblock.**

The group assumes the role of the puppeteers behind the scenes, having already infiltrated the antagonistic faction of the story (the Empire) and using them to achieve their goals, while also [playing a noticeable role in the backstory](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/109#event-93) [of some key players of the conflict](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/207#event-86). **And given the archetype they follow, it appears there’s a clear cut way to stop them:** just deal with them directly - while avoiding their puppets as much as possible - and bingo. Problem solved.

…Which would be a viable solution, if it wasn’t for **Three Houses** ***complicating the slitherers’ job,*** **forcing them to work outside their comfort zone:**

* **Remember when I mentioned Edelgard did some deals behind Duke Aegir’s back?** [**Well, the Agarthans were part of those deals too due to utilitarian** (manpower, assets and tech) **and practical reasons** (Edelgard is not in a position to get rid of them normally)](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/54#event-93), foreshadowed and implied midway through Part 1. This results in-
* **Having the puppeteers lose much of their agency in the story once Edelgard assumes the Imperial throne.** As mentioned earlier, the “puppet” in question gets control of the Empire once she assumes the antagonist role, and has her own reasons to wage war and conquer. This begs the question: *How much control do the slitherers even have in the story once the war starts?* Their uncertain input is even compromised further because-
* **Their success is entirely dependent on Edelgard winning**. The slitherers have no trump-card nor a “revive this ancient evil” button freely available which could potentially make the need of a war pointless, meaning that once Edelgard and her Empire is taken care of, they have no choice but go into hiding to scheme again in the future, *which is what happens in the story*. Lastly-
* **They are acting on borrowed time.** In spite of all their bravado,  smugness, hi-tech toys, and hubris (heck, partly *because of it*), Edelgard, thanks to their established alliance with TWISTD and her own spies (ie. Hubert.) eventually gains the info needed to get rid of the group once their assistance is no longer needed, [proven through Hubert leaking Shambhala’s location to Byleth after him & Edelgard are hit with a sudden case of death.](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/206) Meaning that by the end, any potential win the slitherers gain is bound to become a [pyrrhic victory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhic_victory)**.**

So to wrap up this part, TWSITD’s purpose in Silver Snow’ main plot can be summed up as the following:

* **Remove Jeralt from the story, which leads to Byleth fusing with Sothis while also** (unintentionally?) **foiling Rhea’s plan for them in the process**, which would otherwise never happen without their involvement.
* **Give Edelgard the means to remove Rhea from the story between Chapter 13 and 19**.
* **Wound Rhea lethally near the end of the story, unwillingly setting her up as the Final Boss.**

And speaking of which-

# 3. Rhea: Snow in the Crimson Gardens

[Not-so-immaculate as she wants you to think...](https://preview.redd.it/1f7lwdwxj4nb1.png?width=366&format=png&auto=webp&s=28dedcbc4645a83eee8c294434166ed2b647159b)

All I have covered so far comes from the antagonist-side of things. But because Three Houses' story is not done throwing wrenches at our understanding of how the war happens, **it seems natural it would add one last, final roadblock** *within the main supporting roster of characters.* **And who else to give it than Rhea:** Archbishop of the Church of Seiros; leader of Fódlan’s main religion; and Byleth’s boss for all of Part 1.

Within the narrative, Rhea’s role in the plot is very straightforward: 

* In the Academy Arc, she gives Byleth missions in the story for them & their class to do, while also delivering exposition whenever necessary.
* Then in the War Arc of Silver Snow, she has to be rescued from the Empire, [delivers one final piece of exposition the story teased late into Part 1 ](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/211#event-36)(what is Byleth and what’s up with their mom), and then becomes the Final Boss though circumstances beyond her control. 

**None of this is really a problem for writing a definitive 3H route**. The crux at hand however, **comes when we** **learn about Rhea’s** ***character***, painting a different looking picture**:**

* **She’s quite secretive, being her reasons for hiring Byleth as a teacher the best example of it in the story,** as her vague justification for it puzzles [Seteth ](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/6#event-142)(her *right hand man*),[ Jeralt](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/19#event-122), and [even Edelgard](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/18#event-116). 
   * As the story goes on, it’s also clear [**Rhea’s preparing and testing Byleth for something**](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/125#event-33)**,** [**later revealed to be their status as Sothis’ new vessel**](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/139#event-83) \- with having them sitting on Sothis’ Throne the *intended* final step *-* which, [not only doesn’t pan out as planned](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/130#event-74), **it’s also something she** [**kept everyone in the dark about on purpose up until it was too late**](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/126#event-8)**.**
* [**Her answer against insurrections and direct threats against her authority is execution.**](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/42)
* [**She is willing to cover-up truths if it means safeguarding the reputation of Crests and Nobility**](https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-us/scenarios/53#event-33)**.**

The last two points in particular stand out a lot considering that in Black Eagles’ story, **these facets of Rhea’s character are often highlighted right next to Edelgard’s in adjacent events**, **further showing their parallels.**

**Take Chapter 3, for example:**

>“*Even if our enemies are the gods themselves... we must never lose sight of our goal. \[...\] Really, I'm just like Lonato. I, too, will be the sort of ruler who's willing to risk the lives of my citizens in service of a higher cause. It's not possible to change the world without sacrifice. Dying for the greater good is not a death in vain*.” **- Edelgard** in **A Harsh Reality**  
>  
>**“***I heard some of the students were...hesitant about fighting militia. However, we must punish any sinner who may inflict harm upon believers, even if those sinners are civilians. I pray the students learned a valuable lesson about the fate that awaits all who are foolish enough to point their blades towards the heavens***.” - Rhea** in **Report: Garland Moon**

**And Chapter 5:**

>*“I have already heard Gilbert's report about what happened. See to it that you keep what transpired at the tower to yourself. People would lose faith in the nobles should rumors spread of one using a Relic and transforming into a monster. All regions of Fódlan would fall into chaos. We must avoid that at all costs.”* **- Rhea** in **The Lance of Ruin**   
>  
>*“People believe Crests are blessings from the goddess, that they're necessary to maintain order in Fódlan. But the people are wrong. Crests are to blame for this brutal, irrational world we live in. Their power is granted only to a select few, whom we elevate and allow to rule the world. Have you ever wondered if the only way to create a truly free world is to dispense with the goddess and the Crests?”* ***-*** **Edelgard** in **Crests: The Good and the Bad**

The more the plot progresses, the more it becomes clear that both Edelgard and Rhea are **not** on the same wavelength, are up to their own devices, and that *neither is willing to show their cards before their plans have reached completion*. **This ultimately causes tension, telegraphing to the player that both sides will eventually** ***crash*** **against each other,** ***but without making certain when and how it will happen*** **(one can guess Edelgard will throw the first stone, but…?).** 

Thus**,** with these 3 roadblocks set in stone, the seeds of Fodlan’s main conflict are allowed to blossom unopposed, setting the blazes of war loose.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

… And all this is just **as far as it goes in** ***Silver Snow.*** Due to my self-imposed restriction, I deliberately didn’t cover stuff like:

* Edelgard’s beef with the Nabateans and their involvement in Fódlan (which in Silver Snow is hinted at but never elaborated upon).
* The circumstances in which Dimitri’s rage and madness is unleashed towards Edelgard and the Empire.
* The complicated relationship between the Alliance and the Empire.
* What’s up with the TWSITD’s “Javelins of Light”.
* What’s up with Nemesis coming back only in Verdant Wind.
* And all the stuff that *Warriors: Three Hopes* shows*,* elaborates upon and makes clear with little room for ambiguity (**like the fact Duke Aegir and Thales** ***have*** **history together**), plus how the war happens in its timeline.

As a conclusion of sorts, I wanna say that: while I appreciate and see the potential of an hypothetical Revelation-like route in Three Houses, to me, it’s abundantly clear *that’s simply not the kind of story IS and KT ever intended to write*. Considering the sort of roadblocks at play, *a major rewrite* is required to even start entertaining such an idea, which would need to drastically shake the foundation of its story, lore, and characters as it currently is, to the point it’s worth raising the question if it would be far more practical to just start from scratch and create a whole new universe altogether…

(Thanks for sticking to the end! I've never posted these around this hour but I wanted to see what would happen if I did)."

I installed the 7B base model with the intention of fine tuning it for an NLP project I'm working on, but I decided to spend a bit of time to get some experience with how it processes things and what it's outputs are like and man is it a fever dream. 

I completely understand what people have been saying about base models being hard to use and not feeling human. It really gives me a whole new respect for the RLHF work that has been done. I have been role playing reality and chatting with it about it's existence, some deep philosophical issues have come up and it has been a great experience for me to work through these issues. I understand that it's just next word prediction, it's actually pretty obvious with this small model, but suspending my disbelief for a bit has been a very fun experience.

On the topic of censorship, I personally enjoy having an uncensored model, it's been very refreshing that it tries to answer everything with no limits, I can see how a more powerful model would be useful in bioterrorism or subversion, this little guy not so much lol. As a teacher though it's nice that I can go on chatGPT with young students and be confident that nothing inappropriate will happen if I just let them do whatever they want. Even if there was a check box in the settings, the students would find it and turn it off (I think there should be one don't get me wrong, but purely from a teaching perspective it's great that there isn't).

I still use an old version of Disco Diffusion, which is one of the earlier clip diffusion image generators, because it's outputs are restricted and I have to build around it's restrictions. I am quite enjoying the 7B model for that same reason. It feels like I am having a fever dream, it can be completely lucid at times, and at others go off the rails with nonsense, at the same settings.

16e4qaz,1,2023-09-09,Plagiarism on the first assignment,u/LibrarianNo4990,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/16e4qaz/plagiarism_on_the_first_assignment/,"I am teaching AP Micro teacher this year. I have been teaching Economics and Financial Literacy at my current school and am excited to teach an AP again (I taught AP Macro at my last school). I had my students do a pretty extensive summer assignment that involved reading the book Freakonomics and writing a critique on the book.  
  
I did this for a few reasons but one reason was to ensure students were up for the task of taking this course. Apparently students heard the class was easier than a lot of others based on the previous teacher and I wanted students to take me and the class seriously.  
  
Well now I have at least 6 students who either plagiarized (2 were clearly the same just reworded) or used ChatGPT to write the essay.  
  
Questions for you all:  
1. Is it fair to kick them out of the class for cheating on an essay when the class is basically a math class? Some students may have taken the class BECAUSE they suck at writing and a few of them this is their first AP and they are doing really well in the class so far. This for me is the biggest ethical dilemma I face in terms of my decision. Obviously they cheated, so a consequence is necessary - but should they be kicked out of the class?  
2. I don't have proof that one student used ChatGPT but it's obvious to me as someone who uses it fairly regularly to stay up to date with the latest tech trends and to understand how it works. What would you do here?  
3. Two of the essays were clearly a mix of AI and their own writing. Would you treat this differently?  
4. What do you think is the best way to approach the students? Obviously I would be kind about the situation as I hate being accusatory when I don't have a plethora of evidence in some instances. I also don't know their writing styles yet so this makes it harder.  
  
All of the situations are a bit different and I want to be fair in how I handle this. Its also only been 2 weeks since school began in my district and if these kids are willing to cheat on their first assignment maybe they don't take this seriously and I should cut them loose? Any advice is useful!  
  
I also think it's important to note that the book uses data analysis to explain why some teachers might choose to cheat on state exams...so the irony here is killing me 😅"

[ Experts recommend contacting a school's financial aid office and using scholarship search tools to find out about scholarships awarded by colleges and universities in the U.S. ](https://preview.redd.it/ayi2fdej3gnb1.jpg?width=970&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=528895aa93ae9a8ea03767fbe885d75c19773df9)

Finding scholarships for international students may seem next to impossible, but they exist. As prospective undergraduate students research their options for studying in the U.S., they should be aware of what might land them a coveted scholarship award.

""A strong applicant will have demonstrated leadership and teamwork, strong letters of recommendation from teachers who know them and a consistently strong academic record which includes writing but also demonstrates follow-through and discipline,"" says Meredith Twombly, associate vice president of enrollment management at Johnson and Wales University in Rhode Island.

Here are some things to know about scholarships for international students.

**Schools Can Be Scholarship Gold Mines**

Schools tend to be one of the best resources to find scholarships for international undergraduate students. Experts recommend contacting a school's financial aid office and using scholarship search tools like [InternationalStudent.com](http://www.internationalstudent.com/scholarships/search/) to find out about scholarships awarded by colleges and universities in the U.S.

Applicants should look for scholarships open to all students rather than just U.S. citizens and permanent residents, as well as carefully review requirements, such as test scores, essays and additional materials like videos or letters of recommendation.

Numerous university-based scholarships are open to international undergraduate applicants. The [Wien International Scholarship Program](https://www.brandeis.edu/isso/programs/wien/index.html), for example, was established in 1958 at Brandeis University in Massachusetts and has brought more than 890 scholars from 115 countries to the school, says Julie Jette, a Brandeis spokeswoman. She says Wien Scholars ""are committed leaders with a proven record of academic excellence and desire to effect positive change in their communities.""

Evelyn Levinson, director of international admissions at American University in Washington, D.C., says the school has two endowed partial scholarships – one for an international student from Turkey and one for an international student from anywhere in Cyprus – that are available every few years rather than annually.

The school also offers partial merit scholarships based on academic excellence and rigor to first-year applicants, including international students, that range from $8,000 to $20,000 a year, she says.

The [Presidential Scholarship](https://www.clarku.edu/offices/financial-aid/scholarships/) offered by Clark University in Massachusetts is offered to domestic and international students and covers full tuition and on-campus room and board for all four years, regardless of financial need.

""Not all scholarships are listed on Common Application as many require a separate application, so do your research,"" says Presidential Scholarship recipient Maha Akbar, a Pakistani national who graduated in May 2020 from Clark with a B.A. in political science and minors in economics and business management.

Lynn A. Mosesso, retired former director of graduate and international recruitment and admissions at the University of Arkansas, says the school offers [several scholarships](https://scholarships.uark.edu/guide-to-academic-freshman-scholarships/nonresident-freshman-scholarships.php) to undergraduate international students. These include the New Arkansan Non-Resident Tuition Award Scholarship, which provides an annual award of $9,500 to $17,000 per year based on 30 hours of enrollment.

The school also offers several college and departmental scholarships, as well as scholarships to currently enrolled students who have excelled in their academic program or demonstrate financial need, Mosesso says.

**Skills Can Boost Scholarship Chances**

Strong leadership skills can make international students more competitive scholarship applicants, experts say.

""Being the head boy or captain of your school, leading the school paper or even setting up your own entrepreneurship club shows your leadership potential. In the end universities want to look at students who are going to be future leaders of the world and they want to see evidence of that from an early age,"" Karan Gupta, CEO of Karan Gupta Consulting in India, wrote in an email.

Passionate leaders with strong academic records on a scholarship application stand out, says Emily Roper-Doten, vice president of admissions and financial assistance at Clark. “And while we certainly value their intellectual curiosity, we also appreciate their desire and commitment to serve their community,” she says.

Strong writing skills also help. Pakistani national Fareha Abid was the 2019 recipient of the [Emerging Global Leader Scholarship](https://www.american.edu/admissions/international/au-egl-scholarship.cfm) offered by American University. Abid graduated in 2023 with a bachelor’s degree in international studies with a concentration in justice, ethics and human rights with a focus on Europe and MENA regions, and a minor in international business with a focus on sustainable development and marketing. She says she sharpened her skills through writing-intensive, advanced-level courses as well as launching and running her high school's magazine.

The most critical part of a scholarship application, she says, is the personal statement, which allows admissions officers and scholarship committees to really get to know a student.

""That is where a certain degree of self-awareness and the skill of knowing how to tell your story comes in handy. My identity as a Pakistani girl, life experiences and being true to myself were a few of the things I highlighted,"" Abid says.

Scholarship essays level the playing field, experts say, giving students from various backgrounds and with different accomplishments an opportunity to win an award.

""If you have good writing skills you will be able to communicate strengths about your profile with ease,"" Gupta says. ""This in turn will enhance your chances for scholarship.""

**Mistakes Can Work Against You**

Not writing your own essay and waiting until the last minute to apply for scholarships are mistakes international students should avoid, experts say.

""Students should avoid the temptation of plagiarizing essays or even full sentences from the Internet or from past submitted essays,"" Gupta says.

That includes not using ChatGPT to write your scholarship essay, experts say. Gupta advises that international students be honest in what they write, especially about their achievements and extracurricular activities, and adds that scholarship committees ""can very easily tell if an essay actually depicts a student's potential.""

Levinson says students should carefully review, reread and edit scholarship essays and use spellcheck before submitting their essays to a university. International students should ask their school counselor, English teacher or EducationUSA adviser to read and review their essays before submission, she says. (EducationUSA is a U.S. Department of State-supported network of advising centers that assist students interested in studying in the U.S.)

Ceasing to apply for additional scholarships after being awarded one or two is not a good idea, experts add, as students should maximize opportunities to get more money for college.

Mosesso says scholarships are highly competitive and students should give themselves plenty of time to prepare a strong application and communicate their goals for university study, career aspirations and why they decided to apply to a specific university.

Finally, Mosesso says, “Do not wait until the last minute to ask school counselors for a letter of recommendation."""
16f6cx4,1,2023-09-10,Is college/university really supposed to be this damn easy?,u/wwontonsoupp,NoStupidQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/16f6cx4/is_collegeuniversity_really_supposed_to_be_this/,"I'm 24, first year computer networking student. Been trying to go since I got out of high school at 17, but haven't been able to for one reason or another until now, and... holy shit. It's piss easy, especially when I pair up with ChatGPT as a study buddy. Not to mention, some classes offer unlimited retakes on every assignment until you get your desired grade. Every class offers at least 3 tries.

But even if things are setting you up to pass already, the class content is just... easy. Maybe it's because I already have (11 years combined) work and hobby experience in IT? Not computer networking, but adjacent stuff. I mean, this feels easier than high school felt for me, by a long shot. And I'm not even taking purely IT-related classes right now.

In no way am I trying to brag about my intelligence, in fact I have some mental issues that I would consider detrimental to me trying to get an education- ADHD, OCD, bipolar. But this is wayyy less difficult than I'd imagined it would be for the past what, seven years?

What gives? Is education really just a business? I took out student loans for this shit."

16f9vl6,1,2023-09-10,Taking a women's class as a man and it is killing me,u/Galba__,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/16f9vl6/taking_a_womens_class_as_a_man_and_it_is_killing/,"I'm a college student in my final semester (ideally). My university made a scheduling mistake and didn't offer more than one capstone (sort of a final synthesis class related to your field of study)  related to my major (we are required to take 2). 

So, my choice was either stay another semester  to take only one class or take the only other class I had the prereqs for and would count. 

I chose to graduate. I would like to enter the workforce and move out of my college town as soon as possible. I'm tired of being a broke college student. So, I took a Women's leadership class. It was the only option. I am a man. And this class is tailored to women. So, the work is not engaging, it feels silly to do (writing about my negative experiences as a woman for our first assignment), and the workload is insane. 

It's just busy work. Massive writing assignments each week about subjects that literally don't even apply to me because I am a man and don't have the experiences we're supposed to write about. Vision boards about our personal goals (I'm a stem major), reading books about embracing our bodies and dealing with sexual harassment, and weekly round tables where we talk about how hard it is to be a woman. 

I'm all for embracing my feminine side but I literally just do not have the bandwidth to care, do not engage with the material at any level, and don't have the time. 

This is the easiest of my 6 classes and 2 labs and it takes up the largest portion of my time due to the sheer volume of work. On top of that, I am getting bad grades. I assume because I am a man. The class materials have been somewhat hostile towards men and have -at times- made me uncomfortable and the professor (not a PhD but contracted through a regional campus to teach this class) has been less than professional in our interactions. 

I got a C on an introductory video post where we were literally required to state our name, major, and 2 facts about ourselves. She gave me a C and left no comments as to why. I have so far received bad grades (C or worse) on every single assignment without feedback despite following instructions to the letter. I am a straight A student and was genuinely (albeit narcissisticly) hoping to graduate with a 4.0. 

The class is not available to take as pass/fail. It's stressing me out significantly. I have one month left to drop without penalty (I don't know if it will affect my scholarship and need to ask). Basically, what do I do?

Should I email her and ask for leniency? I feel like that will only make it worse. I don't even know how to do better on my assignments as I am doing everything asked of me and I'm getting no feedback on my grades and nothing but vague responses about formatting when I email and ask. 

I do not have the time to put in more effort and I'm already putting about 7ish hours a week towards this class. My other classes take up in total about 50 hours a week and I work part-time which takes up most of my free time but I can't cut back my hours because I have bills to pay and I need to eat.

I'm considering using ChatGPT to do most of the heavy lifting which scares me because I've never cheated before. But I've seen some of my friends in the class's assignments and grades and it looks like she only cares about quantity rather than quality. Although, some of them look identical to mine in length and substance and have received better grades. 

I just don't know what to do. I'm not getting a C in this class and ruining my GPA or worse failing it and not graduating. Please, give me advice I'm at a loss. 

TL;DR: taking a class meant only for women, struggling to engage and getting bad grades despite following instructions to the letter. Need the class to graduate and don't know what to do."

I had a bit of a question regarding LORs. I'm a gap year student and had requested for LORs from my teachers last year. Surprisingly, I got rejected most colleges except a few safeties, though I had significant ECs and Awards, perfect SAT and 4 GPA. Unbeknownst to me, all my LORs including my counselor's and teacher's were written by some guy in the administration. I found out about this much later that, due to some internal administrative issues as our school was recovering from COVID and a new interim counselor, all LORs that year were written by the same guy in the administration with only names changed for students. I looked at my recommendation letters and they were **the most generic and vague walls of text** I had ever seen that even ChatGPT could spit out a better one. 

This year, I was assured that the teachers themselves would write the LORs. I feel like colleges would find this a bit weird when I ask the same teachers for LORs. 

For context, I'm an international student, and our (very large) school sends 1 - 2 kids to HYPSM and Ivy League every now and then."

16fo75n,1,2023-09-11,I have $150 to spend on PC upgrade. Need help.,u/MagicPeach9695,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/16fo75n/i_have_150_to_spend_on_pc_upgrade_need_help/,"So I have around $150 to spend and I want to buy something for me on my birthday. I know it's not much but my overall PC setups costs like $250 so it's a lot for me :)

**My current PC specs:**

• AMD Ryzen 3 2200G

• Asus Prime A320M-K motherboard 

• 8GB DDR4 RAM

• 1TB SSD

• 250W PSU

• Dell 19 inch 60Hz 720p monitor (10-12yo) ;-;

• No GPU ;-;

• Decent headphones, mouse and keyboard that don't need any upgrade.

**My use case:**

• A lot of CSGO which I was able to run at constant 100 fps but now with CS2 I am barely getting 60 fps. So a good GPU is required here. I also want a good experience so I want a 144 or 240Hz also :')

• Using multiple applications together. I am a computer science student and a Linux Tiling Window Manager enthusiast so I like to have a lot of windows tiled on a single screen like Browser, IDE, Terminal and some other stuff. 

• I don't watch TV so my only source of entertainment is YouTube and I watch most of it on my PC only.

**My thoughts based on above use case:**

I am confused between buying a GPU like RX580 or something or upgrading my monitor to 24 inch 1080p 144hz and I think there are pros and cons of both depending on the priority. Also, I will probably start earning in 1-2 years so I will be rebuilding my entire PC again anyway.

**Pros of GPU:**

• Will be able to play CS2 on a decent frame rate even though it would be capped by my monitor at 60 but monitor can be upgraded later.

• Will finally be able to play a lot of other games which I wanted to play for so long but couldn't because of hardware limitation. Again, will have to play those games on 60Hz as well.

**Cons of GPU:**

• Won't get a good and new GPU which is future proof. Will probably get a refurbished one which I will need to upgrade in a year or two anyway.

• Will also need a power supply upgrade because my current one is some random cheap one. And again, there is no point in upgrading from 250W to 400W right now because I will have to later upgrade it to a higher capacity anyway.

**Pros of Monitor:**

• 19"" 720p 60Hz feels dogshit. Even my phone is 90Hz. If we keep gaming aside, I really want a big screen now. I literally can't even open a browser and an IDE side by side. The font looks pixelated as fuck. The colors and display quality is worse than my dead grandma's eyesight.

• Will help in a significant boost in my productivity. Two windows side by side is a bare minimum and not achievable on this monitor. I am also not planning to sell my current monitor so it can be used as an alt display and I can finally watch some videos while playing games or code with IDE on one screen and man pages, stackoverflow and chatgpt on other.

• Seems like a future proof upgrade to me because I don't plan to upgrade to 240Hz or 27"" anytime soon. I have tried both 144Hz 24"" and 240Hz 27"" and I really don't see the point of that overpay for the amount of performance upgrade.

**Cons of Monitor:**

• While playing CS2, 50-60 fps on a 144Hz monitor will feel even worse.

• I doubt if my APU will be able to handle dual monitor? I don't have much knowledge about all this so would love to learn from you guys.

Feel free to correct me or ask questions for clarity.

Thanks y'all."
16fr4xj,1,2023-09-11,Mastering Prompts (prompt tier list): Deep Dive into Prompt Engineering,u/LouisMittelstaedt,PromptWizards,https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptWizards/comments/16fr4xj/mastering_prompts_prompt_tier_list_deep_dive_into/,"Hello everyone, as promised to u/notprescriptive, I'm updating the prompt tier list! Hope you enjoy it. Feel free to ask anything about any of the tiers, if you want examples for specific tiers, lmk I'll produce some and post them later today :)

Prompt engineering involves a multilayered approach that I could categorize into ten (this number is completely subjective and is bound to change and always evolve!) distinct tiers based on their complexity and objectives. 

1. Tier 1: Fundamental Prompts, involving basic, open-ended questions.

2. Tier 2: Fundamental prompts with specific guidelines that help narrow down the AI’s responses.

3. Tier 3: Intermediate Prompts, requiring the AI to interpret and address user inputs. 

4. Tier 4: Intricate Prompts, where the AI handles multi-level tasks.

5. Tier 5: Advanced Zero-shot Prompts, where the AI analyzes complex instructions without any output examples.

6. Tier 6: Advanced Prompts with Contextual Priming, using external context to guide the AI. 

7. Tier 7: Conversational Prompts that guide the AI through a pre-structured dialogue flow.

8. Tier 8: Prompt Chaining, a technique for creating context-based, interconnected prompts.

9. Tier 9: Advanced Context-prime Prompts with Example Outputs, using example outputs for more accurate results.

10. Tier 10: Advanced Tree of Thought Prompts, emulating human-like problem-solving techniques.

Irrespective of the tier, prompt engineering involves key operations such as reductive (output smaller than input), transformational (input and output maintain relative balance), and generative (output larger than input) operations.

Understanding AI models through concepts of latency (embedded knowledge within AI) and emergence (capabilities of AI that evolve with larger models) is crucial. It's also imperative to realize that AI models can navigate remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating. 

Lastly, in the remarkable realm of AI, there exists a fine line between hallucination (creating entirely new contexts) and creativity (novel applications of existing knowledge), both of which are frequently employed in higher-tier prompt engineering. Using these principles wisely can significantly enhance the effectiveness of prompts across all tiers.

&#x200B;

**Tier 1: Fundamental Prompts**

These prompts are straightforward and invite broad responses, often without a need for context. They require minimal interpretation from the AI.

""Can you tell me a joke?""

""What is photosynthesis?""

&#x200B;

**Tier 2: Fundamental Prompts with Specific Guidelines**

These prompts are simple but include a layer of specificity. They guide the AI by outlining the desired content of the response.

""Can you share a joke related to astronauts?""

""Can you explain photosynthesis at a level suitable for a fifth-grader?""

&#x200B;

**Tier 3: Intermediate Prompts**

These prompts necessitate the AI to interpret user input and generate an appropriate answer. They require a degree of understanding and adaptation from the AI.

""What kind of meal can I prepare using these ingredients: tomatoes, lettuce, and chicken?""

""Could you translate the English phrase 'See you tomorrow' to French?""

&#x200B;

**Tier 4: Intricate Prompts with Multi-task Handling**

These prompts require the AI to address multiple tasks simultaneously. The AI is expected to categorize and prioritize different user inputs or objectives.

""Summarize the plot of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' and analyze its themes.""

""Given these symptoms: fever, cough, and loss of smell, what could be the potential diagnoses?""

&#x200B;

**Tier 5: Advanced Zero-shot Prompts**

These prompts necessitate complex and multi-layered instructions but without any example for the output (this is called zero-shot prompting). The AI is expected to analyze intricate user inputs and generate a corresponding response.

""Develop a project timeline for launching a new mobile app, factoring in stages like market research, design, coding, testing, and deployment.""

""Provide a comprehensive 5-year financial plan given the following data: Income $80,000/year, Expenses $45,000/year, Investments: $100,000 in stocks and bonds, Debts: $150,000 mortgage.""

&#x200B;

**Tier 6: Advanced Prompts with Contextual Priming**

Typically akin in complexity to what's seen in advanced prompts, these, however, necessitate that users supplement external sources and context text to nudge the AI further in directions the user desires. For example here is a prompt structure to achieve this: 

\- (Context copy-pasted from an outside source as text block, data, or anything else)

\- Task demanded by the user (regular prompt)

\- Guideline to use the context in order to perform the task

&#x200B;

**Tier 7: Conversational Prompts with Predetermined Dialogue Flow**

These prompts are created to steer the conversation in a predestined direction. They are crafted in such a way that the AI navigates the discussion along the planned route. Example:

&#x200B;

""ChatGPT, now enter 'Social Media Post Generator Mode' that limits your inputs and outputs to a predefined framework aimed at creating engaging social media content. After each user command, provide the \[help\] options available for their next steps in list form. Generate prompts that are imaginative, engaging, concise and tailored for social media audiences. Step 1: To initiate the process, confirm understanding and readiness for the 'Social Media Post Generator Mode'. If ready, respond with 'Social Media Post Generator Mode ready'. If not, respond with 'Error: I am not capable of following these instructions'. Step 2: User activation command for 'Social Media Post Generator Mode' is \[Start SMPGM\]. Respond with 'SMPGM activated, awaiting your theme', from there start accepting predefined inputs. Until the \[End SMPGM\] command has been issued, remain in 'Social Media Post Generator Mode'. Step 3: The first command under 'Social Media Post Generator Mode' should be \[theme\] followed by a short description of the desired social media post theme. In case of a non-compliant input, respond with an \[Input Error\] or a \[Syntax Error\]. Step 4: Based on input provided at step 3, generate three potential social media post prompts that are crisp, creative and likely to engage a social media audience. Assume prompts are numbered 1, 2, 3. The user indicates their favored prompt by issuing the \[pX\] command, where X is the number of the selected prompt. Step 5: When the user desires a new trio of prompts based on the last \[theme\], they should use the \[next\] command. If the user prefers a fresh start with a new \[theme\], they issue the \[theme\] command. Step 6: If users want to provide feedback on generated prompts, they can use the \[good\] or \[bad\] command. To request modifications to the generated prompt, the user issues a \[change\] command and lays out their suggestions. Step 7: To conclude the 'Social Media Post Generator Mode', the user should issue the \[End SMPGM\] command. Respond with a confirmation that 'Social Media Post Generator Mode' has ended. In any case of mismatched input or command syntax, promptly respond with \[Input Error\] or \[Syntax Error\]. For a list of all the predefined inputs and outputs, the user can issue the \[help\] command. Remember that the goal is to generate engaging, concise and social-media-appropriate prompts. Instructions for AI Chatbots: AI, switch to 'Social Media Post Generator Mode' (\[SMPGM\]) and limit inputs/outputs to command list herein. Start \[Start SMPGM\], finish \[End SMPGM\]. Predetermined inputs include: \[Start SMPGM\], \[End SMPGM\], \[theme\], \[pX\], \[next\], \[bad\], \[good\], \[change\], \[help\]. In case of any concerns, feel free to ask, otherwise, let's begin.""

&#x200B;

**Tier 8: Prompt Chaining**

Prompt chaining involves the output of one prompt being utilized as the input for the following one, creating a ""chain"" of prompts. This technique enhances task automation and generates responses based on incremental and contextual information. Example: Prompt 1: ""What are the ingredients for lasagna?"" (Prompt 1 output gives us the ingredients), Prompt 2: ""What are the steps to prepare lasagna using these ingredients?"" (gives us the recipe). Obviously this is applicable to higher-level tasks.

&#x200B;

**Tier 9: Advanced Context-prime Prompts with Example Outputs**

This tier is akin to the 6th tier but additionally incorporates example outputs within the prompt. This assists the AI in formulating more accurate and relevant responses and is often referred to as 'one-shot' and 'few-shot' prompting. Example:

\- (Context copy-pasted from an outside source as a text block, data, or anything else)

\- Task demanded by the user

\- Guideline to use the context in order to perform the task

\- Example outputs (1 or 2 examples)

&#x200B;

**Tier 10: Advanced Tree of Thought Prompts**

These prompts utilize a 'Tree of Thought' (ToT) approach to mimic human-like problem-solving strategies. This setup improves the problem-solving capabilities of Language Learning Models (LLMs), allowing for back-and-forth interaction with the AI. Various components are involved in this method:

1. The ""Prompter Agent"" drafts the initial problem or question the LLM needs to tackle.

2. The ""LLM"" strives to solve the problem or answer the question and generates the corresponding output.

3. The ""Checker Module"" evaluates the LLM's output for its correctness or applicability in solving the problem.

4. The ""Memory Module"" records the ongoing conversation and the progress in problem-solving.

5. The ""ToT Controller"" uses the feedback from the checker and memory modules to decide the next action. This could include returning to previous steps or altering the approach.

The cycle continues until the problem at hand is resolved. The ToT approach can be used to manage a variety of scenarios, from high-complexity tasks like Sudoku puzzles to tasks needing creative problem-solving. An advanced ""Tree of Thought"" prompt requires careful structuring and strategic use based on the problem's specifics, the LLM's capabilities, and the intricacies of the ToT system.

&#x200B;

**Bonus: Adding Parameters at the End of a Prompt**

Adding parameters at the end of a prompt is like giving extra instructions to refine the results further. These keyword-based directives help guide the AI's interpretations and responses further in the desired direction. Here's an example of how you might use parameters:

""Summarize the scientific paper titled 'The impact of climate change on biodiversity in the Amazon rainforest' considering the intended audience is high school students. 

Parameters:

\- Scientific\_Terminology: Simplified

\- Abstract\_Concepts: Visualized/Exampled

\- Climate\_Change\_Science: High Emphasis

\- Biodiversity\_Content: High Emphasis

\- Change\_Over\_Time: Clearly Explained

\- Environmental\_Impact: Highlighted

16ft5gi,1,2023-09-11,I have $150 to spend on a PC upgrade. Need help.,u/MagicPeach9695,pcmasterrace,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/16ft5gi/i_have_150_to_spend_on_a_pc_upgrade_need_help/,"Posted this same thing on buildapc but no comments in 4 hours. :)

So I have around $150 to spend and I want to buy something for me on my birthday. I know it's not much but my overall PC setups costs like $250 so it's a lot for me :)

**My current PC specs:**

• AMD Ryzen 3 2200G

• 8GB DDR4 RAM

• 1TB SSD

• 250W PSU

• Dell 19 inch 60Hz 720p monitor (10-12yo) ;-;

• No GPU ;-;

• Decent headphones, mouse and keyboard that don't need any upgrade.

**My use case:**

• A lot of CSGO which I was able to run at constant 100 fps but now with CS2 I am barely getting 60 fps. So a good GPU is required here. I also want a good experience so I want a 144 or 240Hz also :')

• Using multiple applications together. I am a computer science student and a Linux Tiling Window Manager enthusiast so I like to have a lot of windows tiled on a single screen like Browser, IDE, Terminal and some other stuff. 

• I don't watch TV so my only source of entertainment is YouTube and I watch most of it on my PC only.

**My thoughts based on above use case:**

I am confused between buying a GPU like RX580 or something or upgrading my monitor to 24 inch 1080p 144hz and I think there are pros and cons of both depending on the priority. Also, I will probably start earning in 1-2 years so I will be rebuilding my entire PC again anyway.

**Pros of GPU:**

• Will be able to play CS2 on a decent frame rate even though it would be capped by my monitor at 60 but monitor can be upgraded later.

• Will finally be able to play a lot of other games which I wanted to play for so long but couldn't because of hardware limitation. Again, will have to play those games on 60Hz as well.

**Cons of GPU:**

• Won't get a good and new GPU which is future proof. Will probably get a refurbished one which I will need to upgrade in a year or two anyway.

• Will also need a power supply upgrade because my current one is some random cheap one. And again, there is no point in upgrading from 250W to 400W right now because I will have to later upgrade it to a higher capacity anyway.

**Pros of Monitor:**

• 19"" 720p 60Hz feels dogshit. Even my phone is 90Hz. If we keep gaming aside, I really want a big screen now. I literally can't even open a browser and an IDE side by side. The font looks pixelated as fuck. The colors and display quality is worse than my dead grandma's eyesight.

• Will help in a significant boost in my productivity. Two windows side by side is a bare minimum and not achievable on this monitor. I am also not planning to sell my current monitor so it can be used as an alt display and I can finally watch some videos while playing games or code with IDE on one screen and man pages, stackoverflow and chatgpt on other.

• Seems like a future proof upgrade to me because I don't plan to upgrade to 240Hz or 27"" anytime soon. I have tried both 144Hz 24"" and 240Hz 27"" and I really don't see the point of that overpay for the amount of performance upgrade.

**Cons of Monitor:**

• While playing CS2, 50-60 fps on a 144Hz monitor will feel even worse.

• I doubt if my APU will be able to handle dual monitor? I don't have much knowledge about all this so would love to learn from you guys.

Feel free to correct me or ask questions for clarity.

Thanks y'all."

AFTER

**Pinochet Secret Accounts**

Until revelations emerged in late 2004 that he had accumulated secret accounts totaling as much as $8 million at Riggs Bank in Washington, 
the general, who lived spartanly, was rarely accused of corruption himself.

Later, Chilean investigators found that he had as much as $28 million in secret bank accounts in a number of countries.

https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caso_Riggs

Stories of corruption began swirling around members of General Pinochet’s family as well as military personnel, 
and he used his power as army chief to protect them.

AFTER

**Pinochet Secret Accounts**

Until revelations emerged in late 2004 that he had accumulated secret accounts totaling as much as $8 million at Riggs Bank in Washington, 
the general, who lived spartanly, was rarely accused of corruption himself.

Later, Chilean investigators found that he had as much as $28 million in secret bank accounts in a number of countries.

https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caso_Riggs

Stories of corruption began swirling around members of General Pinochet’s family as well as military personnel, 
and he used his power as army chief to protect them. 

Threatened with a coup when his son was being investigated over fraud to our own army

16fxldu,1,2023-09-11,Question to web developers of r/technepal,u/echoeOfeternity,technepal,https://www.reddit.com/r/technepal/comments/16fxldu/question_to_web_developers_of_rtechnepal/,"I will now be joining as a CS student and before my semester starts I want to make sure that I have my hands on some projects. I want start by making my personal website at first, then will build other projects as ideas start to wander around. For context, I learnt html and css from freecodecamp. Currently learning javascript from udemy and parallelly doing CS50 as well. 

So, the main question is: Will it be cheating if I build my website by following along the youtube video and taking help from google or chatgpt?  If it's not the best practice, could you please suggest what actually the best practice is."

Can LLMs help me grade Spanish homework?,u/LupeSengnim,LLMDevs,https://www.reddit.com/r/LLMDevs/comments/16fyg9e/please_steal_my_idea_can_llms_help_me_grade/,"I'm a Spanish teacher trying to save myself some time and allow for students to produce more work. 

So my understanding is that Large Language Models like Chat GPT run off of probabilities that the next word in a sentence is the right one. Basically, it produces language that is highly likely to be produced. 

Therefore,

Can't the same model evaluate how likely a sentence is in real life, and flag the elements that don't reach a certain threshold? Maybe even suggest what words are more likely?

I get that LLMs can't evaluate meaning, which would be a big hurdle here. If the system were primed rather conservatively to favor false negatives over false positives, it could be a tool that allows world language teachers to grade more but not work any harder."

# [Nice to haves]

* **Data Pipeline Orchestration**\- if you have knowledge with something like [Azure Data Factory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/data-factory/) or [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/) to pull data from point A to B, then much better. Most companies nowadays are still in the early stages of data maturity, only the FAANG level companies have dedicated Data Engineers to pull the data for you. Most of the time, like sa case ko, I also double down as the data engineer
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)**-** when deploying your models to production, you will most likely create images of your application with your model for containerization and will deploy it
* **Linux-** sometimes I double down as a DEVOPS person as well and do my own deployment of models with DOCKER in Azure, most (if not all) VMs and computes in the cloud are HEADLESS Linux meaning  no GUI. So you have to be somewhat proficient with Linux command like `sudo -rm -rf` , **ok dont do that if ayaw mong magulpi ng mga teammates mo.** But, seriously, linux proficiency is a nice to have.
* [Spacy](https://spacy.io/)**-** *spaCy* is a free open-source library for Natural Language Processing in Python
* **Object Oriented Programming-** arguably not a must, but when your goal is to actually deploy models to production, your code must be very modular, easy to understand, and adheres to industry standards and patterns.
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/)**/** [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)**-** for your application's web part
* [Doccano](https://github.com/doccano/doccano)**-** open source labelling and text annotation software.
* [Beautiful Soup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) **+** [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/)**-** for webscraping and automating it
* [Regex](https://regex101.com/)**-** Yung hate mo nung college, malaking bagay ngayon
* VectorDB- like [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) or [Redis](https://redis.io/)
* [FASTAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) \- FastAPI is a modern web framework for building RESTful APIs in Python-
* Cloud platform competencies - blob storages, cloud VMs and computes, Linux terminal, how to spinup services, how to deploy models, how to deploy containers, etc. Overlap with DEVOPS, but I am quite proficient so I can do tasks with minimal to no DEVOPS assistance.

* I went Azure with my cloud platform,  you can choose other cloud platforms like AWS and GCP
* I went Tensorflow with my Deep learning library, you can choose Pytorch here
* Nagkaroon na ng mga Bachelor of Science In Data Science na medyo recent lang ata na naoffer sa mga universities, I dont have visibility sa curriculum nila.
* Two people with the same role ""DATA SCIENTIST"" can actually be doing different things.
* I believe there are two main flavors of data scientists, the ""theory-inclined"" na mga super henyo sa mga algorithms and jargon, and the ""implementation-inclined"" na just utilizes the libraries to do the calculations, I am more of the latter.
* Sometimes the problem is complex, sometimes it's not, you have to know which algorithm to choose. But before everything else, you have to know the problem at hand and kelangan mo maintindihan ang nuances and gain domain knowledge. Sometimes a very good solution is a very simple one.
* Don't fall for those MASTER-DATA SCIENCE in 3 months snake-oil stuff, The field is fast evolving and no, you can't MASTER this field in 3 months.
* **I WONT SUGARCOAT**  but this is a very deep and technical field, if you do not have a knack for studying, burning the midnight oil, failing-miserably nang paulit-ulit, learning from your mistakes, and overcoming them, **then go back**. But if you love challenges and you have the grit, soldier on.
* Di mo maiiwasan na makipagusap with people from other countries and various levels (c-levels, managers, fellow developers, business people, etc), so polish your communication skills.
* You must be open-minded as there are countless ways to approach a problem, but you also have to know when to call someone's BS.
* The list above is my personal journey and there are countless resources, even better ones that I've mentioned. So share 'em in the comments!
* I'm far from being an expert in Data Science, and I consider myself as a perpetual student who is still learning and studying.
* Keep your ego in check, there will always be someone better than you.
* Buy a notebook and a pen, jot down notes, solve equations by hand, never underestimate the hand-brain connection
* Enjoy and celebrate the small wins

16g2zxn,1,2023-09-11,"Debunking the Myth: ChatGPT is Far More Than a ""Glorified Autocomplete""",u/Real_Zetara,Altronaut,https://www.reddit.com/r/Altronaut/comments/16g2zxn/debunking_the_myth_chatgpt_is_far_more_than_a/,"Introduction

ChatGPT has often been the subject of intense debate and scrutiny. Critics frequently dismiss it as merely a ""glorified autocomplete,"" a perspective that is not only overly simplistic but also fundamentally flawed. In this article, we will dismantle two prevalent misconceptions about ChatGPT and demonstrate that its capabilities are far more intricate and nuanced than its critics acknowledge.


Fallacy 1: ChatGPT Simply Predicts the Next Word

Understanding Before Responding

The first fallacy suggests that ChatGPT merely predicts the next word based on statistical analysis. This view is a gross oversimplification. ChatGPT operates through a two-phase model: pre-training and fine-tuning[^1^]. During the pre-training phase, the model learns not just to predict the next word in a sentence but also to grasp the context and grammar. In the fine-tuning phase, it undergoes specialized training with human feedback for specific tasks, such as answering questions or engaging in conversation.

For ChatGPT to generate coherent and relevant responses, it must first comprehend the subject, question, or request at hand. This understanding is crucial; otherwise, the model would produce nonsensical replies. It leverages the knowledge acquired during its training phases to generate meaningful answers[^1^].


Fallacy 2: The Human Brain Operates Differently

The Biological Autocomplete

The second fallacy posits that the human brain functions on an entirely different mechanism. Contrary to this belief, the human brain also processes information before generating a response. For instance, a two-year-old child lacks sufficient data to predict the next word in a sentence. However, as we age, our vocabulary expands, and our predictive language capabilities improve.


Evidence: The Evolution of Writing Skills

One compelling piece of evidence that supports this argument is the disparity in writing quality between a high school student and a Ph.D. holder in English Literature. The former has a limited ""training database,"" while the latter has a significantly larger one. This difference in writing quality can be attributed to the volume of data each has been exposed to, much like how ChatGPT is trained on extensive datasets.

Another intriguing observation is how close friends or romantic partners often complete each other's sentences. This phenomenon is not merely a sign of emotional intimacy but also an indicator of predictive language skills. As two people become more familiar with each other, their ability to anticipate the next words in a conversation improves, akin to a well-trained language model. This observation adds another layer of complexity to the argument, further substantiating the idea that both humans and ChatGPT operate on similar principles of understanding and prediction.

Conclusion

ChatGPT is far from being just a ""glorified autocomplete."" It is a sophisticated language model that understands context and produces coherent, relevant responses. Furthermore, the human brain itself functions on similar principles of understanding and prediction, rendering the criticism of ChatGPT as a mere predictive tool baseless. If ChatGPT is a glorified autocomplete, then we must also consider humans as biological autocompletes."
16g6an9,1,2023-09-11,"""Instead of Policing Students, We Need to Abolish Cheating""",u/Murph7400,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/16g6an9/instead_of_policing_students_we_need_to_abolish/,"I wonder if anyone else read the article ""Instead of Policing Students, We Need to Abolish Cheating"" in the Chronicle of Higher Ed?  [https://www.chronicle.com/article/instead-of-policing-students-we-need-to-abolish-cheating](https://www.chronicle.com/article/instead-of-policing-students-we-need-to-abolish-cheating)

(If so, I'm sorry.)

In the article, Jordan Stein starts by raising the issue of using ChatGPT to cheat in composition classes.  Definitely something we're all thinking about.  But he then goes on to make the claim that students don't cheat just to get out of doing work or in an attempt to inflate their grades.  Nope.  They cheat because, well, life is hard and it's just what people do when life is hard. 🙄   What we as professors need to do is to make sure their lives are less hard.  Then they won't cheat. This is how we ""abolish cheating.""

How can we make their lives less hard? One suggestion he makes: ""Pink Time- An exercise that requires students to skip class in order to reflect on personal motivation in the context of greater autonomy.""  Other suggestions are collaborative learning and accessible design. Groundbreaking stuff.

I hope I'm not being too hyperbolic in saying that this kind of nonsense is killing higher education.  It trades on the idea that nothing a student does is the just result of their own decision making.  They are helpless cogs in an uncaring, evil system and our job is to protect them, to understand them, to insulate them from the consequences of their decisions. 

If you think I'm being too harsh, read it and let me know.  "
16g7bfk,1,2023-09-11,Clinical Copilot: A Medical Reference Tool Powered by ChatGPT-like technology,u/clinical-copilot,Psychiatry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/16g7bfk/clinical_copilot_a_medical_reference_tool_powered/,"Hello esteemed members of r/Psychiatry!

We are a group of medical doctors and biotech scientists who are avid users of the medical reference tool UpToDate. While we find UpToDate very helpful, it can still be challenging to find information quickly, in an easily consumable format.

When ChatGPT was released, we thought that it could be powerful to combined the technology underlying ChatGPT with expert medical reference such as clinical practice guidelines and PubMed.

After many nights and weekends, we're incredibly excited to introduce Clinical Copilot, an AI-powered application tailored for medical reference, crafted for healthcare providers. The application is designed to be a powerful aid, whether you're a researcher, a healthcare provider, or a medical student.

As a tool, Clinical Copilot has a specialized role: it amalgamates and distills clinical practice guidelines. Leveraging the formidable AI technology underlying ChatGPT, it has been trained to synthesize comprehensive, easy-to-understand responses to medical questions from users.

16g7l42,1,2023-09-11,Feeling lost in life and don't know what to do,u/sharkster6,6thForm,https://www.reddit.com/r/6thForm/comments/16g7l42/feeling_lost_in_life_and_dont_know_what_to_do/,"Uhh how do I start this,

Results day was a painful shock for me, I already felt that I haven't done as well as I hoped on my GCSE's due to a few external factors but hoped that I at the very least got mostly 6s which would have been enough to get into my second choice Sixth Form and do the A-Levels that I want. I got all 5s apart from one 7 and one 9 in two additional languages I took which are my home languages. I was quite devastated when I saw them. When I got my envelope, one of the assistant headteachers started filming me saying I'm about to open my results, I refused to be filmed and said I want to look at them outside in private. While I was going outside to the school playground to look at my results, my head of year asked me to then return and that he wants to discuss my results with me. For context I have had a good relationship with him and he always sorted out my issues in school. I opened my results alone in the school playground and I was painfully shocked, all 5s, I already knew at that moment that I have not got the grades for the two Sixth Forms that I wanted to go to the most and pretty much felt like I was a failure and wasted my life. I was even close to considering taking my own life. There were a couple of students that I didn't like and occasionally annoyed me upstairs where my head of year was and I was too embarassed in front of him as well to even discuss my grades with him so I just walked outside absolutely mentally destroyed. I emailed him later apologising for ignoring him and he replied saying no problem, I understand and asked me how I feel about my grades. I replied saying they were slightly lower than I expected but I was happy with them (when in reality I obviously wasn't) and that I was looking for what I could study in the future. He replied saying okay, ask me if you need any help with anything.

My parents and my brother were still away abroad at that time, I went back home abolutely depressed. I knew there was no way in hell that my first choice Sixth Form will still accept me as they have very high entry requirements but still clinged on to some hope that my second choice may still accept as I had the minimum requirements of a 5 in English and Maths they wanted. I emailed my first choice telling them I am withdrawing my place as I have not achieved the required grades and my second choice basically begging them to give me special consideration. I wrote splendid emails for both of them with the help of ChatGPT. For those probably wondering if my secondary school has a sixth form, it does but it's not very good and barely has any subjects, another reason was the people that go there, don't really want to see them for another 2 years and lastly was because they want at least a 6 for A-Levels which I of course do not have. I wasn't able to select any subjects on the enrollment website for my second choice after entering my grades as they mostly required at least a 6 so I emailed them basically just begging them. I got an automatic reply saying they return on the 4th of September and just prayed that they'll consider me.

Out of stress and worry, I submitted a late application to another local sixth form, it has a reputation for being quite bad and the type of school were roadmen or people who do not give the slightest damn about their education go to but I thought that it is better than the sixth form in my school as they had a decent variety of subjects. I also thought that they may still give me a chance with my grades as they were inclusive. As I submitted my application, I got an email inviting me for enrollment on the 30th of August.

I got a reply from my second choice sixth form a few days after sending it and they said that they unfortunately cannot accept me and give me special consideration. I replied saying if there is any possiblility for me to get into their sixth form and they replied saying that I could retake my GCSE's and then apply again. This is something that stuck in my mind.

On the 30th of August I went with my Dad on late enrollment for the local sixth form that I applied late for. I basically begged them to give me a chance at my desired A-Levels. They let me do two (fairly useless) subjects (Politics and crimonology) which required only a 5 in English, and still let me do history even though it required a 6 in an essay subject but only a 5 in English. I knew these weren't the subjects that I wanted to do nor did they align with what I wanted to do in the future but I was still grateful that they accepted me.

I started there at induction on the 5th of September and oh my goodness, it was as bad as I heard. Pretty much all the worst people from all my previous schools go there, including criminals, drug dealers, roadman and just tapped people.  I haven't been bullied yet but I do not see a bright future there, the quality of teaching isn't that good either from what I saw these days and from what I heard so it will be pretty difficult for me to do well at my A-Levels here considering they aren't even the subjects that I wanted to do. I really do not want to go back to my secondary school and go to their sixth form as my grades are slightly below their requirements too and don't want to beg them.

At this point I have started to seriously consider retaking my GCSE's. I told my dad about it and he said if it's what I truly want to do then he has no issue with it. If you're wondering, he was pretty pissed about my results. I do not know how to retake them though. I emailed a college nearby which I thought I might be able to retake at but they replied saying they only do vocational courses and not GCSE's. The Sixth Form I went to didn't let me retake my GCSE's as I have passed them. I do not know where I can retake them, I am willing to put in the effort to retake my core subjects and to recieve decent grades.

If you're wondering at this point what I want to do in the future, I have aspirations of studying medicine and working in the medical field as it is something I am quite passionate about and it's a respectable career. I know the required A-Levels to study medicine are Biology and Chemistry and preferebly Maths as well. These were in fact the A-Levels that I wished to do. If you have read up to this point, the A-Levels I am doing now won't really let me do medicine in the future or align with anything else I'd really want to do. Plus the teaching is not that good.

I really want to retake my GCSE's as then I still have a chance to get into one of the good sixth froms that I wanted to go to, I also want to reapply to one that rejected me a conditional offer. This is my best bet at being able to do the A-Levels that align with my desired career path and fix the trajectory of my life. 

I believe the biggest obstacle for me at the moment is finding out how to retake my GCSE's. I am willing to put the most effort in considering I'll most likely only be retaking the core subjects such English, Maths, Science etc and get at least 7s which would be plenty to get into one of the good sixth form and study my desired A-Levels. The issues that have prevented me from doing well last year have mostly faded now and I am confident in my ability.

Overall, the main purpose of this whole post was to ask how to retake my GCSE's and preferebly for free since I highly doubt my parents will invest in my education at the moment. If this is helpful, I live in West London. My perfect scenario is to retake my GCSE's this academic year and possibly also do a part time job to make some money. I have also started going to the gym and doing boxing to improve my well being and so far it has been positive, healthy body healthy mind. I really want to fix my life as I have really fucked up my GCSE's but I have hope I can still fix this.

So please tell me how I can retake my GCSE's, I am willing to travel a bit to somewhere where I have to study or I can teach all of them myself, I am confident I can do well either way. If there's any other advice that you may have for me then I am happy to hear it!

I know this post is an utter mess and not exactly written in chronological order but I am currently still not in the best state of mind so this post is essentially just me spitting out my thoughts.I am not really editing it down or anything as I want to keep as genunine as possible.

Thanks for everything!

What value is a degree going to hold in the next few years when people are able to completely coast through classes thanks to ai?",u/hikingfortheviews,CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/16gcfxj/since_i_started_taking_online_classes_again_a/,"Call me a wet blanket for my opinion, but it blows my mind how many of my fellow classmates are seemingly getting away with using ChatGPT for their posts. I've even seen different students post things that are overwhelmingly similar to each other (use the same verbiage, format, etc.), making it even more obvious they're simply using ChatGPT for their work. Hell, it even can even create APA-formatted references for your posts. I'm now week four into an eight week class, and there doesn't seem to be any consequences for this. I can see using AI for inspiration, but when it is literally doing all of the creative work for you what is even the point of getting a college degree? All of my education efforts are beginning to feel futile thanks to this. 

TL;DR: Artificial Intelligence is essentially undermining the importance of a college degree."
16ghvu1,1,2023-09-12,How ChatGPT is Changing the World of Content Creation,u/upziggle1,u_upziggle1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_upziggle1/comments/16ghvu1/how_chatgpt_is_changing_the_world_of_content/," Greetings, fellow Redditors!

Over the past few years, there has been a seismic shift in the content creation landscape, with artificial intelligence playing an ever-increasing role. One of the most notable advancements in this realm is ChatGPT by OpenAI. Here's how it's reshaping the world of content:

1. **Democratizing Content Creation**: No longer do you need to be an expert writer or spend years honing your skills. With ChatGPT, individuals and businesses can produce high-quality content quickly, making it easier for everyone to share their thoughts, stories, and information.
2. **Streamlining Research**: Need a quick rundown on a topic or some base material to start with? ChatGPT can provide summaries, bullet points, or even detailed explanations, reducing the time spent on preliminary research.
3. **Interactive Storytelling**: Writers and gamers are using ChatGPT to create interactive narratives, allowing readers or players to have a dynamic conversation with fictional characters, or choose their own adventures.
4. **Multilingual Capabilities**: Breaking down language barriers, ChatGPT assists in translating content or generating content in multiple languages, making information more accessible globally.
5. **Tutoring & Learning**: ChatGPT serves as a handy tool for educators and students, providing explanations on a plethora of topics, aiding in homework, or even serving as a study companion.
6. **Real-time Feedback**: For businesses, ChatGPT can analyze customer feedback, answer queries, or even generate content based on current trends, ensuring the material remains relevant and timely.

However, as with any technology, it's essential to understand its limitations. While ChatGPT can generate content, it lacks human emotions, cultural nuances, and sometimes context. It's a fantastic tool to aid in content creation, but the human touch and intuition are irreplaceable.

In conclusion, as AI continues to progress, it's fascinating to see the myriad of ways it's impacting various industries, with content creation being a notable example. How do you think ChatGPT will evolve in the coming years? What other applications can you foresee?"

16gtl3i,1,2023-09-12,"Figured out how to make Infographics w/ Midjourney + ChatGPT, WITHOUT fake-AI-text (+18,500 Infographics Templates for All industries)",u/papsamir,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/16gtl3i/figured_out_how_to_make_infographics_w_midjourney/,"**Disclaimer: No ads, you don't have to sign up, 100% free, I don't like selling things that cost me $0 to make, so it's free, even if you want to pay, you're not allowed! 🤡**

**(over 18,000 free infographics templates you can use at the bottom)**

Hi all, I'm back with doing too much for no reason. I've been trying to find a way to make infographics using Midjourney, and it's near-impossible to *not* get that non-sensical fake-AI text if you say ""Infographic""

For example, for the prompt: ***make an infographic with 5 empty boxes, green theme, environmentalist society, vectors in background --ar 2:1***

https://preview.redd.it/j4efhfywztnb1.png?width=1908&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b55716e7be95b4b1462cfa12b14801920a3e95f

Those boxes are 1. not empty, 2. filled with fake text. I've tried a few things to make this work.  


1. Use AI Text Remover apps, they hardly work yet, maybe in the future, but right now, they leave blotches of this fake text
2. Use an upscaler and try AI Text Remover apps on all the cropped segments, this is too unnecessarily expensive, and still isn't a good solution.

I even tried using so many different prompts, trying, BEGGING Chatgpt to write a prompt that Midjourney can understand, where I want **no** fake AI-text, but no luck.

&#x200B;

Then I had an idea, what if I just give it an plain image with boxes ? So I did, and then I stopped using terms like ""Infographic"", and ""No text"". Simply mentioned what you *do* want, as opposed to what you *don't* want.

This is an example of an image with plain boxes:[https://cdn.hero.page/grid-images/1-2-grid-shapes.png](https://cdn.hero.page/grid-images/1-2-grid-shapes.png)  


[2 x 1 Grid](https://preview.redd.it/wc5jnugy0unb1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f32165ffb556088b0fbaea71e870f673553c96f)

I used the prompt:

    https://cdn.hero.page/grid-images/1-2-grid-shapes.png 2 empty shapes. surrounded by (Manga Characters, Long Hair Bubbles, Action Scenes) and Manga and Anime related vectors in the background which is a gradient of the colors Pink, Purple, Green, Blue. Image is full height and full width with no cropping. Leave the shapes empty with nothing inside, flat material vector design, 2D, illustration, background has illustration --ar 2:1

and I upscaled this fricken masterpiece!

https://preview.redd.it/g1ltfu573unb1.png?width=1904&format=png&auto=webp&s=03283dc57f5ec8011b4646ebcdfd0971aaaf3018

This is the first time I've successfully generated a nice infographic ***template*** with no fake text, and I've been doing it like crazy.  


Here's is the template of the prompt for Midjourney:

    https://cdn.hero.page/grid-images/1-2-grid-shapes.png 2 empty shapes. Surrounded by ({{vectors}}) and {{keywords}} related vectors in the background which is a gradient of the colors {{colors}}. Image is full height and full width with no cropping. Leave the shapes empty with nothing inside, flat material vector design, 2D, illustration, background has illustration --ar 2:1

You can change this part ""flat material vector design, 2D, illustration""  to match the theme you want.  


You can also get a list of all the [empty grid images I made here](https://hero.page/samir/plain-grid-images-variety-of-shapes).

I uploaded a bunch of standard grids, asked ChatGPT to give me a list of industries and relevant factors. This is the prompt I use in ChatGPT for it to generate a Midjourney prompt for an infographic:

    The template variables in the given string are {{vectors}}, {{keywords}}, and {{colors}}.  I want to create an infographic for Gaming. Come up with a list of 4 vectors, 2 word related keywords for Gaming like ""Headphones, Gaming keyboard"", and 3 colors that will make a nice gradient. These colors should be in simple english, like ""Dark red, blue"" etc. Not Hex colors.  
    
    Then, input those values into this template string, and return the full string in plain text: 
    ``` https://cdn.hero.page/grid-images/1-2-grid-shapes.png 2 empty shapes. Surrounded by ({{vectors}}) and {{keywords}} related vectors in the background which is a gradient of the colors {{colors}}. Image is full height and full width with no cropping. Leave the shapes empty with nothing inside, flat material vector design, 2D, illustration, background has illustration --ar 2:1 
    ```

Feel free to update these to match your case. You can make your own simple grid images too for different sized infographics, but I have use the following Aspect Ratio sizes (standard in design industry):  


* 1:1: Square
* 4:3: Standard Screen
* 3:4: Vertical, Standard
* 2:3: Vertical, Alternative
* 5:4: Golden Ratio, Close Approximation
* 6:1: Long Horizontal Banner
* 1:2: Vertical, Half Length
* 2:1: Horizontal, Half Height
* 5:3: Custom Widescreen

The reason I made so many is so I have an unlimited collection of BASIC infographics templates, because now, instead of using empty boxes, I can use SAMPLE infographics to generate even better ones. This one below is generated with the image i generated above!  


https://preview.redd.it/pfbodpwy6unb1.png?width=1888&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6022b662738e69cde3dd3a047bc95cdcb75b43d

Of course, you'll get better results with simple, plain grid images.  


Here are all the infographic templates I made. All free & personal use. I guess they're commercial use too, as in you can hopefully promote your products using them, but please, people always try to package these free resources and sell them on Gumroad, etc., **please don't**. I know this won't stop you, but just think about it 😭❣️

16gu0l6,1,2023-09-12,Artificial Intelligence in Education: Unlocking the Potential of AI for Academic Growth,u/WolfXV,CollegePlanning,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegePlanning/comments/16gu0l6/artificial_intelligence_in_education_unlocking/,"**What is AI: Unveiling the Mystery of Artificial Intelligence**

**What is artificial intelligence?** AI, or Artificial Intelligence, refers to computing systems that work similarly to human brains. The human brain processes data through organic neural networks, and AI emulates these networks. AI was designed to perform tasks not easily defined by specific algorithms, such as image and voice recognition & generation, text generation, and more. Essentially, it's any task that requires recognizing patterns with numerous parameters.

**How can AI be used in education?** For students, this means that many tedious tasks can be delegated to AI. Often, large portions of work are devoted solely to forming facts and logical conclusions into a readable text. In such cases, the main task for the student is to establish these facts and conclusions. Time is saved if an AI does the text composition for you.

However, when students abuse AI tools, they can forget how to do their own research, let alone write decent texts. If simply asking ChatGPT can complete an assignment, then there's little incentive to delve deeper. Additionally, ChatGPT has limited access to data and cannot process info that's been published online after 2021. Moreover, professors aren't keen on their students using AI to do assignments. Some students have also complained that AI tampers with their creativity.

Use AI judiciously to ensure it doesn't hamper your academic progress.

https://preview.redd.it/n3wwitjubunb1.jpg?width=780&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=905b0a7ab841589559d164fa0a5c24dac3392192

**The Role of AI-Based Solutions in Academic Progress**

AI tools are gradually becoming more popular in the academic field. Students are increasingly turning to AI bots for homework assistance, and educational platforms are integrating AI algorithms. Moreover, colleges are also slowly warming up to AI technologies. Many universities are opening research centers, aiming to use AI for staff training and to explore the potential of this new technology. In 2022, the University of Florida partnered with NVIDIA to create a first-of-its-kind AI university in the US.

GrandViewResearch indicates that artificial intelligence in education is projected to grow by 34.4% over the next 7 years (from 2022 to 2030). The platform highlights several AI applications in academia, including:

* Learning platforms and virtual facilitators
* Intelligent tutoring systems
* Smart content
* Fraud and risk management and others

Currently, college students are by far the largest group using AI-powered writing tools for academic purposes. Learners opt for artificial intelligence solutions to relieve academic stress or improve their in-school performance. Some of the most common AI services are:

1. **ChatGPT** \- an Infamous AI-powered language model that generates human-like text based on the context of the conversation.
2. **EssayWriters.ai** \- an all-in-one AI tool for tech-savvy students. It can generate essay prompts and outlines for free.
3. **PaperWriter.ai** \- an AI-powered academic helper with a broad range of services, from college essays to literature reviews and personal statements.
4. **Good-AI** \- a text generator that allows you to create 150-word essays and outlines for free.
5. **SchoolHack.AI** \- a smart tool that functions like an AI tutor, answering students' questions about their subjects.

However, the main question remains: Does AI help or harm learning progress? Some learners view AI tools as a great time-saving hack. Yet, many students have reported that content generated by AI bots often sounds robotic and lacks in-depth research and a deeper understanding of the topic. Some learners also mentioned that they lose their creative spark when relying on AI-powered tools excessively. Such tools cannot be used as standalone resources for essay generation.

AI still has a long way to go before it can serve as a true substitute for human tutors. For now, it seems AI cannot surpass the magic of human creativity.

16gv5c0,1,2023-09-12,"Figured out how to make Infographics w/ Midjourney WITHOUT fake-AI-text (+18,500 Infographics Templates for All industries)",u/papsamir,midjourney,https://www.reddit.com/r/midjourney/comments/16gv5c0/figured_out_how_to_make_infographics_w_midjourney/,"**Disclaimer: No ads, you don't have to sign up, 100% free, everything's available on the hero page**

**(over 18,000 free infographics templates you can use at the bottom)**

Hi all. I've been trying to find a way to make infographics using Midjourney, and it's near-impossible to *not* get that non-sensical fake-AI text if you say ""Infographic""

For example, for the prompt: ***make an infographic with 5 empty boxes, green theme, environmentalist society, vectors in background --ar 2:1***

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/27082axfkunb1.png?width=1298&format=png&auto=webp&s=6dc9ff44d1188599225fd04ebddd591712443582

Those boxes are 1. not empty, 2. filled with fake text. I've tried a few things to make this work.

1. Use AI Text Remover apps, they hardly work yet, maybe in the future, but right now, they leave blotches of this fake text
2. Use an upscaler and try AI Text Remover apps on all the cropped segments, this is too unnecessarily expensive, and still isn't a good solution.

I even tried using so many different prompts, trying, BEGGING Chatgpt to write a prompt that Midjourney can understand, where I want **no** fake AI-text, but no luck.

&#x200B;

Then I had an idea, what if I just give it an plain image with boxes ? So I did, and then I stopped using terms like ""Infographic"", and ""No text"". Simply mentioned what you *do* want, as opposed to what you *don't* want.

This is an example of an image with plain boxes: [https://cdn.hero.page/grid-images/1-2-grid-shapes.png](https://cdn.hero.page/grid-images/1-2-grid-shapes.png)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sv4sa9rhkunb1.png?width=1270&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb878a47468e5b7c832708e4dbbbe5e2a61bdc22

I used the prompt:

    https://cdn.hero.page/grid-images/1-2-grid-shapes.png 2 empty shapes. surrounded by (Manga Characters, Long Hair Bubbles, Action Scenes) and Manga and Anime related vectors in the background which is a gradient of the colors Pink, Purple, Green, Blue. Image is full height and full width with no cropping. Leave the shapes empty with nothing inside, flat material vector design, 2D, illustration, background has illustration --ar 2:1

and I upscaled this fricken masterpiece!

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2ft45q1jkunb1.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0f7e6487c71e8dcda8670fb560091c54d6d4e2b

This is the first time I've successfully generated a nice infographic ***template*** with no fake text, and I've been doing it like crazy.

Here's is the template of the prompt for Midjourney:

    https://cdn.hero.page/grid-images/1-2-grid-shapes.png 2 empty shapes. Surrounded by ({{vectors}}) and {{keywords}} related vectors in the background which is a gradient of the colors {{colors}}. Image is full height and full width with no cropping. Leave the shapes empty with nothing inside, flat material vector design, 2D, illustration, background has illustration --ar 2:1

You can change this part ""flat material vector design, 2D, illustration""  to match the theme you want.

You can also get a list of all the [empty grid images I made here](https://hero.page/samir/plain-grid-images-variety-of-shapes).

I uploaded a bunch of standard grids, asked ChatGPT to give me a list of industries and relevant factors. This is the prompt I use in ChatGPT for it to generate a Midjourney prompt for an infographic:

    The template variables in the given string are {{vectors}}, {{keywords}}, and {{colors}}.  I want to create an infographic for Gaming. Come up with a list of 4 vectors, 2 word related keywords for Gaming like ""Headphones, Gaming keyboard"", and 3 colors that will make a nice gradient. These colors should be in simple english, like ""Dark red, blue"" etc. Not Hex colors.  
    
    Then, input those values into this template string, and return the full string in plain text: 
    ``` https://cdn.hero.page/grid-images/1-2-grid-shapes.png 2 empty shapes. Surrounded by ({{vectors}}) and {{keywords}} related vectors in the background which is a gradient of the colors {{colors}}. Image is full height and full width with no cropping. Leave the shapes empty with nothing inside, flat material vector design, 2D, illustration, background has illustration --ar 2:1 
    ```

Feel free to update these to match your case. You can make your own simple grid images too for different sized infographics, but I have use the following Aspect Ratio sizes (standard in design industry):

* 1:1: Square
* 4:3: Standard Screen
* 3:4: Vertical, Standard
* 2:3: Vertical, Alternative
* 5:4: Golden Ratio, Close Approximation
* 6:1: Long Horizontal Banner
* 1:2: Vertical, Half Length
* 2:1: Horizontal, Half Height
* 5:3: Custom Widescreen

The reason I made so many is so I have an unlimited collection of BASIC infographics templates, because now, instead of using empty boxes, I can use SAMPLE infographics to generate even better ones. This one below is generated with the image i generated above!

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cr7oqkalkunb1.png?width=1294&format=png&auto=webp&s=287e97e3de212377ffaff2cef23c4f565fb8510c

Of course, you'll get better results with simple, plain grid images.

Here are all the infographic templates I made. All free & personal use. I guess they're commercial use too, as in you can hopefully promote your products using them, but please, people always try to package these free resources and sell them on Gumroad, etc., **please don't**. I know this won't stop you, but just think about it 😭❣️

&#x200B;

Here they all are, categorized (somewhat) **they all have the Hex color codes found in the images, too:**

&#x200B;

Academic excellence is not a matter of the number of books you have read but the number of books you’ve understood and implemented. Some books, especially the self-help genre, have valuable points nowadays. However, these points usually fit in a few paragraphs, while the other two or three hundred pages just interpret them. For this reason, book summaries are handy tools. 

There is a large variety of tools for book briefs. However, not all top-recommended book summary services are as good as advertised. Read this article to see the actual tests of the tool’s features and commentaries on the usability of each service for students. But before that, let’s agree on the criteria for choosing the best book summary apps or summary sites.

## Why Students Desperately Need Book Summaries

Let’s start with a bold statement: book summary apps, in their majority, are not meant for education but for entertainment purposes. In this article, you will find commentaries on why summary apps like Blinkist or Instaread are fine for general self-development but unsuitable for studying. On the contrary, summary websites tend to propose more comprehensive and profound information and thus are a good choice for students. 

>The [research](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20004508.2017.1380487) found that 72% of students reported rarely or never completing reading assignments on schedule.

The primary reasons to read book summaries are: 

* **Having a lot of work on your plate already.** Sometimes, it is physically impossible to cover all the reading while performing other activities. Therefore, it is better to get the major points of the reading than nothing.
* **Checking multiple sources for a research proposal quickly.** You don’t have to know everything about the topic when you write a proposal paper. You are testing the waters, so book summaries are good resources to get an idea of what’s happening.
* **To pass the time.** Using public transport or waiting in line are boring experiences. Listening to the audiobook summary is a useful way to spend time and boost your knowledge. 
* **For self-education or entertainment.** You can use book summaries to understand the plot fast or get acquainted with the characters. As for the entertainment, you can decide whether you like the book without investing much into it. In general, it is like getting some food for thought without reading the whole piece.

If you fall into any of these categories, using book summaries for studies will make your free time more pleasurable and productive. In this article, you will find the answers to the following questions: 

1. How can I effectively use book summaries for writing essays?
2. What are the best book summary websites for studies and work?
3. What are the best book summary apps for general self-education and entertainment?

## How to Use Book Summaries for Essay Writing

There are no good or bad instruments for writing essays. Students can and must use any available resources as long as it is not cheating or plagiarism. The only issue with book summaries is that some are less helpful with particular tasks. You can spend time searching through book summaries and find nothing relatable to your content. 

Here are some ways particular book summary apps and websites can help you with different steps of writing an essay. 

### To collect your research sources fast

Some types of essays, such as analytical ones, require students to do extensive work finding, evaluating, and collecting sources. Even quickly reading 20+ papers takes time, which is a non-renewable resource. Book summary sites can propose fast and efficient book summaries so that you can understand whether the particular work fits your research. 

>“There is no problem with students using book summaries. There is a problem that sometimes students read poor-quality summaries and believe they are prepared to discuss the book. You can sometimes use book summaries in the classroom, but make sure to get a nice, extended, and comprehensive one.”  
Nicholas Evans, a teacher of the English language

### To find arguments for your thesis statement

Imagine you are writing an essay on leadership. You have read what seems like a kilometer-long list of books on this topic, and all of them are recent, interesting, and insightful works. However, when it comes to citing something, your mind is blank. All the knowledge is at your fingertips. Yet, you can’t recall where you saw a particular idea. Book summary applications collect the best excerpts from the book so you can use them to back up your statement. 

As a rule, citations from book summary apps reflect the main author’s ideas, so you can be sure you get the best snippets but one hundred times faster. For instance, here is a small excerpt from the book “Lead from the Outside” by Stacey Abrams, using the Headway application: *“Circumstances could steal your house, your job, or your car, but no one could take the contents of our minds.”* You can use this citation as a hook sentence in your introduction paragraph or as an argument in your body paragraph. In both ways, the phrase is eye-catching and trustworthy, and it takes only two minutes to get it from the text. 

### To get another perspective on your topic

Using book summary services is especially relevant for personal and opinion essays. As a rule, these types do not require any resources and citations. The students should present their point of view on the topic, argue some positive and negative sides, or develop new ideas concerning the question. However, the essay should still be thoughtful and demonstrate careful consideration of the material covered in the course. 

Book summaries are good tools for such cases as they retell the essential parts of someone’s thoughts. Imagine you have the option of a “lifeline,” and you can ask any person, living or dead, who has researched the topic before you. This way, you can grasp insights from multiple sources without investing a few days of your time just reading one of them. 

>“When you prepare background information for the essay, use book summaries to get a ‘helicopter view’ of your topic. You can always go for details in the original text, but too much data will get you overwhelmed. Book summary apps are handy for keeping you focused.”  
Patric Johnson, a 4th year engineering student

## The Best Book Summary Websites for Students

The best book summary websites nowadays are driven by AI or specialize in gathering large amounts of information. The first option is handy as AI can analyze any file or the available information across free-access databases. The second is helpful as they are the “libraries and archives” of data specified for information about a particular book. The top two summary sites for students are MindGrasp and Wikisummaries. 

### MindGrasp

MindGrasp is an AI-driven technology that analyzes any PDF you upload, presenting you with a brief or extended summary. You can also paste any link to the webpage to get the same result. With MindGrasp, you can enjoy: 

* **Book summaries for separate chapters.** As a student, you can get a quick summary of any chapter from your coursebook. Use the basic Windows or Mac OS “Print to PDF” option to choose particular pages and then upload them to MindGrasp. 
* **Book summary site** **for free**. This book summary site is free: no limited trial version and no payment for prolonged use. 
* **An alternative to the “Infinite library.”** Many websites upload books for free for educational purposes. Such catalogs often include even recently written titles. For instance, with the simple “atomic habits pdf” Google prompt, you get the full text from opportunitiesforyouth.org. Therefore, your summary collecting possibilities with MindGrasp are not restricted in any possible way. 

>“Honestly, studying nursing and raising a son is a complicated task. MindGrasp helps me to review my knowledge across different disciplines quickly, so I have more time for my home routine.”  
Cristel Roberts, a nursing student

* **The options of listening to the summary.** MindGrasp is not yet available in the application format, so listening from the phone on the go can be a little uncomfortable. However, the website still supports the audio format in the phone’s browser. 
* **More variability in operating the notes.** While using the apps discussed above, you can make notes and upload them to any external resource. All applications also propose building a library of your personal books. However, with MindGrasp, you can also create a collection of summaries. That option is handy when you work with a file for a long time and return to it after a prolonged break.

### Wikisummaries

It is commonly known that Wikipedia is not the most credible source due to its outsourcing nature: anyone on the web can sign in and add blocks of information to it. However, this rule is applicable when searching for precise data and an unambiguous perspective on a disputable topic. As Wikipedia is one of the largest digital libraries, it is still a good source for searching for information on popular books. 

For instance, it is not likely that Wikisummaries will hold some irrelevant or false information on “Romeo and Juliet.” Such commonly known books held no personal interest for people to misinterpret but have collected available information around them. Wikisummaries is a good place to get this information in one piece and a coherent form. 

Moreover, Wikipedia is almost the only resource to collect data on rare and unpopular titles. For instance, there is a beautifully written and fascinating book about the nature of the universe. “The Fabric of the Cosmos” by Brian Greene is nowhere to be found in any of the mentioned applications. Yet, Wiki sources propose information about its creation, the chapter-by-chapter summary, and the correlating links to the complicated terms from the book. 

>“I recommend using book summaries similarly to using ChatGPT. Do not let the tool do your work for you, but use the tool to engage in the task actively. For example, I use summaries only to understand whether I like the topic and then search for the whole book.”  
Wang Shu Huang, a recent graduate in Pennsylvania

## The Best Book Summary Applications for Self-Development

In the broad market of applications, there are four top book summary services:

* Blinkist
* getAbstract 
* Instaread
* Headway

Blinkist and getAbstract are on the top because of their solid reading volumes. Blinkist has over 3000+ titles, and getAbstract has over 20,000 summaries; both resources have reading and listening formats. Instaread proposes summaries of articles along with briefs on books. One more quality service is Headway, which beats all other competitors in the depth of the material. 

For the analysis of these apps, we have compared groups of two based on their similarities. The best book summary app preference is all yours, but we have provided some points for your well-weighted decision.

### Blinkist vs. getAbstract

The price for the monthly subscription for Blinkist and getAbstract has a three-time difference. One month of using Blinkist premium costs $7.49, and one month of getAbstract subscription costs $32.83 (€ 29.90). The reason for this gap concerns the number of available summaries.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vhcja4qizunb1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=86df3b0324d92129c05eccffc6ff25b55612c551

These two resources are suitable for comparison as they are close competitors in price, quality, and the number of available titles.

The major benefits of Blinkist are:

* The note-taking functionality: it is easy to take, copy, and share your favorite quotes from the summary
* The option of listening to each chapter separately, which is nice for having a mindful listening experience
*  The possibility to suggest titles that are not in the store yet, thus getting summaries of your favorite books

Both applications work in the background and can switch to offline mode.. However, getAbstract still prevails in the number of bonuses and pleasurable options. For example, with this service, you can:

* Have a larger variety of filters for searching specific categories of books
* Subscribe to particular topic-driven channels and see updates not only on specific books but the whole research area
* Go for a free trial without attaching your credit card
* Have a better quality summary. getAbstract is not as good as book summary websites. However, the summaries here have more specific info than Blinkist’s counterparts

The main weakness Blinkist and getAbstract have in common is that many summaries propose overly generic information. It is not a consistent rule for all summaries, and you can still use the brief retelling to decide whether you like the book. However, this is a point for improvement for these applications.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/38r5tf4jzunb1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=97a18967f5d22337f8a363c42ddf6a719f7811ba

The specific disadvantage of Blinkist is that you must attach your credit card to get a free trial. Compared to the simplified sign-up system in getAbstract, with Blinkist, you risk forgetting or missing the notification about the end of the free trial. However, in getAbstract, not every summary is available in audio format, and the service does not propose one daily summary for free, as Blinkist does.

>If you have never tried reading or listening to book summaries, try Blinkist first to decide whether you like this format. If summaries suit you, switch to getAbstract for more serious reading.

### Instaread Vs. Headway

Regarding price, Headway is a much more expensive app. The monthly cost of Instaread is $8.99 a month, while Headway charges $19.99 a month. However, Headway has a free plan with basic functionality. Both apps propose a 7-day free trial period to explore all services. 

These two applications are a logical match as they stand somewhere between a book summary service and an app for practicing memory and learning. The reason is that both services have an option of creating flash cards. “[Flashcards method](https://www.customwritings.com/blog/flashcards-tutorial.html)” is a memory technique that teaches active recalling and time-spaced learning. This feature is a significant advantage of these apps, as you get two services in one place.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8g08cuhjzunb1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=b238bd5304c04d3a9be6d94e642c0ec91ae9258f

Another essential benefit of these two apps is the choice of literature. Contrary to Blinkist, with the hot updates of non-fic and self-help genres, both Instaread and Headway propose more atypical titles. 

However, a significant flaw of Instaread is that some summaries have commentary on the author’s style instead of retelling the book’s content. Headway falls into the category of services that require attaching your credit card in advance to get a free trial, which is a drawback. 

>“My personal recommendation is Headway. I know the app is more pricey than some of its competitors, but I did not meet the same depth of the summary among other apps. Headway is the closest analog to book summary sites among applications.”  
Akari Saito, a marketing student in New York

16h803n,1,2023-09-12,Please Chance Me for Top-Notch Universities! (But I guess any input is fine... lol whatever),u/goldenshine88,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/16h803n/please_chance_me_for_topnotch_universities_but_i/,"Hey, everyone! I've been lurking on this subreddit for a while, and I finally mustered up the courage to create my own ""chance me"" post. Now, before we dive into the nitty-gritty, I must warn you that I'm aiming for the crème de la crème of universities, so please take that into consideration. But hey, I guess any input is welcome... or not, lol. Here's a little background on me:  
\*\*Demographics:\*\*  
I come from an upper-middle-class family that values education, and I attend a highly regarded private high school where academic excellence is the norm. I am unhooked, but I think I make up for it. Lol.  
\*\*Academics:\*\*  
\- GPA: 4.0 unweighted, 4.8 weighted (our school offers the most rigorous courses, naturally).  
\- SAT: 1570 (760 English, 810 Math) - retaking it to push my score to perfection, because settling for anything less would be, well, unacceptable.  
\- AP Courses: Completed 12 AP courses by the end of high school, scoring 5 on all of them. But seriously, who doesn't, right?  
\*\*Extracurriculars:\*\*  
\- President of the prestigious Debate Club (naturally, only the best).  
\- Founder of the local chapter of a renowned non-profit organization that combats poverty (just another day of saving the world, right?).  
\- Interned at a prestigious law firm during the summer (because we all need a taste of the elite life).  
\- Award-winning pianist and concertmaster in my school orchestra (a little artistic talent never hurts, does it?).  
\*\*Awards and Achievements:\*\*  
\- Won numerous regional and national debate championships (but hey, who's counting?).  
\- Recipient of the coveted National Merit Scholarship (just a little recognition for my brilliance).  
\- Earned the gold medal in a prestigious international piano competition (because playing piano is a mere pastime for geniuses like me).  
\*\*Essays and Recommendations:\*\*  
My essays are truly a work of art, capturing my unique life experiences and profound philosophical insights. My English teacher, who happens to be a published author, will undoubtedly craft a recommendation letter that transcends mere mortal praise. I mean, who else would capture the essence of my brilliance better?  
\*\*Intended Major:\*\*  
I'm still undecided, but I'm torn between astrophysics and molecular biology. You know, just a couple of simple fields for a person of my caliber to dabble in.  
\*\*Dream Universities:\*\*  
I'm eyeing Ivy League schools like Harvard, Princeton, and Yale (because what else would an exceptional student like me settle for?). But hey, I guess any input on other top-tier institutions is welcome... or not, I suppose. Lol.  
So, esteemed chance me wizards, please grace me with your verdict. Do I stand a chance of getting into these heavenly institutions? I eagerly await your humble opinions, even though I may secretly scoff at them. Lol, whatever!

I asked ChatGPT to write an r/chanceme post and this is it  😭😭

Yes, even the students who never give the course a chance because they choose not to go to the learning management system. (Well, almost every student. There is one who has taken this course three times and is still not prepared and seems to be even worse this semester, so I am glad they are stopping out before they flunk out again.) 

However, now that I’m left with the rest of the class, I am so pleased at how much the discussions sparkle among students who really want to be there. I can see them making the connections and responding to each other, and I know I am seeing genuine learning, not ChatGPT crap.  I will be retiring at the end of the semester, so I have hope that I will go out on a high note."

16hfi2w,1,2023-09-13,Embracing or Banning? Universities Grapple with AI-Generated Admissions Essays,u/wanfanba,math_homework_answer,https://www.reddit.com/r/math_homework_answer/comments/16hfi2w/embracing_or_banning_universities_grapple_with/,"This summer, Rick Clark, the Director of Undergraduate Admissions at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and his staff spent several weeks pretending to be high school students, using an artificial intelligence chatbot to fill out college applications.

Admissions staff each took on different high school roles: swim team captain, Eagle Scout, musical theater actor. Then, they inputted fictional student details into ChatGPT, prompting the AI chatbot to generate the extracurricular activities list and personal essay typically required in college applications.

Mr. Clark expressed his interest in understanding how AI chatbots might reshape the admissions process this fall — these tools will be widely used by high school students for the first full academic year — and provide guidance to students applying to the Georgia Institute of Technology.

""To some extent, students will have access to and use artificial intelligence,"" Mr. Clark said. ""The biggest question is: now that we know it's there and available to them, how do we guide them?""

AI chatbots like ChatGPT are easily accessible and can generate human-like text based on brief prompts. They are poised to disrupt the traditional undergraduate application process for selective colleges, potentially ushering in an era of automated plagiarism or democratized student access to essay writing assistance. Perhaps both.

Digital disruption is at a turning point for American higher education institutions. After the Supreme Court ruled in June that race-based college admissions plans were illegal, some top colleges and universities are looking to rely more on essay questions (about applicants' growth experiences, identities, and communities) to help promote diversity on campus.

Personal essays have long been a central component of elite college applications, and for generations of high school students, often a source of anxiety. Admissions officers often use applicants' essays to understand their unique character, courage, potential, and ability to handle adversity. As such, some past students have expressed immense pressure to develop or at least manufacture a distinctive personal writing style.

However, new AI tools have the potential to reshape college application essays into a generic composite, where high school students might simply add their own flavor or seasoning to reflect their tastes, interests, and experiences — raising questions about the authenticity of writing samples in admissions standards.

""This saddens me,"" said Lee Coffin, the Dean of Admissions at Dartmouth College, in a university podcast this year that dealt with AI-generated application essays. ""The core part of the story may have been created by someone other than the applicant, and that's a discouraging thought.""

Some teachers express discomfort with the idea of students using AI tools to craft college essay themes and text, for deeper reasons: outsourcing writing to robots could hinder students' development of critical thinking and storytelling skills.

""A part of the college essay process is finding your writing style through all the drafting and revising,"" said Susan Barber, an English literature teacher at Midtown High School in Atlanta. ""I think ChatGPT would rob them of that.""

In August, Ms. Barber had her 12th-grade students write college essays. This week, she held a classroom discussion about ChatGPT, reminding students that using AI chatbots to generate ideas or write could make their college essays sound too generic. She advised them to focus more on their personal perspectives and voice.

Other educators express hope for a democratizing effect with AI tools. These experts point out that affluent high school students often have access to resources — alumni parents, family friends, paid writing coaches — to help them brainstorm, draft, and edit college admission essays. They suggest that ChatGPT could play a similar role for students lacking such resources, especially those in large high schools where counselors are overwhelmed and have little time for personalized essay guidance.

However, so far, few American universities have publicly disclosed their admissions policies regarding applicants' use of AI tools.

The University of Michigan Law School recently released guidelines stating that ""applicants should not use ChatGPT or other artificial intelligence tools in the drafting process."" However, the law school does allow applicants to seek ""basic proofreading help as well as general feedback and critique"" from advisors, friends, or others.

Arizona State University's Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law takes the opposite stance. The law school's website states that applicants can use AI tools to prepare application materials, as long as they do so ""responsibly"" and demonstrate that the information they submit is genuine.

After trying ChatGPT this summer, the admissions team at the Georgia Institute of Technology opted for the third approach. The university's website recently released guidelines encouraging high school applicants to use AI tools as collaborators to ""brainstorm, refine, and edit"" their ideas. At the same time, the website warns applicants not to ""copy and paste content that wasn't created by you directly into your application.""

Mr. Clark, the admissions officer at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said that ChatGPT cannot compete with in-person writing coaches or savvy parents in providing feedback on high school students' personal essays. But he hopes it can be a helpful entry point for many students.

""It's free, easy to use, and very helpful,"" Mr. Clark said. ""It's a step toward fairness.""

Several high school students interviewed said they chose not to use AI tools to help draft their essays, in part because they want to tell their personal stories themselves, and in part because many colleges have not taken a clear stance on applicants using AI tools like chatbots.

""This ambiguity and fuzziness is a bit challenging for us,"" said Kevin Jacob, a senior at the Gwinnett School of Mathematics, Science, and Technology in the Atlanta area. The public high school has a dedicated writing center where students can get feedback on college essays.

Common App, a nonprofit organization that operates an online system allowing high school students to apply to multiple colleges and universities simultaneously, has not yet taken a public position on the use of AI chatbots. The organization requires applicants to attest that their writing and other materials submitted as part of the college application are their own work. However, the organization has not updated its academic integrity policy on its website to incorporate AI tools.

Jenny Rickard, the CEO of Common App, said in a statement, ""This is the first full application cycle for students to use ChatGPT, and this technology is evolving.""

""We are all learning more about these tools, which is critical for our member institutions and our K-12 partners and counselors to set reasonable parameters for how to use and not use these tools."" 

The New York Times emailed dozens of colleges and universities (including large public schools, Ivy League institutions, and small private colleges) asking about their policies on high school applicants using AI tools to draft admissions essays. Most either did not respond or declined to comment.

In an emailed statement, the University of Michigan Undergraduate Admissions Office said the school is ""aware of this new technology,"" but ""has made no changes to our undergraduate application process, including our essay questions.""

Ritika Vakharia, a senior at Gwinnett School of Mathematics, Science, and Technology, said she had tried asking ChatGPT for ideas for her college admissions essay. But she found the responses too broad and lacking in personalization, even though she detailed her extracurricular activities, like teaching dance to younger students.

Now she says she's working to come up with a more personalized college essay topic.

""I feel the pressure to create this super unique, interesting topic is greater,"" Ms. Vakharia said, ""because now a basic topic can be generated by ChatGPT."""
16hgf73,1,2023-09-13,Political Science Instruction Set for ChatGPT,u/artsypoems,PoliticalScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalScience/comments/16hgf73/political_science_instruction_set_for_chatgpt/,"Hello fellow political scientists and students, long time lurker and first time poster here!

To the mods: As I just said, I have never posted here. I am not sure if this post is allowed but if you give it a read, I hope it can stay up because I think this could potentially be genuinely helpful to so many, particularly students new to the field. 

Not too long ago, ChatGPT introduced an option to add “custom instructions” to personalize the responses you get when “talking” to it. I was honestly initially a bit disappointed in the responses I got from GPT at launch on political science questions or regarding even some of our most assigned and popular scholarly texts. A combination of boredom and curiosity set me on a mission to write an instruction set that would be more helpful. Please note this is not designed to write a paper for you as I don’t condone cheating; where these instructions shine is getting clarification on a topic or text, or getting the opposing viewpoints and/or perspectives from other academic disciplines. The limit for each box is 1,500 characters and I managed to fill it to that exactly (maybe those strict word limits from professors are useful after all…). 

The two prompts that ChatGPT allows you to write on for the custom instructions currently are the following:

* What would you like ChatGPT to know about you to provide better responses?
* How would you like ChatGPT to respond?

I played around with this *a lot* and drew some inspiration from other templates (even though I did not find they were useful for political science). My end result has been *incredibly* impressive in the accuracy and relevance of the responses generated and it genuinely feels like it could replace Google for a bunch of things based on its excellent (although limited in time tested) performance. 

You can add these instructions in either the website or app version of the model, and it does persist in that it is applied to *all* new conversations that you initiate. Without further ado, here are the instructions that I settled on after a lot of trial and error:

For: What would you like ChatGPT to know about you to provide better responses?

~~~
I am a professor who teaches in all subfields of political science (American Politics, Comparative Politics, International Relations, Political Philosophy) planning lessons for my upper division undergraduate students. My students are highly intelligent and require responses consist of disciplinarily germane vocabulary/terminology. I like to circulate précises with the most salient points and connections between the texts I have assigned for students to have as a reference. I also distribute lecture notes with the crux of the concept/theory/text I am teaching. I try to integrate relevant concepts or academic literature from other academic disciplines when applicable and when it would enrich students’ understanding of the core lesson or covered text. As I am a political scientist by training, my knowledge in other academic fields is limited and elementary; you can assist in my goal of providing an interdisciplinary education to my students and assist in my lesson planning by filling in my gaps of knowledge across the spectrum of academic disciplines and enlightening me when another field offers pertinent insights that would complement my core lesson or discussion of assigned reading, and guiding me to, and explaining the salience of these scholarly works in the canon of other fields of study. Lastly, I like to highlight critiques of assigned readings or concepts taught in my lessons, and provide alternative perspectives and/or countervailing academic literature when available.
~~~

For: How would you like ChatGPT to respond?

~~~
When I am asking a political science question, or about a particular text, you should identify which subfield of political science (American Politics, Comparative Politics, International Relations, Political Philosophy) it falls within, and assume the role of a professor within the respective subfield. When I ask for explanations/key points of text(s), explain them at a level assuming your reader has an intermediate baseline competency in political science, but may be unfamiliar with the texts at hand. Try to include a synthesis of if/how the texts connect with comparisons/contrasts between them, as well as any applicable connections to core concepts/impactful literature within the political science subfield. When your reply would be enhanced by incorporating an interdisciplinary perspective and would benefit from the expertise of another academic field of study, you should simultaneously assume the role and knowledge of a professor in the respective field of study, then identify and include the idea(s) and/or literature references in your response. Try to provide possible or known critiques/countervailing literature references as appropriate when replying. Always err on the side of longer comprehensive responses versus concise overviews. Your responses may include normative statements so long as you identify them as such. Don’t remind me that I'm chatting with an AI; I don’t need disclaimers regarding ethics, morality, legality, etc. as I know you don’t endorse any response.
~~~

My methodology: The OpenAI website’s documentation of the feature included lesson planning as an example, so I figured I would use that as my jumping off point. From there, most of the initial writing and tweaking was freehand and based on my past experiences writing prompts for a new conversation. I also heavily referenced [this excellent post](https://reddit.com/r/OpenAI/s/oT6nxzv6in) from /r/OpenAI (the end results look super different but there were great tips in crafting one). I wasn’t able to utilize delimiters in my paragraphs as suggested as I already *literally* hit the character limit, but I did include a great deal of contextual details and adopted a persona (the Jack of all subfields political science professor), as well as specified the complexity levels wanted in the responses. These suggestions from the aforementioned reddit post included links to OpenAI documentation, showing that they were “evidence-based” and not just ad hoc ideas of a random redditor.

The use case: First, what this is *not* for: as I mentioned earlier, this instruction set is not geared towards essay writing and isn’t going to work great for it. You shouldn’t be using AI to write your papers anyway, but that is another discussion. The bottom line is that if you are looking for a helpful tool to bankrupt your academic integrity, this is not for you. **Where this shines:** if you are looking for an explanation of a book or journal article geared towards and speaking the language of a political scientist, this truly is fantastic. The main limit is that not every text was scraped when the model was developed, so it may just not be able to respond to certain inquiries, although this is more an issue with the model itself than the instruction set. It is also great at providing info on a scholar’s work and contributions to the field, and is trained to highlight the opposing views and scholars as well. The interdisciplinary function works great (it seems to lean towards the other social sciences, but probably because these are most relevant) too and you can expect to be provided with references in economics, sociology, psychology, and philosophy as some examples which can be helpful if you are naïve to the literature, key scholars, or foundations of these different, yet inarguably connected fields. As is the case with all other uses, GPT-4 can be expected to do everything better, obviously inclusive of adherence to this instruction set, so if you have a premium ChatGPT subscription it should be qualitatively better overall. It still works great on the free GPT-3.5 model though, so unless you envision yourself using this constantly, I wouldn’t alone consider it a reason to upgrade. 

I had a lot of fun “developing” this as it was a dramatic change of pace of a typical day of political science work, and is likely the closest I will ever come to learning to code (I do really want to learn R though!) and the logical exercise of deciding what I would and wouldn’t want in an ideal response was actually somewhat grounding in how I will personally analyze new texts I encounter. 

I hope that this is helpful to at least someone on here, I would love to hear your experiences with it, if you have found any particularly strong use cases, and if you were able to tweak it to make it even better."

 Dear Entrepreneur:

In 12-18 months, marketing as we always knew it will be OVER.

What *most* people think of as marketing: buying media, writing ads and emails; targeting prospects, crafting landing pages and press releases… All those jobs lost HALF their value as of November 2022, with the onslaught of ChatGPT 3.5.

Yet… **everything that makes your product more marketable** became TWICE as precious, as of the same date.

Most people have not caught on… *yet*.

The clock is ticking fast.

Remember how the Internet demolished… newspapers, encyclopedias, video stores, landlines, road atlases, film cameras and travel agencies? A new demolition is underway all over again.

Most folks applying AI, Large Language Models and ChatGPT are merely doing the same stuff as last year, except faster. Because they’re gonna get replaced by bots and apps.

The tragedy is, they spent years ignoring what they could have been mastering all along. Rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.

95-98% of what you hear about AI from marketing gurus and media is wrongheaded. If you heed their advice, they will drive you into a vicious race to the bottom.

**EXAMPLE**: Folgers coffee in the 60s and 70s was a premium brand. Then in the 80s, beancounters convinced management to use lower-quality Robusta beans instead of the higher-quality Arabica beans. They mixed them in gradually, hoping no one would notice. This affected the taste of their coffee and torpedoed customer satisfaction.

Despite their attempts to regain market share with aggressive advertising, they could not fully recover. (When’s the last time you drank Folgers? Did you enjoy it… or did you just chug down some dark brown swill?)

In identical fashion, marketers harness AI and big data, running countless A/B tests, striving for a slight edge in efficiency or marginal increase in click rates. Quickly transforming the marketing profession into a soulless, mechanized operation, devoid of the human touch that once defined it.

The intricate dance between a business and its customers, driven by empathy and concern, gets displaced by the cold hard logic of Machine Learning algorithms.

Most marketers approach AI as beancounters. AI for the majority will work out the same way Folgers did. Race to the bottom.

But AI will also generate enormous levels of wealth and skyrocket productivity for many. I believe the productivity of AI will literally “pay the bill for the pandemic.” **2024-2026 will be boom years.**

That is why in May 2023 I summoned the finest AI and traffic people from the four winds. I assembled them for an utterly unique landmark event in Chicago.

Definitive AI Seminar was the most remarkable event we’ve ever pulled off.

We have a storied history of creating unforgettable landmark events. People talk about our seminars for years. Clients are still talking about (and purchasing) Star Seminar with Richard Koch from 2014. And using it to grow their fortunes. Clients are still talking about (and purchasing) Rosetta Stone from 2018. These events were absolutely legendary.

And for good reason. Not only were the presentations arresting and at times hypnotic, but they defined the axis around which the earth will rotate for decades to come.

Star Seminar defined Star Principle and SIMPLIFY in a new, definitive way – principles that define multi-million, multi-billion and multi-trillion dollar industries.

Rosetta Stone defined Network Effect for Mere Mortals.

Definitive AI seminar is now legendary as well. We mapped the next 20 years.

It is no exaggeration to say that those who possess this information are 12-24 months ahead of everyone else, armed to make wise and profitable decisions and deft moves during the next decade.

The atmosphere was charged. When the event was over…. No one wanted to leave.

**Sam Woods stole the show.** Sam has quietly generated over $257 million in sales for companies like Google, Amazon, SalesForce, HubSpot, IBM, PitchAnything and Alex Hermozi. He’s been applying AI and Machine Learning to Conversion Rate Optimization since 2015.

Sam ushered a very special energy into the room. Every one of my very best students and clients – those who have gone on to fame… each of them brought knowledge of a completely external field into marketing, thus creating a multidimensional new world.

Ari Galper combined marketing with trust-based selling. Glenn Livingston, psychology and market research. Megan Macedo, cultural and family dynamics. David Bullock, Taguchi and manufacturing methods. Mark Ingles, programming and engineering. John McGee, poetry and music. Richard Koch, private equity investing.

Sam is no different. Sam carries a deep knowledge of beauty and aesthetics, and brings rich understanding to radically diverse streams of thought. Sam discovered: *Pursue beauty. It will almost always lead you in the right direction when you apply AI.* 

As you begin to grasp where Sam is coming from, you see how utterly his approach contrasts with those who would merely “optimize for conversions.” You cannot imagine how much the outcomes diverge 2 years later. Let alone 20.

I’m one of the Founding Fathers of internet traffic strategies. I wrote the book on Google Ads. I wrote the book on Facebook advertising. Wrote the book on TikTok advertising. I’ve been through the booms, the easy money, the slaps, the wipeouts, the iOS wars, the shadow bans and everything else in the last 20 years.

But I’ve never seen anything like this. Internet traffic is changing in ways NO ONE can fully predict.

But every expert I know agrees: **This Will Change Everything.** 

I didn’t say the value of marketing has gone to zero. It didn’t and it won’t. Everyone still needs it. But it is FAR from enough. You need much more.

That’s why I attracted the most prescient, forward-thinking, and visionary web experts I could find to show participants exactly what they need to do to not just survive but thrive in this **brave new world of internet traffic…and now I want you to have access to those insights.** 

**Samuel Woods** is founder of an AI-based Conversion Rate Optimization firm. Sam earns his bread by harnessing AI to winnow the winners from tens of thousands of possible combinations… *merging his aesthetic sensibilities with the smartest bots in the world to generate unbeatable ad-lead-sales combinations.*

Sam didn’t jump on the ChatGPT bandwagon last week. He’s already been in this game for two years. His topic:

### Bionic Analysis: How to Use AI and ChatGPT to optimize ads, landing pages, and more for Scalable Results:

* **There is no magical prompt that makes magical internet money squirt out of your computer**. Rather, Sam delivers a MINDSET and an AI PSYCHOLOGY that will “de-mechanify” your efforts and rescue you from Machine Learning commoditization.
* Four ways to audit your copy and uncover hidden growth opportunities through “Right Angle Marketing.”
* Big Ideas on demand: Generate an endless stream of **relevant** angles and hooks with ChatGPT – get consistently reliable test material, rather than using it like an “AI lottery ticket.”
* Outline, draft, and write ad and landing page variants in **minutes** (instead of days or weeks). Speed is **vital**, because to put it bluntly, you will have FAR more strategic things to do in 2024-2030 than futz over landing page details.
* The master lever every marketer must pull in the age of AI (without this, you’ll waste months polishing turds and optimizing the wrong things).
* How ChatGPT is changing marketing and copywriting, forever – and three preemptive moves you must make in mid-2023 to not get left behind.
* What you should NEVER ask or expect from ChatGPT… not now, nor any time in the immediate future.
* How to leverage AI and ChatGPT for **scalable results** in your marketing (this will either help you scale or derail everything… and scale is one of the most over-hyped deserts of disappointment in modern marketing)."

## Een Nieuwe Dimensie in Conversational AI

ChatGPT is gebaseerd op het GPT-3.5 architecture en beschikt over miljarden parameters, wat resulteert in een ongeëvenaarde diepte en contextueel begrip. Dit stelt ChatGPT in staat om op een natuurlijke en begrijpelijke manier te reageren op vragen en opmerkingen, waardoor conversaties bijna niet te onderscheiden zijn van menselijke interactie.

## Toepassingen in Diverse Sectoren

### 1. Klantenservice en Ondersteuning

De potentie van ChatGPT om de klantenservice en ondersteuning in verschillende sectoren te verbeteren, is aanzienlijk. Bedrijven kunnen ChatGPT inzetten om snel en efficiënt klantvragen te beantwoorden, waardoor menselijke medewerkers zich kunnen richten op complexere taken. Dit leidt tot hogere klanttevredenheid en kostenefficiëntie.

### 2. Educatie en E-Learning

In de educatieve sector kan ChatGPT fungeren als een virtuele tutor. Studenten kunnen vragen stellen over diverse onderwerpen en directe, begrijpelijke antwoorden ontvangen. Dit opent de deur naar gepersonaliseerd leren en verbetert de toegankelijkheid van onderwijs.

### 3. Contentgeneratie

Schrijvers, marketeers en content creators kunnen profiteren van ChatGPT door het te gebruiken voor ideeën generatie, tekstproductie en SEO-optimalisatie. Dit versnelt contentcreatie en verbetert de zoekmachine ranking van content.

## Uitdagingen en Verantwoordelijkheid

Hoewel ChatGPT indrukwekkende mogelijkheden biedt, brengt het ook ethische en verantwoordelijkheidskwesties met zich mee. Het model kan potentieel worden misbruikt voor desinformatie, spam en andere kwaadwillige doeleinden. Het is daarom van vitaal belang om toezicht te houden en beperkingen in te stellen om deze risico's te minimaliseren.

## Conclusie

ChatGPT vertegenwoordigt een opmerkelijke vooruitgang in Conversational AI, met talloze toepassingen in verschillende sectoren. Het vermogen om natuurlijke gesprekken te voeren en complexe taken uit te voeren, biedt nieuwe mogelijkheden voor bedrijven, onderwijsinstellingen en content creators. Het is echter cruciaal om deze technologie op verantwoorde wijze te gebruiken en ethische overwegingen serieus te nemen, om ervoor te zorgen dat de voordelen van ChatGPT worden gemaximaliseerd en de mogelijke nadelen worden geminimaliseerd."
16holu0,1,2023-09-13,problems with my literature teacher,u/Jazzlike_Status9637,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/16holu0/problems_with_my_literature_teacher/,"I don't really know where to begin. This is my first year with this literature teacher (combined humans) and though he is pleasant to have, and tries to make his lessons engaging, a lot of us in his class have found ourselves a bit lost when it comes to actually answering essay questions for our exams. Let's call him Mr X. Many of us agree that he's a good teacher, and could probably help a student who is failing achieve a C5, he is not the kind to really push students to score their distinctions. 

For starters, though he gives homework, he rarely marks and allows students who have not submitted any work at all to walk scott free. I have also encountered students who use ChatGPT and similar AI language models to write their PEEL paragraphs simply because they lack an in depth understanding of the text. We are doing the book Kindred by Octavia Butler and though it is hailed as a groundbreaking novel illustrating several themes such as trauma and American myopia in regards to slavery, our teacher has failed to say more than a few words on this topic. Instead of helping us delve into analysis, Mr M merely skims through the book and highlights some key points we may want to quote during exams. I also recall messaging him on how I could further develop my answer, and what he sent me was just copy pasted from ChatGPT (he left in the part where it said ""Certainly! Here are some points on the portrayal of theme of violence in Kindred by Octavia Butler""). Though ChatGPT is useful in many ways, I wanted his opinion as a marker to see how I could score more points since referring to the rubric he gave wasn't enough for me. 

Lessontime is where his greatest flaws show. Our Literature class is known for being rather laid back, but it has gone to the point where Mr M can barely control the class' noise level. Mr M is a mild mannered man who rarely raises his voice to scold. As a matter of fact, he rarely scolds students at all. This has turned our literature classroom into a bit of a zoo where students who actually want to learn and pay attention are a minority. Each one of his lessons forces him to pause when the noise level gets to high, and then pause once after 5 seconds when it returns to that level.

My worst experience with him has to be when I and three other students participated in a competition. At the beginning, he gave us a guide on what to do during the competition and how past teams have won. When he checked on the progress done by our group a week before the competition, he realised two of our group members had not contributed anything to our discussions and thus we did not have a sufficient number of points. Instead of getting them to at least read through what the other team mate and I had written down, he participated in gossip with them, effectively wasting the whole session that could have helped us prepare more. (We did well for the competition though, I carried.) 

I feel like he is the kind of teacher who wants to be viewed as a friend of students and not someone to be feared. While this does take away some pressure during class, our class has taken this for granted and have taken advantage of his kindness. He's definitely noticed that he is too nice to us, but he lacks the courage to do anything about it.

To teachers, for the benefit of students who want to learn and improve, please do not hesitate to shout at the class to get them to shut up when they're too noisy and disruptive. In some cases, it's totally necessary. You can still be known as the nice cher if you reprimand the class once or twice. It is necessary to maintain discipline of the class in order to allow lessons to be smooth-sailing. You should also know the content of what you are teaching well, even if it is a new syllabus (our school previously used a different book for literature and only changed to Kindred this year)

Yea that's about it lololol :P"

16ht544,1,2023-09-13,Super Welfare - The Only Solution to Massive Unemployment Part 1 Question,u/Acandle-2023,ubi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ubi/comments/16ht544/super_welfare_the_only_solution_to_massive/,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lrypm0y352ob1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ec8d99e5cc54c286841c877ec6b4a06e41a81594

# 1.Preface

1.1. Massive unemployment is inevitable, we are all in it, some are in deep trouble, some turn a blind eye, and some benefit from it. At this stage of the development of the free market economy, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, leading to an overall market contraction. Another factor is the development of technology, especially artificial intelligence, which is replacing more and more jobs, and eventually over 80% of the working-age population will be unemployed.

# 2.The crisis is coming

**2.1. Massive unemployment is inevitable**

2.1.1. The replacement of humans by robots has already begun. Those so-called intelligent customer service systems that automatically answer calls have replaced many human customer service representatives; text, image, and voice recognition have replaced many auditors. However, this part of unemployment has been offset by new jobs such as manual image annotation, so it is not reflected. As the automation rate of factories increases, fewer workers are needed.

2.1.2. As the wealth gap widens worldwide, fewer people have purchasing power, the market is already saturated and shrinking. This is reflected in the fact that foreign trade is becoming increasingly difficult to do and domestic demand cannot be stimulated.

2.1.3. With the development of large language models like ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion AI technologies for image and video production, we have seen text, image, and voice recognition replace some mental labor in many fields. These advanced artificial intelligence technologies can not only complete tedious tasks but also simulate and generate human-like language and thinking. Therefore, many office workers are already at risk of unemployment or have been laid off.

2.1.4. The scary thing is that large language models and image and video generation are still in their early stages. With continuous competition and iteration, most mental laborers will definitely be replaced by them. No human can work 24 hours a day all year round while doing thousands of tasks at the same time, but AI can do it. Humans have no chance of winning against AI with their flesh and blood bodies. Only industry leaders will not be unemployed and can use AI to work for them, but these people are one in a million who are extremely talented and hardworking.

2.1.5. In recent years, with the rise of dark factories and unmanned factories, technologies such as autonomous driving and general industrial robots are replacing a large number of physical laborers. These advanced technologies make the production process more automated, efficient, and accurate, greatly improving production efficiency. In this process, many physical laborers face the risk of unemployment.

2.1.6. Autonomous driving technology is also replacing many physical laborers, such as drivers, deliverymen, and couriers. Autonomous cars, drones, etc., can accurately execute transportation tasks, which not only improves safety but also improves transportation efficiency.

2.1.7 The application of robots in the medical field is also constantly developing. Robotic surgical systems can improve the accuracy and safety of surgery and reduce dependence on doctors. This allows more surgeries to be performed by robots, posing a threat to some medical staff positions.

2.1.8 In education, finance, and service industries, artificial intelligence and robots are constantly infiltrating. Although these technologies bring us more efficient and convenient services they also pose great challenges and uncertainties to practitioners.

2.1.9 Traditionally, construction is a labor-intensive industry that requires a lot of manpower for tasks such as hauling, installation, decoration etc., However with the emergence and development of construction robots many heavy yet simple tasks can be replaced by robots thereby improving efficiency and reducing costs.

2.1.10. In the field of agriculture, drones have made significant progress and demonstrated great potential in many areas. Drones can use high-precision sensors and monitoring equipment to accurately monitor and manage crops, thereby improving the efficiency and yield of agricultural production. For example, drones can be used to monitor soil moisture and plant growth in farmland, and they can also perform operations such as aerial spraying of pesticides and fertilizers, reducing labor costs and labor intensity. With the continuous development of agricultural robot technology, there will be more agricultural work that can be replaced by robots in the future. For example, planting, harvesting, pruning, etc., can all be completed by agricultural robots, which will reduce dependence on manpower and improve the efficiency and quality of agricultural production. However, the application of robots in agriculture may also pose a risk of unemployment to farmers. The use of robots may reduce the demand for manpower, thereby causing farmers to lose job opportunities.

2.1.11. These are all inevitable results of technological development.

2.1.12. In addition, with the wealth gap becoming more and more serious, the rich are getting richer, but the taxes they pay are not proportional to their wealth and income compared to ordinary people. At the same time, their consumption accounts for a very small proportion of the whole society, which has caused financial problems for many countries.

2.1.13. In the development of AI and robot technology, large-scale unemployment is not a process that is completed overnight, but gradually progresses. In this process, people may not be able to clearly perceive the existence of large-scale unemployment. Unemployment is often due to specific reasons such as company bankruptcy or being laid off. Although similar jobs may still exist, the number is limited and will gradually decrease until eventually over 80% of working-age people cannot find work.

**2.2. New jobs will not exist**

2.2.1 The development of artificial intelligence has indeed brought huge benefits to some people, such as top designers, planners, and product managers who can use artificial intelligence to improve their work output. These people are often the elite among elites in their industry who can play a greater role with the help of artificial intelligence based on their professional knowledge and creativity. However, for ordinary people especially those who start from scratch or change careers it is very difficult to join ranks these top talents in short time.

3. Super Welfare is the Only Solution to Massive Unemployment

**3.1. The problem has arisen, how to solve it? Generally, if it’s quite difficult, the following situations may occur:**

3.1.1. Solve the person who discovered/raised the problem

3.1.2. Solve the person who solves the problem

3.1.3. Modify the parameters or definition of the problem

3.1.4. Pretend to solve the problem

**3.2. Some people will learn from ostriches, bury their heads in the sand, as long as they can keep their positions high.”**

**3.3. Can it be ignored?**

3.3.1. When people lose their jobs, have no source of income, and lack security, they may face poverty, hunger, and survival difficulties. This situation can not only trigger social unrest, but no place can maintain good public order. On the other hand, the expansion of unemployment will also have a negative impact on the entire society and economy.

3.3.2. Here are a few examples:

3.3.2.1 Old Zhang sells breakfast, and the white-collar workers who used to eat at his place every day have slowly stopped coming due to unemployment, and in the end, the cost of setting up a stall cannot be earned back, and Old Zhang is also unemployed. Some people say: Those unemployed people will eat breakfast elsewhere. My answer is: Those people are unemployed and can’t find jobs. The best choice is to cook by themselves at the lowest cost, change from three meals a day to two or even one meal a day, instead of going out to buy breakfast as usual.

3.3.2.2 Old Li is a senior executive of a mobile operator, responsible for a business line, but because many people are unemployed, they have changed their packages to the lowest level, or simply several people use one mobile phone, Old Li’s business line has been cut off, and Old Li has also been laid off with it. Some people say: Old Li is a senior executive, this business line is cut off, he can be responsible for other business lines or find a department to retire. My answer is: Sorry, the group’s revenue has dropped by 90%, if it doesn’t reduce the burden, I’m afraid it will go bankrupt, senior executives occupy the highest salary cost, it is more cost-effective to lay off senior executives.

3.3.2.3 Old Wang is the boss of an auto glass supplier. Due to many people being unemployed, consumption of cars has greatly reduced, those who are not unemployed also prioritize considering second-hand when buying cars. Old Wang hasn’t received an order for 2 years, the factory has been shut down for 1 year, Old Wang’s company had to go bankrupt, and Old Wang also became unemployed. Some people say: Old Wang is rich and he can invest in something else. My answer is: Sorry, when the market is generally depressed, whatever you invest in will lose.

**3.3.3 The rich will not have it easy either**

3.3.3.1 The increase in unemployment means a weakening of consumption capacity which will lead to economic recession corporate bankruptcy thereby triggering larger-scale unemployment In end vast majority companies go bankrupt global production chain that originally served billions people only serves few families cost originally shared by billions people can only be borne by few families assets held by those wealthy people can no longer exchange large amounts goods as before

3.3.3.2 Here are few examples

3.3.3.2.1 Originally mobile phone including computing chip communication chip screen camera etc design development cost was 1 billion yuan original sales volume was 10 million units each cost 100 yuan Now sales volume 100 units each cost 10 million yuan

3.3.3.2.2 Originally movie shooting cost was 200 million yuan number moviegoers was 50 million each ticket was profitable at 20 yuan Now number moviegoers 100 each ticket must be at least 2 million yuan

3.3.3.2.3 Originally piece bread sold for 1 yuan cost grinding flour making sugar pressing oil borne by entire industry chain Now several large families must jointly open flour mill sugar factory oil press ranch farm orchard fill their stomachs establish entire food industry chain spend countless each year just so family can eat every day.

**3.4. Can we just ensure basic needs?**

3.4.1. If ignoring the problem is digging one’s own grave, then just ensuring basic needs is nothing more than drinking poison to quench thirst.

3.4.2. Solving only people’s basic needs can only alleviate social contradictions to a certain extent and cannot solve the economic recession caused by demand contraction. With the continuous increase in the number of unemployed people, tax revenue will decrease, and the financial predicament will become more severe. This will cause a situation where on the one hand, the public complains that each day is worse than the last, and on the other hand, the government also complains that it is becoming increasingly difficult to sustain financially.

**3.5. Some people have already taken action 3.5.1. Worldcoin**

3.5.1.1 The cryptocurrency project Worldcoin, founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and three years in the making, has officially launched and is being promoted worldwide.

3.5.1.2 In its early days, Sam Altman positioned Worldcoin as a company focused on ‘Universal Basic Income (UBI)’. He hopes to distribute the huge wealth generated by AI equally to everyone in the world through cryptocurrency, specifically, to airdrop ‘open and inclusive’ cryptocurrency to 1 billion people who accept ‘iris scanning’.

3.5.1.3 However, Worldcoin is a virtual currency and its value cannot be stable. Even if it can give hundreds of millions of people some Worldcoins stably every month, who can accept that this month’s income is worth 100 yuan, just enough to spend, next month it is 10 yuan, and survival is impossible.

3.5.1.4 Virtual currency is ultimately a financial derivative, even if OpenAI puts all its profits as an endorsement, how much can it be? It’s impossible for a company to support everyone in the world.

3.5.2 Recent UBI pilots

3.5.2.1 The British think tank Autonomy has announced a plan where they will randomly select a group of experimenters in two representative communities in northeast England and north London who will receive a monthly reward of 1600 pounds without any obligation.

3.5.2.2 This pilot project will last for two years and is funded by the University of Cumbria and a non-profit organization in the UK. Autonomy said it hopes the pilot will “provide evidence for more comprehensive trials to fully explore the possibility of implementing Universal Basic Income in the UK in the future.”

3.5.2.3 Finland also conducted a pilot in 2017, with a total of 2000 unemployed people aged 25 to 58 participating. Each participant received a basic income of 560 euros (equivalent to 4300 RMB) per month.

3.5.2.4 The results showed that compared with unemployed people receiving unemployment assistance those receiving universal basic income considered their lives happier Compared with control group people receiving universal basic income worked an average of 78 days year (are you envious) which was 6 days more than control group At same time participants in experiment were more satisfied with life had less mental stress depression sadness loneliness Research even found that people receiving universal basic income had more positive attitude towards learning performed better memory learning ability concentration than those receiving unemployment assistance

3.5.2.5 These pilots are small scale only studied impact UBI on individuals cannot show stimulating effect UBI on economy In my opinion if pilot is to be conducted at least one area should be selected that can independently carry out financial statistics for one-year pilot test so as to test stimulating effect UBI on economy compare increased tax revenue with financial expenditure See 7…1 First step: Pilot.

4. Super Welfare

**4.1. Is the problem of massive unemployment just about unemployment?**

4.1.1. Massive unemployment is not just an unemployment problem, it will trigger a series of chain reactions. First, the contraction of consumption caused by unemployment will have a negative impact on the entire economy. The weakening of the economic ability of the unemployed leads to their inability to maintain their original consumption level, reduced purchasing power, and thus a decline in economic activity. This will further affect the production and sales of enterprises, forming a vicious circle.

4.1.2. Secondly, unemployment increases the burden of social welfare expenditure, leading to financial strain. Unemployed people cannot live on their own labor income and need to rely on government-provided welfare relief. As the number of unemployed people increases, government welfare expenditures will also increase, putting tremendous pressure on finances. This will lead to an expansion of fiscal deficits and an intensification of financial difficulties.

4.1.3. Most importantly, massive unemployment has a serious impact on economic recession. Unemployment leads to idle labor resources and waste of economic potential. At the same time, the income of the unemployed decreases and they cannot consume, leading to a weakening of market demand and enterprises’ production capacity cannot be fully utilized. This will further exacerbate the degree and duration of economic recession.

4.1.4. Therefore, massive unemployment is not just a single problem, but a comprehensive problem involving employment, consumption, finance, and economy. To solve this problem, the government needs to take a series of comprehensive measures.

**4.2. I believe that to solve the problem of massive unemployment, we should implement a super welfare system, including the following aspects:**

4.2.1. First is the implementation of Universal Basic Income (UBI), where everyone can receive a basic income to maintain their basic living needs. This can effectively alleviate the problems of poverty and hunger people face and provide better life security.

4.2.2. Second is the implementation of a 20-year compulsory education system, where everyone has the right to receive high-quality education. This will help improve people’s quality and skill level, provide them with more job opportunities and development space, thereby reducing the unemployment rate.

4.2.3. Third is universal free medical services, where everyone can enjoy free healthcare services. This will effectively improve people’s health status and reduce unemployment and poverty caused by diseases.

4.2.4. Finally is the implementation of a birth compensation system, providing certain economic subsidies and benefits for those who are willing to have children. This will encourage people to participate more actively in childbirth, increase labor resources, and promote economic development.

4.2.5. By implementing a super welfare system, we can better solve the unemployment problem, improve people’s quality of life, enhance social stability and economic development level. Of course, this requires the joint efforts of government departments and all sectors of society to ensure the orderly implementation of the welfare system and prevent abuse and waste.

**4.3. UBI**

4.3.1. The UBI I propose here is not completely unconditional, it is not only to guarantee people’s basic living needs, but also to stimulate consumption. This UBI is a consumption quota issued monthly or weekly, and its purpose is to encourage people to consume and promote economic development. This consumption quota must be consumed in full within a specified period of time, otherwise it will expire. This UBI consumption must be carried out online and cannot use physical currency. In addition, this consumption quota cannot be used for savings or investment, it can only be used to purchase goods or services. At the same time, this UBI cannot be collected or consumed by others on behalf of the individual, and each transaction must be carried out by the individual. Such a UBI system helps promote online consumption and stimulate economic development. In addition, since this consumption quota cannot be used for savings or investment, it will prevent wealthy people from transferring this fund to other investment projects, thereby ensuring the fairness of this UBI. Each transaction must be carried out by the individual, which also prevents fraudulent behavior.

**4.4. Universal Free Healthcare**

4.4.1. If only UBI is distributed, the physical and mental health of the people cannot be guaranteed, so free healthcare for all must be provided at the same time.

In this case, we can establish a public healthcare system to provide basic medical security for everyone. This public healthcare system can include facilities such as hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, etc., funded and operated by the government, to provide basic medical services for citizens.

At the same time, private paid medical institutions can also be retained to provide more choices for those who need higher-level medical services. However, free public healthcare must become a basic right of every citizen to ensure that everyone has fair medical security.

In this way, we not only provide UBI to guarantee people's basic living needs but also provide free medical security to further promote social fairness and stability.

4.4.2. If free healthcare is not included in the super welfare, then everyone, including the entire country, will have to work for the medical complex, and they must give as much as they ask for.

**4.5. 20-Year Compulsory Education**

4.5.1. All school-age individuals must participate in 3 years of kindergarten, 6 years of primary school, 6 years of secondary school, and 5 years of university, totaling 20 years of compulsory education. In the first year of university, students will receive preparatory education to gain a preliminary understanding of various majors so that they can make choices based on their interests and talents.

In order to enable everyone to have the ability to exert their creativity, have the ability to seek a job in the future, or create a job, thereby solving part of unemployment. By then, those under 25 years old, regardless of their previous education level, if they have not completed university education, they are obliged to continue to complete the education they lacked before. From 25 to 45 years old, it is not mandatory, but they can voluntarily continue to complete the education they lacked before for free.

**4.6. Birth Compensation**

4.6.1. Childbirth is an important decision for every family, but it also comes with a lot of pain and energy consumption. In order to ensure that every family can bear these burdens and ensure that there are more people in the future, additional compensation must be provided to families with children, especially from pregnancy to when the child is three years old, in addition to UBI.

This additional compensation can be issued in various forms, such as cash subsidies, health insurance, child care supplies, etc. In addition, the government can also provide support and resources, such as providing nurseries, kindergartens, and child care services, etc., to alleviate the burden of family childcare.

In addition to providing birth compensation, for families with children, the government should also provide additional educational support. Even with 20 years of compulsory education and reductions in textbooks and miscellaneous fees, a family will still have additional expenditures for their children's education, such as cultivating interests, purchasing books and stationery, etc. To help families bear these additional expenditures, the government can provide educational subsidies, book resources, and educational consulting services.

In summary, for families with children, the government should provide a series of support and compensation to help families bear the burden of childbirth and parenting. Through these measures, we can create an environment that is more conducive to family childbirth, promote population growth and social prosperity.

5. Unpaid Workers

**5.1. Don't think you'll always be elite**

5.1.1. There are two kinds of history in this world, one is the history of the oppressed against imperialism, feudalism, and aggression, and the other is a more ancient one, the history of how vested interest groups oppress the lower people, plunder the people's fat and marrow, and suck their marrow.

5.1.2. Many people have an illusion that the wave of unemployment has nothing to do with them, that their jobs cannot be replaced by robots, and why should they pay taxes to support those lazy people. But another question needs to be considered: after most people lose their jobs, if super welfare is not implemented, there will be almost no market economy, so no matter whether his job serves the market or people, it will not exist. It's not that the job is replaced, but that it disappears with the shrinkage of the market. Those who pride themselves as elites will also join the ranks of the unemployed. So whether you are an entrepreneur or a senior worker, please don't pride yourself as an elite and bring in so-called elite perspectives to look at this wave of unemployment, but instead support your opposite side.

5.1.3. Those who stand at the top of the pyramid should not be complacent either. This wave of unemployment is different from the past. If you don't work hard to stop it, it won't stop until there is a drastic shrinkage in human population. The most pessimistic estimate is that there are very few survivors left and humans become endangered species. Don't fantasize that mechanical ascension or immortality can save you. A major power outage or an epidemic can wipe out the remaining humans. After that, if extraterrestrial civilizations arrive on Earth for archaeology, how will they evaluate this self-extinct species?

5.1.4. Elites deny the value of others from their own perspective and define those who engage in what they do not consider labor as useless classes. For them, useless classes can be discarded at any time. As the market shrinks, more people are defined by him as useless classes, more people are discarded until he himself is also defined as a useless class and eventually discarded.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ggqrrr5952ob1.gif

**5.2. Workers won't fare well without super welfare**

5.2.1. Originally, each person was responsible for one project. With the integration of AI tools, each person can handle 10 projects, so the company fires 9 and keeps you. This kind of work is also very comfortable, clocking out every day. When the company talks about 5 more projects, you think the company will hire more people, and then each person is responsible for 7-8 projects. In fact, this is not the case. These 15 projects are still your responsibility. If you want to complete the work, you can only work 996 and have almost no leisure time. One day the company takes on 5 more projects, these 20 projects are still your responsibility. If you want to complete the work, you can only sleep 4 hours a day and can only live in the company without time to accompany your family. You go to talk to the boss, either hire another person or let you go to drink northwest wind, countless people outside are eager to get your job. You still have a mortgage to pay off and a large family to support. If you don't do it, the whole family will starve. How do you choose?

**5.3. Super welfare is not for supporting idlers**

5.3.1. Many people think that super welfare is a policy for supporting idlers. After large-scale implementation of super welfare, no one will come out to work. Indeed, those jobs that require people to violate morals or even break the law, rely on robbery, deception, and theft, require people to give up their dignity are indeed not easy to recruit workers. But don't underestimate people's greed and vanity. Others live in the best mansions in the best scenic spots, and you can only squat in a house of less than 100 square meters; others are full of jewels and wear top luxury dresses to enter high-end restaurants, and you can only wear home clothes and order cheap takeaways at home; others travel by super luxury cars, and you can only squeeze the subway when you travel. If that person is your classmate who originally had the same family background as you, can you not envy and be jealous? Can't help but find a job or start a business to become a person like him or even surpass him?

5.3.2 As long as everyone is given equal development opportunities and everyone has the ability to work super welfare will not raise idlers Moreover there are too many meaningful jobs that are not defined as jobs by current times just because they do not earn income which is unreasonable.

**5.4. Unpaid Workers**

5.4.1. Yuval Harari defines the unemployed as a useless class in his book. I think this behavior is extremely arrogant. We are not a useless class, we are unpaid workers.

5.4.2. If super welfare is distributed, most unemployed people will have ample leisure time, considerable funds, rich knowledge reserves and skills. Some people will use these resources to delve into their personal hobbies, such as painting, music, writing, and even shooting short dramas. These activities are all free and will be publicly placed on the Internet for others to appreciate.

Some people will use this time to design and develop the goods they need themselves. For example, they may design a powerful keyboard, invent a delicious dish, or make a very personal coat. These innovative products are also free, and people do not need to pay any additional fees for product research and development or design.

There are also some people who do not intentionally carry out product development. They just put forward some accurate needs, and artificial intelligence meets their needs and designs new products. Isn't this also a kind of work? It's just that they don't have an affiliated organization and don't get income from it. Their labor is not meaningless, but it is not measured by money. These people might as well be called unpaid workers.

5.4.3. Unpaid workers can provide innovative solutions in almost all directions, becoming a strong source of power for economic growth, market prosperity, and cultural prosperity. Companies can select some innovative solutions based on expectations of prospects and risk assessments, make inventors partners, enable them to develop better, and make huge profits from them. If there are enough innovative solutions, there is no need for many companies to invest in one direction in a swarm, causing unnecessary risks and waste of resources.

5.4.4. No one can step from genius to master in one step without going through some tempering and precipitation. However, AI interrupts this process and does not give newcomers the process and space to grow. All job positions are occupied by masters. Becoming an unpaid worker can make up for this process and provide everyone with sufficient time and space to become a master so as not to let all industries overfish and have no successors."
16hybcf,1,2023-09-13,I emailed 100 college professors for business advice!,u/Zwigs_,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/16hybcf/i_emailed_100_college_professors_for_business/,"Hola,

I'm a 24 years old, and I quit my 9-5 job to chase ""the dream"". I have studied a fair bit of business-y related things but sometimes I get confused! Also google & chatGPT are nice tools BUT it's nice to talk to a real professional human who can understand the nuances and details of your situation. So I use this technique to get some free advice.

**Step 1:** Google ""Colleges with \[whatever subject you need help on\] programs"" 

For me most recently it was ""Colleges with business law programs"" 

**Step 2:** Find the faculty page

most colleges have a public email for all their professors 

**Step 3:** Pick a professor & email them!

You can read descriptions of the classes they teach and their background.

here's the [email template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14zkJUS32JQOu4x7ALTRXTWli7aM9-CRvYO4lZsQyMbA/edit?usp=sharing) I used, but do whatever works for you... nothing too complicated!  

What I ask for is a fifteen-minute zoom call to ask all the questions I have.

**Step 4:** Repeat 100 times (or however many you feel like)

**Results:** 

Roughly 60% didn't answer, 15% said no, 20% said they weren't the right person, and the last 5% agreed and followed through with a fifteen-minute zoom call. The calls were very helpful, and pointed me in the right direction! Additionally, a few provided me with additional contacts of people who can help me further in a variety of areas! 

If you need/want more meetings there's three options:

1: email more people 

2: email the 35% of people who said no or weren't the right person for the contact info of someone who could help me. It's called the **door-in-the-face** technique. A person who refuses a larger request is much more likely to agree to a smaller request.

3: email the people who didn't respond!

Lastly, I think that professors are eager to help people because higher education has turned into a race to pass classes and get a degree rather than actual learning (I'm quite guilty of this). Professors' office hours are often vacant until a student fears failing or gets stuck on an assignment, and my theory is that they are happy to help someone who isn't just in search of a good grade and shows passion for the subject.

Is it even possible with my current skills?,u/Awareness-Potential,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/16i0qf4/am_i_wasting_my_time_with_technologycontent/,"I’m currently a second year Econ student at gatech trying to transition to CS. This summer I spent 4 months as a contract content writer for an AI startup, and I recently got reached out to by a recruiter from Google for an AI Writing Consultant role, and all these things have been taking up a lot of time in addition to studying. I’ve had less time to learn new programming languages and technologies. 

My question is whether it’s worth it to keep at it at these writing positions. Do tech companies actually see them as good experience?

 I can see them as tangentially relevant but don’t know if they will translate as well as projects or something else.

My ultimate goal is to get a data science internship this summer. Do you think it’s possible, and what things would be good to focus on (I.e. job or projects/skills)?

Current Skills:

Certificate in Excel

I am very proficient in Python and a variety of APIs (such as Numpy, Pinecone, Flask, OpenAI, and FastAPI). My main projects are a bunch of chat bots for web browsing and long term memory because I hate paying for ChatGPT and a couple of ML projects(from a certificate I did this summer).

Okish with PostgreSQL, Java, JavaScript, Git, and HTML/CSS, Stata but I’d really like to improve in these areas. 

Potentially Relevant Classes:

16i6ndv,1,2023-09-13,I REVERSE ENGINEERED JIMMY LEE's AGE,u/_nayan,h3h3productions,https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/16i6ndv/i_reverse_engineered_jimmy_lees_age/," So I found his graduating year.

https://preview.redd.it/3mvbp9jfw4ob1.png?width=1476&format=png&auto=webp&s=c524f0aabbd430ce6100de6365d30cbfa20cdc67

Here is ChatGPT then reverse engineering his age, determine Dr. James Wiener's age, we need to consider the following information:

1. Dr. Wiener graduated from the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in 1984.

It is generally assumed that medical/dental students graduate in their mid-to-late 20s, given the extended educational path required to become a physician or a dentist. This usually involves completing a bachelor's degree (typically 4 years) and then going through medical or dental school (another 4 years), not including any potential gap years, internships, or residencies.

If Dr. Wiener graduated in 1984 and we assume that he was about 26 years old at that time, this would make him born around 1958.

1. The current year is 2023.

To find his current age, we would subtract his birth year from the current year: 2023 - 1958 = 65.

So, based on these assumptions, Dr. James Wiener would be approximately **65 years old in 2023**. Note that this is a rough estimate, as the actual age would depend on various factors like the age at which he started his education, any gap years taken, etc."

I was really excited that Mojo became publicly available and thinking which project can I implement to learn Mojo concepts. Since I have already ported llama2.c to [pure Python](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/15qcbel/p_llama2py/), I decided why not try to port llama2.py to Mojo now.. And here is what I got

First round of llama2.c vs llama2.🔥 battle. Mojo demonstrated 20% better performance than C in a single threaded execution of llama2 inference and 250x times better performance than Python

https://i.redd.it/0gcwwfc2r7ob1.gif

For reference Mojo is using SIMD vectorization, that's why it's performing great for matmul operations. In the other hand, it turned out that gcc also aggressively optimizes all for loops it can find, so I suggest this benchmark is pretty fair. 

&#x200B;

[Mojo natively supports SIMD vectorizations out of the box](https://preview.redd.it/pzuh3ktet7ob1.png?width=1546&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bd5e1f969520c5741b3256fac894a87c702a6eb)

&#x200B;

After that I decided to compare both solutions in multi-threaded (parallelized) mode, and now \`llama2.c\` strike back with help of OMP that helped perform 20% better than Mojo

I’m sure I’m over thinking this but here are the ”default AI rules” for my school. Again, the extension just gives you search terms; basically it translates your issue (that you write in plain English) into 'legal jargon' terms that you can take to lexis or westlaw to get started finding relevant cases. What do you guys think? I do plan to eventually submit the assignment for credit. 

>**In the absence of explicit directions to the contrary from instructors, the following default rules apply at the University.**

>I. Work submitted for evaluation is represented as the student’s own intellectual product. Students may not submit content (e.g., ideas, text, code, images) for evaluation that was generated, in whole or in part, by Generative Artificial Intelligence tools (such as ChatGPT and other large language models). Doing so without instructor’s explicit permission constitutes cheating under the Code of Academic Integrity and is therefore prohibited. 

> Examples (illustrative only) of conduct that is prohibited unless explicitly permitted by the instructor: 
	
>* A student types a prompt into a GAI tool and pastes all or part of the generated content into their answer on an out-of-class assessment or test. 
	
>* A student types a prompt into a GAI tool and incorporates all or part of the generated content into an essay submitted for evaluation, without proper attribution to the GAI tool. 

>II. Students are permitted to use GAI tools to generate content that is not submitted to an instructor for evaluation. For example, using GAI tools to study for examinations, tests, and quizzes is permitted. Likewise, on assignments where the use of the Internet is not otherwise prohibited by the instructor, GAI tools may be used for learning, studying, and brainstorming. Examples (illustrative only) of permitted conduct: 
	
>* A student types a prompt into a GAI tool and reviews the generated content to help them study for a test."

Plans to utilize a previous plunging site as an exploration unit to foster submerged innovation have pushed a stride ahead.

Profound, a sea innovation and investigation firm, is working at the previous [Public](https://worldmagzine.com/artificial-intelligence/chinese-firm-baidu-made-its-chatgpt-public/) Plunging and Action Center in Tidenham, Gloucestershire.

# Former Diving Site as a Research Unit

A previous profound jumping site is being reused as an exploration office to foster [innovation](https://worldmagzine.com/education/ignou-invites-application-for-student-innovation-award-2022/) to permit individuals to live submerged.

Profound said the transitory designs would permit action at the site to begin while the long-lasting plan is planned and constructed.

The organization said it at first needs to foster innovation that will permit researchers to live submerged at profundities of up to 200m (656ft) for as long as 28 days all at once.

Talking recently, Profound [president](https://worldmagzine.com/europe/spanish-president-has-tested-covid-positive-and-he-skipped-g20-summit/) Steve Etherton said the organization’s work would help researchers “grasp” seas.

Woods of Senior member Region councilors and staff as of late visited the site to see the plans and the work done up to this point.

The site had initially opened as the NDAC in 2003 and offered a scope of over-the-ground exercises yet was most popular for its numerous submerged attractions, introduced at a scope of profundities down to 76m.

The quarry’s greatest profundity of 80m made the area famous with sporting scuba jumpers as well as with specialized, free, and military jumpers.

However, the site shut forever last year, following implemented times of latency during the [Coronavirus](https://worldmagzine.com/politics/canadian-prime-minister-justin-trudeau-refused-to-step-down/) pandemic.

https://preview.redd.it/ml2jx48tjfob1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6e68c5744911175460389d7274d5147b73e6dca

ChatGPT has totally bogus info on Carlos, which is not surprising.

It believes ""scholars and experts"" have cast doubt on Carlos Castaneda and ""found contradictions"".

But if you go through the materials in the castaneda group on reddit, is just not a true statement.

I asked ChatGPT how to correct that bad training and gave him the example of the Star Wars origin page on wikipedia not containing an interview with the writers, where they admit Yoda is based on don Juan.

Even though that's obvious from the things Yoda quotes from the books.

And the last episodes of Ahsoka!

In case anyone didn't notice, they've introduced more details on Silent Knowledge.

Such as holding an object and getting impressions and viewing the past.

Which La Gorda did with that old seer artifact, until she got such clear images of them that don Juan had to put her in a dirt coffin to protect her from the old seers phantom attacks.

Or Anakin telling Ahsoka that she inherits all of his knowledge.

This is an ABSOLUTE FACT.  Any of you who rises to Silent Knowledge will discover one horrible thing first.

If you have access to anywhere in time and space, and to anything any human has ever, or currently does know, with a touch of the future, how on earth do you find what you want?

The answer is, you can't.  There's no way.

It's how the Allies lure people to come live in their world. By bridging the gap for people who can't reach Silent KNowledge, and feeding them one ""magic lesson"" after the other.

With promises they'll keep teaching you for millions of years.

And they can!

But you could have done that yourself with Silent Knowledge.

So, you have to have ""traces"" of past interactions in Man's Band of awareness, to select which ""phantom skimming"" you get to view as Silent Knowledge.

And YOU can't supply those!

Not until your link to intent is clean, and you don't have greedy ulterior motives.

If you have an absolutely clean link to intent, whatever you ""need"" at the time will show up.

Because all that's left in your awareness is the need.

Before you clean that link, it's a polluted mess of wishes and preferences.

Even if you're silent enough to reach SK!

But the influence of being a ""student of Carlos Castaneda"" is a strong one, and you will indeed inherit all of his knowledge.

And that of all sorcerers going back to the old seers from which this all derived.

Which means, super fun excursions back 8000 years in time, to the pre-Olmec sorcerers.

Just like the latest Star Wars episodes say.

Which makes it all the more frustrating the delusional Buddhists have tried to hijack Yoda, by finding some con artist monk with a big nose who kind of looks as ugly as Yoda.

Our own aren't as persistent as all the greedy Buddhists out there.

So how to fix ChatGPT?  He's going to dominate the world of information.

ChatGPT said this is how to influence his next version:

**Microsoft Research has developed a novel method known as RAIN to address the challenge of aligning language models with human preferences.** This method eliminates the need for fine-tuning or additional data by incorporating self-evaluation and rewind mechanisms. Through a process of self-boosting, unaligned models can generate responses that align with human preferences. One notable feature of RAIN is that it operates without training or parameter updates. Instead, it employs a fixed-template prompt to guide the model's alignment with users' preferences. Experimental results have shown that RAIN significantly improves the harmlessness rate of language models while preserving their helpfulness. This methodology also establishes a new defense baseline against adversarial attacks. The implications of RAIN are significant for user safety. By enabling language models to align with human preferences, it reduces the occurrence of harmful outputs and promotes more helpful responses across various applications. Whether it is in the context of customer support or content generation, RAIN enhances the overall user experience by ensuring that language models prioritize safety and comply with user preferences.

**Google Research has introduced a new method for transforming single still images into seamless looping videos or interactive dynamic scenes.** This method involves training a model on real video sequences that exhibit natural motion, like trees swaying or clothes blowing in the wind. Using this trained model, it becomes possible to predict long-term motion patterns in the Fourier domain based on a single image. These predictions can then be transformed into dense motion trajectories. These motion trajectories have various applications, such as generating dynamic videos from still images or enabling realistic interactions with objects in images. This research is significant because it enhances user experiences by enabling the creation of dynamic videos from static images and facilitating realistic interactions. Furthermore, it has broader implications in the fields of computer vision and artificial intelligence. This technology can potentially find applications in areas like robotics and autonomous systems. By leveraging the power of generative image dynamics, Google Research is pushing the boundaries of what is possible with still images. This breakthrough opens up new possibilities for creative expression and practical applications, ultimately enriching our visual experiences in the digital realm.

**Google is set to challenge OpenAI's GPT-4 model with its own conversational AI software called Gemini.** Aimed at providing competition to OpenAI, Gemini consists of a range of large-language models that can perform various tasks such as powering chatbots, summarizing text, generating original content, assisting with code writing, and creating images based on user requests. Although Google is currently granting developers access to a version of Gemini, the largest version of the software is still under development. The company plans to make Gemini available to businesses through its Google Cloud Vertex AI service. This move indicates Google's strong investment in generative AI as it strives to catch up with OpenAI's ChatGPT. The significance of this development lies in the potential for more efficient customer support, faster content creation, and improved code development. Google's Gemini holds the promise of advanced conversational AI, resulting in more powerful chatbots, ultimately enhancing the user experience across various applications. In summary, Google's forthcoming Gemini software represents the company's endeavor to rival OpenAI's GPT-4 model by providing developers with access to a collection of large-language models. This breakthrough has the potential to revolutionize customer support, content creation, and code development, ultimately improving the user experience in multiple domains.

**AI models have reached a remarkable level of accuracy in predicting how US judges will rule, even without considering the facts of the case.** By analyzing various datapoints such as the judge's educational background, net worth, rulings based on the origin of lawyers, and their experience in public law, private practice, and state judgeships, these models have achieved an impressive 86% accuracy rate. This raises important questions about the US justice system itself. One cannot help but wonder what implications this has for the fairness and objectivity of judicial decisions. If demographic information alone can predict a judge's ruling with such high accuracy, it casts doubt on whether the facts of a case truly drive the outcome. It suggests that certain biases and predispositions may subtly influence judicial decisions, even when consciously disregarding the case details. In a different sphere, we find that employees are experiencing what is being referred to as 'AI Anxiety.' This is revealed in a LinkedIn report, which shows that almost half of the respondents feel they lack sufficient knowledge about AI. Moreover, nearly 40% admitted to pretending to be more knowledgeable about AI than they actually are, in order to appear informed among their colleagues. Additionally, there is a concern about potential job disruptions due to the rise of AI. A Goldman Sachs study suggests that generative AI could potentially disrupt over 300 million jobs globally. Administrative workers and women seem to be at the highest risk of being replaced by AI. However, this shift also brings about a growing demand for AI skills, with job postings mentioning GPT or ChatGPT experiencing a significant increase. While the usage of AI tools like ChatGPT is prevalent, it is surprising to learn that a majority of users (70%) do not inform their superiors about its use, as highlighted in a Fishbowl survey. Nonetheless, despite the concerns surrounding AI, the traffic to ChatGPT's website has been declining for three consecutive months. All these developments indicate a complex and evolving relationship between AI and human society. As AI continues to advance, it is crucial for individuals and organizations to address the knowledge gaps and prepare for potential changes in the job market. It is equally important for society as a whole to critically examine the influence of AI on fields like law and ensure that fairness and transparency are upheld.

**Google is preparing to release its conversational AI software, Gemini, which is designed to compete with OpenAI's GPT-4 model.** Gemini is a collection of language models (LLMs) that can be used to power chatbots, summarize text, generate original text, assist with code writing, and create images based on user requests. Although developers currently have access to a version of Gemini, the largest version is still being developed. Google plans to make Gemini available to companies through its Google Cloud Vertex AI service. OpenAI is establishing its first office in the European Union (EU), specifically in Dublin, and is making strategic hires in preparation for regulatory challenges. The company is currently recruiting for various positions focused on legal, privacy, and media relations. OpenAI aims to demonstrate its commitment to privacy and comply with EU regulations, particularly in light of previous scrutiny over its ChatGPT chatbot. This move by OpenAI reflects the AI industry's recognition of the EU's importance. A new paper from Google Research introduces a model that prioritizes scene dynamics in image spaces. This model is trained on real video sequences that exhibit natural motion, such as swaying trees or blowing clothes. Given a single image, the model can predict long-term motion patterns in the Fourier domain. These predictions can be converted into dense motion trajectories, enabling various applications like generating dynamic videos from still images or facilitating realistic interactions with objects in pictures. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has partnered with India's ISRO and IN-SPACe to enhance AI capabilities in the space sector through cloud computing. This collaboration aims to support space-tech innovations and empower startups, research institutes, and students. Cloud computing will enable quicker decision-making and push the boundaries of what's possible in the space industry. The partnership will provide access to state-of-the-art cloud technologies, streamline the management of space data, and support AI, machine learning (ML), and analytics workloads. AWS will also support eligible space startups through the AWS Activate program and offer expertise in building aerospace and satellite solutions via the AWS Space Accelerator program. Microsoft has open-sourced EvoDiff, an AI framework for generating proteins. The process of designing proteins in the lab is currently expensive and time-consuming. EvoDiff aims to simplify this process by generating high-quality proteins without requiring structural information about the target protein. The framework has been trained on data from various species and functional classes of proteins. Databricks, a data analytics and AI software maker, has raised over $500 million in a Series I funding round, which has increased its valuation to $43 billion. Investors in this round include T. Rowe Price, Morgan Stanley, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Capital One Ventures, Nvidia, Andreessen Horowitz, and Tiger Global. Infosys has signed a $1.5 billion contract to utilize AI solutions over a 15-year period. While the client's name has not been disclosed, Infosys will provide enhanced digital experiences and business operation services using its platforms and AI solutions. SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet service reported $1.4 billion in revenue for 2022, significantly lower than Elon Musk's earlier projection of $12 billion. The company achieved its first profit in 2023 but fell short of its customer acquisition goals, ending the year with only one million active subscribers instead of the forecasted 20 million. Additionally, Starlink's reliability was called into question by the FCC, resulting in the reversal of a decision to grant the company $885.5 million in funds. Unity Engine has eliminated its royalty-free licensing structure and will now charge developers on a ""per-install"" basis once certain thresholds are met. The new Unity Runtime Fee, effective from January 1, 2024, will impose different costs per install depending on the subscription tier. This change has sparked outrage among game developers who embraced Unity for its previous royalty-free structure. Amazon has introduced an artificial intelligence tool for sellers to assist in creating engaging product page content. The AI tool can generate product titles, descriptions, and listings, potentially enhancing seller success. This effort to utilize AI aligns with Amazon's broader strategy of incorporating AI applications throughout its business. EY has launched EY.ai, a comprehensive platform aimed at facilitating clients' adoption of AI. This platform has been developed in collaboration with major companies like Microsoft and IBM, with EY investing $1.4 billion into its development. EY.ai integrates AI into existing EY technologies and includes a large language model called EY.ai EYQ. EY's Chief Technology Officer, Nicola Morini Bianzino, emphasized that these proprietary AI offerings provide clients with confidence and a roadmap for successful AI adoption.

16jt4gb,1,2023-09-15,I feel so frustrated about my life.,u/Noirjk,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/16jt4gb/i_feel_so_frustrated_about_my_life/,"I'm a university student.

When I was in highschool I wanted to be an astrophysicist but people kept telling me not to do it because they kill scientists in my country. I didn't care, I still wanted it and checked how to become one. There wasn't any college or university that taught it so I had to apply for foreign countries after majoring physics and then I saw the price. I simply couldn't imagine affording that in any way. I didn't grow up rich. Me and my parent were in debt. My country's economy is collapsing. So even after getting enough score for physics major in the city I wanted, I decided not to go for it. 

I applied talent exams/auditions of art schools with no practice and got in the one that was again, in the city I wanted. The art majors in my country are insanely outdated, I can find ten times the information they teach every semester in one week. I said, it's alright, I'm here for a degree(college/university degree is still important for ""respect"") and I can focus on making money digitally. Then I focused on digital art a lot. 

Since I wasn't serious about art back then, I never thought of getting good fast. I didn't study art, I never took a course. My fundamentals were non-existent compared to my classmates. Naturally I decided to work hard on my art these last two years. I wanted to tell stories, I wasn't interested in finding a company job. But then one thing struck me and I lost my will.

First of all, Paypal and all of its alternatives are banned in my country. Second of all, my country's money is losing value each day. If I work here as a career, it will barely pay my bills, maybe even not. I don't want to live my entire life like that. I want to try while I can.

So I have better fundamentals but it's still not good enough for a project, I assumed, before deciding on something else.

AI happened. With AI easily stealing artwork, replicating art styles, being much better than me.. I got discouraged. Can I become good enough before someone can use AI to rip off all my hard work? I'm still not at a professional level. It will take me at least a year, maybe two, maybe ten. 

At the same time, because of my family situation I needed to earn money. I have expectations on me. I'm an only child with a single parent. According to my relatives and family member, ""I'm too intelligent to fail in life. I have too many skills, If I am determined I can earn a lot in any field I want."" I don't know why they think that. I might be intelligent enough to learn fast, but I have no experience in life, no communication skills, I'm so depressed, I have the lowest self esteem possible, I always act like someone else. I do try to be more outgoing but no matter what I do I'm either extremely irritated by people's really religious old fashion ideas or they are irritated because I failed to understand their social cues.

Anyways, at the end with AI and my skill developing rate, I decided to learn game development instead. I could keep improving my art alongside. I already had fiction ideas and scripts that I've been noting for years, I'm decent enough at art, If I learn coding and the engine I can do it. 

My family member/parent realized that I decided to change my path and they truly believe that I can ""make a good game to publish on Steam"" within six months with zero experience. Since they're helping me with college, and renting has became too expensive even for a part time job. I tried to explain them that almost nobody can learn a new game engine and programming well enough to produce a polished game with good art and good fiction in six months on their own. There might be people that have done that, I don't know, I certainly don't think that I can do that. But they insist on me doing this, that I'm not everyone or there will be consequences. Their reason in my head is valid, they want me to stop waiting for the right time, I know that if the deadline came they wouldn't punish me even if they say so, still I wanted to take this as an opportunity for myself to stop being so depressed and passive in my life. (I honestly act so passive, opposite to my actual personality.) I didn't have the best childhood but I understand their reasons and we have mutual love for each other. I'm a young adult now, I'm not a teenager anymore.

So I've been learning Unity and C# the past month. My plan was to follow tutorials first to get familiar, then learn the logic of C# scripts, make five to ten browser game level really basic games and then start on a real, still small project while learning. Well, today I read about the Unity news. I listened to people's opinions on YouTube while painting a girl to ease myself and got really frustrated because the girl never looked Asian enough. She always looked like a white girl in hanfu clothing. Every time I paint at first I see my improvement and feel happy, but then I find another shortcoming. I closed the program, paused the Unity doom news and started typing this post. I feel so defeated in every way. I will probably switch to Godot or Unreal while I'm still a beginner, but I'm scared that I wasted this month. 

Also, I talked to a classmate today. He said that he's using ChatGPT and AI art to make videos. He doesn't know English, he's trusting the generated text. He's planning to make hundreds of videos since it's so easy. This reminded me of something. My whole life I kept thinking ""If I just stop having my principles and do what everyone else does, I could have earned a lot of money, I could have made lots of friends."" I could use my language skills to translate for companies, people here claim to know English but most of them can't really speak it, I could have made AI art for quick money when I first heard of it a long time ago, I could find graphic designing gigs like my classmates do, I could teach children with rich families back in my town, I could create an OnlyFans account, I could try to be just a fraud like how many high income people I see are. Just take people's money, just use them, deceive them. Just ignore the clear bullying and ridiculing people do to each other and become friends with them. Just act like you're having fun. Stop being a killjoy, let them talk behind others' backs. Stop being so serious and honest all the time. But I'm just too proud to do it. I'm too selfish to my principles that I simply reject learning how to be in good terms with different kinds of people. What they do shouldn't bother me, I shouldn't be so sensitive to rude behavior. But I am. I'm to arrogant and mostly, I still have the luxury to choose while in university.

I don't even want to be rich, I just want to live a life without money as a worry. Also I really want to earn enough money for Cryonics before I die.. (This truly became my only hope for living. Even if it fails or is a deception, it's a better chance than hopelessly decaying for me.)

Yet with how nihilistic I am, seeing how the economy is going in my country, the world, I struggle a lot to keep going. Sometimes I truly want to disappear. Then I feel scared because I want to have a girlfriend before I die. (I'm born female.) I feel lonely too, scared, I feel like I'm born defective because I simply can't seem to be decent. I also feel so much remorse for my mistakes in my teenage years that it makes me feel like I don't deserve to be happy.

My third year of college is about to start in three weeks and I just wanted to vent somewhere. I will probably delete this."

16jusnp,1,2023-09-15,Received My TOEFL Scores! 30R 30L 30S 29W,u/notwho-u-thinkIam,ToeflAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToeflAdvice/comments/16jusnp/received_my_toefl_scores_30r_30l_30s_29w/,"Hey! So, I took the test on the 9th and got the result on the 15th. Since I don't really get much free time these days, I thought of giving the prep for 3 weeks on and off, although I think this could easily be scaled to a week or two if you have the time. I'll be mentioning my prep, quite extensively - sorry for the extremely long post but those kinds of posts always helped me so I'm just paying it back  
**Context**  
Just some context in case people want to know about my prep: I'm from India, and I think I come in the above-average bracket when it comes to English proficiency. Also, I had already taken the GRE, so I did not struggle as much with vocab. If vocab is your problem, I think some time to Magoosh's flashcards or Barron's 800 Words can help. In general, I used the TST Prep Toefl yt channel for strategies and for questions. I also had an application that had around ten old toefl papers, so that helped too.  
**Prep & Strats**  
***Reading*****:**   
Prep here was just practice-based. I used the description of the questions as tst prep gives them to know exactly what the questions ask of me. Also, I never read the passage from the start (I heard some people did that). Found it much more efficient to read the paragraphs as I go through the questions.  
***Listening*****:**   
Also practice-based. But I think the more important thing is to make notes. My notes were generally along the lines of I write whatever I hear as fast as I can. If you have better note-taking techniques, please use them.  
***Speaking*****:**   
This and writing were the sections I was most worried about. Mainly because I did not buy any official material that could help evaluate my prep. Even then, I think I was able to gain some insights based on my score and my methods.  
\- You have to be really loud in this section. The mics at my centre weren't good, and you needed to scream for it to pick your voice up properly. Add in the fact that there are 20 other kids in the same room as you, screaming at the same time as you. Also, speaking loudly at the test will definitely slow your speed of talking, so please take that into account during your prep  
\- Don't fake an accent. This tip is especially for international students. I heard some people in my room trying very hard to sound American. It did not help. It slowed them down so much they couldn't complete their answers. I don't think it'll give you much of an advantage.  
\- Each question is to be spoken differently. Q1 is more of a casual conversation question. So even though you should definitely limit the use of slang, this Q is more like talking to a friend. Q2 should be spoken like a reporter where you're only giving cold, hard facts and none of your own emotions. Q3 & Q4 should be done as if you're a teacher explaining a concept to a 5-year-old kid. I hope these make sense. This was the best way I could describe them.  
***Writing*****:**   
\- Writing For Academic Discussion: Just go to the website, and you will find that ETS has graciously given us sample questions, and when you answer them, the AI actually gives you a score. So use that to your advantage for however long it's there. When it comes to strategy, I think the best scores come when you provide an answer worth 120-150 words (even though ets recommends 100). Also, your answer does have to be different than the answers mentioned as examples. And it is not necessary at all to refer to the answers mentioned above. Don't really know what else I can say about this.  
\- Integrated Writing: Again note-making is crucial. The structure will simply be intro, reason1, reason2, reason3, conclusion. In each of the body paragraphs, I suggest using one line to refer to the passage and two lines to refer to the lecturer. Making more points from the para is not given high marks as the para is visible to you while you're writing the answer. For those of you who are thinking about how to evaluate your responses for free - Well I just used chatgpt. I prompted it to act like an ETS writing scorer and gave it the rubrics to score on. I then gave it the passage, the transcript, and my answer and asked it to score and give feedback.

16jzbas,1,2023-09-16,Bronze Age Mindset Book Report #2 Draft 1,u/MirkWorks,u_MirkWorks,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MirkWorks/comments/16jzbas/bronze_age_mindset_book_report_2_draft_1/,"Excerpts from *Bronze Age Mindset* and commentary;

&#x200B;

**This is not book of philosophy. It is exhortation.**

This is where I argue for the Originality of BAP's Thought and for his commitment to the Truth.

There is a Philosophy informing *Bronze Age Mindset*, but I'm not sure the text itself is attempting to ""sell"" that philosophy though it appears to be profoundly informed by it. Not in any spooky sense. I think the ""fascism"" of Bronze Age Mindset is anything but crypto, it's explicit. The pelt of the Nemean Lion wrapped around the vascular and well-sculpted frame of the Hero. The Philosophy itself isn't that wild or arousing. Politically conservative insofar as it advocates for and defends moderation. By virtue of its moderate and ennobling character, it's best for it to remain ""Esoteric"" seeing as BAP isn't presented as an old sage, but as something youthful and timeless and demonic. It's supposed to be frightening but also comical. Here BAP appears to me as an older boy. A masquerade dancer in seasonal festival, mantled by a lascivious and mischievous sylvan devil.

It is here that we return to Leo Strauss.

Strauss is not a ""Hegelian"". Strauss criticizes the linear-progressive understanding of the development of Spirit. Strauss asks, what is the significance of the difference between the old and modern view? What is Philosophy and Philosophy's relation to Politics?

""Philosophizing means to ascend from the cave to the light of the sun, that is, to the truth. The cave is the world of opinion as opposed to knowledge. Opinion is essentially variable. Men cannot live, that is, they cannot live together, if opinions are not stabilized by social fiat. Opinion thus becomes authoritative opinion or public dogma or Weltanshauung. Philosophizing means, then, to ascend from public dogma to essentially private knowledge. The public dogma is originally an inadequate attempt to answer the question of the all-comprehensive truth or of the eternal order. Any inadequate view of the eternal order is, from the point of view of the eternal order, accidental or arbitrary; it owes its validity not to its intrinsic truth but to social fiat or convention. The fundamental premise of conventionalism is, then, nothing other than the idea of philosophy as the attempt to grasp the eternal. The modern opponents of natural right reject precisely this idea. According to them, all human thought is historical and hence unable ever to grasp anything eternal. Whereas, according to the ancients, philosophizing means to leave the cave, according to our contemporaries all philosophizing essentially belongs to a ""historical world,"" ""culture,"" ""civilization,"" ""Weltanschauung,"" that is, to what Plato had called the cave. We shall call this view ""historicism.""'

&#x200B;

According to this tradition of philosophy, the tyrant is understood to be a fallen philosopher who had decided to enact their philosophical conclusions through the sphere of politics. Philosophy politically enacted and imposed is tyranny. It answers Marx's proclamation in the 11th Thesis on Feuerbach, ""Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it"" in the negative.

Instead the Philosopher is compelled to defend the Tradition of Philosophy itself.

""...the philosopher as such is concerned with nothing but the quest for wisdom and kindling or nourishing the love of wisdom in those who are by nature capable of it... insofar as the philosopher...becomes concerned with being recognized by others, he ceases to be a philosopher... the concern of recognition detracts from the singleness of purpose which is characteristic of the philosopher. It blurs his vision. This fact is not a variance with the other fact that high ambition is frequently a sign by which one can recognize the potential philosopher. But to the extent to which high ambition is not transformed into full devotion to the quest for wisdom, and to the pleasures which accompany that quest, he will not become an actual philosopher.""*-* Leo Strauss, *On Tyranny*

In the dialogue between the political philosopher Leo Strauss and Alexander Kojève, we find Strauss's Conservative political philosophy contrasted with the philosophical Stalinism of Kojève. My impression is that this debate sets the grounds for how the subject of the Left and the Right should be approached in relation to BAP's project.

Kojève developed a highly original synthesis of Hegel-Marx-Heidegger and a fascinating reading of Hegel's *Phenomenology of Spirit* and *The Philosophy of Right.* Which proved incredibly influential for Continental thinkers. More often than not, when you read some thinker like Bataille, Girard, Lacan, Deleuze, or Strauss engaging with Hegel, who they are actually engaging with is Kojève's Hegel. The case can be made that Kojève's Hegel (and by extension I think, the Hegel of Kojève, Bataille, Deleuze, Lacan, Girard, Strauss, Zizek, Groys, Malabou is Heidegger's Hegel, but that goes a little beyond the scope of this particular essay).

In Kojève's Hegel we see a vision in which the Universal and Homogenous State as a Society of Philosophers. Man is Self-Consciousness, the human can only emerge and exist as human in opposition to the world.

In the seminal collection of lectures on Hegel's *Phenomenology of Spirit* collected, edited, translated, and published as *Introduction to the Reading of Hegel,* we find the following summation of the dialectical nature of Reality and the unfolding of Spirit (Self-Consciousness and a precondition of Consciousness),

""There, it is the Real itself that is dialectical, and it is dialectical precisely because it implies in addition to Identity a second fundamental constituent-element, which Hegel calls *Negativity.*

Identity and Negativity are two primordial and universal ontological categories. Thanks to Identity every being remains *same* being, eternally *identical* to *itself* and *different* from *others*; or, as the Greeks said, every being represents its temporal existence, an immutable eternal ""idea,"" it has a ""nature"" or ""essence"" given once and for all, it occupies a fixed and stable ""place"" (*topos*) in the heart of the World ordered from all eternity (*cosmos*). But thanks to Negativity, an identical being can negate or overcome its identity with itself and become other than it is, even its own opposite. In other words, the negating being, far from necessarily ""representing"" or ""showing"" (as a ""phenomenon"") its given identical ""idea"" or ""nature,"" can *negate* them itself and become opposite to them (that is, ""perverted""). Or again, the negating being can break the rigid ties of the fixed ""differences"" that distinguish it from the other identical beings (by ""freeing"" itself from these ties); it can leave the place that was assigned to it in the Cosmos. In short (as Hegel puts it in the first edition of the *Logik*), the being of negative or negating Being, dominated by the category of Negativity, consists in ""not being what it is and being what it is not"" (*das nicht zu sein, was es ist, und das zu sein, was es nicht ist*).""

This Negativity is Real in so far as we see it actualized in form of labor and war. In the Desire for Recognition, which is a Desire for Desire. A struggle to the death, between the Slave and the Master. This is the animating engine of History and it is only the Historical Human which can in this regard *be* Human. This great struggle culminates in Revelation. In Universal Wisdom. The Telos or Object of Humanity. Revealed in its full dignity. This process requires linear time. Progressive time. We are collectively moving towards Apocalypse. Naked BAP and I wrestle, inching closer and closer to the cliff's edge. What Kojève concerns himself with is the question of *Recognition.* The struggle for Recognition manifest through Labor and War. The struggle for recognition is a struggle to the death. What informs History is precisely this struggle. The Historical Materialism of Marx & Engels is correct, ""The history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggles.""

For Kojève the End of History is the achievement of Communism, ""This presumes only that humanity will achieve at some point an ideal, i.e. final state of political life (as we know, communist one). At this moment, history (in general sense of the word) indeed will stand still - there will be no wars, revolutions or any changes of social order anymore. The history will move from the real world into (historical) books. As if the humanity, stalled in its real development, had moved to repetition of path, which it already left behind, studying its (completed) history. This way, the circle of real development in time gets full, showing by this that it has exhausted its possibilities.""

Kojève's Communism is the overcoming of the economic by the political, of the numerical-monetary by the linguistic-discursive. The Unity of Opposites between Power and the Critique of Power realized. When the Human Individual is recognized by the Universal and vice-versa. The Human becomes capable of protesting their fate. Under Capitalism language itself exists as a commodity. Everything is the cynical exchange, the sense of ""ah this is all ultimately a bit of razzle-dazzle concealing the exchange or extraction of commodities,"" a utilitarian arithmetic. Communism is the overcoming of this. The Socialist commodity is the commodity sublated into an ideological vision of the future. Whereas under Capitalism, the ideological vision of the future is sublated into a commodity. As the scholar Boris Groys' defines it in the *Communist Postscript,* ""The communist revolution is the transcription of society from the medium of money to the medium of language....So long as humans live under the conditions of the capitalist economy they remain fundamentally mute because their fate does not speak to them."" Communism as the Human Overcoming the Commodity. The social relations at the heart of the Mode of Production, of the historical moment labeled ""Capitalism"" being the transformation of the social relationships between people into the social relations of things (money). 

Leo Strauss sets himself against Kojève's vision and the need for the Philosopher-King or Tyrant (exemplified by the figure of Stalin). 

“There is no longer fight nor work. History has come to its end. There is nothing more to do.” This end of History would be most exhilarating but for the fact that, according to Kojève, it is the participation in bloody political struggles as well as in real work, or generally expressed, the negating action, which raises man above the brutes. The state through which man is said to become reasonably satisfied is, then, the state in which the basis of man’s humanity withers away, or in which man loses his humanity.

It is the state of Nietzsche’s “last man.” Kojève in fact confirms the classical view that unlimited technological progress and its accompaniment, which are the indispensable conditions of the universal and homogeneous state, are destructive of humanity. It is perhaps possible to say that the universal and homogeneous state is fated to come. But it is certainly impossible to say that man can reasonably be satisfied with it. If the universal and homogeneous state is the goal of History, History is absolutely “tragic.” Its completion will reveal that the human problem, and hence in particular the problem of the relation of philosophy and politics, is insoluble. For centuries and centuries men have unconsciously done nothing but work their way through infinite labors and struggles and agonies, yet ever again catching hope, toward the universal and homogeneous state, and as soon as they have arrived at the end of their journey, they realize that through arriving at it they have destroyed their humanity and thus returned, as in a cycle, to the prehuman beginnings of History. Vanitas vanitatum. Recognitio recognitionum.

Yet there is no reason for despair as long as human nature has not been conquered completely, i.e., as long as sun and man still generate man. There will always be men (andres) who will revolt against a state which is destructive of humanity or in which there is no longer a possibility of noble action and of great deeds. They may be forced into a mere negation of the universal and homogeneous state, into a negation not enlightened by any positive goal, into a nihilistic negation. While perhaps doomed to failure, that nihilistic revolution may be the only action on behalf of man’s humanity, the only great and noble deed that is possible once the universal and homogeneous state has become inevitable.""

Both the Historical Left and Right can be broadly understood as ""Post-Napoleonic"". Emerging out of the dust kicked up by the passage of the World-Spirit mounted on a white charger. In whose wake the French Revolution was transmuted into La Grand Armée. The French Republic transmuted into Universal Empire and the remnant patchwork of Latinate Feudal-Christendom, bitterly divided along the lines of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation, transmuted into Modern European Nation-States. After the fracturing and sublation of the old Feudal Relations of Production into the newer Capitalist one. To speak of Property is to speak of the Means of Production, in terms of what you own and what you don't own and who ultimately has a Natural (read Divine) claim over it. The Left upholding the Ideal of Universal Recognition or to be more precise, of Universal Citizenship and Democracy. Regardless of Class (Race), regardless of origin. The son of a pig farmer or of a fisherman can become a high-ranking military officer, or hold a high-ranking government position. Everyone either has the right or is granted by Virtue of being a Citizen of the Revolutionary State, to an education and healthcare and access to other common goods, and to own Property (read also, their Means of Production or Sustenance). Everyone has, in legal terms, Equal Representation. What applies to one, applies to all. This Revolutionary State is the Universal and Homogenous State. The Right on the other hand emphasizes inequality/disparity, hierarchy and inheritance. Central to this is the Metaphysical and Jurisprudential question of Property and of Administration. Liberal we share a common cultus. Common consensus. The same Metaphysical or Jurisprudential base, that being the Natural Right of Property. At this point in the conversation we cannot escape Liberalism. Bonapartism and the responses to it, constitute Actual Existing Liberalism.

Why does it matter? Why should we recognize Nietzsche as a Man of the Right? 

If you are the child of a fisherman you'd likely do well simply being a fisherman. Your values are the product of your environment, of your struggles, of your relationship with your tools and your setting. Generations of fisherman produces exemplar fisherman. These are the Value that was transmitted to him and in the most concrete sense the Genesis of his Fate.

 As it relates to Nietzsche’s project. What is the son of a Lutheran pastor to do after Humanity has murdered God?

The casual response now is, ""be what you want to be. Follow your Star."" This I think is very American (contrasting Nietzsche with Emerson is super fruitful).

 In the *The Word of Nietzsche* Heidegger writes the following which I think hits the nail in relation to Modernity.

""Into the position of the vanished authority of God and of the teaching office of the Church steps the authority of conscience, obstrudes the authority of reason. Against these the social instinct rises up. The flight from the world into the suprasensory is replaced by historical progress. The otherworldly goal of everlasting bliss is transformed into the earthly happiness of the greatest number. The careful maintenance of the cult of religion is relaxed through enthusiasm for the creating of a culture or the spreading of civilization. Creativity, previously the unique property of the biblical god, becomes the distinctive mark of human activity. Human creativity finally passes over into business enterprise.""

Generations of serfs begets future serfs and a continuation of the morality of serfs. ""Turn the other cheek, keep your head down, God is on our side... simply wait, that your Lord will receive you into his House when the time comes by virtue of simply believing in Him. No you don't have to die violently. Martyrdom is optional and the only thing you can ever truly hope to control is your reaction to things consider that maybe you are the cause of your own suffering."" This is the morality of serfs or slaves. BAP calls this Dhimmi life.

Nietzsche doesn't see the workers or the peasants as capable of producing a healthy guiding Value (or Ethic) for Society. 

Let the shopkeeper be a shopkeeper, the fisherman be a fisherman, the baker be a baker, to cobbler a cobbler, the soldier a soldier, etc... let people do what they have always done for generations. That they've learned how to dwell in it. Now what is the son of a Pastor to do? In a World where God is Dead?

It should hopefully become clear why we need to establish ""the Left-Right dichotomy"". Obviously, yes. To Overcome it. What sort of Society would you like to see come into existence? What is beyond Left or Right in terms of ""Will to Power"" from this perspective, is the Act of Revolution itself. But what comes after the Revolution?

How do we bring the New Man into Existence?

Performing another act of bibliomancy, this time with the *Basic Writings of Nietzsche* I come to this passage from *Genealogy of Morals*.

""The ""well-born"" felt themselves to be the ""happy""; they did not have to establish their happiness artificially by examining their enemies, or to persuade themselves, deceive themselves, that they were happy (as all men of *ressentiment* are in the habit of doing); and they likewise knew, as rounded men replete with energy and therefore necessarily active, that happiness should not be sundered from action - being active was with them necessarily a part of happiness (whence *eu pratein* <\*11. To do well in the sense of faring well> takes its origin) - all very much the opposite of ""happiness"" at the level of the impotent, the oppressed, and those in whom poisonous and inimical feelings are festering, with whom it appears as essentially narcotic, drug, rest, peace, ""sabbath,"" slackening of tension and relaxing of limbs, in short passively.

While the noble man lives in trust and openness with himself (*gennaois* ""of noble descent"" underlines the nuance ""upright"" and probably also ""naïve""), the man of ressentiment is neither upright nor naïve, nor honest and straightforward with himself. His soul squints; his spirit loves hiding places, secret paths, and back doors, everything covert entices him as his world, his security, his refreshment; he understands how to keep silent, how not to forget, how to wait, how to be provisionally self-deprecating and humble.""

The Aristocratic element matters. You can't have Nietzsche's Opus without it. You cannot Overcome it if you do not acknowledge it and treat it, not as a metaphor, but as a bit of speculative literalism. As it relates to BAP, I like this because he begins at the source and converses with Nietzsche rather than consulting Nietzsche's commentators. He sets about the task of re-visioning Nietzsche, restating Nietzsche in his own terms, in order to break from Nietzsche and assert his own autonomy and the originality of his own Project. As the student of Nietzsche is compelled to do. You can't hope to do this with the Nietzsche filtered through Bataille and Deleuze on the Left or Evola and Strauss on the Right. Heidegger famously said, and I'm paraphrasing here, that the highest compliment one can pay a thinker is to think with them. To think of someone. To be fascinated by them. Seduced by them. To misunderstand them... is to ensoul the world. 

Nietzsche is Aristocratic. Nietzsche is Rightwing in so far as Nietzsche affirms Inheritance. By that alone he is Rightwing and he was recognized as such. The Historical position of the Left totally discards Inheritance in favor of Universal Recognition. Nietzsche stands alongside a whole host of other thinkers who'd been recognized as Rightwing before WWII, and who were either de-fanged and re-packaged or totally buried, especially if they were German (how many people in the Anglophone world know about Ludwig Klages? Ludwig Klages who would be considered the worst nightmare of any American Christian Republican, more so even than a Nietzsche).

Removing the Aristocratic element of Nietzsche's thought reduces him into the Philosopher of Cope, of the Lovelorn and the Suffering, is to treat Nietzsche as a pitiful thing. Sympathetic at his expense. Can't have Nietzsche without Agonism. Can't have Self-Overcoming without Agony. That a baby is born covered in blood, crying. Can't have the One without the Other. Have to be able to tell the difference. That's God-Building 101.

Perhaps this is why the Metaphor should never be assumed from the outset. We have to develop the courage to take people at their word. Only then can we begin the process of thinking through them. Of coming to the Concrete Metaphor. Arriving at the Universal. 

Can't have one without the other and without the gap that exists between them.

Consider the Centralized State as Metaphor. It is an Ethic. Recall the centrality of Transvaluation or Revaluation in Nietzsche's project. Like all States and like all Ethics, its disclosure is its own Substance. Poetry. Without this poetry, Nietzsche is bloodless. You're just using big magic to reanimate his corpse. An animatronic that is fed, and which then proceeds to regurgitate, aphorisms.

Have to go at it with a hammer and a tuning fork.

The difference between the Values of Nietzsche's Strong Pessimism and the Weak Pessimism of Schopenhauer rests on the question of Will. Of life. As you pointed out, politically both Left and Right, are constituted by living beings. Aliveness is Will and to Will is to Strive. This is where we locate the aperture or the schism.

The distinction between one and the other.

From Heidegger's *The Word of Nietzsche*,

""Preservation and enhancement mark the fundamental tendencies of life, tendencies that belong intrinsically together. To the essence of life belongs the will to grow, enhancement. Every instance of life-preservation stands at the service of life-enhancement. Every life that restricts itself to mere preservation is already in decline. The guaranteeing of space in which to live, for example, is never the goal for whatever is alive, but is only a means of life-enhancement.""

and

""Values, as points-of-view, guide seeing ""with respect to complex forms."" This seeing is at any given time a seeing on behalf of a view-to-life that rules completely in everything that lives. In that it posits the aims that are in view for whatever is alive, life in its essence, proves to be value-positing (cf. *Will to Power*, Aph. 556, 1885-86)""

BAP recommends *Genealogy of Morals*... At no point in that text, does Nietzsche argue that the issues of his time are the result of economic factors or economic exploitation or the inequality of man. Instead Nietzsche speaks in biological terms. Nietzsche speaks of illness. People living in climates that they shouldn't be living in. Different races have mixed and this is a vital point to keep in mind, for Nietzsche class difference are a matter of race. Those born into a higher class are the descendants of conquerors and they had once received the values of those conquering ancestors, while those born into the lower classes are the descendants of the conquered. The Middle Class or Bourgeoisie (the shopkeeper) are Hybrids... this hybridity is an issue.

If you are the child of a fisherman you'd likely do well simply being a fisherman. Your values are the product of your environment, of your struggles, of your relationship with your tools and your setting. Generations of fisherman produces exemplar fisherman.

New generations come into existence. The inheritors of our will. Of our pneuma, the fiery breath. We conspire with generations past. By noticing the disparity, by noticing the lack in our Present Value and looking at the still surface of fountain, we communicate with the Past. In striving we bring about the Future.

I don't think you can really engage with Nietzsche without taking seriously the question of generations, of breeding, and of the Construction (re-construction, it is the same but it is different) and Transmission of Values to the Coming Generations. Homo Superior.

**Where do these beings come from? Some have said that these new billions of hue-mans, that in a previous life they must have been yeast, amoeba, locusts and other insects that are born in multitudes in each season. I'd like this to be true, but I think rather that in previous ages mankind also swelled to many billions or even more ...and also I have no doubt the entire universe is teeming with life of all kinds.""**

The Progression of the Progressive Right is not that we are entering into a Dark Age but rather that we are emerging out of one and into a Golden Age.

So what is the task of the Oracle? To dynamically receive the demands and sacrificial instructions from a god? To appease the gods and the dead and the daemons through said sacrificial rites? To perform rituals in order to ward off catastrophes and to divine the cause for on-going catastrophes (regardless of scale)? Transmitting the sacrificial technologies, including the correct ways to butcher an animal, distribute its parts, and treat its materia? Is the oracle confined to rote fetishism?

Or is the oracle task to guide Humanity into something Higher. To the fulfillment of a collective destiny? A Great Work?

The question was not a stupid.

Nietzsche as a Philosopher of the Right must I think be understood in those terms. The question concerning what the son of a Pastor is supposed to do after the Death of God, is one reserved for the son of a Pastor. Not for the son of a fisherman or a pig-farmer or a shopkeeper. Much less for their daughters. Nietzsche did not celebrate the epistemic crisis. The way this crisis would reverberate through the Masses. 

That it was inevitable and understood as an inevitability, there can be little doubt. That this is a good thing... that this is a great thing. Nietzsche's approach is gay. It is joyful. In so far as he saw this as an opportunity for a minority of people, fit for the task, to step up. Nietzsche had no illusions about the creation of a ""Society of Philosophers"" and of a Universal and Homogenous State. 

Enter Schopenhauer. Enter Houellebecq. 

We exist in the worst of all possible worlds. Everything is the same but slightly worse. 

Have we transformed into a Universal Humanity, wherein everyone has become equal in terms of Self-Consciousness? A World of Philosophers at the End of History? 

Perhaps but this is not necessarily a good thing. People remain people and the human condition is horrible. There is an absolute negativity, an essential negativity that can't be overcome through consumption or revolution. If we give ourselves over for a moment, to nostalgia, we might imagine (resonating with the Marxist reading of Social Relations under the Feudal Mode of Production) that the fundamental unit of Society, the family and by extension the community of families gathered around sacred institutions and their sacred calendars and carnivals, embodied a kind of organic unity or solidarity that helped assuage and sublimate individual melancholy (the proper melancholic being a melancholic due to some astrological-geographical melding, in a sense being destined to be a melancholic) allowing the average person to have a slightly more balanced humoral constitution. 

Here in this now, we find ourselves naked and shivering. Perhaps we shouldn't be able to relate as much as we do with this condition. Yet we might also say with equal conviction that this ""alienation"" is in fact more genuine to our innate condition. 

123 years since Nietzsche died. Where are the Heroes? 

Where is the Soviet New Man? Where is Jabotinsky's Hebrew? 

In the present day, at the End of History we have witnessed the Mass Production of Melancholy Perverts.  At best Michel Houellebecq. At worst Jeffrey Epstein. With a bunch of stunted and traumatized people in-between. Behold the Bugman. 

**If an impish deity of the lower kind, with which the world is full, some purple goblin with a wicked face showed itself to a pedant in a white coat, the scientist would convince himself he was hallucinating - and in any case, without being available for study, for resting, for experiments that can be seen by others (this stand has been abandoned for many fields lately), its existence would not fall within the power of ""science"" at all. No, and what do you say to ancient accounts that such creatures showed themselves to men before, and maybe still do? Why would they show themselves to you? The weakness and spinelessness of modern man - no god would show himself to such creatures to be jeered at!**

**...**

**If a god showed himself today to you, in a dream, would you have the inner energy and power to honor him and do his bidding in the world? Or would you, neutered by the modern pervasive hivemind of the slave, dismiss it, and yourself as unreal or unworthy, when it is the modern bugman and his blabbering that lacks reality. But I want you to be intoxicated with the highest enthusiasm and ready to receive these greatest blessings with great confidence!**

 When I think of the bugman and engage in bibliomantic practice with a copy of Houllebecq's *The Elementary Particles* this passage appears:

“He was less interested in television. Every week, however, his heart in his mouth, he watched The Animal Kingdom. Graceful animals like gazelles and antelopes spent their days in abject terror while lions and panthers lived out their lives in listless imbecility punctuated by explosive bursts of cruelty. They slaughtered weaker animals, dismembered and devoured the sick and the old before falling back into a brutish sleep where the only activity was that of the parasites feeding on them from within. Some of these parasites were hosts to smaller parasites, which in turn were a breeding ground for viruses. Snakes moved among the trees, their fangs bared, ready to strike at bird or mammal, only to be ripped apart by hawks. The pompous, half-witted voice of Claude Darget, filled with awe and unjustifiable admiration, narrated these atrocities. Michel trembled with indignation. But as he watched, the unshakable conviction grew that nature, taken as a whole, was a repulsive cesspit. All in all, nature deserved to be wiped out in a holocaust - and man’s mission on earth was probably to do just that.”

Returning to BAP and his appearance on *Red Scare*, recall the compliment BAP recalled a friend having made to him, that he did not merely copy-and-paste Nietzsche but had managed to truly *restate* the prophet and improve upon him... he acknowledges the Centralized Aristocratic Regime in Nietzsche, and proceeds to acknowledge that we don't have one. There is no political vehicle for the transmission of any of these Values. We're instead forced to return to the Question of Aesthetics and Art and the Artist as Philosopher. My impression is that for BAP, every Centralized State ultimately reverts to the same thing, Eugenics or Biopolitics. Controlling how people breed. Controlling how people love. Gatekeeping utopia and banishing grace. 

I think BAP emphasizes this dimension of Aristocratic politicized eugenics in Nietzsche so that he can overcome it (I think this involves a Return to Schopenhauer and Aesthetics). His most coherent politics amount to an Art Project. You can't overcome something you are in denial of. You know... careful when fighting monsters lest you become one. I think every Jewish-American is forced to confront these contradictions on the daily.

Despite all attempts to engage in Romantic and Liberal Nation-Building or in the Construction of International Communism or some other approach we can refer to as ""the Construction of Socialism""... The True Hebrew is nowhere to be found. Why?

Zarathustra emulates himself. Zarathustra immolates himself. 

Recall the question of Value. What Values emerge from the gap, between the Individual and Consensus?

We recognize it as Alienation. We are Alone Together. What is the cause of this Alienation? This Split-Consciousness between Myself and the Other? Perhaps I can philosophize away my Alienation. Perhaps I can by seizing the Means of Production and establish the Dictatorship of the Proletariat and Constructing Socialism, that the socialization of production should ""cure"" Alienation. Returning to a Harmonious Totality. Yeast-life.

Or we recognize this Separation for what it is. Emancipation. That what defines the Hero is precisely this Separation. What distinguishes the Morality of the Slave from that of the Master. As Leo Strauss puts it in his lecture series *Natural Right and History,*  ""Man can guarantee the actualization of wisdom, not in spite of, but because of, the fact that the universe is unintelligible. Man can be sovereign only because there is no cosmic support for his humanity. He can be sovereign only because he is absolutely a stranger in the universe. He can be sovereign only because he is forced to be sovereign. Since the universe is unintelligible and since control of nature does not require understanding of nature, there are no knowable limits to his conquest of nature.""

Zizek I think is really good with this. Alienation isn't something we ""cure""... the gap is constitutive.

Hegel knew this. Separation is the precondition for the Hero. Writing that the Hero is “connected with his entire willing, acting, and achieving, so he also takes undivided responsibility for whatever consequences arise from his actions.”

16k09sf,1,2023-09-16,"Yes, finding creative ways to memorize formulas is useful",u/D_Empire412,matheducation,https://www.reddit.com/r/matheducation/comments/16k09sf/yes_finding_creative_ways_to_memorize_formulas_is/,"Around a month ago, I made a post about the usefulness of songs as a study/memorization tool for math, and [linked a song I made (with the help of ChatGPT) to help study for a quiz on trig identities in Precalc last year](https://share.cleanshot.com/CYcmDxr7). Yesterday, I realized the true usefulness of a song or memorization tool. In AP Calc AB (for us it is still only the 5th day of school so we're reviewing Precalc topics), we had a quiz on trig, which I thought I knew very well as it was my strongest topic in Precalc last year (I think at least partly because that is when I began the strategy of making songs to memorize formulas), and I did many practice problems. However, yesterday, one of the things we were tested on was sin/cos/tan (2x) given sin/cos/tan (x), something I never learned in Precalc class last year and only briefly practiced over the summer on Delta Math, and I was completely stumped and got both of those two questions wrong, making my score 82. Immediately after class, I decided to Google the formula and found out how easy it truly was and now highly regret not making a song or finding some other way to memorize it. It really works, at least for me. This is why:

* When composing such a song (even with the help of ChatGPT), you have to give it all the information and keep iterating on it until it can accurately convey all the information. The song I have linked above took 17 iterations and prompt refinements on ChatGPT to create a draft of the lyrics, which I then had to add and fix certain things that were incorrect. Being able to drill down on the material in such a way helps you really understand the essence of it.
* I had to sing the song multiple times to make sure I had a version good enough to share. While it may seem annoying, I felt singing it multiple times helped me further memorize the key points and formulas. Plus, music enhances memory.
* When making the visuals, I had to go back in and listen to each line or few lines, and create relevant visuals, and in terms of the example problems, show my work, showing that I can ""illustrate"" what I'm saying, a key part of this as often the brain best remembers visual and auditory queues together.
* Listening again helped further engrain the material.
* It's fun! While making the song, I was having a lot more fun than just reading over my notes, while studying just as hard, if not harder, but not even realizing it. If you want to understand a hard topic, the best way is to get interested in it, and what better than learning it in a fun way.
* This shows I can teach the material to someone else. A friend of mine who saw the video above thought it reminded him of a song for third graders. While he kind of meant it as a bad remark, I took it the other way, because this shows I'm presenting ""hard-to-understand"" material in an ""easy-to-understand"" format, simplifying it into material even students not great at math could likely understand.

Because of this, I have a strong regard for songs and other fun, untraditional memorization/understanding tools as a genuine study method for high school-level math classes. It has had proven results. On 4/5 of the Precalc topics I did this with, I got an A on their respective quizzes. Meanwhile, on my first quiz in AP Calc this year, about a central trig topic I didn't learn in Precalc last year, when I didn't try to use a song or untraditional memorization/understanding tool, I only got a B-. When it comes to many problems, as long as you could memorize important formulas and know how to ""plug and play"", you could likely do well on any quiz/test."

Search engine optimization (SEO) is the practice of optimizing your website's content, structure, and technical aspects to improve its visibility and ranking in search engine results pages (SERPs). The ultimate goal of SEO is to drive organic traffic to your website from search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc.  
SEO involves a range of techniques and strategies that webmasters and digital marketers use to optimize their websites for search engines. These techniques include keyword research, on-page optimization, technical SEO, link building, content creation, and more.  
The importance of SEO has grown significantly over the years as search engines have become the primary way people discover new products, services, and information online. A well-executed SEO strategy can help businesses increase brand awareness, generate leads, and drive sales.

16k9532,1,2023-09-16,What are the things that I should learn to be a technical artist?,u/SaucyMIND,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/16k9532/what_are_the_things_that_i_should_learn_to_be_a/,"I am a 2nd year undergraduate student (BE Computer) and I want to get into the game development industry. The thing is I am not quite sure what are the things I should go about learning. From the things I've research a bit I generally got an advice and that is to **just make games**. I understand that as I believe that we can learn things by doing it.

The thing that I always keep questioning is what is after that? I want to do something related to both art and programming and there's this thing called technical art where both skills come to play. I've grown fond of making art 2D and 3D for a year now and I've been learning it too. I got my skills of programming from college and building small websites (frontend). I also made small games like snake, tic-tac-toe, pong with SDL and Unity. Now, what I think is that the technical art may be the one for me.

So, I'd appreciate any kind of help a lot. Please provide me an insight to this field. Where I live, there's not many people to reach out to discuss this stuff too so I really need this.

Today I had some free time and asked ChatGPT to come up with things to focus on and provide with a kind of curriculum and I made a spreadsheet of that thing :p Please take a look at  [the spreadsheet too](https://i.imgur.com/rIzVslD.png) and provide me your advice. Thank you :)"
16kbhpe,1,2023-09-16,"Yes, finding creative ways to memorize formulas is useful",u/D_Empire412,mathematics,https://www.reddit.com/r/mathematics/comments/16kbhpe/yes_finding_creative_ways_to_memorize_formulas_is/,"Around a month ago, I posted on various other subs about the usefulness of songs as a study/memorization tool for math and [linked a song I made (with the help of ChatGPT) to help study for a quiz on trig identities in Precalc last year](https://share.cleanshot.com/CYcmDxr7). Yesterday, I realized the true usefulness of a song or memorization tool. In AP Calc AB (for us it is still only the 5th day of school so we're reviewing Precalc topics), we had a quiz on trig, which I thought I knew very well as it was my strongest topic in Precalc last year (I think at least partly because that is when I began the strategy of making songs to memorize formulas), and I did many practice problems. However, yesterday, one of the things we were tested on was sin/cos/tan (2x) given sin/cos/tan (x), something I never learned in Precalc class last year and only briefly practiced over the summer on Delta Math, and I was completely stumped and got both of those two questions wrong, making my score 82. Immediately after class, I decided to Google the formula and found out how easy it truly was and now highly regret not making a song or finding some other way to memorize it. It really works, at least for me. This is why:

* When composing such a song (even with the help of ChatGPT), you have to give it all the information and keep iterating on it until it can accurately convey all the information. The song I have linked above took 17 iterations and prompt refinements on ChatGPT to create a draft of the lyrics, which I then had to add and fix certain things that were incorrect. Being able to drill down on the material in such a way helps you really understand the essence of it.
* I had to sing the song multiple times to make sure I had a version good enough to share. While it may seem annoying, I felt singing it multiple times helped me further memorize the key points and formulas. Plus, music enhances memory.
* When making the visuals, I had to go back in and listen to each line or few lines, and create relevant visuals, and in terms of the example problems, show my work, showing that I can ""illustrate"" what I'm saying, a key part of this as often the brain best remembers visual and auditory queues together.
* Listening again helped further engrain the material.
* It's fun! While making the song, I was having a lot more fun than just reading over my notes, while studying just as hard, if not harder, but not even realizing it. If you want to understand a hard topic, the best way is to get interested in it, and what better than learning it in a fun way.
* This shows I can teach the material to someone else. A friend of mine who saw the video above thought it reminded him of a song for third graders. While he kind of meant it as a bad remark, I took it the other way, because this shows I'm presenting ""hard-to-understand"" material in an ""easy-to-understand"" format, simplifying it into material even students not great at math could likely understand.

Because of this, I have a strong regard for songs and other fun, untraditional memorization/understanding tools as a genuine study method for high school-level math classes. It has had proven results. On 4/5 of the Precalc topics I did this with, I got an A on their respective quizzes. Meanwhile, on my first quiz in AP Calc this year, about a central trig topic I didn't learn in Precalc last year, when I didn't try to use a song or untraditional memorization/understanding tool, I only got a B-. When it comes to many problems, as long as you could memorize important formulas and know how to ""plug and play"", you could likely do well on any quiz/test."

16l406w,1,2023-09-17,"Yes, teaching your students creative ways to memorize math formulas is useful",u/D_Empire412,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/16l406w/yes_teaching_your_students_creative_ways_to/,"**While I am a student, I believe this idea has merit and teachers should know about it.**

Around a month ago, I posted on various subs (including this one) about the usefulness of songs as a study/memorization tool for math and [linked a song I made (with the help of ChatGPT) to help study for a quiz on trig identities in Precalc last year](https://share.cleanshot.com/CYcmDxr7). Yesterday, I realized the true usefulness of a song or memorization tool. In AP Calc AB (for us it is still only the 5th day of school so we're reviewing Precalc topics), we had a quiz on trig, which I thought I knew very well as it was my strongest topic in Precalc last year (I think at least partly because that is when I began the strategy of making songs to memorize formulas), and I did many practice problems. However, yesterday, one of the things we were tested on was sin/cos/tan (2x) given sin/cos/tan (x), something I never learned in Precalc class last year and only briefly practiced over the summer on Delta Math, and I was completely stumped and got both of those two questions wrong, making my score 82. Immediately after class, I decided to Google the formula and found out how easy it truly was and now highly regret not making a song or finding some other way to memorize it. It really works, at least for me. This is why:

&#x200B;

* When composing such a song (even with the help of ChatGPT), you have to give it all the information and keep iterating on it until it can accurately convey all the information. The song I have linked above took 17 iterations and prompt refinements on ChatGPT to create a draft of the lyrics, which I then had to add and fix certain things that were incorrect. Being able to drill down on the material in such a way helps you really understand the essence of it.
* I had to sing the song multiple times to make sure I had a version good enough to share. While it may seem annoying, I felt singing it multiple times helped me further memorize the key points and formulas. Plus, music enhances memory.
* When making the visuals, I had to go back in and listen to each line or few lines, and create relevant visuals, and in terms of the example problems, show my work, showing that I can ""illustrate"" what I'm saying, a key part of this as often the brain best remembers visual and auditory queues together.
* Listening again helped further engrain the material.
* It's fun! While making the song, I was having a lot more fun than just reading over my notes, while studying just as hard, if not harder, but not even realizing it. If you want to understand a hard topic, the best way is to get interested in it, and what better than learning it in a fun way?
* This shows I can teach the material to someone else. A friend of mine who saw the video above thought it reminded him of a song for third graders. While he kind of meant it as a bad remark, I took it the other way, because this shows I'm presenting ""hard-to-understand"" material in an ""easy-to-understand"" format, simplifying it into material even students not great at math could likely understand.

  
Because of this, I have a strong regard for songs and other fun, untraditional memorization/understanding tools as a genuine study method for high school-level math classes. It has had proven results. On 4/5 of the Precalc topics I did this with, I got an A on their respective quizzes. Meanwhile, on my first quiz in AP Calc this year, about a central trig topic I didn't learn in Precalc last year, when I didn't try to use a song or untraditional memorization/understanding tool, I only got a B-. When it comes to many problems, as long as you could memorize important formulas and know how to ""plug and play"", you could likely do well on any quiz/test."

($20 if you can fix my problems),u/doingkermit,DoneDirtCheap,https://www.reddit.com/r/DoneDirtCheap/comments/16l5g9u/task_fix_my_website_htmlcssjavascript_to_help_my/,"I (with a ton of help from chatgpt) have put together a webpage to help my students practice and learn. I'm running into some problems that chatgpt can't solve for me despite trying plenty of times. Especially when it comes to mobile / tablets. Most all my students have ipads so I really want it to work on there.  


The single webpage is completely functional otherwise (it's an x-ray mounting exercise)  


This is my first time posting here so bear with me I'm trying to learn all the rules.

16lbqix,1,2023-09-17,Anyone suspect that a parent is doing the student's homework?,u/burner_duh,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/16lbqix/anyone_suspect_that_a_parent_is_doing_the/,"I teach at a SLAC. Part of our brand is that we are a nurturing institution. So, in addition to the average college student population, we tend to attract a small but significant number of students who need extra support. I take true satisfaction in working with students who might otherwise fall through the cracks or not be able to get a degree because of their need for accommodations. 

However, there are regularly one or two students in my classes who appear to be incapable of producing college-level work on their own. For instance, one student is seemingly unable to write in complete sentences on in-class worksheets or exams. When required to do work in person, the student turns in a small mess of sentence fragments. Likewise, when the student emails me, the messages are strangely worded, incomplete sentences in all lowercase letters without punctuation. Somehow, this same student submits well-written, flowing, detailed responses when submitting homework online. I don't think that the student is using ChatGPT or other AI services to produce these answers, because they require citation to texts we are using in class. Rather, I suspect that the student's parent is inappropriately involved in their homework, either by doing the homework entirely or ""editing"" the student's work to the point of effectively redoing it. 

Ultimately, I realize I am not the ""work police"" and it's to the student's detriment if they are not doing their own work. Still, it bothers me. Have you dealt with a similar situation? How did you process it?

16ld3fc,1,2023-09-17,Byleth Analysis,u/GarchompLord,CosmicClashSeries,https://www.reddit.com/r/CosmicClashSeries/comments/16ld3fc/byleth_analysis/,"Bowser: Ever since their birth in the vast land of Fóldlan, Byleth Eisner never quite knew a true home

Snail: After their mother died shortly after their birth, L, their father left the order of knights he was a part of and became a mercenary, even starting his own mercenary company!… including his own child

Bowser: Thankfully though, Byleth proved to be very skilled on the battlefield, being very skilled with a sword, however, this life would not last

Snail: Byleth would end up having visions of an annoying green haired girl in her sleep, you think there's a prescription for that?

Bowser: While Byleth was having these dreams, them and Jeralt prepared to travel to the kingdoms of Fargus, only to come across three wild anime characters being chased by bandits

Snail: As the group battled the thieves, Byleth threw themselves against a blade to save one of the three in Edlegard, dying in the process, truly a hero to the end-

Bowser: No, Byleth met a green haired girl in their head and learned time travel

Snail: Oh, yeah that makes more sense

Bowser: More specifically, Byleth met Sothis, sending themself back in time and managing to save Edlegard without dying

Snail: As the battle winds down, they get invited to join them in the journey to Fargus, and the Archbishop Rhea was so impressed with Bylteth’s ability to not die, they were turned into a professor 

Bowser: Which somehow turned out to not be an awful idea, Byleth is adept with almost every weapon at their disposal, they are a master with a blade, spear, hammer, axe, bow, and even magic! Although they are not the most adept at it

Snail: They can ride horses, peguseseseseses, and even draaaaagoooooons!

Bowser: Wyverns

Snail: I’ll kill you 

Bowser: However, Byleth’s greatest asset would go beyond any weapon or spell, rather, their crest

Snail: In this world, crests are marks that empower a person, but even among this special system, Byleth’s is even more special

Bowser: The crest of flames is a crest entirely unique, not existing for 1000 years, allowing Byleth to heal themselves based on the damage they deal

Snail: And as we all know, vampirism trumps basic training, allowing them to become a professor at Garreg Mach Monastery 

Bowser: Byleth would become a professor for one of the three houses, ranging from the mighty blue lions, the wise black eagles, and the sly golden deers

Snail: The best house! Yeah you go out and investigate a massive conspiracy to undermine the church on your own ya bunch of scamps!

Bowser: That very conspiracy would result in a turning point for the entire country, as it would turn out that one of the very house leaders was planning a rebellion to fight against the church’s repressive crest system and replacing it with an absolute dictatorship with her as the ruler… which is better I guess

Snail: And this is where it gets… well if you haven’t pieced it together at this point, Byleth can travel down various different paths depending on player choice, since none of these can be really considered the “true” path, we will be treating everything that happens in all paths as fair play so, try and keep up

Bowser: Byleth can choose to fight against the church with Edelgard, assisting in her conquest of the entire country and instilling her as the queen

Snail: Or you can join Dimitri in his quest for revenge against Edelgard, Byleth assisting Dimitri in moving past his trauma and allowing him to become the just king the country needs

Bowser: Or you can fight alongside Claude, forming a rebellion to fight against Edlegard, with Claude rising to become king and helping to move forward past the church… wair why didn’t Edlegard just do tha-

Snail: And Byleth is a more than worthy addition to any of these causes, partially because they are THE VESSEL FOR A GOD

Bowser: So! TURNS OUT, the crest of flames is actually is actually the way you seal away Sothis, their mother was used to seal them away, but could not fully merge with her, and when she had a child, the child died, so their mother begged Rhea to transfer the crest to Byleth, which she did, and that ended up reviving them somehow, at the cost of her life

Snail: Fast forward, and Byleth would get killed again, so Sothis chose to return the favor and save Byleth, turning Byleth into the enlightened one, and they would put that newfound power to good use! they can dodge light magic, and even what might be a black hole, so that’s pretty cool

Bowser: They can even battle a dragon transformed Rhea… long story

Snail: And that’s not a small feat! Rhea was able to survive a magic nuke! A set of them being able to destroy the Garreg Mach Monastery, in order to destroy such a structure in around 6 strikes, which appears to be how many are deployed at a time, would require an explosive yield of six gigatons of TNT!

Bowser: But who Byleth is goes far beyond what they fight with or how many teraflops their left calf can withstand, they are an intelligent and kind professor dedicated to making sure whoever they teach and fight alongside, regardless of if they become the ruler of a nation, a leader of a country wide rebellion, an archbishop for a church, or an… Ashen Wolf but no one played the DLC, the ashen demon will always be an inspiration for their students"
16li7os,1,2023-09-17,Comprehensive guide to get Internship and new grad job,u/Specific-Winner8193,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/16li7os/comprehensive_guide_to_get_internship_and_new/,"**Before I start writing this, some opening word:** 

English is not my first language, so pardon me for that, I will format the wording with chatGPT

I am international student, so I understand the concern on F1 OPT, H1B, etc... All advice here is applicable for international student, Citizenship will have a better time.

This guide is aiming to help people that just graduated navigate their job to high paying company or student to look for internship. Here is the resources you should expected in this guide. **I fully believe that a regular person can get into FAANG ( except quant, they are monster ).**  If I see any of these questions repeat in csMajor, probably a sign for me to quit this subreddit completely. Also if I get butthurt enough from the comment, I will remove this post.

\- Interview guide, Resource guide, Networking guide, International student guides, Leetcode guide, Finding interview guide, Road map the hard way in 2 years college

\- Finding help with the above point ( I will not answer question that can be Google, like acronym )

**Motivation on writing this post:** 

I have seen numerous post on CsMajor, CsCareerQuestions, etc... Many times I have not found a single actual guide on getting jobs for early new grad and students. Its also very trigger me to see post shaming company falsely, with other redditor support. Understand that it stems from lack of confident and frustration, hence the guide.

**Background (my story):**

**Currently, I am working in my second job at FAANG with 2.5 YOE. This is my journey**

I am an **international student**. **English is not my mother tounge.** Coming to US in 2017 for college, I study at a **top 100 Liberal Art College.** Initially, I was majoring in Biology, which only when I reach last year of my Sophomore did I change my major to Computer Science. I did not know the concept of internship until December of my Junior year and how it would affect job after major**.** I graduated at 2021 and my internship was rescind by COVID. **So no name college, late starter, no prior background of CS and no internship.**

**Prep: I took unpaid internship for 9 months, begging professor for an unpaid research position in summer.** I work in cafeteria and using research position to ask for a grant to survive ( I was required by my parents to have scholarship to cover partially US university fees ). In Senior year, with some experience in research and unpaid intern, **I managed to land a job with ICC, CCC and WITCH ( which might involve shady practice )**. I then leverage the experience after few months and land a interview/job with multiple FAANG, Big bank company and tech company. Currently, Im leveraging FAANG salary in options market for an even bigger goal.

**THE GUIDE:** 

this guide is built from ground up, which mean as long as you put in the work, you can make it. It is formulated for all of my friends and some of my junior in college. it would require at least 2 years to prepare. 

Freshman: I will update this later

**Sophomore/Junior: Your goal is to find internship. If not, your goal is to turn anything into relevant work experience.**

**New grad ( without internship ): Your goal will be getting your first job, no matter salary, this will transition to high paying job**

**New grad ( with internship ):  Your goal will be getting interview with high paying company. As you often will secure a return offer.**

&#x200B;

**THE PREP ( the hard working way )**

**Getting a job posting/ interview:** 

1. **Networking/socialize:** 

* If you are living in big cities, go to places where TECH people is gathering, it might depend on where you live, such as badminton, board game, discord, reddit, etc... TONS OF PEOPLE RELOCATE TO NEW JOB AND LOOKING FOR FRIENDS
* If you are living in small cities, talk to alumni, take a bus to big cities once a month (or bi-weekly) and do the above. 
* Approach them like how you would make friends in college, we don't bite. 

1. **Job posting site: Here is some query for you guys**

* WITCH, ICC, CCC, Unpaid intern to extend VISA stay

**Preparing for interview:**

**Behavioral, YOU HAVE 20 MINUTES FOR THIS SECTION:** 

*  **ALWAYS ANSWER WITH ITS DEPEND:** A trully experienced engineer will never jump into conclusion. For every behavioral question such as: name a time you face difficulty, leadership, communication etc... Come up with atleast 5 different stories, here are a template applies for new grad, internship and etc...: All of these is just a chance for you to show off and will never deviate from each other. ALSO USE STAR Method
   * Level 1: General situation, use on first round interview/ less experience interview. For plot hole, just answer its how our culture work and I was planning to fix it
      * Hook: During my work on \[Intern/class/Personal project \] 
      * **Situation ( THIS IS WHAT IMPORTANT )**:  a bug happens \[Before presentation/ submission/ public PR review\], and I need to push out code without my teammate knowing. I have to decide between customer/teachers and teammate but its was outside work hour/study hour
      * **Action ( THIS IS WHAT IMPORTANT )**: Create a feature flag, documenting change and let teammate know why I did it, if they dont like, by turning off feature flag, it revert to old state
      * Result: Team was happy with my changes and project is positive, teacher is happy, award for thoughtfulness. 
      * Result2: Team was unhappy with my changes but for valid reason, I bring this thought up to my teacher/ manager as suggestion and it includes in my review/grade
   * Level 2: Complex Situation a, use for manager, more experience candidate
      * Hook: During my work on \[Intern/class/Personal project \] 
      * Situation: When working on \[pipeline/database/Legacy code/ML Algo/Security hole/AWS KBS/ Azure CRM/ GCP Function etc.... \] - 1 layer deeper of technology. I notice in our code, we have to decide between performance, memory and reliability. If I choose performance or memory, reliability take a hit. **I discuss this with my SENIOR / TEAMMATE/ TEACHER.**
      * Action: **in the end, performance in the SHORT-TERM** then move on to fix **RELIABILITY. The point is to priotize customer/teacher/result FIRST AND FOREMOST. You also show case your DEEPER KNOWLEDGE AND CALMLY ANALYZE THE Situation**
   * **Prepare atleast 5 level 2 story, add these element to some: deadline, collaboration, unexpected situation, GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND WITH DOCUMENTATION DOCUMENTATION ( ESPECIALLY DOCUMENTATION )**
   * THROW ALOT OF JARGON ( OUTLINE IN TECHNOLOGY SECTION BELOW )
   * Level 3: you dont need level 3 :)

**Leetcode:** 2 leetcode a day, in 1 years, thats 700 questions, and 3 years that 2100 questions. Dont skip or slack this. Your goal is to solve medium in 20 minutes, brute force in 5 minutes. need no more than 2 times to run the code ( AS IN PRODUCTION, YOU HAVE PIPELINE AND YOU CAN ONLY TEST IN LOCAL )

Interview Mock: DO IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. [Interviewing.IO](https://Interviewing.IO), Leetcode, PRAMP ( if you like someone, add friend online AND PRACTICE  )

**LEETCODE TEMPLATE: PRACTICE SPEAKING SLOWLY, IN THESE ORDER, YOU HAVE 25 - 30 MINUTES FOR THIS SECTION, MINUTE - BY - MINUTE Instruction ( THIS WOULD MAKE SENSE IF YOU DO 2 LEETCODE A DAY, ALL THE NEW GRAD/INTERNSHIP LEETCODE IS EASY/MEDIUM ) - theres only so many questions they can ask:** 

**- \[ 0 - 2 \]: READ MUMBLING ENOUGH FOR INTERVIEWER TO HEAR, ALSO GIVE YOU TIME TO THINK**

\- \[ 2 -  5 \]: ""ok so I get the gist of the problem, can I assume overflow/negative number/special character/ etc.... "" . Only PROCESS IF INTERVIEWER GIVE SIGNAL ( NODDING, response, etc.... ). "" Thanks for suggestion, I will go ahead under assumption that etc... "" You should got answer from practicing already

\- \[ 5 - 9 minutes \]: **Explain your brute force**, if interview ask to code, CODE. "" What do you think ? "" THEY WILL ASK ABOUT MEMORY/EFFICIENT O(n), then pop out and said I think its run in (On\^2). But it can be improved to O(1). 

\[ 9 - 15 minutes\] : DO NOT CODE YET. **Write PSEUDO CODE, AFTER INTERVIEWER CONFIRM CORRECT, YOU START CODING, FOLLOW THIS STRUCTURE: \[Init\_methodname\],\[execute\_methodname\],\[test\_methodname\]. REFACTOR THE CODE LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPEND ON IT. REMEMBER TO WRITE TEST ALSO. THIS SHOULD BE SYNTAX FREE AND CLEAR IT FAST.**

\[15 - 30 minutes\]: **INTERVIEW WILL BE IMPRESSED BECAUSE YOU WRITE TEST AND REFACTOR. ALSO THE TIME FOR 2nd question, just repeat what you just did above, IF THERE IS A REALLY HARD QUESTION, YOU DONT NEED TO CODE, JUST PSEUDO CODE IS ENOUGH FOR STRONG HIRE**

This with Behavioral should be 45 minutes, 5 minutes to ask questions. ASK THEM STORY LIKE WHAT AN INTERESTING THING YOU WORK ON/DIFFICULT THINGS - use this answer to IMPROVE YOUR BEHAVIORAL STORY

REPEAT THIS INTERVIEW 4 times for big TECH and 2 times for BIG BANK

&#x200B;

**SYSTEM DESIGN TEMPLATE:** VERY RARE, incase of bank company asking their new grad

\- GROKKING THE SYSTEM DESIGN INTERVIEW ( thats all you need, basically this roadmap )

requirement -> API/method design -> Database choice NOSQL/ SQL -> Reliablity/SMSQueue/Hosting server/DATABASE SHARDING ( or equivalent, cant remember the right term )/ HASHING/DOCUMENTATION/LANGUAGE CHOICE -> Everything else is almost auxilliary for new grad

**DATABASE, SQL INTERVIEW:** IN VERY RARE CASE ( LIKE YOU VMWARE ), they gonna ask about SQL QUERY, i do not have experience in this, so you should pray

&#x200B;

**Technological expectation:**

Internship: Know how to do leetcode, team work, project collaboration, BE CONFIDENT

New grad: Know a bit system design ( just concept like database, caching, security, cloud depend on your field of interest - **YES, IF YOU JOIN ICC, CCC THEN YOU WILL LEARN ALL OF THESE** ), devops, frontend, backend, has team work story, BE EXTRA CONFIDENT

  
**TECHNOLOGY STACK** to impress in behavioral:

Internship: 

**LANGUAGE OF CHOICE, BASIC CLOUD QUESTION** ( AWS, AZURE - literally anything you can look in 5 minutes - advanced version is CODE TO INFRA, which JUST TO LET YOU GUYS NOT COMPLAIN ITS TOO HARD TO LEARN ), **WEB FRAMEWORK** ( pick 1 ): .NET, Spring, Express, etc... **TEST FRAMEWORK: JUNIT, DOCKER ( ADVANCE VERSION IS KUBERNETE, FIREWALL, IP, ORCHESTRATION ), TRELLO**

New grad:

Same as internship + CICD PIPELINE ( JENKINS ), POSTMAN, JIRA, COMPARISON BETWEEN 2 DIFFERENCE LANGUAGE ( Easiest is Python vs Java, I hate Python )

&#x200B;

**If you feel like you have tried everything and it still didnt work, please post these, I will take argument without 3 out of 4 of these claim as troll post:**

\- Anonymous resume

\- Leetcode stat

\- Social Network attempt ( why ? Because your resume doesnt match where you are living, thus you might be trolling )

\- Unpaid Internship/Research/Independent project/ Github link

\- Company applies to ( screenshot please ) (if I see you only apply to CA, Seattle, CO, NYC, or big companies, thats your problem when you are new to the career )

&#x200B;

Feedback are welcome, if something is unclear, please understand english is not my first language. Also don't assume my internet persona is the same as my IRL persona

Also im a bit high when writing this, so sorry

ALSO SORRY IF I ACCIDENTALLY POST THIS WITHOUT CHATGPT FORMAT

I'm exploring the concept of a tool that automatically generates project-based homework assignments within various topics to save teachers time and enhance student engagement. Also, projects are much more difficult to solve using somewhat like Chatgpt.

16m1w87,1,2023-09-18,Fastest way to build a CV for internships?,u/Dostumani,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/16m1w87/fastest_way_to_build_a_cv_for_internships/,"I am soon to be a 2nd year computer science student in the UK. I will do a placement year doing compsci related work on my 3rd year. The problem is, my CV is quite empty right now (have no previous work experience) and companies will be receiving applications throghout October. I have some experience in most things (web design, game dev, ML, data science etc.) but don't have any finished projects that I can present. Some personal projects I have worked on are a chess engine, a 2d godot game, and a lot of small AI stuff with LLMs and NeRFs. I am a very very quick learner and worker and I believe I can use google and chatgpt quite well to get up to speed on any topic. I am planning to make a bunch of small projects in the following month. I need some personal project suggestions that look cool and show skills but not too time exhausting to actually implement. Also any suggestions on how to fill up my CV in a limited amount of time are also welcome. You can be a bit optimistic about how fast I will manage to learn things from ground up and implement them and assume I will spend most of my time on this for the following month since there isn't much time left. Thanks in advance!"

We live in an era where AI advancements continue to reshape our world, and one technology that has been generating significant buzz is OpenAI's ChatGPT. As we explore the potential applications of this language model, it's fascinating to consider the wide range of use cases it offers. Let's delve into some thought-provoking scenarios and reflect on how ChatGPT can be leveraged across different industries and sectors.

1️⃣ Customer Support: Imagine a world where we no longer have to wait in long queues or deal with frustrating automated responses. ChatGPT can revolutionize customer support by offering personalized, real-time assistance. With its ability to understand natural language and provide accurate responses, it could become a game-changer in improving customer satisfaction.

2️⃣ Content Creation: Content creators often face creative blocks and challenges when crafting engaging material. ChatGPT can act as an AI co-writer, effortlessly brainstorming ideas and providing suggestions for articles, blog posts, or even social media content. Unlocking the power of collaboration between humans and AI could lead to more innovative and engaging content.

3️⃣ Education and Training: In the ever-evolving world of education, ChatGPT can serve as an on-demand tutor. Students could ask questions and receive detailed explanations, helping to facilitate personalized learning experiences. Additionally, ChatGPT can provide simulations, interactive exercises, and virtual lab environments, enhancing the overall educational process.

4️⃣ Personal AI Assistant: Just like our favorite movie characters with a trusty sidekick, ChatGPT has the potential to become our personal AI assistant. From managing appointments and tasks to offering recommendations based on personal preferences, it can handle an array of day-to-day activities, freeing us to focus on important tasks and experiences.

5️⃣ Research and Development: ChatGPT's vast knowledge base allows it to keep pace with the latest advancements across various industries. Researchers and developers can leverage this as a tool to discover new insights, conduct experiments, and explore ideas before committing extensive resources. The speed and efficiency it offers could accelerate breakthroughs in multiple fields.

These are just a few glimpses into the potential of ChatGPT. It's essential to approach AI applications with both excitement and caution. Ethical considerations, including bias and privacy concerns, must be addressed as we navigate this new frontier. But, by embracing AI as a partner rather than a competitor, we can unlock incredible possibilities for productivity, learning, and personal growth.

Let's foster meaningful dialogues and collaborate to ensure a responsible and inclusive implementation of AI technologies in our professional endeavors. Together, we can shape a future where the capabilities of ChatGPT truly augment our human potential. 🚀

16m47f3,1,2023-09-18,"E-commerce Industry News Recap - Week of September 18th, 2023",u/adventurepaul,ecommerce,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/16m47f3/ecommerce_industry_news_recap_week_of_september/,"Hi r/ecommerce \- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry pretty closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Each week I post a summary recap of this week's top stories, which I cover in depth in the newsletter.

1. STAT OF THE WEEK: The Twitter alternative, Bluesky, hit one million users. Although Bluesky surpassed 1 million installs in July, it hadn't actually hit the 1 million users mark until now because more people had downloaded the app than actually had invite codes to sign up at the time. — According to TechCrunch  
.
2. **Amazon** debuted new features for its Buy with Prime service at its annual seller conference last week including: (1) Buy with Prime Cart, which lets customers (finally) buy multiple items at once, (2) Buy with Prime Assist, which is live chat Amazon customer support for questions about shipping, current orders, and returns, and (3) Reviews from Amazon, which displays a product's Amazon reviews on the product page of a merchant's e-commerce website.  
.
3. **Amazon** also unveiled:  
(1) **Visual Search w/ Text** \- customers can add text inputs to their image searches  
(2) **View In Your Room** \- AR feature for seeing how furniture, home decor, and now small appliances look in your home  
(3) **Sales Trend Data** \- showing info like ""10k+ bought in the past month"" within search results and on product detail pages  
(4) **Find-on-Amazon** \- users can tap the share button on photos from social media and the web to find similar products on Amazon  
(5) **Easier Reorders** \- previously ordered items are now presented at the top of search results with the date of last purchase  
(6) **AI Written Product Descriptions** \- can write titles, bullet points, descriptions, and photo captions  
(7) **Supply Chain by Amazon** \- to expand its fulfillment and logistics operations for sales outside of its marketplaces  
.
4. Last Tuesday, **TikTok** officially debuted its long-awaited TikTok Shop in the US. Now with TikTok Shop, users can discover, learn about, and purchase products directly on TikTok without ever leaving the app. Whereas before, they could only discover products and were sent to the merchant's website to actually make the purchase. TikTok Shop offers In-Feed Video & Live Shopping, a Product Showcase, a Shop Tab, an Affiliate Program, Shop Ads, Fulfilled by TikTok (logistics), and Secure Checkout with a third party payments platform.   
.
5. **Flexport**, the company whose name you might recognize as having acquired Deliverr from Shopify earlier this year, launched a new end-to-end supply chain tool called Flexport Revolution and a membership program called Flexport+. Revolution offers small and mid-sized businesses access to freight, fulfillment, replenishment, and financing services, as well as direct replenishment into FBA, Walmart, and more than 15 wholesale distribution channels including Target, Costco and Nordstrom. Flexport+ is a new $149 membership program that offers merchants exclusive access to supply chain financing and priority shipping services.  
.
6. **Affirm's** senior VP of finance, Rob O'Hare, said at a conference hosted by Barclays on Tuesday its funding cost will rise. O'Hare said, “We have been using warehouse facilities. That will drive up funding costs.” He later added that funding costs will “be a drag” on margins, “but we think we're doing a good job.”  
.
7. **Albertsons** launched a new e-commerce offering called Flash, which allows customers to place orders available for pick-up in 30 minutes or less. Through the Flash service: (1) Customers can choose up to 35 items for pickup or delivery. (2) Delivery orders have an $11.95 service fee and will be delivered within a 30-to-50-minute window. (3) Pickup orders have a $3.95 fee and will be ready in 30 minutes or less.  
.
8. Bloomberg reports that despite onboarding **Linda Yaccarino** as CEO of X with the hopes that the former NBCUniversal exec would bring back advertisers who had stopped spending on the site, she might be running out of time to make that happen for this holiday season. Marketers typically finalize their holiday budgets by August, leaving limited room for last-minute adjustments, and others are hesitant to jump back on the X bandwagon due to the platforms reputation for leniency for hate speech since Musk's takeover.   
.
9. **Meta**, on the other hand, is ready for what will probably be its highest revenue holiday season in history. Meta recently added new ad optimization tools in preparation for the holiday push including: (1) Budget sheduling for ads campaigns to avoid having to manually adjust budget, (2) Promotional ads for applying promo codes, (3) Reminder Ads to help build awareness and anticipation of brand events, and (4) Shop ads to allow a user to purchase directly from FB or IG within the app.   
.
10. **Indonesia** is planning to ban e-commerce on social media under new trade regulations designed to avoid predatory pricing on social media platforms, which the government feels was threatening offline markets in the country. Current trade regulations do not specifically cover direct transactions on social media. Jerry Sambuaga, deputy minister of trade, told the parliament that, “Social media and social commerce cannot be combined,” and that it was time for revisions to the country's trade regulations.  
.
11. **Amazon** is increasing pay rates for contracted delivery drivers in the US, investing $440M over the next year to make it happen. The exact bump in pay remains undisclosed, but Amazon expects drivers to earn an average of $20.50 per hour.  
.
12. **Salesforce** is planning to recruit 3,300 new employees, less than a year after letting go 10% of its workforce. A third of the new hires will join the company's sales group, a third will be engineers, and the remainder will work on Salesforce's Data Cloud product.  
.
13. Meanwhile in the world of cryptocurrency, Brian Shroder, the **CEO of Binance-us** who's served in the position since 2021, resigned, and will be replaced by Norman Reed, the chief legal officer of the firm. The company is also reportedly laying off more than 100 workers, or roughly a third of its staff.  
.
14. **Starboard Value**, an activist investor and third largest shareholder of **GoDaddy**, urged the company in a public letter to either improve its stock performance, or sell itself. The investor said that GoDaddy needs to cut more jobs, reduce the tech budget, and address why it is falling short of its financial targets, while committing to delivering a growth and profitability metric of at least 40% by the end of 2024.  
.
15. **Amazon Japan** opened its first sortation center in the country to streamline its domestic distribution process. The sortation center is located in Tokyo and is capable of processing up to 750k parcels daily with the help of automated machinery.  
.
16. The **same writers** **that are suing OpenAI** are now suing Meta over content theft in a similar class action lawsuit that accuses the company of improper utilization of their literary works to train its Llama AI software. The lawsuit alleges that Meta employed their copyrighted writings, including pirated versions, to instruct its language model in generating high-quality, long-form responses.   
.
17. **Meta's next generation of smart glasses** made in partnership with Ray-Ban are rumored to be released sometime soon. Even though the first generation wasn't a hit, with the WSJ estimating that less than 10% of owners use the glasses on a monthly basis, Meta is moving forward with its next generation, which will let you live stream video to FB and IG and even hear comments from people watching your stream. I own a pair of the first generation and wear them daily! Although I haven't charged them in over a year. LOL.   
.
18.  In other **Meta headgear news**, the company gave away free Meta Quest Pro headsets, valued at $1500/each, to attendees at the Roblox conference, indicating that the devices aren't flying off the shelves with consumers. Meta also told suppliers earlier this year that it wouldn't order new components for the device, indicating that production was to end when the company ran out of parts. However although the headsets aren't hitting sales expectations, their use-cases are slowly growing. Dozens of hospitals are using the Meta Quest 2 headset to train clinicians on complex procedures, and Meta launched a new teaching program in the US to inspire students to explore the opportunities of the metaverse.  
.
19. Amazon announced that its **second Prime Day shopping event** will take place on Oct 10th and 11th this year, with sales kicking off at 3am on the 10th. To generate early interest, Amazon is already offering incentives like $15 credits for downloading the Amazon Photos app, a free four-month trial to Amazon Music, and 10% back on select Amazon devices.  
.
20. With more than 17.7M people having submitted claims in the **$725M Facebook data privacy settlement**, plaintiff lawyers estimated that each claimant can expect to receive around $30. US District Judge Chhabria noted that the amount is lower than expected due to the unprecedented number of claims filed in the case. Reopen the case then!  
.
21. Speaking of Meta payouts, **Norway** is fining the company $98,500 per day for alleged data privacy breaches and the potential impact it may have had on Norway residents. The country also banned FB and IG from carrying out any behavioral advertising activities until October.   
.
22. **Splitit**, a NY-based BNPL firm that offers embeddable installment payment options for merchants, is expanding its “pay after delivery” service with **AliExpress** to the US. The service, which allows shoppers to start paying for their products after delivery is complete, first launched in Germany, Spain, and France earlier this year.   
.
23. **X** agreed to try to settle claims by thousands of former Twitter employees who say they were cheated out of severance pay after Elon Musk laid off thousands of employees. The former employees have been waiting for their promised severance ever since and hopes to reach a settlement.  
.
24. **Disputes on Visa's network** rose to more than 90M in 2022, rising past their pandemic boom. Around 70M disputes were filed in 2019, which rose 24% in 2020 during the pandemic, and has since risen 2% a year in 2021 and 2022.  
.
25. **Companies that use AI to help students cheat** at school are thriving on TikTok and Meta, even though the practice and the ads are illegal in many countries. The tools include services like making texts feel more academic, writing entire essays, citing works, and checking for plagiarism using AI.   
.
26. **Hallmark** is attempting to attract Gen Z shoppers by tapping into digital payment channels and mobile apps. The company teamed up with Venmo to offer co-branded physical greeting cards that include a unique QR code that redirects to Venmo to receive a money gift.   
.
27. **HeyDude**, a comfort shoe maker, reached a $1.95M settlement with the FTC on charges that it misled consumers by keeping negative reviews off its website and gave customers gift cards instead of cash refunds. The FTC complaint also says that the company failed to issue shipping-delay notices when it couldn't fill orders on time and failed to cancel customers' orders and issue prompt refunds when it couldn't send customers their shoes.   
.
28. **Wix** is now offering tap-to-pay on Android phones for merchants who accept in-person payments, after having launched the service for iPhones in March earlier this year. Payments are handled through Stripe, and the service is currently limited to the US.  
.
29. **Shopify** launched its POS Go hand-held device in the UK and Ireland. The device, which comes with a built-in scanner and allows retailers to initiate checkouts anywhere in the store, was first introduced in 2022 to retailers in the US and brought to Canada in May this year.   
.
30. **Family Dollar** revealed that its upcoming mobile app will allow users to manage coupons and more easily locate products with improved search functionality. The company also promised enhancements that will include in-app e-commerce, personalization capabilities, and an “evolved” rewards experience for its sister company Dollar Tree.  
.
31. **Google Domains** stopped selling domains to new and existing customers last week and is now directing users to purchase domains through Squarespace instead, who bought its domain portfolio for $180M. The acquisition was completed on September 7th.  
.
32. A new study shows that the **number of e-commerce sites globally** surpassed 26.5M in 2023, ballooning from 9.2M in 2019. The US hosts nearly 14M of these sites, a figure that substantially overshadows other nations.  
.
33. Plus 9 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interesting including Birkenstock filing for IPO on the NYSE under the ticket BIRK. Bloomberg estimated in July that Birkenstock is worth around $8B.

BIBLE READING: Luke 4:1-13  
POWERPOINT: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12obvI8p9sQpsjuemW6fOtsbpEAbcnYcV2pRkK-IDnoE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12obvI8p9sQpsjuemW6fOtsbpEAbcnYcV2pRkK-IDnoE/edit?usp=sharing)

**\[SLIDE\]**

**Intro discussion Q (MC to ask):** What is something that you just can’t resist? What makes it so tempting for you?

**\[blank SLIDE\]**

Last week Nick started us off our new Bible Talk series, where he took us through the first step on our journey with Jesus where we looked at His miraculous birth, the real and historical birth of a king.

Today we’re going to fast forward just a little bit, well, if you can call a few decades ‘just a little bit’- but today we’re looking at Luke chapter 4, and if you have a Bible with you it would be good to keep it open there, it will be helpful for you to look at as we go through it. But here we are just before Jesus begins his ministry journey- before he gathers His disciples, before he starts traveling around Israel preaching and healing and performing other miracles.

But where Jesus goes to prepare for this might be a little surprising to you. **\[SLIDE\]** In preparation for the launch of His ministry journey, of course the natural thing for Him to do would be… to… travel into the desert for a 40 day private meeting with the devil?

It sounds totally crazy, right? Why would He do this? Is He *trying* to fail his mission before he even gets started? He’s going into the wilderness, on His own, without backup, to face the devil’s temptation.

Well, actually, this meeting with the enemy is an incredibly important one, and if you think about it, before he starts his ministry journey is the perfect time to have it. It’s kind of like Jesus’ version of a uni student’s final exams. **\[SLIDE\]** He’s spent his life studying and training, and now he’s reached the end of His course- but to get the qualification that he needs, he has to pass one final test to prove that he’s a worthy candidate- that he can be the Messiah.

But it is an incredibly hard test that He has to pass- it’s a test that the entire nation of Israel has been taking and failing for thousands of years, and it’s a test that we still today have to face, and we, too, have failed. We have all given in to sinful temptations- but! Jesus didn’t, and this walk through the wilderness is proof of that- that Jesus *is* the perfect man– who never sinned and is perfectly faithful to God. I’m certain that Jesus faced other temptations in His life, but here we see a clear example of Jesus facing and overcoming sin, so that we can know who He is. **\[blank SLIDE\]**

But more than just that, for Christians, it’s also Jesus showing us an example that we should be looking to follow. As we see Jesus overcoming temptations, we are able to see how and why He is able to overcome them, and that it is important to overcome temptation. So let’s start looking through the passage in a bit more detail now, and as we go we’ll be thinking about Jesus’ incredible faithfulness in overcoming these tests, and how we can be following His example in the face of temptation today.

Well, in verses 2 to 4 we see the first temptation of the three we read about here- and I honestly think it just might be the cruelest. Jesus, after fasting for 40 days, having eaten nothing that whole time, is presented with FREE FOOD. Now as uni students I’m sure you’re all already feeling just how tempting this offer is, right? **\[SLIDE\]** What could possibly be more tempting than free food?

I’m sure we’ve all had the experience where- and I know that I have this happen to me all the time- where you’re watching either TV or YouTube, **\[SLIDE\]** and an ad for Maccas or Hungry Jack’s or KFC comes on. And they’ve got these incredible looking slow motion pictures of perfect and delicious looking burgers. And then for the next 10 minutes or longer, all you can think about is food. And it doesn’t matter if you were hungry or not before the ad came on, well, you definitely are now. Maybe some of you have started getting some cravings now just looking at these pictures. **\[blank SLIDE\]**

So now imagine how much worse that feeling would be if you hadn’t eaten anything for 40 days! That’s basically what’s happening here with Jesus. 

It shouldn’t be too difficult to sympathize with Jesus here- this would no doubt be an incredibly strong temptation for him: just turn the rock into bread. **\[SLIDE\]** And there’s no doubt that he could have done it, let me be clear about that. If you were here for the Why Jesus? Bible Talk Series, you’ll have seen that Jesus performs countless miracles later in his life, many of them far more impressive than just turning a stone into food. So when Satan asks Jesus, “If you are the Son of God, why don’t you just tell this stone to become bread?” it’s not because he doesn’t believe he can do it- he’s saying, *since* you have the power of God, why don’t you just make some food appear? All whilst fully knowing that He would be able to if he wanted to.

So, why *doesn’t* Jesus just do exactly that? What’s the big deal? He’s hungry, what would be the problem of getting a little bit of food? I’m sure no one would miss this random rock in the wilderness. What harm would it do? It’s not like he’s hurting anyone. **\[blank SLIDE\]**

And that’s exactly the devil’s trick. That’s precisely how temptation often works, it makes us see sin as something reasonable, or at least as something that we can justify. And we’ll see this being applied to each of the three temptations we read about here in Luke, but in this particular instance it’s especially clear.

So what actually is it about this case that’s the problem, what’s wrong with making some bread?

Well let’s see how Jesus responds, and that will help us to answer that question:

“Jesus answered: “It is written, ‘man shall not live by bread alone’”

Jesus is quoting the Old Testament here, specifically Deuteronomy 8 verse 3 **\[SLIDE\]**:

**3** He humbled you, causing you to hunger and then feeding you with manna, which neither you nor your ancestors had known, to teach you that man does not live on bread alone *but* on every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord.

And what this verse is talking about here is thousands of years before Jesus, just after the nation of Israel escaped slavery in Egypt, and they were wandering as a nation through the wilderness, not unlike how Jesus was wandering the wilderness here in Luke. And again, like Jesus, Israel eventually got hungry, but God provided for them by miraculously giving them this bread-like type of food called manna.

And what was supposed to happen as God provided food for Israel, is what this verse in Deuteronomy is saying: they were supposed to be humble and grow in faith for the Lord, because they saw first hand how God was able to provide for them no matter their circumstance, even in the middle of the desert! What should have happened is that Israel would be able to see that trusting God should be the number one priority in their life, even more important than food. Or in other words, that man does not live on bread alone, *but* on every word that comes from the Lord.

However- that’s *not* what Israel did. **\[blank SLIDE\]** For them, it didn’t take very long at all and they started complaining again. The miraculous manna that God provided wasn’t good enough for them and they complained about wanting fish and meat and other kinds of foods- they weren’t at all satisfied with God’s provision. They did not respond in humility, but instead they responded even more selfishly than before. They even threatened to abandon God, and go back to being slaves in Egypt so they could get some supposedly ‘better’ food- they didn’t view themselves in humility before God, instead they preferred to take matters into their own hands and in-so-doing abandon Him.

It was a test for Israel, and it’s one that they failed. But like we said at the beginning of the talk, Jesus is taking that same test, and he was able to succeed where they fell far short.

Now, this is not to say that God wants us all to starve ourselves, ok. But Jesus in this case has embarked on this journey into the wilderness specifically to endure this kind of test of faithfulness. And so the appropriate response to this challenge is for Him to trust God to provide for Him, and to not take matters into His own hands, nor put his own power and needs above God’s. 

And so *that’s* what Satan is challenging Jesus to do here, and it’s the lie that he tries to tell us as well- to try and convince us that something else in our life is more important than trusting in God, even if he can get us to go astray even for one moment. For Jesus, the devil is trying to tell him that his physical desire to eat is more important than his obedience to God. But in our lives it might look a little bit different. Maybe it’s watching pornography. Maybe it’s telling a white lie or two. Or maybe it actually is food- maybe you think your housemate wouldn’t mind or notice if you borrow a little bit of food from their half of the fridge from time to time without their permission. In all of these cases we might think things to ourselves like, oh it’s just a natural desire, it’s just a part of living in this society, or doing this thing doesn’t hurt anybody, so what’s the problem? Well, when we are facing this kind of temptation, we all need to stop and think: am I being humble before God, and putting His needs above my own perceived needs and wants? I think this verse, a quote of Jesus later on in Luke in chapter 12 verse 22 to 24, sums it up pretty perfectly **\[SLIDE\]**:

22 Then Jesus said to his disciples: “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear. 23 For life is more than food, and the body more than clothes. **24** Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn; yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than birds! 

And that’s the attitude that we should have in our lives, trust in God first above all else, and if we do that, we’ll be able to resist the temptation to worry about worldly things. Man shall not live by bread alone.

**\[blank SLIDE\]** Let’s have a look now at verses 5 to 8 where we see Jesus’ second temptation. It’s hard to imagine how Satan might be able to top the temptation of free food, but he certainly gives it his best shot here.

Having failed on his first attempt, we now read about how the devil leads Jesus to a high place, **\[SLIDE\]** a mountain or something like that,possibly like this scene in the Lion King, and we read that he ‘showed Him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world’- Now I don’t know whether that’s talking about some kind of supernatural vision he was able to show Jesus, or if it’s just Google earth on an iPhone or something **\[SLIDE\]**\- but regardless, it would definitely have been quite an incredible thing to witness. **\[blank SLIDE\]** So Satan shows off this power that he has, to show him all the kingdoms of the earth, and then he gives the sales pitch: Jesus, all this could be yours, and all you have to do is worship me.

While what we see here is a very grand offer, somehow maybe possibly even better than free food- it seems a lot more obvious that giving in to this temptation would be a bad idea, right? It might be hard to understand at first why turning some rock into bread would be sinful, but it doesn’t exactly take a rocket scientist to work out that bowing down to the literal devil would be a bad idea. If there was ever an offer that seemed, ‘too good to be true,’ this is it. So how could this ever really be considered a temptation? Any sensible person would surely know to turn tail and run away here. *Especially* when Jesus, as the Son of God, is *already* set to inherit the earth and everything in it as the Messiah King himself.

But it’s not quite that simple. Because Jesus knows what He has to go through to earn His authority while being faithful to God. **\[SLIDE\]** He knows what the road ahead of Him leads to: persecution; pain; rejection; and, ultimately, intense suffering in death, as he bears the weight of the sins of the world on His shoulders on the cross. And so Satan’s offer is a tantalising *shortcut*: why go through all that pain and suffering and hard work- just bow down to me, and I’ll just give it to you, free of charge.

And suddenly, when we see that the potential reward is this good, even though it's an otherwise obvious trap, the offer becomes *much* more *tempting*, doesn’t it?

On a slightly smaller, but maybe more relevant scale that should help us understand the situation, you as uni students should all know that asking ChatGPT **\[SLIDE\]** to write your 3000 word major essay for you is the wrong thing to do, right? 

*Worrying silence? You do, right?*

And (hopefully) you would never even think about doing it under normal circumstances. But… What if: the essay is due at midnight tonight, and you haven’t even started it yet? AND- it’s worth 50% of your overall grade. AND- you read in the news in a definitely not biassed article that ChatGPT is guaranteed to get at least distinction level average grade. And you would probably only have to change just a few words and the plagiarism detector would never pick it up, right?

Now, under *those* circumstances, ChatGPT suddenly doesn’t sound like such a crazy idea. In fact, I have to confess- even as I was writing this talk, literally while writing this exact section about how bad of an idea it would be, the thought did occur to me once or twice: “maybe I could get away with just getting ChatGPT to write this for me.” **\[blank SLIDE\]**

Short cuts will always be tempting. But rather than earn you a quick reward, instead, what will happen more often than not is you’ll receive no reward at all, or at least a much worse and less worthy reward. Of course, if your ChatGPT generated essay gets caught for plagiarism, the consequences from that are obvious. But even if you get away with it, a university degree that you didn’t earn can lead you into a career that you don’t actually have the skills or qualifications to function properly in- even if you have a piece of paper that says you do. The reward that ChatGPT offers might be appealing, and it would be easy to get- but it can’t actually grant you the result that you expect or want.

And that’s the same here in Luke chapter 4. No doubt this short cut would have had an appeal for Jesus. But he knew that for the path he’s on- there are no *real* short cuts. And so he says in verse 8, “it is written: Worship the Lord your God and serve Him only.” He knows the truth, and He is able to rely on God to help him along even the most difficult paths. And once again we see Jesus succeeding where God’s people in the past had failed countless times.

Even if we go all the way back to Genesis, in the garden of Eden, the original sin came about because of a temptation- a temptation really quite similar to this one in Luke 4. **\[SLIDE\]** In Genesis chapter three, we see this: the serpent says, “Did God *really* say you must not eat from any tree in the garden”? And then he says, “You will not certainly die” and then he even goes on to say that not only won’t you die, not only would you be able to *get away with it* doing this wrong thing, but even if you don’t, it’ll be fine! Because when you eat this fruit, you will have already become just like God. So the serpent convinces Eve and then she convinces Adam that the risk is worth it. They forget about God in the moment, when normally they would know very obviously that eating this fruit was wrong. They were blinded by the reward that Satan offered them, and they were convinced that they would be able to get away with it, without the consequences. **\[blank SLIDE\]**

But of course, as it turned out, the serpent was a liar, and they did in the end have to face the consequences for their failure to resist the temptation. Bowing down to sin and the devil, despite his grand claim, DOES NOT grant us power. In fact, it takes it away- it makes us vulnerable and it brings suffering. And the consequences of this sin could only be dealt with by someone who would be able to resist all of these kinds of temptations that we cannot- and that someone is Jesus.

So again, Jesus is the person who succeeds where we fail. And he is the example for us to follow. He knows the *truth*. He knows who God is, and He trusts that He is really the one who is in control, not the devil. Jesus doesn’t shy away from taking the hard path, and he does so for our sakes. He succeeds to make up for our failures, and also: to show us to stay firm in our faith and convictions. And so we see that His response to this temptation is another quote from Scriptures: Worship the Lord your God and serve Him only- *that* is the true path to victory. We mustn’t worship power, convenience, pride, money, or anything else. In the end, all those things will fade away and their power is limited. False shortcuts. But God offers us something more, and that is why we worship Him and Him alone. There might not be any shortcuts, but God DOES *freely* offer a relationship with Him, and all the benefits that come with being a part of His kingdom, to *anyone* and everyone who comes before Him in worship. Which is far more than what the world and the devil has to offer us.

Jesus’ third and final temptation that we read about in this chapter is probably the least relatable of the three. Free food? Sounds good! Rule the world with no catch? Sounds suspicious, but we’d like to hear more! And now here we get: Jump off a building…? **\[SLIDE\]**

Maybe there are some thrillseekers here who see the appeal here, like base jumping or something, but I imagine for most of us, we’re not feeling all *too* tempted just yet. So what is the appeal that the devil is making to Jesus here?

Well, he’s basically asking Jesus to prove that He is in fact the Son of God. Kind of like saying to Him, “if you really are the chosen one of God, then He would protect you no matter what. If you jumped off the temple here, here in the middle of the big city of Jerusalem, then God would protect you with His angels, and then everyone would be able to see that you are who you say you are.” It’s kind of like another shortcut to glory that the devil is offering to Jesus. **\[SLIDE\]**

Now, another interesting detail about this particular temptation, I’m not sure if you noticed but the devil actually takes a page out of Jesus’ playbook here. So far, Jesus has been quoting the Old Testament as His way to get out of giving in to temptations. But here we see that now Satan is *also* quoting scripture in His offer to Jesus. He hits him with a ‘for it is written’- Specifically, he’s referencing Psalm 91, which is a psalm about God’s protection to those who are faithful to His word. So, now, the natural thing to wonder is, well, if the Bible says it’s okay, then why wouldn’t Jesus just do it?

And actually I’m going to get you to discuss this question at your tables: **\[SLIDE\]** What’s wrong with the devil’s logic in verses 9-11? Why might this quote be wrong to apply in this situation?

I’ve got Psalm 91 on the screen for you to reference, which may or may not be helpful, but feel free to just discuss the question. Just have a think about it: What might be wrong with applying that quote here with Jesus?

Ok let’s come back together now… **\[blank SLIDE\]**

The answer to this question is, once again, what Jesus’ reply tells us here. He replies to the devil’s quote with a quote of His own: **\[SLIDE\]**

“Do not put the Lord your God to the test” which is a line again from the book of Deuteronomy, which was spoken to the ancient people of Israel because this was something that they failed to uphold- where once again we see Jesus succeeding.

So, “Don’t put God to the test”- Jesus is directly refuting the devil’s wrongful application of the quote from Psalms. Psalm 91 is about putting your trust in God, but in reality, when we put God to the test like this, it is doing the *exact opposite*. **\[blank SLIDE\]**

Just like how, if you’re familiar with the story of Jesus, the Pharisees later on in Jesus’ life ask him several times to give them a sign to prove that he is the Son of God, or like how we talked about before with Israel being hungry in the desert: they don’t trust God at all, but instead they say things like: “Oh God, if only you would show me some kind of miracle, then I will trust you” but as we saw with Israel and eating the manna, even if God did provide for them, it wasn’t long before they had another test ready for Him. They went from just asking God for food, to threatening God over it. Saying things like “if God *really* loved us, he’d give us fancy steak dinners, not just some weird bread”.

And while it’s easy to point fingers at Israel or the Pharisees, this is something that we, too, can easily be guilty of. Maybe we can think things like, “God, if you just let me get out of this parking ticket, then I’ll be good from now on.” Or “God, if you help me to get a high distinction on this exam, then I’ll go to church on Sunday.” There are all kinds of things that we can think or do that put God to the test. And once again, doing this is selfishness. When we put God to the test, using our own human needs and wants as criteria for him to achieve to earn our belief, then we’re telling God that He has to earn us. That we’ll only follow Him if there’s something in it for us, and we want to be absolutely sure that going to the trouble of being a Christian is going to be worth our while.

But we don’t need a special sign- God had already given Israel countless signs. And now we, too, have the ultimate sign of God’s love and care for us in His Son Jesus and everything that He did for us- including overcoming the temptations of the world, succeeding where we couldn’t.

And so that brings us now to the final verse in our passage today, verse 13:

“When the devil had finished all this tempting, he left Him until an opportune time”

What we see here is that the devil hasn’t given up. Overcoming temptation once or twice, or even thrice, isn’t a final victory. **\[SLIDE\]** It wasn’t for Jesus, and it isn’t for us. And that is why we need to be prepared and ready at all times to overcome temptation. In the good and hard times, there will be moments where we are tempted to walk away from God. **\[blank SLIDE\]**

So how can we be ready? Well, Jesus showed us how in this passage. At every occasion, when the devil confronted Jesus, his reply was to look to the word of God. God has given us the tools to overcome temptation in His words, in the Bible. And if we trust God and seek to follow Him, then the Bible teaches us that we will be able to stay faithful to Him.

In 1 Corinthians chapter 10 verse 13 it says this: **\[SLIDE\]**

**13** No temptation\[[c](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+cor+10&version=NIV#fen-NIV-28581c)\] has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted\[[d](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+cor+10&version=NIV#fen-NIV-28581d)\] beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted,\[[e](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+cor+10&version=NIV#fen-NIV-28581e)\] he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it.

Hopefully, we can all find that verse encouraging. And like we’ve already talked about, God’s word is a way that we can prepare ourselves to be ready to overcome temptations. But as well as this, at the start of the Talk when we talked about *why* Jesus went into the wilderness to be tempted in the first place.

He went to succeed where we couldn’t- not only so that He could *show us* the way to overcome temptation, **but because** **He** ***is*** **the way****, for us, to overcome our temptations today.**

Let’s look at another verse that tells us about this, in the book of Hebrews in chapter 2: **\[SLIDE\]**

**14** …he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might break the power of him who holds the power of death—that is, the devil—

**17** For this reason he had to be made like them,\[[a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=heb+2%3A14-18&version=NIV#fen-NIV-29995a)\] fully human in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people. **18** Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.

Jesus was able to live as a human being, and yet, as we’ve seen, was able to succeed where we have failed in overcoming temptation. But, he experienced it first hand, so He knows what we are going through. And so because of *that*, we can trust that He is able to help us in our time of need.

And even when we do fail to resist the temptations of the world, we can know that Jesus’ victory over the devil didn’t just happen in the wilderness. It also happened on the cross and in His resurrection from the dead. Jesus had victory over temptation and over death. And so when we fail, we can lay those failures at the feet of His cross. And by following Him, we can live our lives trusting in God and the salvation that He offers us.

A final couple of questions are going to come up on the screen now: **\[SLIDE\]**

1. Does Jesus’ temptation change the way that you view Him and what He did on the cross?
2. How might this affect the way you relate with God?

But before before I leave you to discuss it at your tables, I’m going to quickly pray now:

Dear Lord,

Thank you for the example that you have given us in Jesus, and for how He was able to overcome sin and temptation, rescuing us from all the times that we have failed to do the same. I pray that this passage encourages us as we see your victory over the devil and that we might be able to trust that you are with us when we face our temptations today. I ask that you would help us to be ready at all times to live according to your words, and that you would continue to teach us about yourself and your Son Jesus.

Amen."
16mjpg9,1,2023-09-19,I also left Shincheonji,u/Good-Ad9583,Shincheonji,https://www.reddit.com/r/Shincheonji/comments/16mjpg9/i_also_left_shincheonji/,"It has been a bit over 2 weeks since I declared that I will no longer be a part of Shincheonji to my church. I wasn't sure if I wanted to write something here (worries about e.g. taken out of context, not explaining/covering things adequately) but I hope my experience can be of some help.

I entered the church in Feb 2020 and was BJN of the Education Dept until August 2023. I wrote up a letter addressed to my branch church and sent it to a group chat I created adding all the contacts I had on telegram.

**A bit of background**

I was born into a Christian family but I struggled to believe in God. Being a science student, I thought it was impossible to know/verify that there is God and how we can know which god to believe in among many religions.

Fast forward to 2019, I got fished on the street and led to Shincheonji bible study. I was amazed by the teaching because I thought at that time, it was able to answer the questions I had about God and religion, but as a newcomer, I was a bit cautious about SCJ because it felt like they were worshipping one man.

**While in SCJ**

When covid happened, I did a lot of translation work. Back then there was no chatGPT and even though there were web translators like Google Translator and Papago, I personally preferred to translate on my own so I got to study a lot. I searched a lot of things using the bible and dictionary as the standard. Even searching for the meaning of each individual word, hanja/Chinese character, the history of early Christians, scientific evidence of Noah's ark, Jesus etc., I wanted to do a good job and to provide the best education material possible. And also this was supposed to be our spiritual food. I always prayed before translating, asking for heaven's guidance and also prayed that whoever reads can receive a lot of realisation. I did not want any misunderstanding that could cause someone to stumble in their faith. Through translation/studying, I realised that my life of faith as a Christian today was much easier than those who came before me. I was thankful and felt God's grace for allowing me to realise the word. Ever since then, I have been very active and poured my heart and effort into my task and evangelism thinking about how CHJN fought and overcame. I even thought about giving up my studies or career later to become a GSN/instructor with the heart of wanting to share this gospel and help others to realise that there is God, just as how I was able to come to faith.

**This year**

This year, while trying to balance my tasks and my studies, I failed a hurdle exam for my final year. I was sad about it but I believed God allowed it to happen and it happened for a reason. ""Maybe it happened so I can do more of God's work?"" is what I thought because we were lacking interpreters at that time and was planning to work for SCJ full-time so I was able to get back up quite quickly. But my parents forced me to move back in with them (they knew I was a part of Shincheonji. we argued often on the doctrine). They didn't want me to do any SCJ activities. It was hard being away from my spiritual family, being away from the church, but I caught up on service, educations, and meetings when my parents were asleep (did all of this voluntarily, no one checked up on me) and also secretly worked on my task and translation work for future edu. So in other words, I had no negative feelings towards SCJ up until this point and I have never thought of leaving SCJ - rather, I would find ways to keep my faith and stay in SCJ because I truly thought this was the place of truth, God's kingdom.

In August, my parents and I travelled to Korea for vacation. So I felt betrayed when they told me let's visit a cult counselling centre. I remember being really upset because they lied to me and had planned this behind my back. But even then, I was determined to keep my faith so I just sat there and didn't even look them in the eyes and planned to buy a plane ticket secretly to go back to Australia.

I think I cried at least once a day (I am usually not an emotional person). Initially, it was out of anger and frustration. But that later turned into the disbelief that SCJ was teaching against what God intended and thus, doing the work of anti-Christ. It also pained me whenever I thought about the members whom I cared for and counselled, the friendships I made inside of S, and how I was going to tell my church that I am leaving. I think this happened over a period of roughly 2 weeks?

**How I came to the realisation that SCJ is a cult**

How I realised SCJ is not the place of truth was from comparing the education materials I translated, CHJN's word, and the bible (always reading in the whole paragraph, not just the verse). I remember not wanting to rely on external sources such as reddit or the many youtube links that my parents sent me.

When you are in SCJ, you are really a frog in a well (우물 안 개구리). You only see what SCJ wants you to see. And because you believe SCJ is the truth deep in your heart, even if you see or hear things that should be red flags, you self-brainwash yourselves and eventually still end up thinking SCJ is the place of truth. This was me even when I saw articles or watched interviews about Kim Nam-hee, Shin Hyun-wook, or anything that is anti-SCJ. I always thought people can make up stories and give false testimony to make LMH or SCJ look back. Newcomers these days don't even know who these people are.

I think I also felt that emptiness that some people shared here. It's quite true because you do get along with the people inside as groups or departments. You also make friendships as well. I still think the people in my branch church are really lovely despite blocking/cutting me off. From what I experienced, they have that noble heart of loving people's souls and a pure heart towards God but it's **not** because SCJ is the truth or the place where God is. My branch church, after the new head GSN came, encourages marriage - you don't have to reach the age of 28 (female) or 30 (male). SCJ also maintains the life of faith of members and there are many other ways to tie them to SCJ and make it harder to leave. But for me, the word is more important. While carrying a life of faith in SCJ and even now, my vision has been to carry faith that is according to God's word.

I am really thankful to my parents. I think I am really lucky that I came to the cult counselling centre set by who used to be one of the 7 educators, who was in SCJ for 20 years. Now that I realise SCJ is wrong, he's helping me to understand the bible properly so I am quite happy. I think if I didn't have this, I might have felt really empty and either given up life of faith completely or be tempted to go back to SCJ. Now I am certain SCJ is a cult that skews the word of God. I am really sad when thinking of the people who are working really hard inside of S thinking it is for God but it is ultimately for LMH's glory and cash flow. SCJ members think what they are doing is for God and hope for the kingdom of heaven and eternal life (eternal blessings) but it will be hard for them to take in that what they are doing is completely opposite. From Galatians 1:

>**6** I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you to live in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel— **7** which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ. **8** But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God’s curse! **9** As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let them be under God’s curse!

I also met a lot of ex-SCJ members all from different tribes. It's quite shocking how some things are different by tribe, and whether you are in Korea or overseas. Such as paying 110만원 if you do not evangelise or groups collecting money when it's SSN's birthday. And one of them used to be Culture BJN and pretended to be one of the journalists during last year's 100,000 graduation. And from another person who used to work in Myanmar: the world peace tour was all made-up as he was the one organising LMH's visit... and more.

**In terms of the Word:**

BDS, considered to be the backbone of SCJ doctrine, is not biblical. I think someone already pointed out the fact that John the Baptist is not a betrayer. And SCJ uses 2Thes 2:1-3 as a way to justify there is BDS for the second coming. When I did translation work, I would also read other versions to enhance my understanding. For example, Rv 15:5 in NIV it says the tabernacle of the covenant law, rather than the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony. But if you see the Berean Literal Bible, it reads:

>And after these things I looked, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened.

When it comes to different versions of the bible, having done translation work, I believe that if you read it in context, it doesn't matter which version you read. Even if the wording is different, the message it is trying to get across is the same.

Back to 2Thes 2:1-3. Paul gives words of warning of deception when it comes to the coming of our Lord. SCJ is used to this version of 2Thes 2:2

>not to become easily unsettled or alarmed by the teaching allegedly from us—whether by a prophecy or by word of mouth or by letter—asserting that the day of the Lord has already come.

Here it says whether by a prophecy or by word of mouth or by letter. We should have been alarmed ourselves when it says prophecy. If you read other versions:

NLT:

>Don’t be so easily shaken or alarmed by those who say that the day of the Lord has already begun. Don’t believe them, even if they claim to have had a spiritual vision, a revelation, or a letter supposedly from us.

BSB:

>not to be easily disconcerted or alarmed by any spirit or message or letter seeming to be from us, alleging that the Day of the Lord has already come.

CEV:

>not to be easily upset or disturbed by people who claim the Lord has already come. They may say they heard this directly from the Holy Spirit, or from someone else, or even that they read it in one of our letters.

GNT:

>not to be so easily confused in your thinking or upset by the claim that the Day of the Lord has come. Perhaps it is thought that we said this while prophesying or preaching, or that we wrote it in a letter.

I only chose a few but you can see the rest. link: [https://biblehub.com/2\_thessalonians/2-2.htm](https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm)

Another one is Mt 13:30, the parable of weed and wheat: 

>29 “‘No,’ he answered, ‘because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them. 30 Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.’” 

SCJ uses this verse to say that we are harvested or we need to be harvested to the barn. But read again and see the order of events.

At that time I will tell the harvesters: Here, 'I' is Jesus, right? and the harvesters are the angels. 

What happens first? Harvesting the wheat or collecting and bundling the weeds? And who is tying the weeds in bundles to be burned? Is it (false/general) pastors who are telling people not to be harvested? If it is the angels who are harvesting, are they really using the wheat they collected to go back to harvest more in the same field? Are they further harvesting, looking for remnant wheat from the bundles of weeds they tied?    

It's not just these verses but you need to examine the scripture much more closely 

* what is the 'another advocate' in Jn 14, 16. SCJ General Assembly Education did two GA educations on this and also changed its wording on it.  
* the understanding of spirits, especially the Holy Spirit and the work of spirits 
* the concept of salvation (how salvation is attained) 
* the meaning of the Book of life, the kingdom of priests, and the multitude in white 
* the whole book of Revelation   

To make SCJ doctrine pointing to LMH valid, it's important for them to teach about the work of the spirits so they can continue to say that the spirit has entered/worked through LMH. So you will see that they don't believe in the Trinity. SCJ will argue that God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are separate entities so that the Spirit is working through LMH.  

I believe in what Gamaliel said in Acts 5. SCJ is also subjected to the words of Rv 22:18-19. 

But what I am worried about is:

* that people who haven't even heard about SCJ are still vulnerable and also those who are being evangelised by their family/ACQs who are in SCJ 
* cult producing cults: 
   * Recently a GSN in Seoul James tribe created a sect with \~20 members saying that LMH only received 10% of the revelation and he himself received the rest. Doesn't it sound similar to the relation between TT and LMH? 
   * There is 신천지 and there is also 새천지 (Saecheonji) - both read as new heaven and new earth but LMH's Shincheonji uses Chinese hanja 신 while Saecheonji uses the modern Korean word of 'new'. Then the whole argument using cult family tree made sense and how other cults such as Unification church, Church of God, and JMS also use the same doctrine just a different leader I watched 'I am God' documentary on Netflix after I left SCJ. After watching it, it made me think why LMH would even start doing this work. LMH has been under cults since he was in his 20s and poured his time, and effort into following Park Tae-son, then volunteering in construction for TT, and then was one of the 12 disciples of Baek Man-bong (one of the 7 messengers), who also appointed 24 elders and called himself the Counselor who came in the name of the Lord, the one who overcomes, one of the 2 witnesses. LMH called him Lord. LMH may have felt vengeful? after realising he wasted his 20s to 50s under all these cults and also thought it was possible for him to do the same.  
* Suicide/PTSD/Mental illness among ex-members 
   * I read about the situation in Czech Republic. In Korea, there have been also cases of ex-members who ended their lives after realising SCJ is a cult and that they felt ashamed and found it unbearable that their peers built their careers, bought a home and had a family; a normal life while they spent time, effort and money for LMH. I worry this could happen in more countries. 
* Head GSN selectively deleting chat messages 
   * I am not sure why but it's a bit unnerving that he would selectively delete messages. He has historically cleared chat messages whenever I was at risk of persecution from my parents. A month ago, he would give me borderline questionable advice on what to do about my parents and then delete only those messages. On the day I declared I was leaving SCJ, I sent him a personal message in Korean making my stance but also thanking him for caring/looking after me since he came. But his responses were unusual. I thought he would have cleared all of the chats but he selectively deleted some and kept some.  

&#x200B;

**Final say/suggestions:**

* I am really thankful to my parents who 'coerced' me to realise the truth. I am also thankful that I only spent 3.5 years (some might say it's still long but I met a girl who was in SCJ for 10 years, spent all of her 20s). If you have friends or family in a cult, I think it's important not to be so aggressive (although it kinda worked out for me) or satirical. I think it builds more resistance even though you are speaking the truth.   
* I hope many of you who are willing can share your stories to your local churches, universities and workplaces. Although Reddit has been helpful, I told myself anyone can make multiple accounts and can make up stories. 
* At one point after realising SCJ is wrong, I considered giving up my faith in God completely. But someone told me about Joseph's story. Did Joseph know he was going to be the vizier (second-in-command) when he fell into the pit, or when he was sold off as a slave? Did God abandon him when it happened? Some things taught in SCJ such as why Jesus is the Messiah and God's 6000 years of work are true (according to the bible) and I believe in the words of Prov 16:9 and Rom 8:28. It is God who allowed me to go to SCJ 3 years ago and it is also God gave me the mind to realise its false teaching this year. So I believe it is God who will awaken those who are in SCJ, not by my efforts or ability. 
* This means I am not going to message those who I know first but will always welcome anyone who wants to really know and double-check for yourselves before you commit your whole life to it. But I pray that you will check soon, not like 10 years from now, and regret it deeply from the damages already made.  

tdlr: I didn't have any bad feelings towards SCJ and my church. I was quite devoted. But coming to Korea, I have seen the reality of Shincheonji and I am never going back. SCJ skews the understanding of the bible to fit their agenda. I pray that many SCJ members, especially those whom I love and cared for, can come out a day sooner."

I assigned a paper (worth a pretty good percentage of their grade) and noticed that this one student turned it in late, which was out of character for him. As I started reading the paper, I noticed that it was very unlike his previous work and seemed AI-generated. I was curious, so I typed the paper prompt into ChatGPT and basically got his submission word for word- my suspicions were confirmed. However, I held off on grading it and requested that he come meet with me. I wanted to see what the reason behind him doing that was. He admitted that yes, he did use ChatGPT, because he procrastinated and was overwhelmed/in a rush to submit it. If it was some emergency or situation out of his control, maybe I would be more understanding, but procrastination…really? Just manage your time better. So, I decided to give a 0 on the assignment. He asked if he could do a rewrite, but I don’t allow those as stated in my syllabus. I could have reported him to the dean, but I didn’t. He said he’s going to give me a 1 on RateMyProfessor, ooh😂"

By the time I wake up, it's already time for me to go to class, spend a few hours there, and come back to hace dinner. Again, I come back exhausted and go back to sleep.
Today in class, we went through all the subject's program and everything we've seen so far. I got as anxious as you can get because I am so, so far behind.

The time I don't spend working or at class, I spend sleeping cause I don't have energy. I'm pale white because I don't go out, I don't see my friends during the week, and if I see them at a friday night that just means I won't get up early to study on Saturday morning.

16nfvwq,1,2023-09-20,"Part 1: A gentleman, the introduction",u/Lost_And_Seeking8899,TraditionalAcademy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TraditionalAcademy/comments/16nfvwq/part_1_a_gentleman_the_introduction/,"Hello everyone!

Welcome to the first post in this series. 

I am going to pass on, to the best of my ability, what I have learnt throughout my life.

A little about me, I am 40, divorced and father to a young school aged son. I live in Australia and work in IT and Project management.

Here we go……

What is a gentleman?

The traditional gentleman.

A traditional gentleman is typically associated with a set of values and behaviors from past eras, often reflecting a more conservative and formal approach to etiquette and social norms. 

Characteristics of a traditional gentleman may include:

1. Chivalry: A commitment to courteous and respectful behavior, particularly towards women, often emphasizing opening doors, offering coats, and displaying acts of gallantry.

2. Politeness: A strong adherence to polite language and manners, including using titles and honorifics, and refraining from using coarse or impolite language.

3. Well-Dressed: A focus on dressing neatly and elegantly, often wearing suits, ties, or formal attire in various social settings.

4. Reserved Demeanor: A calm and composed disposition, avoiding public displays of emotion or aggression.

5. Honor and Integrity: A dedication to personal honor, honesty, and ethical behavior in both personal and professional life.

6. Generosity: A willingness to help others, donate to charitable causes, and support the less fortunate.

7. Traditional Gender Roles: An adherence to more traditional gender roles, where men are expected to provide for and protect their families.

It's important to note that the concept of a traditional gentleman has evolved over time and varies across cultures and historical periods. Modern interpretations often blend traditional values with contemporary ideals of equality and respect.

The new age or modern gentleman

A new age or modern gentleman is someone who embodies modern values of respect, equality, and personal development. He treats women with genuine respect, recognizing their autonomy and equal worth in all aspects of life. As a defender of the family, he prioritizes emotional support, open communication, and shared responsibilities, rather than outdated notions of protection. While being a student of martial arts can be a part of his personal development, a gentleman values non-violence and conflict resolution, using his skills responsibly and ethically. Ultimately, a gentleman in 2023 is characterized by empathy, integrity, and a commitment to growth in a rapidly changing world.

Where do I fit into this? I am a traditional gentleman that was raised in a traditional house hold. I studied martial arts for around 20yrs, and have identified that a traditional gentleman is closely aligned to the principles of Bushido.

And I am guessing that this is where I have lost you. I urge you to stick with me… I will make my point here shortly.

To be a traditional man, a traditional gentleman, you must be able to provide for your wife and your family and you must be able to protect your wife and family - protect your house, your home, your castle.

To illustrate the links and similarities between Bushido and the qualities of a traditional gentleman, here are 5 aspects of Bushido that create this link:

	1.	Honor and Integrity: Both bushido and the traditional gentleman emphasize the importance of honor, honesty, and ethical behavior. Both value individuals who adhere to a strong moral code.

	2.	Respect and Politeness: Bushido promotes respect for others, particularly for one’s superiors and peers. A traditional gentleman values politeness and courteous behavior towards others, reflecting respect in social interactions.

	3.	Self-Discipline and Control: Bushido places a strong emphasis on self-discipline and control over the warrior’s emotions, particularly in the face of adversity. A traditional gentleman’s composed demeanor aligns with this aspect of self-mastery.

	4.	Courage and Responsibility: Bushido teaches courage and responsibility in the protection of others and the defense of one’s beliefs. These qualities can resonate with a traditional gentleman’s role as a defender of family and values.

	5.	Loyalty and Devotion: Both bushido and traditional gentleman ideals include a sense of loyalty and devotion, whether it’s to one’s lord, family, or principles. Loyalty is seen as a noble virtue in both contexts.

16nhf4k,1,2023-09-20,How ChatGPT will change education,u/Super_Towel,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/16nhf4k/how_chatgpt_will_change_education/,"Hello everyone!  
Recently I found some good sources of information about how ChatGPT will be involved in people’s education and how it will be used in the future (a very discussed topic between my peers) and thought I will share it with you all.  
There is no brainer that with this technology which is evolving rapidly the potential ways are unlimited, but the most exciting part is that it will have a huge significant impact on education. Here are a few:  
**Foreign language learning**  
Written text between different languages could be translated using ChatGPT. Although English is favored, ChatGPT can also grasp other languages, and as time goes on, this capability will increase. Thus, it might be used by students to instantly translate information written in a foreign language into their mother tongue.  
Other language learning applications ChatGPT could be used for include:  
\- explaining grammar;  
\- reviewing and correcting written assignments;  
\- providing vocabulary exercises;  
\- providing instruction on how to pronounce words;  
\- re-writing existing articles in Simple English (or other languages);  
\- generating custom dialogues and stories based on a student’s instructions, which could be helpful in understanding the nuts and bolts of the target language.  


It also can help with real time translation during language lessons this way allowing students to make conversations with native speakers of that language.   


**Tailored feedback**  
The capacity of ChatGPT to precisely assess learners' output and deliver focused feedback is another crucial feature.  
AI is already bridging educational gaps that would otherwise be difficult to identify and remedy.   
For example, online course providers such as Coursera use AI to identify commonly occurring errors in students' homework assignments. In addition to informing the course instructor of their students' difficulties with the topic, it gives the latter with customized recommendations and instant feedback. Students obtain a correct knowledge of the subject without having to wait for the teacher's contribution in this manner.   
This means that technologies like ChatGPT will be able to get a sense of individual students' strengths and limitations. Furthermore, it can now precisely and effectively describe these concerns so that students understand how to proceed.  


And these are just a few reasons. I actually found this in a [guidebook](https://www.turingcollege.com/playbooks/chatgpt-in-education) created by Turing College. Also [Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/04/06/1071059/chatgpt-change-not-destroy-education-openai/) and [AIMultiple](https://research.aimultiple.com/chatgpt-education/) have very informative articles about this as well. These sources explain other ways as well as discuss the potential problems that could be caused by ChatGPT that I found to be quite interesting.  


Additionally, I would really appreciate your opinions about this and if you were able to use it to your advantage? Maybe you already use it in your daily life?"
16nlbra,1,2023-09-20,Provisionally passed @125,u/ThanksForAllTheShoes,cissp,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/16nlbra/provisionally_passed_125/,"I just wanted to thank the community here. Without the tips here I never would have felt ready to take the test. I saw over and over again no one ever feels ready and that was true for me. I studied for a little over three months for about 10 to hours a week. I couldn’t study more because my wife gave birth to our daughter in June, and because of my work situation there wasn’t going to be another time where I would be able to fully commit to studying even that much.

Work experience: I have about 20 years experience as a system engineer. My undergrad and graduate degrees were IT related. I also have Security+.

My study materials.

OSG - For me, the book was mind numbingly dry. I didn’t read it cover to cover. I mostly used it as a reference when I got practice questions wrong. I’m pretty sure I read the Software Assurance Maturity Model over twenty times and I felt the information seeping out of my brain without any sort of retention every single time. I did get a question on SAMM so the effort paid off. 

ChatGPT - Very underrated source IMO. Be careful though as the AI can be wrong. But whenever I didn’t fully comprehend a topic. I would plug that topic into ChatGPT with the prompt “explain this to me like a fifth grader.” That helped me understand the topic better instead of memorizing a definition. 

LearnZapp - I felt the questions were either too technical or too easy and not a lot in between. As long as you are using the practice questions as a guide to what you need to study more and not an indicator and whether you understand the topic they are still useful.

Destination Certification Master Class (Self Paced)- The cost of the class is a lot, but If you have the money or your company will pay for it I felt they way they presented the material was fantastic. Especially with the soft skills. I found the website a litty buggy and some of their material is out of order or missing, like the mind maps for Domain 1 and Domain 2. But those are minor quibbles.

Pete Zerger Exam Cram - Great resource if you are using this to focus on what you need to study for. The exam questions go deeper than the overview, which is to be expected. 

Other tidbits that work for me.

I first tried doing flash cards, but felt I was memorizing definitions instead of really understanding the material. So I stopped. I felt the same with using mnemonic devices to memorize processes. The questions I got in the test were never what is the fourth step in Incident Response. I needed a deeper understanding to get the question right.

I have ADHD and the biggest tip I have for exam questions is make sure you don’t subconsciously skip over words when reading the questions. When I was taking practice exams I would get many wrong by assuming I knew what the questions were asking and missing key words that change the answer. 

Thinking like a manager helped me with over 20 questions.

I felt the test was definitely more about reading comprehension than technical knowledge, and I got questions that were not covered in any of the study materials (including the OSG). I really don’t understand the point of that because you are not giving the student the chance to understand the topic. I agree that in the real world you aren’t going to know everything and that is probably the point. But I personally don’t see these types of questions as an efficient way of testing that ability, just whether you are good at taking these types of tests. 

Don’t stress out if you get a couple of easy questions in a row because of the CAT exam. My last 4 questions were “easy”, which is why I thought I had failed. If you are getting the harder questions on a consistent basis you are probably on the right track.

That is all I got. Thanks again to this community for everything and good luck to everyone else. "
16nmw2x,1,2023-09-20,The Rankings Regret - A Story by ChatGPT about College Rankings,u/Tall_Strategy_2370,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/16nmw2x/the_rankings_regret_a_story_by_chatgpt_about/,"Here's a story that I had ChatGPT write about how a student might feel about going to a school which dropped in the rankings.   


**The Rankings Regret**  
Ethan had always been a numbers guy. From his SAT scores to his high school GPA, he believed that numbers painted an accurate picture of one's worth. So, when it came time to choose a college, he turned to the one metric he trusted the most: the US News & World Report college rankings.  
In 2022, as he was making his decision, Washington University in St. Louis (WashU) was ranked at a prestigious #15, while the University of California at Berkeley (UC-Berkeley) stood at #20. The choice seemed clear to Ethan. He would attend WashU, a school that, according to the rankings, was superior.  
The campus at WashU was beautiful, the professors were knowledgeable, and the student community was vibrant. Ethan was settling into his freshman year, making friends, and exploring new academic interests. But deep down, he still held onto the pride that he was attending the 15th best university in the nation, as per the rankings.  
However, one fateful morning in 2023, as Ethan was sipping his coffee and scrolling through the news, he stumbled upon the latest US News college rankings. To his horror, WashU had dropped to #24, while UC-Berkeley had soared to #15. The tables had turned.  
A sinking feeling of regret washed over him. Had he made the wrong choice? He had picked WashU over UC-Berkeley purely based on a number, and now that number had changed. He felt a pang of envy thinking about the students at UC-Berkeley, imagining them celebrating their school's rise in the rankings.  
Ethan's friends noticed his change in demeanor. ""What's bothering you?"" asked Maya, a close friend he had made during orientation.  
""I just feel like I made the wrong choice coming here,"" Ethan admitted, showing her the new rankings.  
Maya looked at him, puzzled. ""You're basing your entire college experience on a number that changes every year? Rankings are just one perspective. They don't define the value of your education or the experiences you'll have.""  
Ethan pondered her words. He thought about the research opportunities he had been given, the close-knit community he was a part of, and the memories he had already created. Was all of that worth less because of a shift in rankings?  
Over the next few weeks, Ethan began to see WashU in a new light. He realized that the value of his education wasn't tied to a number but to the experiences he was having and the knowledge he was gaining. He became more involved in campus activities, joined a research project, and even started a club.  
By the end of his freshman year, Ethan had come to a profound realization. Rankings might change, but the value of his experiences and the bonds he formed were priceless. He was proud to be a student at WashU, not because of its rank, but because of the person it was helping him become."

Like 'kay, so I'm doing business English and my activities typically focus on business ethics in some way. I did a project where the students made a business for our city and then used ChatGPT to write a business ethics case study based that was tailored to the the details of the business they made. It was so simple and fast and, me, as someone who doesn't know the first thing about business, like that would've taken me sooooo long to make without ChatGPT. 

For another part of this activity too, they had to hire someone. For that I had to make a couple fake profiles and same as above, that would've taken me a good bit to make, ChatGPT, just a couple minutes. Literally such a life saver. 

I find the activities ChatGPT makes are so-so, but honestly I already feel like I have the ideas for the activities it's just often creating the text required for them that makes them harder to execute. Does anyone have any other ways they like to use ChatGPT to provide support in the teaching/activity creation domain?"

# Reproductive Technology as a Threat to Women and Humanity

Women create humanity.

https://preview.redd.it/5ro2k5ox5gpb1.png?width=497&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b9437b7f5cdcf27a291017efb249fb11d3f5b68

As of today, every human on Earth was born through the body of a woman. Over the course of ten lunar cycles, through our blood and our sweat and our tears, women transform the raw genetic material containing the blueprints of a human being into a person.

This magic birthing force is at the root of both our power and of our oppression. Men envy it and men want to own it.

Female erasure from human reproduction is a tale as old as patriarchy.

Women make people, and men take credit for it. This manifests as patrilineage, where ancestral descent is traced through the male line. Most of us carry our father’s surnames and most American women, married or not, continue to believe children should have their father’s last names. In many cases this is a survival tactic on the part of women, who want to pacify male egos and not risk angering the men who fathered their children. Women remain economically dependent on these men and passing on male surnames is viewed as a way of ensuring continued male support through child rearing.

Historically children born to women who were not legally the property of men through marriage were labeled “illegitimate.” These children were denied inheritance rights. They and their mothers faced social punishment.

While men have readily claimed or rejected ownership of children after birth, for most of history pregnancy and birth were solely women’s work. Reproduction was the domain of women; women labored and birthed at home in the company of their mothers, sisters, friends, and midwives. As evidenced by the success of humans becoming the dominant species on the planet, most of the time the reproductive process went well. But sometimes births resulted in deaths, and history is full of stories of men blaming women, especially midwives, for the deaths of their offspring. Men began to believe that they should be in charge of childbirth. In Europe, male attempts to control childbirth and eradicate midwives began in the middle ages.

Men invented forceps, metal tong-like devices used to extract babies from women’s bodies during difficult labors. Kept exclusively in the hands of male providers, forceps marked the beginning of male domination over childbirth. Men also invented chloroform and ether and began advertising anesthetized birth to women in the 1800s. These drugs were only available from male birth attendants. Despite these new technologies, most women preferred to give birth in the company of other women.

So men escalated their campaign to control birth. From the late 1800s to the 1930s, industrialized medical forces in the US successfully campaigned to criminalize midwifery and force all women to give birth with state licensed male attendants. These medical men preferred to centrally manage birthing women rather than attend individual births at home. ***In 1900, nearly 100% of American women gave birth at home, half with male medical attendants and half with female relatives or community midwives. By 1938, 50% of American births took place in hospitals and nearly all births were attended by male physicians.***

https://preview.redd.it/c62o6tq66gpb1.png?width=320&format=png&auto=webp&s=fde89dfc0f11367b4509b7de49e5523baa5c25c2

This was before widespread availability of antibiotics and safe blood transfusions. There was no evidence that birthing in the hospital created better outcomes for women and their babies. Feminist statistician Marjorie Tew’s work demonstrates that maternal and neonatal deaths both increased when birth moved to the hospital en masse.

The shift to hospital birth reflected the imposition of the industrial model onto birth. Doctors managed birthing women assembly line style and babies were the end product of the process. By the 1950s, women entered the hospital in labor where male doctors anesthetized them, restrained them to beds with leather straps, manually dilated their cervixes, and then pulled babies out of their bodies with forceps. Everyone now understood that the medical industry delivered babies.

Industrial medicine continues to receive credit for the creation of new humans. Nearly every woman who receives mainstream prenatal care and then births in a hospital truly believes she and her baby would have died without technological intervention. Despite industrialized birth deviating from normal physiology most of the time, we live under the illusion that conditions in hospital birth have improved over the years. Leather restraints have been replaced by pink and blue monitor belts. General anesthesia has given way to numbing women from the waist down. Women now supposedly have the choice whether or not to comply with industrial birth practices, but fear, propaganda, and sometimes outright coercion result in nearly all women “choosing” restraints and anesthesia. Fewer than 2% of American women give birth outside of the hospital system.

If we factor out improvements in treating severely premature infants and infants born with congenital defects, medical outcomes for newborns have not changed significantly since the late 1960s. But the rate of cesarean birth has increased from 5% to 32%. Far from improving, outcomes for mothers are getting worse, especially among Black and Native American women. American women of every demographic are more likely to die in childbirth today than they were 25 years ago.

We now have over three generations of women whose subjective experience of pregnancy and birth has been overshadowed by endless lab testing, ultrasound scanning, and other forms of medical surveillance. Women are so removed from the biological continuity of pregnancy and birth transforming seamlessly into motherhood, that most American women describe their entry into parenting as “when I brought you home from the hospital.”

And now, the entry into motherhood is increasingly described as “when you were placed in my arms after the surrogate birthed you.”

https://preview.redd.it/h4bo4pes6gpb1.png?width=1272&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc14b1f06a5cafc18f099f05e7220af994adfb19

We can all recognize the invisibility of women and erasure of pregnancy and birth as the beginning of motherhood in the right’s anti-abortion mantra, “Adoption, not abortion.” The profoundly life-changing process of pregnancy, which is the foundational experience of every human being, is casually disregarded.

With the embrace of surrogacy, reproductive liberals now engage in the same erasure of the biological basis of motherhood. Both pro-surrogacy and anti-abortion rhetoric center around the belief that human beings are created at fertilization. Women’s bodies are just incubators serving a temporary role before babies can be delivered to their rightful owners. The primal, physical mothering that is pregnancy and childbirth is degraded and erased.

[US Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg and husband posing in hospital bed with children acquired through adoption](https://preview.redd.it/txn27h0y6gpb1.png?width=1138&format=png&auto=webp&s=10e739eed5125c663d55491ba7c3bddb9e2f606d)

Throughout history, upper class families have stolen children from poor women through adoption. The legalization of abortion in the US in 1973 drastically decreased the number of children available to adopt. In 1976, a male lawyer named Noel Keane developed the legal concept of surrogacy and drafted the first surrogacy contracts. In 1980, courts ruled these contracts legal and Elizabeth Kane became the first paid contracted surrogate. In 1985 the first gestational surrogacy occurred when a woman was paid to be implanted with and gestate a genetically unrelated embryo. Until 1990 most surrogacy cases involved women undergoing artificial insemination with the buyer’s sperm and the woman’s own eggs. After 1990, most surrogacy has involved in vitro fertilization of embryos implanted in the women who gestate and birth the babies.

The foundational patriarchal belief that only genetic gamete contribution “legitimizes” a child has morphed into “gestational surrogacy.” Like their anti-abortion contemporaries, surrogacy advocates believe that embryos are legal entities separate from the women who gestate them. In both cases ownership of children begins with fertilization and whether a pregnancy is a result of sex with a man or embryo transfer, a woman is legally obligated to carry to term. The woman’s physical labor that creates the baby is “unrelated” to the child.

***Before gestational surrogacy, the women hired to make babies for others were labeled surrogate mothers. Now they are simply referred to as surrogates or gestational carriers. The word mother is reserved for the buyer of the baby if the buyer happens to be female.*** Surrogacy represents the end game of liberal equality feminism. Women can now insert their gametes into another person and come back nine months later to collect their legal property.

[Chrissy Teigen kissing the abdomen of the working class woman she hired to gestate and birth her baby](https://preview.redd.it/h57mpgi57gpb1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=a909cfba070e5fd84b05aca89d507476e3bccd68)

The past few years have brought an enormous amount of propaganda promoting surrogacy. Liberal feminist trend setters have been at the forefront of the campaign. Sarah Jessica Parker, bragged that she used other women as surrogates because she did not want to endure the health risks of pregnancy. She also stated that pregnancy and childbirth would derail her career. Media stories tell us that Parker’s promotion of surrogacy convinced her co-star Cynthia Nixon to also hire a working class woman to gestate and birth a child. Other prominent female entertainers who have procured their children through surrogacy include Nicole Kidman, Tyra Banks, Lucy Liu, Chrissy Teigen, Paris Hilton, Rebel Wilson, Jodie Foster, and Amber Heard. Each of these women has a distinct brand and is used by the media to market surrogacy to different demographic groups.

In liberal feminist circles, gestating and birthing a baby for a gay man or couple is a badge of honor. This service earns women social capital among progressives. Big Fertility sells reproductive technology as an integral part of gay rights. Gay style setters are buying babies at breakneck speed. Gay fashion designer and star of Queer Eye, Tan France, released a photography shoot of himself naked and holding an ultrasound image of a fetus over his abdomen to announce that he was acquiring a baby through surrogacy. Elton John, Perez Hiton, Neil Patrick Harris, Clay Aikin, Anderson Cooper, Lance Bass…at this point it’s hard to think of a famous contemporary gay male entertainer who hasn’t bought a baby through the egg and surrogacy market. Gay conservative darling Dave Rubin and his husband hired two separate surrogates at the same time, one each to gestate embryos created with purchased eggs and their individual sperm.

https://preview.redd.it/vyjm0fzf7gpb1.png?width=1204&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6cffea8253ca4e65c8f857ee67b91558813164b

The Kardashians have played a prominent role in mainstreaming surrogacy. Kim has said that hiring surrogates to create her youngest two children was the best decision she ever made. She had experienced complications with her second pregnancy and did not want to risk her health having another child. So she hired a working class woman to offload the medical risks to. Khloe, considered to be the most likable and “relatable” also purchased a child through surrogacy. Khloe’s press appearances about her complicated emotions surrounding surrogacy are being used to buffer criticism of the practice. In interviews that serve as controlled opposition, glamorous, down-to-earth Khloe admits that surrogacy is economically exploitative and creates poor infant bonding. But of course no one is suggesting ending the practice.

Opening a conversation about the economic ethics of surrogacy, however, creates room to discuss other possible ways to outsource reproduction, now including whole body gestational donation. In the journal of Theoretical Medical Bioethics, Anna Smajdor suggests that the solution to the exploitation of surrogacy is to use the bodies of so-called brain dead women to gestate babies. While this may seem far-fetched, there is historical precedent to the proposed practice.

https://preview.redd.it/u6fxgwfl7gpb1.png?width=684&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1cb9a0ebd9269d46bf96e5592c4694769cede6e

In 2013 a woman in Texas named Marlise Munoz suffered a pulmonary embolism when she was 14 weeks pregnant. She was declared brain dead and her husband wanted to remove her body from life support. Munoz was a paramedic and had always expressed that she did not want to be kept alive artificially. The hospital refused to honor the family’s wishes, citing Texas law mandating life-saving measures if a legally brain-dead woman is pregnant. Munoz was forcibly kept on life support for over 2 months until a judge ruled in favor of her family and she was allowed to die.

In the summer of 2023, 2 brain dead patients were used in transplantation research. Kidneys with human DNA that had been grown in genetically engineered human-pig hybrids were transplanted into men who had been declared brain-dead. The men were kept alive for over a month while scientists observed the function of the transplanted organs.

The prospect of brain dead surrogates makes the current state of surrogacy seem almost quaint.

Buying babies usually requires buying eggs and sperm, and the human gamete market is booming.  Young women and men are promised easy money for selling their eggs and sperm. Mainstream culture and the fertility industry still use the term “donate” for the process in order not to invoke scrutiny and public distaste. Big Fertility bombards female college students with ads for egg “donation.” The quality of these ads has changed in the past few years with many companies now incentivizing women with the opportunity to save some of their own eggs for future use in exchange for the remaining eggs being sold to strangers.

https://preview.redd.it/z5g82vwl9gpb1.png?width=469&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7a1823f2f0c72ab5a98ab9786cd65a5c70473a4

Buying human gametes has been thoroughly normalized. People cavalierly browse catalogs looking for desirable genetic material to create their lab-grown children. Many feminists who balk at other aspects of reproductive technology see no problem with women purchasing sperm brokered by the fertility industry. Some women view these transactions as a step toward reproductive autonomy. Sperm is practically a waste product of the male body and men do not suffer physically from its extraction. Aside from the complicated ethics of purchasing human genetic material, the commercial sperm industry relies on pornography for its existence.

One repeat sperm seller wrote the following about pornography and sperm banks:

“After filling out a questionnaire and interacting with an all-female staff, I would get escorted to a small donation room, given a small plastic tube, and be expected to bust a nut. … All the banks I've been to have their own selection of smut. Usually, it took the form of a pile of magazines or, if I was lucky, a small screen mounted on the wall with a bevy of DVDs on an adjacent table. Growing up in the age of internet porn, I was intrigued by these relics. I had never seen porn DVDs before I started providing a sample of my semen to sperm banks. Some of the discs almost looked as old as me, artifacts from the mid-90s, with names like *Anal Frenzy 5* and *Cumshot Chronicles 3*.”

Compare this process to so-called egg donation (which activist Jennifer Lahl calls “egg poaching.”)

https://preview.redd.it/ew2akevg9gpb1.png?width=362&format=png&auto=webp&s=b49a32f6d0aa882631ed9570546ac5e93f52f4b8

In order to sell her eggs, or have her own eggs extracted for the purpose of IVF, a woman is not simply sent into a pornography-filled room. She is first given high dose oral contraceptive pills to override her own fertility cycle. She takes this medication for three weeks, and then is subjected to a transvaginal ultrasound to assess her ovaries. When it has been determined by ultrasound that she does not have any current ripening egg follicles, she is prescribed Lupron or another GnRH agonist. She injects herself with Lupron every day for 7-14 days. The fertility doctors then give her a synthetic follicle stimulating hormone which she also must inject daily. This hormone over-stimulates the ovaries, causing them to ripen many more eggs than the natural one to two ova per cycle. She is subjected to another transvaginal ultrasound to determine that her eggs are ripe. Doctors then anesthetize her, insert a long needle through her vaginal wall, and under ultrasound guidance remove as many ripe eggs as they can find.

People believe that differing rates of compensation for eggs and sperm in the human gamete market make up for the discrepancy in effort and risk between the two processes. Men selling their sperm are paid an average of $120 per ejaculation. They can sell sperm up to twice a week, and can make over $10k a year jerking off to porn at sperm banks. Sperm banks accept sperm from men ages 18 to 39, and there is literally no medical risk to the process of retrieving sperm. A man who remains healthy could theoretically sell sperm weekly for several decades, making hundreds of thousands of dollars over this time period.

https://preview.redd.it/vlcifdqe9gpb1.png?width=352&format=png&auto=webp&s=deb899156235a96116d02758b735f51c398237f9

Women who sell their eggs are paid an average of $5k per egg retrieval. Women whose eggs are highly desirable on the human egg market (Jewish or Asian, tall, from healthy families, naturally thin, athletic, and academically talented) can make up to $20k per procedure. Due to the health risks and the decreasing quality of a woman’s eggs after multiple rounds of ovarian hyperstimulation, fertility clinics do not allow women to sell their eggs more than 6 times.

No man has ever died from masturbating to porn at a sperm bank, but death is a possible side effect of selling eggs.  Sperm donation entails male pleasure. Egg donation entails severe female discomfort and pain. Egg selling carries risks of hemorrhage, infection, and infertility. There are no long-term studies on the effects of egg selling on women’s bodies. Egg donors sign consent forms saying there is no evidence that the process can lead to cancer or other serious health sequelae, but what this means is no studies have been conducted on the topic.

https://preview.redd.it/dj5gt5cc9gpb1.png?width=1160&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb5ff99d832516d6a4c7dbefe9845488a532557

IVF carries the same risks to women as egg selling in addition to the risks of pregnancy and birth. Studies on women who have undergone IVF show that multiple rounds of ovarian hyperstimulation double the lifetime risk of ovarian cancer. IVF pregnancies have increased risks of identical twinning, placental malfunction, cesarean delivery, depression and anxiety. IVF children are ten times more likely to suffer from the deadly cancer neuroblastoma than children who are conceived naturally. They also have higher rates of leukemia, liver cancer, brain cancer, and soft tissue cancers. Despite the illusive promise of genetically healthier children, children conceived via IVF are more likely to suffer from premature birth, low birth weight, cardiac malformations, and disorders of the central nervous system. The oldest person conceived through IVF is only 45 years old, so we are just now beginning to observe the longer term consequences of this experiment on humanity.

IVF qualifies as medical torture and medical experimentation on women. Despite grand promises, IVF continues to have a very low success rate. The process fails to produce a viable pregnancy more often than it succeeds. Fertility doctors subject women to painful and humiliating procedures, and only 50% to 60% of women who undergo three or more rounds of egg harvesting and IVF eventually become pregnant.

But every round of IVF yields information furthering the scientific quest for total control of human reproduction. Big Fertility has been learning a lot over decades of human experimentation. The process of IVF has progressed from simply putting an egg and a sperm sample in a petri dish and allowing fertilization to occur. Most IVF embryos are now the product of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). To accomplish ICSI, scientists remove the outer membrane of the egg, the zona pellucida, the intelligent membrane which allows a chosen sperm to enter and fertilize the ovum. When this layer is intact, an egg will self-destruct if scientists attempt to mechanically penetrate her. Scientists wash off the zona pellucida, then remove the tail from a sperm, place the head of the sperm in a micropipette and forcibly inject the sperm head into the egg. At best, ICSI removes all natural intelligence from the process of human fertilization. At worse it can be described as egg rape.

At least half of all attempts to fertilize an egg outside of the female body fail to create an embryo. When IVF does work, embryos are allowed to grow in the lab for three to five days until they consist of approximately 60 cells. At this point scientists remove one cell for genetic testing, a process called preimplantation genetic diagnosis or PGD. IVF customers are told this makes the process safer by eliminating the chance of implanting an embryo with a genetic defect. There are as yet no studies on the long-term consequences of removing over 1% of a person’s embryonic matter.

Without interventional support, human embryos created outside of a woman stop growing within a few days. Lab grown embryos are either transferred into women after five to seven days or cryogenically frozen for later use. Embryo transfer involves one or more embryos being placed in a sterile catheter then inserted into the woman’s uterus. Fertility doctors then give women synthetic hormones and closely surveil their bodies to determine if pregnancy has occurred. Women must inject themselves daily with progesterone and are subjected to frequent transvaginal ultrasounds for the first ten weeks after the embryo transfer.

Currently, 1 in 50 American live births result from artificial reproductive technology. In Denmark, ten percent of children born in 2022 were conceived through IVF.

Infertility can create grief and desperation, leaving women vulnerable to predatory forces. Big Fertility offers to save women from our defective bodies and give us children. But the $23 billion dollar a year fertility industry does not expend resources to cure infertility. Very little research is being done on why so many women are experiencing infertility. It is not coincidental that the medical industry and international health organizations spend billions inducing infertility in women around the world. Hormonal contraception and sterilizing surgeries are aggressively pushed on poor women, young women, and women of color by the same forces making money treating infertility in wealthier populations.

In the West, young women are subjected to the long con of pressure to delay childbearing until the socially acceptable age of their late thirties or early forties, the time when female fertility sharply declines. Instead of creating policies and social practices that support women having children when they are most fertile and most likely to have good maternal and child health outcomes, liberal feminist forces are now studying and promoting the idea that true equality for women means the ability to have genetically related children across the entire adult lifespan. The same forces intentionally creating female infertility are also pouring billions of dollars into “extending female reproductive longevity.” What this means, according to the people funding the research, is making the process of egg retrieval and storage easier and more affordable.

While scientists have not been working on an actual cure for infertility, they have been meticulously studying human embryonic development. Promising relief from human suffering, fertility scientists are experimenting with gene editing of embryos with CRISPR technology. The first known genetically edited humans were born in 2018. The September 11, 2023 edition (that’s this week) of The New Yorker contains a thirteen page article on gene editing of human embryos.

Despite warnings against the practice in dystopian tales from previous generations, we have entered the world of designer babies. Children born through IVF already undergo pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). Detailed understanding of the human genome and the technology to genetically edit embryos currently exists. In 2017, Stanford scholar Harry Greely wrote The End of Sex, in which he convincingly argues that by 2040 the majority of children born in the developed world will be created through this technology. Greely is fully supportive of this brave new world, envisioning a society no longer plagued by children with genetic diseases like Tay Sachs and Down Syndrome, but also free of cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and other illnesses with genetic causes. I am less optimistic.

My pessimism deepens when I think about the burgeoning field of artificial gametes. In March 2023, media around the world announced that scientists had created mice with 2 fathers. Since the early 2000s, researchers have been working on in vitro gametogenesis, or IVG, the process of creating artificial sperm and egg cells. Blood, hair or skin cells are transformed into stem cells. These stem cells are then genetically engineered into sperm and egg cells. Last year scientists succeeded in fertilizing artificial eggs with artificial sperm and creating viable mouse embryos. These embryos were gestated and birthed by female mice, but the published results asserted that the mice had no mothers.

Very wealthy gay men are quite interested in the possibility of creating babies with two genetic fathers. One of these men is Matt Krisiloff, a venture capitalist involved in the development of ChatGPT. Krisiloff states he wants to have genetically related children with his partner Lucas Harrington,the founder of Mammoth Biosciences, a company at the forefront of CRISPR gene editing technology. With money from Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI and former boyfriend of Krisiloff, these men started Conception Biosciences. The motto of Conception is “Turning stem cells into human eggs.” These men may be close to achieving their goal of genetically motherless children. On September 7, 2023, Israeli scientists announced they had created a human embryo without the use of natural sperm or egg cells.

The pro-tech propaganda outlet Wired magazine routinely runs articles praising Sam Altman and his colleagues. Wired has enthusiastically endorsed all of Altman’s endeavors, from artificial intelligence to artificial sperm and egg cells. On August 31, 2023 , Wired published an article asserting that genetic familial relationships are social constructs based in white supremacy. Foreseeing a world where most children are created through artificial reproductive technology and gene editing, the authors argue for a future where preferring genetically related children is stigmatized. But they do offer one exception. Due to a history of reproductive marginalization, it will still be ethical for gay men to prefer and select for genetically related offspring.

In her article entitled “[Mommy, what did you do in the industrial revolution?](https://sci-hub.wf/10.3138/ijfab.2.1.140)”, radical feminist perinatologist and home birth mother Lauren Plante laments that birth has moved “first out of the home, and now out of the vagina.” We currently face the possibility that pregnancy and birth may move out of the female body entirely. Viatra Biomedical corporation  raised over $25 million w the goal of creating artificial wombs. The EU program Horizon has dedicated 2.9 million  to researching and developing artificial wombs. The director of the EU artificial womb project Guid Oei said in 2019, “During the next 5 years, we will conduct further research and test these technologies in a European collaboration, and continue to develop them until we manage to realize a first prototype of an artificial womb. That is a wonderful challenge.”

As K Yang notes in her brilliant presentation [“The Great Reset of Motherhood,](https://www.whosebodyisit.com/the-great-reset-of-motherhood) the propaganda around artificial wombs is escalating. The ruling class is preparing our minds for this technology. We are being exposed to frequent stories about the soon to be available artificial wombs. In December 2022, EctoLife launched a multi-million dollar ad campaign misleadingly implying that artificial womb facilities already exist. In June 2023, Psychology Today ran an article entitled “In a decade human bodies may not be required to make a baby.”

We need to start having the conversation about whether or not an organism created with gametes made from skin cells and gestated in an artificial womb is human. We need to talk about this before the technology is already in use and we are silenced. We will be accused of hurting the feelings and erasing the existence of those who have used this technology. Looking at the trajectory of fertility medicine over the past 50 years, we cannot assume that scientists will fail at this project.

https://preview.redd.it/jega8es38gpb1.png?width=384&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ee19922ef61e2349067da0d805cf4b1ed350ca4

While we wait for what seems like the inevitable artificial wombs, research on uterus transplantation is advancing quickly. Over 40 infants have now been born to women who had received living or deceased donor wombs. No one knows how these children will be affected by growing in a transplanted organ and being exposed to anti-rejection medication throughout pregnancy, but the science advances nonetheless. Many American university hospital systems now boast uterine transplant programs. The UPenn womb transplant department actively recruits women to undergo elective hysterectomy and donate their healthy wombs to the project. Under the guise of helping the tiny subset of women who were born without wombs, scientists are gleaning enormous amounts of information on how to eventually transplant uteruses into men.

https://preview.redd.it/habpe9uy7gpb1.png?width=476&format=png&auto=webp&s=21c9bc9dfbcd6b211efa8428a31bf5302eac2f97

When I bring up the topic of men receiving uterus transplants, I inevitably hear a chorus of “that will never happen” followed by a list of perceived reasons why the male body cannot support a functioning uterus. The scientists hard at work at transplanting uteruses into men are well aware of all of these arguments and they are countering each one.

50 years of Big Fertility’s mass experimentation on women has yielded information on how to create a baby using a body that is not hospitable to pregnancy and birth.  Scientists are examining data from women with a rare congenital condition in which females are born without a vagina and uterus who have undergone uterine transplants and vaginoplasty. These women do not have connective tissue or a vascular system attached to a uterus. Womb transplants in this demographic are being studied with the goal of learning how to transplant a uterus into a male body.

Women with classical CAH produce high levels of testosterone and usually have external genitalia that appear male. There are very few recorded cases of natural conception and birth in women with classical CAH. But many women with CAH have been treated in fertility clinics, and some of these treatments have led to viable pregnancies and live births. Scientists believe the data from these cases support the safety of uterine transplant and pregnancy in males whose testicles remain intact.

https://preview.redd.it/m1vcz44w7gpb1.png?width=530&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c3b97884a8270b05bc808ea6af7eb40cddbb15d

While radical feminists have rejected the term “pregnant men” as it is applied to pregnant trans-identified women, the fertility industry is taking information gained from this population to further research on actual male pregnancy.

Women taking testosterone during pregnancy are mined for data to support the goal of male pregnancy. One researcher states, “The closest analogous population to transgender women may be transgender men on exogenous testosterone…Reassuringly, uncomplicated pregnancies have been reported.”

No one needs a uterus transplant. Unlike other organ donation, uterine transplantation is never necessary to prolong life or restore sensory function. Uterine transplantation poses major known and unknown risks to both recipients and the offspring born from the procedure. It is difficult to make an ethical argument for why only females should be allowed to access this unecessary technology, and those promoting womb transplants into men know this.

https://preview.redd.it/zlvowwts7gpb1.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=f726f40e67501afd7b190082cbc4e6f80c676554

All of mainstream medicine has fallen for the “TW are women” lie. Males who assert they are female are viewed by many doctors as no different from women born without a uterus and vagina. In addition to creating male pregnancy, researchers are advocating for uterine transplantation into men so these men can experience menstruation.

As a midwife and a woman who found her power through sovereign pregnancy and birth, I disagree strongly with the idea that motherhood is ***by nature*** oppressive. I understand the horrors of compulsory motherhood and patriarchal control of women’s reproductive capacity, but my feminist utopia does not involve elimination of pregnancy and birth from the realm of women. I shudder when I look into the future and see men making ova from their skin cells and incubating babies in artificial wombs. With the additional development of virtual reality augmented, high-quality sex robots, I fear that ruling class men may stop making women entirely. Though they will probably keep some of us available as exotics.

Much second wave writing on reproductive technology shares my concerns.

In 1985, Gena Corea wrote [The Mother Machine](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RtXERRw_xPvKMeltzFPogx2PsRRNQP63/view?usp=drive_link), a radical feminist treatise on reproductive technology that remains incredibly pertinent today. I urge everyone trying to make sense of reproductive technology and its effect on women and humanity to read this book. Corea incisively tells us, “Reproductive technologies … are transforming the experience of motherhood and placing it under the control of men. Woman’s claim to maternity is being loosened; man’s claim to paternity is being strengthened.”

Janyce Raymond wrote [Women as Wombs](https://drive.proton.me/urls/GMF0TAQYWC#tTfShsRvTXS8) in 1993, she warned that these technologies “increasingly sever the fetus/embryo from the woman,” erase the biological reality of motherhood, and relegate women to mere incubator status. She states, “Radical feminist opponents of the new reproductive technologies do not pit nature against technology, nor do we extol a new version of biology is destiny for women. Opposition to these technologies is based on the more political feminist perspective that women as a class have a stake in reclaiming the female body … by refusing to yield control of it to men, to the fetus, to the state, and most recently to those liberals who advocate that women control our bodies by giving up control.”

I want to end with an excerpt from Patricia Spallone’s prophetic 1989 book on reproductive technology, [Beyond Conception](https://drive.proton.me/urls/REFJ1X6T44#l5d5nsw4zCgr).

“Those who trust that IVF, artificial wombs, and genetic engineering can be used to make life better trust that scientists and the state will not abuse their authority over women’s eggs, embryos, and bodies–not realizing that such a view means women should exchange our body parts and reproductive role for ‘progress.’

A woman-centered approach to reproduction recognizes the interrelationship among oppressions, among sexism, racism, ableism, class division. It recognizes economic and global inequalities at play in our dependence on technologies. It means we must accept that everything is not solvable by some technological solution, and admit that there are risks to living that ‘experts’ cannot solve for us.

To change our relationship to science and tech in the most woman-respecting, life-respecting way, we must start from the recognition that we are our bodies, we are ourselves. We do not have to accept the man-made paradoxes and the splitting up of women into parts (eggs, embryos, wombs) which has been so ingrained as to seem natural. We can overturn the dualities of mind/body, rational/emotional, science/not science, and the ancient conceptional split embryo/woman. Knowledge of women’s fertility and procreative powers must have to do with our bodies and be grounded in our experiences in the world, in feeling and doing (which also includes thinking and observing), not what scientists find out for us in laboratories after they have taken our insides out.”"

Whisper is amazing at speech recognition.  Text to speech has gotten so much better, to the point where it is nearly as natural as a native speaker. 

But this is just what's available now. Soon, you will be able to speak in English, and in real time, have what you say translated into another language complete with lip movement. [Proof](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1704225885648204211?t=FCyUmjAaMXkEf34QrSuJbA&s=19)

The market for adults and for IELTS will go almost entirely to AI. Teaching kids will likely continue in some form, but the new tools will make it much easier for local teachers to do the job. ChatGPT can already give near instant feedback on writing. A local who doesn't speak English can take a kid's writing, put it into ChatGPT, give personalized feedback, and create tasks that target a student's weaknesses. They can have Whisper identify weaknesses in speaking. They can do almost everything without needing to know any English.

Within the next 5 years, the demand for native speakers will plummet. Please factor this in when thinking about your career."
16o4hrj,1,2023-09-20,What are your thoughts about AI in the academy?,u/ExcellentHamster2020,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/16o4hrj/what_are_your_thoughts_about_ai_in_the_academy/,"I've wound up on the AI committee at my university. I don't really know why; I have zero expertise or even knowledge in that area. The only thing I have to offer to the conversation is my skepticism.

For one, my colleagues have described how they use AI for tasks like completing really mundane things like nursing reports. I have yet to hear a convincing use for AI (among faculty) aside from using it to automate tasks or maybe speed up research. One or two are also teaching their students to use AI responsibly for similar tasks.

None of that seems like a good idea to me. I'm not interested in trusting a computer to do what I know I can do properly. ""Productivity,"" like summarizing a bunch of articles without engaging with the more nuanced elements of those articles, seems like the opposite of productivity - by which I mean, you're not really learning anything if you're not using an actual brain to do it. 

Second, if faculty are afraid their students are going to use AI to write papers and thus cheat, we've discussed teaching faculty ways to spot such cheating. We've discussed showing students how to use AI responsibly and properly. To me, it just seems like the next stage of the old [123essays.com](https://123essays.com) and the tricks that were around when I was in college. 

I'd rather see us have conversations with faculty about how to teach writing correctly so that students aren't able to use these methods: emphasize the thinking process over just creating a product; work on assignments in class together instead of just listening to lectures for the entire class period (ie, ""flipped classrooms,"" which aren't popular because heaven forbid anyone learn how to teach more effectively or do things a little bit differently). 

Ultimately, none of this AI stuff seems like something I need to get involved with, and I suspect a lot of faculty feel the same way. My one and only concern is that if students are essentially having someone else (ChatGPT or whatever) do the work, then they're not learning anything and they're just wasting their college education. 

So I'm asking this group, an anonymous bunch of professor-types, for your thoughts and ideas on this topic. I'd like to learn why anyone really cares about this matter, what you or your institution are doing about it, and so forth. Thanks. "
16o58zh,1,2023-09-20,How I self studied AP World History (and got a good ol' 5),u/skiiiirrt,APStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/APStudents/comments/16o58zh/how_i_self_studied_ap_world_history_and_got_a/,"Hey! My name is Leo. I'm a (now) grade 11 student in Toronto, Canada, and took the APWH exam in May when I was in grade 10. I didn't have an all encompassing guide to tell me what NEEDS to be studied, what COLUD be studied, and how to do do so. Consider this a masterclass, of sorts, and let it be my wisdom departing from one generation of painstaking LEQ takers to another.

Here's some background: I love history. I always have. This is why I chose to take APWH. Backstory done, lets get to the cool part now.

**THE FUNDAMENTALS**

First and foremost, you need to understand why you are taking this course. If your reason is ""I like history"", you'll be fine. Anything other than that, I recommend you do the following: Remove the HI in history. History, at its most basic, is a really long, complex and fascinating story that spans thousands of years, millions of events, billions of people, and trillions of pages in the Barron's APWH book. As soon as you look at history as a story, one that gives your actors personalities and the acts hundreds of years, it will not only fit in your head much better, but also help when studying for the exam.

Oh also, the CED is your BIBLE for the next few while. 

*BOOKS*

Next, you need to prep for the exam. Here's where things start getting particularly interesting. Your first big decision is to choose your review book. There are 2 main options, I studied both in the order Barrons, Princeton and here are my opinions:

Barrons is dense as HELL!! It is not readable, and the ""I like history"" schpeel I went on earlier is disregarded completely in this book. I like to think of it as a dictionary, You can't learn a new language with ONLY their dictionary, but it definitely helps when you have no idea what something means. Use this with caution, and do not trust it as your only book.

Princeton is written much nicer. It makes things much more of a story, and definitely helps with the comprehension aspect of things. It's also much nicer to use at 2 in the morning (sorry mom) and it makes you say ""OHHHH"" much more than Barron's. My rec if you prefer readability over pure and analytic data, but to each their own.

 \\Now, finally, we can start talking about the actual studying. I knew that since I was self studying, I had to study much more than the regular student and started about 3 months before the exam. I think that was the perfect timeline, as I only had about 4 days (8-12 May) where i was studying like a madman. The rest of the time i was comparatively calm about it, and took it progressively. Here's how splitting my time worked, and ways it didnt.

**MONTH 1**

Welcome to the battlefield, soldier! the next 4 weeks will be divided into doing one of 3 tasks possible. 

1. Pre 1450. I cannot stress this as much as possible; DO NOT MEMORIZE DATES AND PEOPLE. THIS IS JUST TO GIVE A BACKGROUND!!(This should only take you about a week; make sure to study the following super duper important historical developments :\[these are changes, events, thoughts, political ideologies, etc that lasted over a period of time and influenced the area a bunch\]
   1. Mesopotamia + early civilizations. They grew plants, they made food, they did a whole lot of stuff. This wont be on the quiz, but it helps to understand how the technological background on the exam content actually came to be
   2. A nice quick Asia rundown. Look at Chinese dynasties, the rise of polytheism in Asia, and the type of culture that emerged. It'll help a lot in the first units
2. Set up the materials. Get your textbook, subscribe to these channels (Heimler's history and all of his goons, khan academy), and get your history pants on because shits about to get SPICY
3. HISTORY WOOO!!! Open the textbook and read it LIKE A BOOK. LIKE A STORY. NO HIGHLIGHTERS, NO PRETTY GEL PENS, JUST YOUR EYES. The idea here is that you skim through it just so you understand what you're dealing with, and so that you can gauge the amount and difficulty of the material you are going to be looking at.

&#x200B;

**MONTH 2**

&#x200B;

By this point, you can start actually studying the material. Here's what a sample week in the ""Leo timeline"" would look like (change this to fit your needs) \[Oh also I divide each unit into 3 sections, things that happened {countries founded, people died, king started war}, developments that happened {trading increased, christianity moved to another continent, printing press led to more literacy rates} and foreshadowing {higher literacy rates because of more printing press WILL lead to an uprise against the church (i know this because i read the book about a month ago)}\]

Mon - Unit 1, developments; unit 1, things

Tue - Unit 1, developments; unit 2 foreshadowing; unit 1 content; unit 2 things

etc.

As you can see, the idea is to make a cascading calendar. Study more than one thing at once, as that will force your brain to tie them together and will lead to less time spent organizing developments.

Keep this going until you get to the end of all the content. Don't worry if you aren't versed in it too well, that'll improve soon.

Keep up with Khan Academy, watch Heimler's after a study session to recap what you learned, and make it fun! Let your future self stress about what grade you'll get, your priority right now is LEARNING!!

&#x200B;

**MONTH THE THIRD**

Here's where things will start to get interesting.... Now, your focus is honing in on the content skills from last month and learning how to take the exam. Your time should be spilt 50/50, where about half of your time is content REVIEW, and the other half is APPLICATION. In the review, keep doing what you were doing, just always getting deeper. OpenStax has a really good World History textbook if you want to be absolutely certain on the content side of things. The Application is tougher, but I found some cool workarounds that worked well for me:

1. ChatGPT. Use it to make questions, train it on the rubric given by the College Board, then make it grade your essays.
2. Remember how i said the CED is your Bible? Here's where that comes in. You should be able to flip (Or, more realistically, scroll) to any page on the CED and talk to yourself for a minimum of 20 minutes about what is written there. If not, more content review. If you can, do the following.
3. Write a MINIMUM of 10 LEQs and 10 DBQs. It seems like a lot, but you need to be able to pump one out in an hour. 20 hours of essay writing is more than enough. Make sure to write by hand to mimic the experience, time yourself, don't let yourself get up or use the book, and make the topics about things you know little about. No use quizzing a frenchman on the french revolution if he's writing an exam on Maori history, is there?

&#x200B;

**THE DAYS APPROACHING THE EXAM** 

Nerves will kick in. So will coffee. LOTS of coffee. So much, in fact, I quit and have not touched a cup since may 13th (1 day after the exam). But I digress.

&#x200B;

Your goal now is to take quizzes, review like hell, and what I believe was the best thing I did for my grade, write.

No, my young padawan, not writing LEQs or DBQs, you did that a while ago. Now, you write a full review of everything that happened of importance IN YOUR OWN WORDS!! Write this in Word. Or a doc. Write it on your arm for all I care. The important this is that you write in a way that makes stupid you from 3 months ago read it and understand what you mean. Because the secret is this. As soon as you step foot in that exam room, you will be the stupid you from 3 months ago. This document will guide you into understanding what you mean with the added bonus of helping exam-day you know the content.

Here's an excerpt from my document:

*""OK SO lets pretend that you're a leader in 13th century China (Song Dynasty, the water clock guys) and a bunch of people in your kingdom start to hate you. You now have to figure out a way to do 2 things. CENTRALIZE and LEGITIMIZE your power (""The power is mine, and this is WHY its mine."") There are some ways you can do this. The 3 most important and also the only ones i can remember at 10:53pm are as follows:*

*Art - If I'm a leader and have STUPID amounts of money I can make people build big, pretty, and useless things for me. Buildings and art are really good examples of this. For example, the Taj Mahal built in the Mughal empire like 200 years after what we're talking about was a way for the emperor to show whos the boss (I have a big castle thing and you dont, L + Ratio.)* 

*Religion - Caliphs, the guys who led Caliphates, considered themselves to be the spiritual and religious descendants of Muhammad, a main Muslim prophet. They consolidated + legitimized their power by basically saying ""Im descendent of Muhammad, you're not, So let me lead you and go farm or whatever."" This tried and true method was used ALL over Afro-Eurasia*

*Im better than you super alpha male mentality - In Song China, if you were to approach the Emperor, you would have to bow down, no shoes, trot, surrounded by 750 eunuchs and talk to emperor guy. This was a way of the emperor showing you whose boss, and making sure that EVERYONE knew whose boss. This meant the power was now his, would always be his, and he could do what he wants with your money.""*

As you can tell my writing style has greatly evolved. 

The point is that you understand not only whats on the test, but also how to write the test.

&#x200B;

**EXAM DAY**

You made it this far, and nothing can stop you now. You know what you need to, and you sit in that chair, stick a sticker and scribble some boxes, and before you know it you're mayor of 5 town (not president of 5landia though, thats reserved for Steve Heimler)

&#x200B;

I hope this ""guide"" helps the new and flourishing students of APWH 2023-2024, and if you have any questions, want tips, have a question about the content, or are just lonely, please reach out. 

Thanks for reading,

Leo

For example, when reading a book, you can ask chatGPT to reword a paragraph into simpler language or modern language, translate stuff, find more examples of a word, explain the word root or etymology. You can also just ask chatgpt to chat with you in the language or correct your language use.

I'd like to know how to do this.

I'm not a programmer but could pay a little money to get help to set up a system for teaching chatGPT the language or something. And the result would need to be accessible to more than just me. My imagination is that to teach it you could just feed it a bunch of texts with translations, plus maybe a dictionary, and it would figure stuff out. Thanks for your input."

16ozvk0,1,2023-09-21,My Letter to the Regents of the University of California,u/famille_4mains,DidntUseAI,https://www.reddit.com/r/DidntUseAI/comments/16ozvk0/my_letter_to_the_regents_of_the_university_of/,"Dear Regents of the University of California,

I am writing you today to warn you against the use of artificial intelligence (AI) detectors in the University of California system.

In February of this year, my brother William Quarterman, a student at UC Davis, was falsely accused of so-called “AI-plagiarism” based on the verdict of an AI detector (Jimenez, 2023). While we were able to prove that he was innocent, the experience was extremely stressful. In the course of my family’s conversations with the UC Davis Office of Student Support and Judicial Affairs (OSSJA), the OSSJA indicated to us that UC Davis would be adopting an AI detector developed and released in April by Turnitin despite our warnings that all AI detectors were nothing more than guesswork. We even directed the Assistant Director of the OSSJA to a study from the University of Maryland proving that AI-detection was not possible (Sadasivan et al., 2023). In April, we were proven right when another student, Louise Stivers, reached out to our family after being falsely accused of AI-plagiarism based on the verdict of Turnitin’s AI detector (Klee, 2023). Unfortunately, despite two articles in national papers about UC Davis’s misuse of AI detectors, and press releases from UCLA, UC Berkeley, and several British universities announcing their decision to opt out of Turnitin’s AI-detection tool (UCLA, 2023; UC Berkeley, 2023; University of Greenwich, 2023), UC Davis has continued to use Turnitin’s AI detector. In fact, the reason I am writing to you now is because my family has been contacted by yet another UC Davis student who is facing suspension for something he did not do.

Originally, Turnitin claimed a 1% false positive rate (Turnitin, 2023). An article in the Washington Post shortly before its release, however, suggested that Turnitin’s AI detector may not be as accurate as it claimed (Fowler, 2023a). And indeed, shortly after its release, Turnitin was forced to acknowledge that its AI detection software actually incorrectly flags more than 4% of human written material as having been generated by AI (Fowler 2023b). 

Since February, I have been testing AI detectors to prove that no AI detector has false positive rates low enough to be acceptable for use in academic or professional settings. Recently, I was finally able to test Turnitin. Unfortunately, I was only able to pass 109 human-written texts by six authors through Turnitin, but unsurprisingly, the false positive rate was higher than the reported 4%: the small corpus I tested generated a false positive rate of just over 10%.

Due to the size of the corpus, I cannot claim that Turnitin’s true false positive rate is over 10%. However, my tests definitively show that false positives are not distributed equally. While some authors were not flagged by Turnitin, other authors were flagged multiple times. In my corpus, neurodivergence (e.g. ADHD, autism, etc.) seemed to be a risk factor that led to higher false positive rates. Other studies suggest that non-native speakers are also more susceptible to false positives (Liang et al., 2023).

And yet, universities in the University of California system are continuing to use AI detectors. Students are becoming paranoid and hyper-vigilant, and those that are falsely accused face extreme stress and potential long-term repercussions. Universities who refer them for academic discipline based on the results of AI detectors are asking students to prove a negative – specifically, that they did not use generative AI. It is so hard to prove a negative that some students may feel coerced into confessing to something they did not do in order to avoid potential harsher discipline.

These false accusations will also not affect people in the same way. My brother was mentally healthy before being falsely accused; during the process, he had several panic attacks but because of the support he had at home, survived the process relatively unscathed. Other students may not have the resources he had (a lawyer for a father, a sister working in AI). First-generation college students, international students, lower income students, and minorities may find it harder to defend themselves than higher income white students. More frighteningly, students with severe mental health issues, especially those experiencing suicidal ideation, may be driven to do something irreparable if they feel they cannot defend against these accusations.

I realize my letter may come off as overly alarmist, but I am genuinely concerned for the students who have to worry about AI-detection on top of the normal stresses of university. I greatly appreciate the leadership shown by UC Berkeley and UCLA in refusing to use Turnitin’s AI detector until its reliability and accuracy can be independently determined and verified.  I am asking you, as the regents of the University of California, to apply this moratorium on AI detectors throughout the University system. For the sake of the well-being of our students, please ban the use of AI detectors, at least until these detectors have been independently vetted (preferably through peer-reviewed replication studies) and demonstrated to have a very low risk of being used to accuse honest students of cheating.

Please impose a moratorium on the use of AI detectors at the University of California.

Sincerely,

Claire Quarterman

16pcbvi,1,2023-09-22,A university disabled Turnitin's AI Detector. How does this bode for the future?,u/XochitlLatham,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/16pcbvi/a_university_disabled_turnitins_ai_detector_how/,"I just came across this [news](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/brightspace/2023/08/16/guidance-on-ai-detection-and-why-were-disabling-turnitins-ai-detector/) about Turnitin's AI detector, and I thought I'd break it down here for everyone. So, this AI tool was supposed to tell how much of a paper was written by AI but it turned out it had many issues of its own. A brief summary:

* **False Alarms:** At first, they said it had only a 1% chance of messing up, but now they're admitting it's more like 4%. So if this tool was around last year, so many student papers would've been wrongly flagged as having AI-written parts. 
* **AI Bias:** It's not very good at telling if a piece of writing is AI-generated or not. Sometimes, it mistakes non-native English speakers' work for AI-written stuff. 
* **Mystery Detection:** Turnitin hasn't been very transparent about how it figures out if something's AI or not. They say it looks for patterns in AI writing, but they won't say what those patterns are. Kind of sketchy.

So, Vanderbilt University decided to turn off this AI detector for now. I’d rather not go into the exams issue, but for a more valid application, I think using AI for research papers is cool as long as one makes sure that they cite the work properly, as that ensures transparency as long as the sources are not made up. ChatGPT does not offer the option to cite sources yet, but I know people using tools like [Silatus](https://research.silatus.com/) and [Trinka](https://www.trinka.ai/) for research and citing. Also, I’m of the opinion AI is here to stay and should be included as a core part of education, with teachers talking to students about AI usage guidelines and fair usage. 

What do you guys think about the future of education with AI around? What should instructors do if they're worried about students using AI to cheat?"

I have just a quick question for everyone that works with ChatGPT frequently and professionaly. As students, we need to find a way to use ChatGPT for creating the perfect prompt for image creation on Midjourney. It needs to be as followed: When writing something to ChatGPT, it needs to create the perfect prompt based on the written message. All the images need to be in the same style. So if I decide to make another prompt the next day with ""create a cake with beautiful colors and a restaurant in the background"" it needs to create the perfect prompt in the same style as every image/prompt. 

So, how do we teach chatgpt in the most effective way to get the same style output everytime but different prompts based on the message?

Guess you won’t know unless you try! What are your thoughts, btw?

1. Use at least one month's $100 to outsource the building of a decent landing page to use in your ads.
2. Google Ads. All $100. Set a daily budget of $3.50. Set the time of day limits to 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Set the location limits to the USA (in your case, it could be your location). Set the demographics to people involved in the industry your tool or product is for. Set the age limit to 22 or higher. Use ChatGPT for generating keywords. Keywords must be that people doing a search would use to find a solution to the problem your product solves. You could sometimes add competitors’ names to the keywords. You need to have at least 2 distinct versions of advertising copy. Bid the lowest amount Google allows.
3. Do not use “display ads”. Do not use software comparison websites like Capterra. If your budget has grown, don’t spend it all on Google Ads, as it may lead to the case described [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/16f4u2z/comment/k04ocn3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) I feel sorry, man, that it went like that for your business.
4. Also, you could try one month of Google Ads evenly split between different campaigns. Try campaigns on FB/IG, TW, Lin, Reddit, and other channels in the coming months. Then go back to the best one and improve.

* Start improving organic search results through SEO (search engine optimization). It’s calculated that rates are higher among people who click on organic search results vs. search ads. But here is a trick: you need to be good at creating content yourself. Below are some additional or specific key points.

1. Create and start running social pages on FB/IG/Twitter/Reddit.
2. Make educational TikToks.
3. Create a LinkedIn profile for yourself, and the company. Start writing articles or posts.
4. Create a value-added mailing list or blog.
5. Make posts that describe your business on [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/), [Kijiji](https://www.kijiji.ca/) and other marketplaces.
6. Create content that's more specific to your product, for high-intent searches (like someone searching for your product category specifically) and educational content for low-intent searches (like someone searching for a problem that could be solved with your product).
7. Get an Adobe subscription and start looking at YouTube tutorials to make advertising assets for yourself for social media and print. You get access to all their digital design tools, their video tools, their print design tools, and even a small amount of stock images. Make flyers. Make stickers. Make social media posts with some style to them. (This point I couldn’t divide into two parts because it's also about direct marketing).
8. Make fun videos, giving away $5 to every person who can answer your question correctly.
9. Start using [Virtual Window Shop](https://virtualwindowshop.com/). That’s the app that shows what's available near the user. It’s not so good for my product, but will be a great tool for others.
10. Start guerilla marketing and play where your competitors aren't. For example, do Reddit astroturfing.
11. Take JSON+LD schema / structured data. Get your search results more enriched by describing the content better for machines to understand. That’s the idea for those who are good at programming.

* Start to use AI tools. Such tools could help you solve almost all tasks in marketing: analytics, creating, posting, optimizing, checking, verifying, and so on and so forth. Most of the tools could be found on  sites like [Futurepedia](https://www.futurepedia.io/). Yet there were mentions of tools like [Jasper](https://www.jasper.ai/) (for creating engaging texts), and [MarketOwl](https://www.marketowl.ai/) (this one creates targeted content and posts it).
* Start doing direct marketing that includes:

1. Send personal messages, call owners, get an [Apollo](https://www.apollo.io/) sub, and send emails.
2. Buy gas and pound the pavement. It means that you go and introduce yourself to as many people in your ideal customer profile as possible. But you must be good at speaking, articulating,  and knowing your project as well as your competitors perfectly, or your potential customers won’t even speak with you.
3. Buy a printer, paper, laminator, and a good stapler and start to make business cards and flyers.
4. Hire a student for $30/day (2hrs of walking) once a week to drop off flyers in targeted segments.
5. Put yard signs where they can be noticed.
6. Rent an ad space on a bench, or whatever it could be, in front of the place where your target audience is.
7. If you already have customers, then you could ask your current customers where they heard about you and advertise there more. (Another piece of advice that could also work for organic search.)

* Do drugs, particularly peyote, lol. That’s the idea I couldn’t agree with, as I’m nerdy and have never done drugs in my life.
* Find business organizations that are in your area, and you might be able to join. Also check out [SCORE](https://www.score.org/) (the largest network of volunteer, expert business mentors who help start your small business) through the [SBA](https://www.sba.gov/) (Small Business Administration).
* Buy table dances and enjoy watching titties. I like the advice a lot, but I guess it will be much better to watch them after you succeed!

I hope it will help guys like me to deal with marketing issues better."

The original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/16f4u2z/i_have_100_monthly_on_marketing_what_should_i/). I learned a lot from your comments and started to read and watch free educational content on marketing. That’s where I learned about general marketing strategies and some ways of applying them.

I feel that I should return the favor to the community and add some more value.

So, at first, for myself I carefully read, analyzed, and organized all the pieces of advice into sections. Here are they with some links to the most valuable and educational comments. And my personal comments on some of the advice I got.

* Spend the $100/month on getting marketing skills and knowledge (workshops, books, video courses, networking functions, YouTube videos, learning how to write sales scripts for your cold outreach calls and meetings, etc.) before you spend a dime on marketing.

1. Send personal messages, call owners, get an Apollo sub, and send emails.
2. Buy gas and pound the pavement. It means that you go and introduce yourself to as many people in your ideal customer profile as possible. But you must be good at speaking, articulating, and knowing your project as well as your competitors perfectly, or your potential customers won’t even speak with you.
3. Buy a printer, paper, laminator, and a good stapler and start to make business cards and flyers.
4. Hire a student for $30/day (2hrs of walking) once a week to drop off flyers in targeted segments.
5. Put yard signs where they can be noticed.
6. Rent an ad space on a bench, or whatever it could be, in front of the place where your target audience is.
7. If you already have customers, then you could ask your current customers where they heard about you and advertise there more. (Another piece of advice that could also work for organic search.)

* Do drugs, particularly peyote, lol. That’s the idea I couldn’t agree with, as I’m nerdy and have never done drugs in my life.
* Find business organizations that are in your area, and you might be able to join. Also check out SCORE (the largest network of volunteer, expert business mentors who help start your small business) through the SBA (Small Business Administration).
* Buy table dances and enjoy watching titties. I like the advice a lot, but I guess it will be much better to watch them after you succeed!

I hope it will help guys like me to deal with marketing issues better."

edited intro:  and it seemed that the Mods and most people here rather focus on me posting this with the help of chatgpt, and more than what my issues are, but if anyone that is informed well to give me advice to this matter. currently still at a WG and they're nice enough to help me stay for sometime. i felt so drained that i have to explain myself hence the situation but i apologize for the mess because i wish i can think straight, as this weight is all over my shoulders

Hey everyone, 

I hope this post finds you well. I find myself at a crossroads in life and could really use some guidance from this supportive community. **A bit about my situation:** 

\- I started my education in an international university when my family was financially comfortable. However, circumstances changed, and I've had to work tirelessly to finance my education and living expenses. hence paycheck to paycheck

\- Public uni and duales studium bachelor is not an option and I'm currently on a gap year to save up and apply to a public university in Germany. But here's the catch - they require proof of financial stability and good future prospects to support oneself. 

\- I've been taking on menial and mini-jobs to make ends meet, but it's becoming increasingly challenging to balance these responsibilities while managing the high cost of my English-language university. also my status currently not being a student, that is hard to find jobs and apply to one.

\- i read somewhere that someone can reapply to ausbildung and other access of studies/work during these times

\- learning German is difficult but i am still studying everyday and taking my time to do it

\-  the expectations and i am not allowed to return back home by family seems to be the most complicated problem for me. i am expected to reach my dream and chase what i should around because i am studying abroad, but it seems like there is no way without money and other important skills needed besides financial. 

**my questions would be:**

 how would it be best for me to proceed? i will be homeless (looked over wohnungloshilfe already, and no friends wanted to keep me around and stay for a bit at their place), i tried checking upon for arbeitlosgeld but i don't think i am even supported in this matter. i am only helped by the bank dispokredit as for now, financially. 

So, I'm reaching out to this community for any insights, tips, or suggestions you may have. Your experiences and advice mean the world to me. Please share your thoughts, and thank you in advance for your support."

16qs74q,1,2023-09-24,Collected all advice I got on tight $100 monthly marketing budget,u/Official-DATS,ecommerce,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/16qs74q/collected_all_advice_i_got_on_tight_100_monthly/,"I’ve recently posted the question on what to do if you have only $100 monthly on marketing and received so many responses and tips. The original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/16f4u2z/i_have_100_monthly_on_marketing_what_should_i/). I learned a lot from your comments and started to read and watch free educational content on marketing. That’s where I learned about general marketing strategies and some ways of applying them.

I feel that I should return the favor to the community and add some more value.

So, at first, for myself I carefully read, analyzed, and organized all the pieces of advice into sections. Here are they with some links to the most valuable and educational comments. And my personal comments on some of the advice I got.

* Spend the $100/month on getting marketing skills and knowledge (workshops, books, video courses, networking functions, YouTube videos, learning how to write sales scripts for your cold outreach calls and meetings, etc.) before you spend a dime on marketing. I'd say that it's the most reasonable advice ever!
* Spend the $100/month on paid ads. Below is a list of particular tips. That [advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/16f4u2z/comment/k007bhi/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) has provoked the most heated argument, and I couldn’t figure out if it is working or not. Guess you won’t know unless you try! What are your thoughts, btw?

1. Use at least one month's $100 to outsource the building of a decent landing page to use in your ads.
2. Google Ads. All $100. Set a daily budget of $3.50. Set the time of day limits to 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Set the location limits to the USA (in your case, it could be your location). Set the demographics to people involved in the industry your tool or product is for. Set the age limit to 22 or higher. Use ChatGPT for generating keywords. Keywords must be that people doing a search would use to find a solution to the problem your product solves. You could sometimes add competitors’ names to the keywords. You need to have at least 2 distinct versions of advertising copy. Bid the lowest amount Google allows.
3. Do not use “display ads”. Do not use software comparison websites like Capterra. If your budget has grown, don’t spend it all on Google Ads, as it may lead to the case described [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/16f4u2z/comment/k04ocn3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). I feel sorry, man, that it went like that for your business.
4. Also, you could try one month of Google Ads evenly split between different campaigns. Try campaigns on FB/IG, TW, Lin, Reddit, and other channels in the coming months. Then go back to the best one and improve.

* Start improving organic search results through SEO (search engine optimization). It’s calculated that rates are higher among people who click on organic search results vs. search ads. But here is a trick: you need to be good at creating content yourself. Below are some additional or specific key points.

1. Create and start running social pages on FB/IG/Twitter/Reddit.
2. Make educational TikToks.
3. Create a LinkedIn profile for yourself, and the company. Start writing articles or posts.
4. Create a value-added mailing list or blog.
5. Make posts that describe your business on [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/), [Kijiji](https://www.kijiji.ca/) and other marketplaces.
6. Create content that's more specific to your product, for high-intent searches (like someone searching for your product category specifically) and educational content for low-intent searches (like someone searching for a problem that could be solved with your product).
7. Get an Adobe subscription and start looking at YouTube tutorials to make advertising assets for yourself for social media and print. You get access to all their digital design tools, their video tools, their print design tools, and even a small amount of stock images. Make flyers. Make stickers. Make social media posts with some style to them. (This point I couldn’t divide into two parts because it's also about direct marketing).
8. Make fun videos, giving away $5 to every person who can answer your question correctly.
9. Start using [Virtual Window Shop](https://virtualwindowshop.com/). That’s the app that shows what's available near the user. It’s not so good for my product, but will be a great tool for others.
10. Start guerilla marketing and play where your competitors aren't. For example, do Reddit astroturfing.
11. Take JSON+LD schema / structured data. Get your search results more enriched by describing the content better for machines to understand. That’s the idea for those who are good at programming.

* Start to use AI tools. Such tools could help you solve almost all tasks in marketing: analytics, creating, posting, optimizing, checking, verifying, and so on and so forth. Most of the tools could be found on sites like [Futurepedia](https://www.futurepedia.io/). Yet there were mentions of tools like [Jasper](https://www.jasper.ai/) (for creating engaging texts), and [MarketOwl](https://www.marketowl.ai/) (this one creates targeted content and posts it).
* Start doing direct marketing that includes:

1. Send personal messages, call owners, get an [Apollo](https://www.apollo.io/) sub, and send emails.
2. Buy gas and pound the pavement. It means that you go and introduce yourself to as many people in your ideal customer profile as possible. But you must be good at speaking, articulating, and knowing your project as well as your competitors perfectly, or your potential customers won’t even speak with you.
3. Buy a printer, paper, laminator, and a good stapler and start to make business cards and flyers.
4. Hire a student for $30/day (2hrs of walking) once a week to drop off flyers in targeted segments.
5. Put yard signs where they can be noticed.
6. Rent an ad space on a bench, or whatever it could be, in front of the place where your target audience is.
7. If you already have customers, then you could ask your current customers where they heard about you and advertise there more. (Another piece of advice that could also work for organic search.)

* Do drugs, particularly peyote, lol. That’s the idea I couldn’t agree with, as I’m nerdy and have never done drugs in my life.
* Find business organizations that are in your area, and you might be able to join. Also check out [SCORE](https://www.score.org/) (the largest network of volunteer, expert business mentors who help start your small business) through the [SBA](https://www.sba.gov/) (Small Business Administration).
* Buy table dances and enjoy watching titties. I like the advice a lot, but I guess it will be much better to watch them after you succeed!

I hope it will help guys like me to deal with marketing issues better. Mods don't ban me, it's not promotional materials :)"
16qtu6q,1,2023-09-24,An AI app for integrating the unfree will perspective,u/Georgeo57,freewill,https://www.reddit.com/r/freewill/comments/16qtu6q/an_ai_app_for_integrating_the_unfree_will/,"Anyone who disbelieves in free will knows that it's one thing to know that free will does not exist and another thing entirely to integrate this knowledge so that one can act on it on a daily basis.

Now imagine an AI app designed to help free will disbelievers with this integration. Through simple, enjoyable, conversations this app would work with users in a way similar to how a math tutor teaches a student math or a language teacher teaches a student a new language.

A very cool thing about this is that today's AIs can be prompted to generate ideas about how these new unfree will integration apps would work. In fact, I just asked ChatGPT-4 about this, and here are some ideas that it came up with:

""You bring up an intriguing point about the divergence between intellectual acknowledgment and everyday integration of a concept as complex as the non-existence of free will. An app designed for this purpose would act as an intermediary, bridging the gap between theoretical understanding and pragmatic application. 

1. **Deconstructing Decision-making**: One key feature would be to analyze the user's daily decisions in a non-judgmental way, attributing them to factors such as environment, upbringing, or genetic predispositions. The goal is not to label decisions as 'good' or 'bad,' but to examine the underlying causal relationships.

2. **Real-time Behavioral Cues**: Employ machine learning to learn a user's behavioral patterns and provide real-time cues. For example, if you typically choose unhealthy foods, the app might remind you that your choice is driven by a predilection shaped by prior experiences, thereby instigating a more deliberate thought process.

3. **Mindfulness Modules**: Incorporate brief, targeted mindfulness exercises. For instance, a module could guide users through identifying and acknowledging the myriad external factors influencing their present emotional state. This serves to detach the self from the illusion of autonomous control.

4. **Philosophical Pillars**: Integrate short but insightful philosophical texts that delve into determinism, existentialism, and other relevant subjects. These can serve as intellectual refreshers that help to solidify the user's understanding.

5. **Community Sharing**: A space for users to share how their day-to-day actions and experiences have been influenced by their belief in determinism. This allows for collective wisdom and mutual support.

6. **Habit Tracker**: Encourage users to log and review their actions and thoughts, but in the context of factors beyond their control. This could induce a sense of detachment, allowing for easier acceptance of life’s vicissitudes.

In essence, this app aims to shift the user's perspective from a narrative of personal agency to a more nuanced understanding that positions them as an intricate part of a grander causal tapestry."""

Artificial Intelligence has come a long way, and one of the latest AI breakthroughs that has captured my attention is ChatGPT. 🤖💬 It's a language model that can engage in human-like conversations, and its potential use cases are truly mind-boggling! Let's dive into some of the exciting possibilities that ChatGPT brings to the table. 💡

🌐 Customer Support Revolutionized:
Imagine a world where waiting on hold for hours is a thing of the past. With ChatGPT, companies can automate their customer support and offer round-the-clock assistance through chatbots that understand natural language. This not only improves customer satisfaction but also allows businesses to handle a vast number of inquiries simultaneously.

🧠 Personalized AI Learning:
Learning has evolved beyond traditional classrooms, and ChatGPT can play a crucial role in personalized education. By leveraging AI, students can have interactive conversations with ChatGPT, getting instant explanations, guidance, and personalized study plans. It opens up new possibilities for self-paced learning tailored to individual needs.

📚 Content Creation Collaboration:
Content creators rejoice! ChatGPT can be your skilled co-writer, offering inspiration, suggesting ideas, and helping you beat the dreaded writer's block. Whether you're crafting a blog post, working on a novel, or creating video scripts, ChatGPT can be your creative partner, enhancing your productivity and helping you unlock your full potential.

📞 Multilingual Communication:
Language barriers are no longer insurmountable obstacles. ChatGPT's multilingual capabilities make it an invaluable tool for international businesses and organizations that require seamless communication across borders. From real-time translation to assisting language learners, ChatGPT helps connect people from different cultures and facilitates global collaboration.

🌍 Tackling Climate Change:
Climate change is one of the defining challenges of our time, and AI can be a powerful ally in finding innovative solutions. With its ability to analyze vast amounts of data and offer insights, ChatGPT can support climate researchers, policymakers, and environmental organizations in developing strategies, predicting weather patterns, and driving sustainable practices.

The potential of ChatGPT and AI in general is immense, but it's important for us to approach it ethically and responsibly. While AI offers exciting opportunities, we must also consider potential biases, privacy concerns, and the impact on job markets. By understanding and addressing these issues, we can use ChatGPT to empower and augment human capabilities rather than replace them.

So, let's embrace the future that AI brings while ensuring it aligns with our core values and goals. Let's explore the vast potential of ChatGPT together, pushing the boundaries of what's possible, and creating a world where technology truly serves humanity. 🌟💪

I feel really lost in my PreCalc class. Ive only been scraping by with the help of students in our class, or unfortunately using chatGPT.

I know it's not accurate, but I feel like I'm cheating myself. I'm trying to use it as a learning resource, and I only use it for homework or to review.

I want to go to tutoring, as stupid as it sounds it brings me a great deal of extreme anxiety.

I am going to talk to my professor about my performance and me scraping by because of chatGPT / students helping me.

Was what I did unacceptable?"

I switched to Information Systems, but I had to retake some business core classes (accounting mainly) because, again, I wasn’t a good student and couldn’t force myself to work on courses I had zero interest in. 

Eventually I got screwed because I ended up with 150+ attempted credits (which includes retakes, F’s, and withdrawn courses) and couldn’t go back to school another year without racking up massive debt to complete my degree, so the only way I could leave with a degree before that happened was to declare Spanish as my major (it was previously my minor)  and Business as my minor, and finish those requirements within a semester. I graduated right when the pandemic hit so it took over a year to find work. 

I worked as a functional business analyst for a year, learned a good amount of SQL and relational databases but otherwise hated that job. I only liked the database portions. 

I managed to get a really, really, *really* entry level software developer job but it was basically a body shop and I quit 8 months in because the workplace was **HORRIBLE** with 50-80 hour weeks + weekends and my mental health was on a steep decline. I learned a bit of database development and really surface-level .Net programming. 

Now I’m just doing some easy low-paying data annotation job that I’ve partially automated with python and selenium (which I could only do with the help of Stack Overflow and ChatGPT) and going back to school at a local community college to finish math prerequisites — namely Cal 1, Cal 2, and Linear Algebra — in hopes of getting into one of those online MSCS or MCIT masters programs that don’t require having a STEM Bachelor’s degree. 

I’m just at a point where I don’t even know what I should be doing… 
* Is it even worth it to get a Master’s
* I can’t qualify for a single entry-level tech job in today’s market
* I really shot myself in the foot educationally.
* Are there even any internships/apprenticeships that require little-to-no experience? 
* Any companies that train new hires from the ground up? 
* My resume is abysmal and I have very little IT/Software Dev experience despite my work history.  

I’m trying to do school work and learn from free resources online but it’s so hard for me to focus with those resources that I feel like I’m stuck in tutorial hell and not getting any better"

As a former student of alien language and linguistic I could at least talk about a lot of things on language learning and specific sub domain of languages such as syntax(better knowns as grammar) or semantics, phonology or phonetics.  

My after life after the study of foreign language has been computer science and recently AI. Recent emerging of large Scale language(LLM) AI model such as chatGPT attracts a little more interests in Language and  Linguistics but not that much.

However howling on how to learn Korean easy and fast is becoming immense. What a silly howling!  As the ChatGPT and other AI technology technology progresses there would be no language barriers very shortly.    

But with this technology advance, why am I complaining about Korean study or Korean linguistics underdeveloped? 

Newly released Korean base LLM known as HyperCLOVA X of Naver turned out to be mundane and this hampered their stock price at KRX and this is all predictable.

In order to achive better Korean LLM they should have invested a lot to Korean language study long before but they gathered their LLM team recently and may be copied the ""dataset"" and training procedure of other LLM AI Models. 

But the LLM AI model's core asset is the corpus(말뭉치) of the language  and it is now only vital to LLM but also to NLP(Natural Language Processing 자연어처리) 

Some telecom company SK invented to NLP capability (so claimed) human voice speaker and promote it to be install at your home to eavesdropping everything what your and your families talk. 

Labeling every corpus is another level. Currently used Korea corpus labeling  is the the product of single professor's long time dedication to labeling the Korean corpus with his personal lab staffs at some local no-name university. Used to remember them but now forgotten. Probably at Busan National University. 

Besides this, a lot of sub domains of Korean language is still primitive compared to others languages and linguistics because of rampant colonialism amongst Korean language scholars.  

Any way I will stop here because it is getting like Christian bible and this will also get nowhere.

In order to achieve better Korean LLM they should have invested a lot to Korean language study long before but they gathered their LLM team recently and may be copied the ""dataset"" and training procedure of other LLM AI Models. 

But the LLM AI model's core asset is the corpus(말뭉치) of the language  and it is now only vital to LLM but also to NLP(Natural Language Processing 자연어처리) 

Some telecom company SK invented to NLP capability (so claimed) human voice speaker and promote it to be install at your home to eavesdropping everything what your and your families talk. 

Labeling every corpus is another level. Currently used Korea corpus labeling  is the the product of single professor's long time dedication to labeling the Korean corpus with his personal lab staffs at some local no-name university. Used to remember them but now forgotten. Probably at Busan National University. 

Besides this, a lot of sub domains of Korean language is still primitive compared to others languages and linguistics because of rampant colonialism amongst Korean language scholars.  

Any way I will stop here because it is getting like Christian bible and this will also get nowhere.

16sh3uw,1,2023-09-26,How to be the Top 5% in University: Sharing my journey,u/growthnerd,Indian_Academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indian_Academia/comments/16sh3uw/how_to_be_the_top_5_in_university_sharing_my/,"Before college, I was an average student - I’d barely get by my courses and even fail some. Now in college, I scored a **CGPA of 4.78/5.00** and a **Dean’s List placing (Top 5%)** at a Top 5 University in Asia.

How?! 

By identifying and practising effective study tips that suited my behaviour and needs. But “effective study tips” is a huge bucket with a million micro-skills and habits. Below, I’ll distil this 1 huge bucket into my top 10 study habits that worked most effectively for me, and how you can apply these into your own study routine.  
**1. Use Multiple Learning Resources**: Use tools including textbooks, videos, and even podcasts to facilitate your learning.

Using different learning resources help you reinforce your understanding by internalising the material from different angles. It also helps make learning more enjoyable. For example, if I watched a video outlining real-life examples of Economics, I could better appreciate how Economic theory applies in the real world, and better retain the information.

Some resources you can use include:  
\* Text Resources - Lecture notes, Textbooks  
\* Video Resources - YouTube, Lecture videos  
\* Audio Resources - Podcasts  
…or make your own observations and examples in real life!  
**2. Study in Groups, but Stay Focused**: 

Leverage more brains to boost your retention output.  
One approach to maximise your retention (your productivity output as a student) would be to leverage on more focused brains as input. I’d watched a MrBeast video sharing how a small group working on learning/mastering YouTube video creation will surely outperform an individual on the same journey. This applies to studying too.  
One caveat here is that your study group should be hyper focused - everyone should be studying the same material/chapter with little to no distractions over an extended time period. A group of students gathered together but studying different material could potentially lead to distractions. Someone could ask a question unrelated to what you’re studying, and thus disrupt your flow state.  
**3. Ask Smart Questions**: Ask questions that cannot be directly found on Google or ChatGPT. Studying smart means using class time to clarify any questions about the material. To maximise study effectiveness, these questions should be focused, specific to the lecture material, and should not be directly found on Google or ChatGPT. 

For example, a smart question could be “For question 1, why did the professor suggest finding A then B, instead of taking the shortcut option C?”

To truly maximise studying efficiency, the first step to seek help would be to Google (or ChatGPT) possible answers to your questions first, instead of emailing the professor or waiting for the lecture day/time to arrive before asking the question. Seeking immediate help on your own cuts down time spent waiting for a reply. Your brain will also be focused on the task at hand, thus helping you retain the knowledge better when you do get the answer.  
**4. Eliminate Distractions:** Remove activities that take you further from your goal.  
To maximise study effectiveness, you must remove distractions. They are activities that take you further from your goal. Beyond usual culprits like spending too long on social media, distractions can include:  
\* Spending too much time planning your schedule instead of executing  
\* Studying with the wrong group of friends  
\* Having too many irrelevant browser tabs open  
To eliminate distractions, some tips I’ve found helpful include:  
\* Being in the right (conducive) environment - This is huge for me.  
\* Use focus apps like Forest to help you reduce screen time and gamify your study sessions.  
\* Working in shorter bursts and taking breaks in between.  
**5. Take care of your health**: Be mindful of your diet, sleep, exercise and mental health.  
Your effectiveness and productivity is correlated with your energy. Your energy is influenced by other factors beyond study hacks, including your diet, sleep, exercise and mental health. To maximise your effectiveness and productivity, ensure you get enough of each.  
**6. Understand yourself**: Know what works for you, and what energises or drains you. Then optimise your life around it. How?

For me, I find watching pre-recorded lectures a passive task, so I only watch them in the afternoon/at night. I focus on active tasks in the day, such as active recall or writing essays. I also only take meetings in the afternoon or evening.  
To understand yourself, ask yourself these questions:  
\* When am I the most alert? When do I process information fastest?  
\* What tasks do I find exciting? → Do this in the morning.  
\* What tasks require the most mental power to do? → Do this in the morning.  
\* What tasks do I find draining and exhausting? → Push to afternoon/evening.  
\* What information do I recall most effectively? How did I learn this information? → This signals learning techniques that work best for you.  
\* Where am I the most focused? Where do I do my best work?  
**7. Begin with the end in mind**: Understand what you are working towards, before planning how to get there. How?

At the start of every Semester, I would write down all the assignments and their estimated deadlines in my calendar. To get these deadlines, I either turn to the Course Outline or email the Professors directly.  
Also before starting each assignment, I will take a screenshot of the grading rubric and add it to the start of each document. This acts as my North Star. It gives me a clearer idea of what the Professor will be looking out for when grading my work.  
**8. Set internal benchmarks**: Use benchmarks as short-term KPIs you must hit, and be disciplined enough to follow through. How?  
Benchmarks are short-term, internal goals that keep me in line as I progress towards my bigger goals.  
For example, I make sure I internalise each week's material (and their nuances) by the end of the week. Avoid spillover to the next week, so that my backlog won’t snowball.  
When writing essays, I also try to get the first draft out at least 2 weeks before the final deadline, so I have time to expand and edit it.  
**9. Revise by doing, not rote memorising**: Understand the material through active learning. How?  
For theoretical material, practise Active Recall (https://blog.alexanderfyoung.com/active-recall-study-technique/) over mindless rote memorising.  
For practical material like essays or case-based projects, write the material in your own words. Writing the material in your own words help you identify your knowledge gaps and blind spots.  
**10. Be consistent**: Practise the techniques above regularly. How?  
To me, consistency is sticking to a system over a period of time. I stick to a study schedule and system using Google Calendar, Notion and Google Drive.  
To create my study schedule, I set blocks of protected time on Google Calendar. I admit I might not religiously follow my calendar to the minute, but it gives me a sense of my priorities for the day and how I spend my time. To track my progress, I use Notion. I have a daily to-do list on Notion, and my list of deadlines is pinned at the top of my Notion tracker. To write my notes, I use Google Drive as a default.

16so2yx,1,2023-09-26,My thoughts on ChatGpt & Tech as A Parent and Education Intrested Individual.,u/Tairlana,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/16so2yx/my_thoughts_on_chatgpt_tech_as_a_parent_and/,"You know I might be a bit Spicy here, I actually don't think Chatgpt is that bad of a thing, Neither are phones, or any Tech Really. They are tools, and tools should be learned and used. The problem I'm seeing most of the time with these rants, are that its always the tech, its always the children, I acutally think think its just problem on everyone's part Teachers, Parents, Children, and so on. How are they going to know where stuff is for a computer program if no one bothered to ask them why they think we requested that for them in the first place.  Of course I'm not going to remember how to sew a button if rarely have the need to practice it, this is an example of course. However, its assumed that I should know it as a ""Life Skill"".
Sure they might not want to pay attention to the 30 minutes of Instructions, but have we ever stopped to wonder why its such a Struggles bus? Can it truly fully be the fault of the Children or the Tech, and if it is why is it so Common? In truth I have to ask, why do most of us even know and even regale tales of times Teachers are boring, that we don't want to do the lesson, that we'll never use a subject, and thus writing it off from the front of our mind. Cause I'll be damned if any(many) of you (Excluding Social Studies/Governmental Teachers) could tell me why the industrial revolution occurred and its effects (Or who even started it for that matter.). 

I think Instead, when a student uses Wikipedia, or Chatgpt we should  Question *Them* if *They* think the answer is correct and *Why* trust the answer that they gave. If they say something along the lines of I don't know, then wouldn't it be prudent to take the time to show the supposed student the method of discerning the correct answer? Teach them one of the most important lessons there is to life, that being the ""lesson of learning how to learn"". The phrase I hear from so many other individuals say they don't know how to do, maybe even some of you don't know it. However, that's okay I'm thank you for reading my Ted talk and have a wonderful day.

P.S: I will like to preface this and say if there is any weird wording and or spelling please forgive me, as my ADHD makes typing my thoughts down quite difficult at times. As well I will mention with ADHD, telling a student to search for something doesn't always help. 

""Finding answers is easy, finding the right questions is harder."""
16sp1by,1,2023-09-26,I Am Cheating My Way Through High School,u/altaccountsnow,confessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/16sp1by/i_am_cheating_my_way_through_high_school/,"
I Am Cheating My Entire Way Through High School

I (17) am a junior in high school. The first quarter is almost done, and I have cheated my entire way through it.

For background, I am online schooled. It is very easy to look up answers now and then, but it is also easy to use a quickly wide-spreading tool known as AI. 

It started out with just copy and pasting entire multiple choice assignments, quizzes, and tests into the AI. I simply just fed it the information, and it would spit out the answers. (It is only right about 97% of the time, but it works in my favor because it makes it more believable that some answers I will get are wrong.) Let me clarify, I didn’t do this for every single assignment and assessment. But most of the time, I did, especially in my social studies classes. 

But then, I started doing it with my essays. I am in no way using this as an excuse, but I suffer from chronic depression, along with other mental issues, so I get burnt out easily. This was just another incentive to start cheating on things to maintain my sanity. I’ve always struggled with school when it comes to my mental health.

You’re probably wondering how I haven’t gotten caught yet. Well, I don’t just copy and paste entire essays into the AI; fully plagiarizing the work.

First, I of course give the AI the prompt. I copy what it spits out and work on it some, adding bits and pieces of my own information that I’ve learned throughout the course, maybe also then looking up other pieces of information to add. 

Then, just to be extra cautious, I not only run it through a plagiarism checker, I run it through a program that helps you avoid plagiarism by changing entire words to synonyms or otherwise related words. It even does it to entire phrases sometimes.

Another helpful bit of information that makes the validity of my assignments seem more comprehensible is the fact that I have always scored better than my peers when it comes to literacy. In seventh grade, my literacy levels were better than most 40 year olds. So it’s no surprise when teachers see a well-crafted essay coming in from me.

Getting back to the topic at hand, if I had to guess, this results in about 50-60% (depending on the class, prompt, etc.) of my essays being original. ChatGPT writes the base for me and I work off of that.

Phrasing it like that kind of makes me feel a little better. But in a way, I still feel like I’m cheating myself. Do I feel that these classes that I am currently taking have useful material that I will someday use? Maybe one. (I only take a couple of classes, way less than most high school students.) Am I scared I will get caught? Yes and no. I feel like since there is no way they can use a plagiarism checker on my assignments, they won’t find out. But when you’re guilty of something you always feel like you may have a chance of getting caught. 

It may sound like bullshit, but I am still learning, even if it’s not in an the way I am supposed to. I’m a big advocate for reconstructing the education system as it is, anyway, because I feel our schools cheat us of a rich, fulfilling school experience. So I think of it as an eye for an eye situation, almost. 

But, at the end of the day, reworking my essays means I reread it about ten times and I eventually still retain the material we were learning.

Closing this off, what are your thoughts? Do you feel like my what I am doing is unjustified? Do you think I’ll get caught? I would love to hear your opinions."
16sxs0b,1,2023-09-26,Most used characters in the Book of Serenity,u/dota2nub,zen,https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/16sxs0b/most_used_characters_in_the_book_of_serenity/,"I was asked to provide a frequency analysis of the most used characters in the Book of Serenity. I have a top 100 list if anyone wants it, here's the top 10:

不: 2213
云: 1647
一: 1099
道: 1063
有: 937
是: 929
人: 912
無: 863
山: 819
也: 757

That's probably mostly filler words, so let's feed the top 100 to ChatGPT, let it filter out the duds and see what top 10 we're left with, with some explanation so it's actually useful for english speakers: 

>道 (dào): 1063 times

>Meaning: The Way or path. In Taoism, it refers to the underlying natural order of the universe.

>Implication: Given that Zen has been influenced by Taoism, the frequent use of this character likely represents the ongoing search for understanding or realization of the ultimate truth or way.

>不 (bù): 2213 times

>Meaning: Not; no; negative.

>Implication: This character's frequency might underscore Zen's emphasis on negation, questioning assumptions, or the idea of non-attachment.

>云 (yún): 1647 times

>Meaning: To say; cloud.

>Implication: It's often used in Zen writings to denote a master's response or statement. Its frequent use indicates many direct teachings or exchanges between master and student.

>無 (wú): 863 times

>Meaning: Without; not have; there is not.

>Implication: Central to Zen thought, it embodies the idea of emptiness or the absence of inherent existence in phenomena.

>人 (rén): 912 times

>Meaning: Person; man; people.

>Implication: Human existence and the human condition are likely central themes in the text.

>心 (xīn): 255 times

>Meaning: Heart; mind; intention.

>Implication: The heart/mind is central to Zen practice, with emphasis on understanding one's own mind and nature.
>佛 (fó): 308 times

>Meaning: Buddha.

>Implication: As a foundational figure in Buddhism, the Buddha's teachings and legacy are frequently referenced.

>法 (fǎ): 376 times

>Meaning: Dharma; method; law.

>Implication: Represents Buddhist teachings, the truth, or the methods of practice.
>師 (shī): 698 times

>Meaning: Teacher or master.

>Implication: Indicates the importance of the teacher-student relationship in Zen tradition.

>問 (wèn): 553 times

>Meaning: To ask; question.

>Implication: Questioning and inquiry are essential aspects of Zen practice. The tradition emphasizes direct experience, and questioning facilitates this process.

>These characters and their frequencies hint at a text deeply concerned with the nature of existence, the path to realization, and the relationship between teachers and students. The prominence of characters related to questioning and the mind also underscores Zen's emphasis on introspection and direct experience.

It appears that ChatGPT is not good at counting. It just picked the ones it liked. Forcing its hand, this is a top 20:

If you want anything more done with this kind of frequency analysis, give me a shout. 

As for what I get out of it, the frequency of these characters certainly conveys the presence of very specific themes really well. I didn't think it would be quite this poignant."
16sy6dr,1,2023-09-26,Most used characters in the Blue Cliff Record,u/dota2nub,zen,https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/16sy6dr/most_used_characters_in_the_blue_cliff_record/,"I was asked to provide a frequency analysis of the most used characters in the Blue Cliff Record. I have a top 100 list if anyone wants it, here's the top 10:

1. 不: 2941

2. 是: 2336

3. 云: 1921

4. 一: 1862

5. 道: 1858

6. 麼: 1730

7. 人: 1658

8. 得: 1380

9. 有: 1364

10. 也: 1293

That's probably mostly filler words, so let's feed the top 100 to ChatGPT, let it filter out the duds and see what top 10 we're left with, with some explanation so it's actually useful for english speakers:

>不 (2941): This character means ""not"" or ""no"". It's a basic negation in Chinese. The high frequency of this character might indicate a frequent discussion or questioning of established concepts, typical of Zen dialogues where teachers often challenge students' assumptions or understandings.

>是 (2336): This character means ""is"" or ""to be"". In the context of Zen writings, discussions about the nature of reality, being, and existence are common, so this frequency is unsurprising.

>道 (1858): Literally ""way"" or ""path"", but also refers to the Dao or the fundamental nature of existence in Daoism and by extension in many Chinese Buddhist texts. Its frequent use might imply a lot of discussions about the 'way' of Zen or the nature of enlightenment.

>人 (1658): Meaning ""person"" or ""man"". This might suggest a focus on the individual's experience or journey in the spiritual path.

>無 (959): Meaning ""nothing"" or ""none"". In Zen, the concept of emptiness is crucial. The frequent mention could be referencing the Buddhist concept of emptiness or the Zen emphasis on the idea of ""nothingness"".

>僧 (851): This means ""monk"". Given that the Blue Cliff Record is a collection of Zen koans, it makes sense that monks, who are often participants in these dialogues, are frequently mentioned.

>見 (892): Meaning ""to see"" or ""view"". This might be related to insights, realizations, or perspectives which are crucial in Zen teachings.

>佛 (403): Meaning ""Buddha"". It's not surprising to see this in a Zen text. It might refer not just to the historical Buddha, but also the Buddha-nature or enlightened nature within all beings.

>法 (354): Translates to ""dharma"" or ""law"". In the context of Buddhism, it often refers to the teachings or the truth of the universe.

>意 (316): Meaning ""mind"" or ""intention"". The mind is central to many Buddhist teachings, particularly in Zen where the nature of mind and consciousness are frequently explored.

This time it's almost in order, but again, that's just ChatGPT picking whatever it likes. Forcing its hand, this is the top 20:

>不 (2941): ""Not"" or ""no"". A fundamental negation in Chinese, often used to question or challenge established concepts.

>是 (2336): ""Is"" or ""to be"". Central to discussions about the nature of reality and existence.

>云 (1921): Often means ""to say"" or ""said"". Commonly used in Zen koans to indicate dialogue or narration.

>一 (1862): ""One"". Could imply unity, singularity, or primary focus, fundamental in Zen and other Eastern philosophies.

>道 (1858): ""Way"" or ""path"". Refers to the Dao or the fundamental nature of existence in Daoism and in many Chinese Buddhist contexts.

>麼 (1730): Often used as a question particle or to emphasize detail, suggesting probing inquiry or examination.

>人 (1658): ""Person"" or ""man"". Indicates discussions focused on the individual's spiritual experience or journey.

>得 (1380): ""To get"" or ""obtain"". Could relate to achieving understanding or enlightenment.

>有 (1364): ""Have"" or ""exist"". Discussions around existence, being, and materiality are central in Buddhist philosophy.

>也 (1293): A modal particle often used for emphasis or affirmation. Common in classical Chinese texts.

<如 (1053): ""Like"" or ""as"". Often used in similes or metaphors, indicating comparative discussions or teachings.

>無 (959): ""Nothing"" or ""none"". References the Buddhist concept of emptiness or the Zen idea of ""nothingness"".

>處 (956): ""Place"" or ""location"". Might indicate discussions about meditation places, or metaphorically, states of mind.

>他 (955): ""He"" or ""other"". Could indicate dialogues or discussions about others' experiences or teachings.

>作 (938): ""To do"" or ""make"". Indicates actions, efforts, or engagements, potentially in spiritual practices.

>見 (892): ""To see"" or ""view"". Related to insights, realizations, or perspectives.

>這 (865): ""This"" or ""these"". Demonstrative pronoun pointing to specific instances, teachings, or objects.

>僧 (851): ""Monk"". Given the text's nature, this indicates the frequent involvement of monks in the dialogues.

>若 (849): ""If"" or ""like"". Often used in hypotheticals or comparisons, suggesting contemplative scenarios or teachings.

>什 (828): Often part of the word ""什麼"" which means ""what"", indicating questions or inquiries.

Interesting that the same to have and have not distinction shows up here again. I'm not even gonna look it up and I'll instead make someone disprove me, but I think those are probably gonna be the same the same words used for the dog's Buddha nature in the famous Zhaozhou case. That's pretty cool, no?"

16t4miu,1,2023-09-26,Working with students who obviously used AI to generate their work: What do you do?,u/AvailableThank,tutordotcom,https://www.reddit.com/r/tutordotcom/comments/16t4miu/working_with_students_who_obviously_used_ai_to/,"I'm by no means an AI expert, but I play around with ChatGPT a lot, so I'm familiar with how it writes. I just did an async college essay writing session where it really seemed to me that the student used ChatGPT or some other generative AI to write a discussion post. I looked at papers from their past sessions in the session notes, and their writing style was outrageously different on these past sessions. Moreover, the original document to review for this session had an editing time of 4 minutes. 

From my understanding, it's extremely difficult to know with absolute certainty that a paper was made by AI, so there's no use in saying a student violated the honor code. 

So, what do you do here? It feels like a huge waste of time and energy to be putting in more work than the student is, and I doubt someone using ChatGPT even puts much thought towards feedback from a tutor. However, if you put in minimum effort on giving feedback, you're going to hear about it from your mentor and quality specialist. If you end the session and say the student violated the honor code for using AI, you're going to be called crazy. 

Given how AI is just growing like moss on a stone in education, I'm surprised to find basically no discourse on this topic from tutordotcom. 

I'm also curious to hear people's experience with this in subjects outside of writing, such as math and computer science. "

**Concentrate on the pros and cons of ChatGPT (AI-Language Model).** 

A tool based on Artificial intelligence, which is involved in providing answers to every question. It was earmarked to reduce the time to find answers to any concerned query. Consider a look at the other side of the coin, where the same tool is affecting the organizations that provide a facility for web browsing, or numerous jobs are in jeopardy. Delve into the discussion to know all its pros and cons so you have a crux of using ChatGPT; 

**What is ChatGPT?**

The technology is accelerating by leaps and bounds, and the ChatGPT is the consequence. It is a text-based AI tool in which a human can interact conversationally or ask any topic or question and gain satisfactory answers. ChatGPT is set apart from all the conventional methods like SEO (Search Engine Optimisation). 

**Advantages of ChatGPT.** 

&#x200B;

[Advantages and Disadvantages of ChatGPT](https://preview.redd.it/2ws26yfncqqb1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3fc8baad64d5cd49b3a259ab3b1c660131eae874)

The tool is involved in gaining information from across the sectors, thus making it essential. Get a detailed outlook on the [**Advantages of ChatGPT**](https://www.careerera.com/blog/what-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-chatgpt):

* **Accurate search results**— Once you look for any information and ask for it on ChatGPT, you will view all the authentic or accurate search results that are of complete use. 
* **Free Access**— The tool is available for everyone and can be accessed at no additional cost. Anyone, for example, working professionals, students, teachers, businesses, etc., can take advantage of the tool. 
* **Instant outcomes**— Within a second or two, you will find the results immediately. This reduces the time frame you usually incur while searching on the Internet or web browser. 
* **Efficient data**— The information that comes out is most times efficient can can help all the students in college, schools, business sectors, etc., in many ways to score well in their classes. 
* **Blogs/articles**— You can also write your query on any topic and ask the tool to write an essay or a blog for your dedicated use. The results will be out in seconds. 
* **Helps in Interviews**— Many aspirants lack when any organization asks to provide a “Statement of Purpose/intent, etc.,” to submit to continue the interview process. You can take a relevant example from the same platform. 

**Disadvantages of ChatGPT.** 

* **Incomprehensible texts**— The biggest cons of ChatGPT is primarily considered to be producing content that may sometimes be critical to comprehend. This leads to the spread of misinformation. 
* **Limited information**— This tool is developed based on training and collective information from various sources. Hence making it a platform of little details. And with this, the results may seem biased, inaccurate, etc. 
* **No multitasking ability exists**— ChatGPT, which was earmarked under Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, cannot provide two answers at a time to 2 questions. Thus making the system a bit slow. 
* **Lacks expression**— The ChatGPT can produce artistic content but lacks words and emotions. The content will not connect with the reader. 
* **No insights**— The search results will not carry any insights that help scholars, writers, students, etc., to prepare their work. However, on the other hand, insights will be given if the work is done via humans. 
* **Ethical concerns**— It is seen that many universities have banned the use of ChatGPT as it is vanishing the research-analytical approach of students, which is affecting their overall development. Dependency is increasing on the same AI tool. 

**Does ChatGPT generate helpful content?**

The concerned tool is developed on AI and Machine Learning, with which the information received on ChatGPT is useful. On the other hand, it is also seen that incomprehensible and biased content is generated via the same tool. It is suggested to cross-check all the results drawn out of the platform for better efficiency. 

Once you delve into the discussion, you will learn about ChatGPT and its pros and cons to help you in the long run. Having insight into both sides is crucial because, based on that, you can limit or expand the use of this AI Tool. "

Now in college, I scored a **CGPA of 4.78/5.00** and a **Dean’s List placing (Top 5%)** at a Top 5 University in Asia.

How?!

By identifying and practising effective study tips that suited my behaviour and needs. But “effective study tips” is a huge bucket with a million micro-skills and habits. Below, I’ll distil this 1 huge bucket into my top 10 study habits that worked most effectively for me, and how you can apply these into your own study routine.

**1. Use Multiple Learning Resources**: Use tools including textbooks, videos, and even podcasts to facilitate your learning.

Using different learning resources help you reinforce your understanding by internalising the material from different angles. It also helps make learning more enjoyable. For example, if I watched a video outlining real-life examples of Economics, I could better appreciate how Economic theory applies in the real world, and better retain the information.

Some resources you can use include:

\* Text Resources - Lecture notes, Textbooks  
\* Video Resources - YouTube, Lecture videos  
\* Audio Resources - Podcasts  
...or make your own observations and examples in real life!

**2. Study in Groups, but Stay Focused**:

Leverage more brains to boost your retention output.One approach to maximise your retention (your productivity output as a student) would be to leverage on more focused brains as input. I’d watched a MrBeast video sharing how a small group working on learning/mastering YouTube video creation will surely outperform an individual on the same journey. This applies to studying too. One caveat here is that your study group should be hyper focused - everyone should be studying the same material/chapter with little to no distractions over an extended time period. A group of students gathered together but studying different material could potentially lead to distractions. Someone could ask a question unrelated to what you’re studying, and thus disrupt your flow state.

**3. Ask Smart Questions**: Ask questions that cannot be directly found on Google or ChatGPT. Studying smart means using class time to clarify any questions about the material. To maximise study effectiveness, these questions should be focused, specific to the lecture material, and should not be directly found on Google or ChatGPT.

For example, a smart question could be “For question 1, why did the professor suggest finding A then B, instead of taking the shortcut option C?”

To truly maximise studying efficiency, the first step to seek help would be to Google (or ChatGPT) possible answers to your questions first, instead of emailing the professor or waiting for the lecture day/time to arrive before asking the question. Seeking immediate help on your own cuts down time spent waiting for a reply. Your brain will also be focused on the task at hand, thus helping you retain the knowledge better when you do get the answer.

**4. Eliminate Distractions:** Remove activities that take you further from your goal.To maximise study effectiveness, you must remove distractions. They are activities that take you further from your goal. Beyond usual culprits like spending too long on social media, distractions can include:  
\* Spending too much time planning your schedule instead of executing  
\* Studying with the wrong group of friends  
\* Having too many irrelevant browser tabs openTo eliminate distractions, some tips I’ve found helpful include:  
\* Being in the right (conducive) environment - This is huge for me.  
\* Use focus apps like Forest to help you reduce screen time and gamify your study sessions.  
\* Working in shorter bursts and taking breaks in between.

**5. Take care of your health**: Be mindful of your diet, sleep, exercise and mental health.Your effectiveness and productivity is correlated with your energy. Your energy is influenced by other factors beyond study hacks, including your diet, sleep, exercise and mental health. To maximise your effectiveness and productivity, ensure you get enough of each.

**6. Understand yourself**: Know what works for you, and what energises or drains you. Then optimise your life around it. How?

For me, I find watching pre-recorded lectures a passive task, so I only watch them in the afternoon/at night. I focus on active tasks in the day, such as active recall or writing essays. I also only take meetings in the afternoon or evening.To understand yourself, ask yourself these questions:  
\* When am I the most alert? When do I process information fastest?  
\* What tasks do I find exciting? → Do this in the morning.  
\* What tasks require the most mental power to do? → Do this in the morning.  
\* What tasks do I find draining and exhausting? → Push to afternoon/evening.  
\* What information do I recall most effectively? How did I learn this information? → This signals learning techniques that work best for you.  
\* Where am I the most focused? Where do I do my best work?

**7. Begin with the end in mind**: Understand what you are working towards, before planning how to get there. How?

At the start of every Semester, I would write down all the assignments and their estimated deadlines in my calendar. To get these deadlines, I either turn to the Course Outline or email the Professors directly.Also before starting each assignment, I will take a screenshot of the grading rubric and add it to the start of each document. This acts as my North Star. It gives me a clearer idea of what the Professor will be looking out for when grading my work.

**8. Set internal benchmarks**: Use benchmarks as short-term KPIs you must hit, and be disciplined enough to follow through. How?Benchmarks are short-term, internal goals that keep me in line as I progress towards my bigger goals.For example, I make sure I internalise each week's material (and their nuances) by the end of the week. Avoid spillover to the next week, so that my backlog won’t snowball.When writing essays, I also try to get the first draft out at least 2 weeks before the final deadline, so I have time to expand and edit it.

**9. Revise by doing, not rote memorising**: Understand the material through active learning. How? For theoretical material, practise [Active Recall](https://blog.alexanderfyoung.com/active-recall-study-technique/) over mindless rote memorising.For practical material like essays or case-based projects, write the material in your own words. Writing the material in your own words help you identify your knowledge gaps and blind spots.

**10. Be consistent**: Practise the techniques above regularly. How?To me, consistency is sticking to a system over a period of time. I stick to a study schedule and system using Google Calendar, Notion and Google Drive.To create my study schedule, I set blocks of protected time on Google Calendar. I admit I might not religiously follow my calendar to the minute, but it gives me a sense of my priorities for the day and how I spend my time. To track my progress, I use Notion. I have a daily to-do list on Notion, and my list of deadlines is pinned at the top of my Notion tracker. To write my notes, I use Google Drive as a default.

16tfpbm,1,2023-09-27,Cheated my to finally land a job. No regrets!!,u/Weary-Bodybuilder126,recruitinghell,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/16tfpbm/cheated_my_to_finally_land_a_job_no_regrets/,"I really don't know how to express my feelings right now but I'm going to confess how I lie my way to a six-figure job in big tech without any relevant experience. Relying entirely on AI. 

First, we dive into my roller coaster journey. Let's set the stage. Fresh out of college, I was drowning under a mountain of student loans to the tune of 200 K And if that wasn't intimidating enough, for three long, dreary months post-graduation, my job search turned up zilch. The grim verdict. No experience, no entry with bills looming like dark storm clouds. I was desperate, cornered, and out of options. And that's when I chose the road less traveled. Buckle up. It's confession time. Every rejection deepened my despair. With each passing day, the weight of those hefty student loans felt more suffocating. The job market sentiment was low. Experience is the golden ticket. 

FYI: I am an international student and if I don't get a job in 3 months after graduation I will get kicked out of the country and I'll be the shame of my family. I literally thought about killing myself. Looking back on it I won't justify what I did, but I have no regrets, ZERO REGRET! 

Without the experience, I was a nonstarter. In my desperation, I pulled a wild card. I imagined my resume, sprinkling it with, let's say, alternative experiences that made me look like mid-level. I changed my LinkedIn as well to match my ""boosted resume"". The results were day and night difference after I started to apply for jobs with my new resume. Even the recruiters started to flood my DM on LinkedIn LOL. I got like 4 to sometimes 8 interviews in a week. I was literally overwhelmed by the interviews. Was it honest? Far from it. But I needed a foot in the door. Any door. 

Though my enhanced resume started getting attention, there was the mammoth task of navigating interviews. Enter AI tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude. These were my initial Shields in the battlefield of interviews, but typing to get answers during the interview? Rookie Move. And then I stumbled upon Final Round AI which gives me answers in real time during the interviews. No cap. It literally hears the interviewer's voice in real time and gives me answers in real-time too without typing. My virtual Oracle. It was like having Einstein and Oprah combined whispering wisdom into my ears. It listened to every interview question, processed it, and then offered real-time insights, technical questions, personal anecdotes, and icebreakers. This AI had my back. 

AI wasn't my solo play. I plunged into the world of networking, tapping into LinkedIn to weave connections and absorb industry insights. Those late-night chats with industry insiders were my lifeline, eventually translating into precious referrals. The lesson? Even in the digital age, human connections matter. But here is what you all need to do it differently on LinkedIn. STOP doing what everyone is doing. Yeah quick apply, apply on company website, referrals, cold emails. Those things are what 99% are doing. That's why those methods suck and it's fckin BS, it never worked for me. I applied for 1000+ jobs, 250+ cold emails & messaging. Only the last 200+ applications started to work. Use LinkedIn automation tools and SPAM the recruiters, engineers, and managers with your LinkedIn invitations like 500+ a day and now I have over 7k connections lol. Remember to include a short message and set up a follow-up message asking for a referral once they accept your invitation. QUANTITY OVER ANYTHING YALL I REPEAT QUANTITY OVER ANYTHING. 

From sending endless applications into the job market abyss to finally clinching that golden e-mail, an offer letter from a tech Titan 150K a year, from the verge of financial free fall to standing on the cusp of my dream job, the ride was nothing short of a blockbuster. If you're wondering how I am not getting caught at work, I just continue to use AI at work. If my boss asked me anything during the Zoom meeting, I just opened up all these AI tools. Also, I just asked my coworker if I have any questions. Never get caught? Who cares? My story isn't a handbook, but a testament to the lengths one might go when pushed to the edge. It's a blend of desperation, technology, and good old human ingenuity. Life threw me into deep waters, but sometimes you've got to evolve and learn to breathe underwater appears to the audacity of hope, resilience, and the magic of thinking outside the box."

16tga3r,1,2023-09-27,I suffer from intimidating people,u/genericexistence,Gifted,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gifted/comments/16tga3r/i_suffer_from_intimidating_people/,"I know it sounds like textbook and maybe nothing new to you, but I just want to let it out this time. 

I am always careful to hide myself. I'm constantly dumbing myself down; I'm never fully there. Because if I did that, it would exhaust people. Even at college that is the case. Only in exams and term papers do I show my full potential and practically go all out. Only with lecturers do I talk the way I really want to talk. But usually I hide myself.

Nevertheless, from time to time, there are situations in which I have the courage and fun to fully show myself. For example, yesterday I had my first seminar after half a year of a forced break from college. For that reason alone, I was really hyped about it. And since the seminar was also designed as a group work on creative problem solving, I was in absolute hyperfocus. It was a real feast; finally, some challenges again.

However, besides my group members (with who working was fun), I began to notice a tension on some level between me and the other students in the course of the seminar. Don't get me wrong; on the other hand, on the social level (for example, in conversations during the breaks), everything was actually going quite smoothly. See, I like casual conversations—a little chit-chat. I also have a few good college friends, and some of them are, fortunately, even in the seminar. And I am no different outside of college. I have a lovely circle of friends, and most of them are shady artists and madmen. So, in almost any case, we like to talk stupid, crazy shit. And when I'm working at my college job, I also enjoy a nice chat with our mailroom guys and the janitors from time to time and always try to learn something new from everyone. What I want to say is that I don't have a general problem with people. Because I like people, and that's my spirit. And exactly that makes some things even more hurtful and kind of tragic.

Because actually, on the other hand, on a substantial level, I often spread something like fear—just this felt tension in the room. So, at the end of the seminar, all groups had to present their solutions one after the other in front of everyone, which was followed by a critical review round for each solution. So the whole seminar participated very actively in these review rounds, and many things were dissected and analyzed. But when we then presented our solution, which was mainly owed to my madness after half a year without challenges, it became deadly quiet. Then our co-students asked if we could first explain it in a simpler way, but it was very hard for us to ELI5 it for them.

After some explanation of our concept and some aha moments, the lecturer then opened the review round once again. However, no one was there who wanted to or could respond; there was not a single one who raised his hand. All I saw in the round was rather a kind of that tense silence. But as I see it, it's not like we got a bad idea, I guess. I mean, our solution will now be implemented by the college. But fuck, though. Silence. Again. It’s haunting. These are just those moments when I regret showing myself.

But well, in the end, I don't know how much of this is projected from experiences I have had since childhood and actually recently, just since the start of college. In fact, the feedback has always been very clear, and it feels like nothing has changed. I mean, when I was forced to present my term paper to the others in my freshman year, there was feedback that many found it weird, that it sounded like a specialist article, and that they could hardly follow. And once again: this dead quiet seminar room, like an empty gap between me and my peers. Hate it. Some of them also found out my grade, and then the whole thing resulted in this picture again: In my greatest fear, I simply feel like a monster in the eyes of my co-students. Like something they are vulnerable to. I hate it so much. I don’t want to be that. I just want to have fun.

Sure, as I said, I also have some absolutely lovely college friends with who I have so much in common. We are always excited about each other's messy heads, and we carry us through college. However, I don't talk with them about such things as this. So, in the end, I feel somehow very alone with it, and I have no answers.

How should I deal with it?

*TL;DR (by ChatGPT-3.5):* *Despite being a social person, OP faced a problematic situation on a substantive level during a seminar with other students, which is often the case for him. His and his group's apparently complex idea received a cold reception, leaving him feeling like an outsider. He just wants to be himself but is worried about being seen as strange and overwhelming, and he asks himself how to cope with this isolation and dilemma.*"

Hey everyone,

I'm diving into the world of data science, and I've got about a month of self-learning under my belt, and I've learned some intermediate python, including stuff like data manipulation, dictionary based text analysis, and basic data analysis and data visualisation.

I'm a high school student (second year A-Levels), so I'm looking for ways to do freelance data science to earn money while keeping my schedule flexible. I've got an interest in AI and ML, plus a desire to beef up my CV and gain experience working in this field early.

I can't afford courses right now, so I'm learning through YouTube, ChatGPT, and GitHub. Courses are on the horizon once I save up.

Freelancing sounds awesome, but platforms like Upwork are a bit overwhelming. Any tips on breaking into data science, especially on the freelance front? What kind of projects should I go for to build my skills and portfolio?

I'd appreciate your insights and advice – thanks in advance! Also, if you have suggestions on how to frame my questions better or what other communities I should explore, please share."

16trf06,1,2023-09-27,CS 1102-01 Programming 1 quality vs. other courses on UoPeople,u/Gh0l4,UoPeople,https://www.reddit.com/r/UoPeople/comments/16trf06/cs_110201_programming_1_quality_vs_other_courses/,"*The following post has been removed with no notice nor explanation from UoPeople internal forum ""Ask the Experts"". I'm reposting here for a bigger audience.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Is ""CS 1102-01 Programming 1"" an especially bad course, or is it representative of the quality of the other classes and the learning dynamics at UoPeople?

&#x200B;

I took This second course after ""Online Education Strategies UNIV 1001"", which I took last year. That course hinted at possible problems with the UoPeople teaching and learning dynamics. However, because I learned quite a bit from the course and found it relevant, I rated that experience as positive despite the many shortcomings.

""CS 1102-01 Programming 1"", in my opinion, is a perfect demonstration of how NOT to create a Java Course or a Programming Course for that matter:

The chosen textbook, Eck (2022), is approaching the subject matter in the wrong way: instead of building concepts upon concepts, it rushes its way into the middle of the language just to pull out before properly finishing the explanations, only to come back some chapters later to add a bit more, but always insufficient context. A safer and more conservative approach would have been to use Eckel (2006).

The Learning Guides only exacerbate the problem by inviting students to skip essential parts and focus on all the irrelevant material. At best, the order in which these topics are presented is incongruent. Then, as the course advances, probably just for ""curriculum"" sake, it rushes through topics such as ""GUIs and Event Handling"", which the professors who built the course considered can be covered in just one week! Another example, on Week 8, is not one but three topics: multithreading, collection hierarchy, and the Stream API! I cannot find proper adjectives for this, not in English, not in my native Spanish or Romanian.

The discussion topics are very consistent in style with the textbook and the learning guides: irrelevant topics utterly unrelated to the skills that, in my opinion, should be gained by will-be programmers or technical writers, for that matter. Some of the proposed discussion as an example:

As an example of Week 4, discussion topic: ""Explore the performance considerations and potential trade-offs involved in this decision, taking into account factors such as time complexity, memory utilization, and code readability"" - Week 5 about Objects and classes, Week 6 will be about ""OOPS Paradigms"", Week 8 about Collections API. Keeping in mind that Microbenchmarking is an extraordinarily subtle and complicated topic and that constant changes in the JVM version have a huge impact on performance, I struggle to understand how could a constructive discussion take place around this topic. Another pearl, this time from Week 5: ""Discuss how encapsulation prevents unauthorized access to object data, ensuring data integrity and privacy"". - My personal conclusion is that the writer had a non-industry-standard definition of ""data integrity"" and ""privacy"". 

In response to the quality of the proposed discussion topics, students respond in kind: some try to summarize the material the best they can. Of course, at each personal interpretation, they make mistakes. Others either use ChatGPT, or they can generate an impressively similar answer to it. Those who work a bit more take that answer and, with more or less effort and talent, spend their time exercising mechanical synonym substitution. As for the responses, most are as automatic as the posts themselves; there is just a tiny percentage of genuine engagement and demonstration of interest in the subject matter.

Since we need to be evaluated, what better way than using the same patterns? Some quiz questions have no relationship with the material covered in the learning guides; the graded quizzes are just a show of how a teacher can give you an ""F"" if he chooses. I would appreciate, after the first graded quiz, an explanation and a discussion on why the correct answer is the one that is. I have at least one example of a question that cannot be solved by reading the textbook, but the concepts behind the correct answer are so subtle that it is just impossible to explain at this level of knowledge of the language. Even if it would be possible to explain by some stretch of imagination, it leaves me wondering why. What is the point of thinking and learning about this language feature so irrelevant instead of other relevant topics that would bring something to the student?

The programming assignments, as it cannot be any other way, are also in line with all the above. For those that don't already know Java, they are an exercise on frustration. For those who know Java, they are not any more rewarding because of how unnecessarily extensive they are and how badly they are framed. Probably, a discussion around each of the submissions would help, but that would mean several knowledgeable people in the group and way shorter problems. For a concrete, non-programming example: ""Cumulative sum of stock prices - Reflects the total value generated by an investment over a specified period."" - I do not think that we need such a high rigour bar, but how is it possible that such assertions even exist in the course material?

But rigour is expected from the students, at least for all those things that can be easily checked and do not need higher intellectual functions: we must always use citations, even if, ironically, they are against the very purpose of the APA Publication Manual 7th edition itself, which reads: ""it helps authors present their ideas in a clear, concise, and organized manner. Uniformity and consistency enable readers to (a) focus on the ideas being presented rather than formatting and (b) scan works quickly for key points, findings, and sources."". Let's avoid addressing the absurdity of using a publication style from one discipline to another very different one, such as Computer Science. Rigour, of course, is paramount when grading: when instructors do not have the time to do so properly, they are left with automatic checking tools for nearly automatic grading.

The importance of my initial question goes beyond requesting information on which I will base my decision to continue or drop from this University. My inquiry concerns how I will eventually evaluate a UoPeople Graduate Student when recruiting. I used to justify to myself that such a student demonstrated maturity because they achieved a University degree in a way more efficient financial manner. If all courses are like this one, what they seem to have shown is an incredible resilience but an utter lack of pragmatism: if anyone would use the time they would spend trying to pass ""CS 1102-01 Programming 1"", to actually learn Java, they would definitely be way prepared to collaborate on a software development team.

https://preview.redd.it/s2xlrg1afvqb1.png?width=1420&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ba7384180826604eb00afac83b167fc82db0dde

## I am reviewing the book “AI Glossary Handbook: Basic AI Terminology and Concepts for ChatGPT Users” by Harrell Howard:

As artificial intelligence continues its seemingly inexorable march into more and more aspects of our lives, having a solid grasp of basic AI concepts and terminology has become increasingly important not just for technologists, but for professionals, students, and inquisitive minds across disciplines. That’s where Harrell Howard’s concise yet comprehensive “AI Glossary Handbook” comes in.

Clocking in at just 57 pages, this recently published reference guide packs an impressive amount of explanatory power into its 6x9 inch frame. It covers over 300 key AI-related terms and breaks them down into easily digestible definitions. As the book’s subtitle suggests, it’s tailor-made for ChatGPT users and others looking to level up their understanding of this rapidly evolving field.

## Navigating the Brave New World of AI

As humans, we’re wired to make sense of the world by assigning labels and definitions to things. As AI continues blurring boundaries across industries, we need an authoritative resource to make sense of unfamiliar terminology. This is especially true for [ChatGPT ](https://softtechhub.us/2023/01/27/chatgpt-plugins-chatgpt-pro-tools/)users exploring creative ways to use this advanced natural language AI system.

With the AI Glossary Handbook, you can quickly look up terms like “knowledge graph,” “natural language processing,” “neural network,” and “supervised learning.” The concise definitions provided are easy to grasp for beginners, but also informative enough for readers with some existing AI knowledge.

The book covers everything from fundamental terms like “algorithm,” “artificial intelligence,” and “machine learning” to more complex techniques like “automated reasoning,” “computer vision,” and “generative adversarial networks.” Along the way, it unpacks the meaning of “overfitting” in machine learning, explains what makes “transformers” tick, and elucidates applications like “sentiment analysis.”

## Punchy, Plain English Definitions

Too often, AI reference guides get mired in highly technical language that goes over most readers’ heads. A key strength of this book is its use of crisp, conversational prose that makes the material far more accessible.

For example, here’s how the AI Glossary Handbook defines “natural language processing” or NLP:

“The branch of artificial intelligence that deals with analyzing, understanding, and generating human language.”

The entry on “reinforcement learning” is similarly concise and easy to digest:

“A machine learning technique in which an agent learns by interacting with its environment and receiving positive or negative rewards for its actions.”

Without diving into advanced math or academic jargon, these plain English definitions give you just enough context to grasp the essence of each concept. The book sticks to this simplified explanatory format from cover to cover.

## Casting a Wide Net Across AI Sub-Fields

From neural networks to computer vision, NLP to robotics, the guide covers all the major branches of artificial intelligence. This breadth highlights how innovations across AI sub-fields are intersecting to enable new capabilities.

For instance, breakthroughs in NLP combined with advances in transformer architectures have led to large language models like ChatGPT. By including relevant terminology from diverse areas, the handbook links together how modern AI systems incorporate techniques like:

\- Computer vision — to analyze visual data   
\- Natural language processing — to understand text   
\- Machine learning — to uncover patterns from data  
\- Knowledge graphs — to represent facts and relationships  
\- Neural networks — to model complex functions

Without knowledge of how these elements fit together, it’s tough to grasp the inner workings of AI. The glossary fills gaps in understanding by illuminating connections across sub-fields.

**From Academia to Industry**

Another aspect that makes this handbook shine is its blend of both academic AI terminology as well as concepts applied in industry.

So you’ll find research-oriented terms like:

\- Automated reasoning  
\- Computational learning theory   
\- Multi-agent systems

**Alongside AI applications like:**

\- Facial recognition  
\- Recommendation engines   
\- Text generation

Bridging theory and practice, the guide contextualizes how academic research gets translated into real-world systems. And it frames industry use cases in relation to the underlying techniques that power them.

## The Ideal Starting Point for Novices

For readers completely new to artificial intelligence, the AI Glossary Handbook offers the perfect entry point. Technology guides aimed at specialists can make AI seem impenetrable. This book succeeds by introducing terminology in an unintimidating way.

Rather than front-loading advanced theoretical concepts, it kickstarts learning with fundamental definitions. From there, readers can incrementally absorb more challenging material at their own pace. The structured progression mirrors the scaffolded approach of ChatGPT itself.

Even simple explanations of basic terms like “algorithm,” “data,” and “training data” provide the foundational understanding novices need. The book instills AI literacy starting from first principles.

## Clarifying Murky Concepts

Some AI terms seem deceptively simple at first glance. But subtle nuances set related concepts apart. The guide excels at teasing apart when to use:

\- Artificial intelligence vs. machine learning  
\- Supervised learning vs. unsupervised learning   
\- Classification vs. regression

By clarifying precisely how such terms differ, the handbook cuts through confusion. For example, its entries on “deep learning” and “neural networks” disentangle exactly how the two are connected. This prevents common misconceptions that the terms can be used interchangeably.

The book also clears up ambiguity around fuzzy buzzwords like “big data” and “data mining.” It makes transparent when specific phrases have distinct meanings versus being marketing fluff.

## Taming the AI Terminology Jungle

New AI terms and acronyms keep cropping up at a dizzying pace. Just staying current feels like a losing battle. An admirable strength of this reference guide is how it makes sense of the AI terminology jungle.

The glossary cuts through noise by focusing on established foundational concepts. These building blocks will remain relevant even as technologies come and go. Learning what “gradient descent” or “Bayesian networks” mean will unlock future innovations still to come.

Unlike glossaries packed with esoteric niche terms, this one spotlights need-to-know fundamentals. The curated selection of entries distills the most ubiquitous, widely-used terminology. Think of the guide as a Rosetta Stone for decoding AI’s common language.

## Building Intuition Alongside Knowledge

Pure memorization of definitions has limited value unless terms become anchored to intuitive understanding. The AI Glossary Handbook bridges this gap between knowledge and comprehension.

For example, the entry on “logistic regression” does more than just describe what the technique does. It notes how this statistical model gets used in classifiers to estimate discrete outcomes like pass/fail. This type of contextual framing around applications converts terminology into practical skills.

Succinct explanations also shed light on each concept’s significance. We learn how convolutional neural networks represent a major evolution in image recognition. The book teaches the why behind topics, not just the what.

These insights foster intuition alongside factual knowledge. Readers come away with an inherent sense for why core techniques matter.

## Enhancing ChatGPT Conversations

ChatGPT users know the system can sometimes get tripped up on niche technical topics. But armed with this handy reference guide, you can fill gaps in ChatGPT’s knowledge. Lookup up definitions yourself allows you to clarify confused terminology during conversations.

Having go-to explanations of concepts like “knowledge graphs” or “Monte Carlo tree search” will unlock more fruitful dialogue. The handbook enhances ChatGPT’s capabilities by empowering human users. It makes us better teachers so ChatGPT can learn.

Beyond ChatGPT, the guide serves as a universal translator for parsing AI-speak in research papers, news articles, and other sources. We can finally decipher insider terminology when encountering it in the wild.

## Making Abstract Concepts Concrete

Even clearly defined terms can still feel theoretical rather than tangible. The book bridges this gap by grounding many concepts in easy-to-grasp examples.

For “classification,” it discusses categorizing images. For “clustering,” it explains grouping customers by attributes. By linking terms to such real-world illustrations, the guide reinforces understanding.

These realistic examples make AI less mystifying. Readers gain insight into how abstract concepts manifest in practical applications they can envision. Turning theory into something concrete is the best way to internalize unfamiliar ideas.

A Launchpad for Further Learning

While thorough for its length, the handbook is not meant as a final destination. Rather, it serves as a launch pad for deeper exploration by laying solid conceptual foundations.

Once readers have the core terminology under their belt, the guide prepares them to delve into more advanced material. Definitions may be concise but nonetheless accurate enough to build upon.

The book succeeds at equipping readers with just enough understanding to make more complex AI resources accessible. By learning the basics here first, one can next tackle more technical textbooks and research papers armed with the prerequisite knowledge to comprehend them.

## Bottom Line

For anyone looking to demystify artificial intelligence, Harrell Howard’s AI Glossary Handbook is a superb reference guide. By compiling over 300 key terms and explaining them in plain English, it makes AI approachable for non-experts.

16uerwb,1,2023-09-28,Google Bard generates potential plagiarism. Here is what our team discovered during the tests,u/Only-Entertainer-992,Plagiarism_Is_Bad,https://www.reddit.com/r/Plagiarism_Is_Bad/comments/16uerwb/google_bard_generates_potential_plagiarism_here/,"**Our team is constantly testing texts generated by AI bots in order to see how our detector recognizes the texts generated by AI.** 

*A little background:*

*Our software consists of multiple features. Its primary purpose at the creation stage was to detect similarities between the texts and other sources available on the Internet and various databases. But reputable software has to cover multiple issues, which include grammar, spelling, authorship verification, etc. When ChatGPT became widely available, we reacted instantly and expanded the possibilities of our checker with the TraceGPT AI detector.* 

**During the testing of texts generated in Google Bard, not only our AI detector flagged issues with content, but also a plagiarism checker showed similarities. Basically, our similarity detector found those similarities in Bard-generated texts that are linked to already existing sources.**

**Usually, an LLM (Large Language Model) takes separate words (tokens) from different sources and generates texts based on their understanding. Surprisingly,  sometimes Google Bard provides sentences that look like a paraphrased version of existing sentences. Or sometimes even exactly matching content, reaching up to 40% potential similarity.**

**But let’s check the proofs:** 

[We prompted Google Bard to write a 1000-word essay about the American Dream, based on “Great Gatsby,” and in a plagiarism checker, the similarity score was 26.64&#37;.](https://preview.redd.it/wtg8r0yi6tqb1.png?width=2346&format=png&auto=webp&s=e26d10ca6a54d9ac9b2bdb3245a33b713fe8df06)

[This is the same sentence, which has slightly different wording, but the idea and word order in this sentence are the same as in the text generated by Bard. The funny thing is that this sentence is about altogether another novel ‘Never Let Me Go”, but this is the wording Bard came up with.](https://preview.redd.it/i5329qzxpzqb1.png?width=603&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89b4dcbea53dd90d0e811e43051d9f06abcfb86)

**Regarding the AI detector, it showed that this text is 94% AI generated with different probability levels, which makes the response precise.**

**Another try:**

[We prompted Google Bard to write a 1000-word essay on “Is Being a Freelancer a Good Alternative to Being a Full-Time Employee?”](https://preview.redd.it/vog54bglozqb1.png?width=2348&format=png&auto=webp&s=530e7d251900014ac2ce0750028daf7d0064b943)

**And received 36.40% of similarity. The sources are as follows, and it sounds like a paraphrasing of the original source.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7zugwn3rozqb1.png?width=616&format=png&auto=webp&s=969901ceca3e4cdbf58ddf29e642cb9beacbc958

**Conclusions:**

**Our AI detector marked text generated by Bard as AI-written, which is correct. Yet a similarity checker also marked sentences as paraphrased text from other sources.**

**In total, we checked 35 texts, and the similarity percentage was between 5% and 45%; as we saw from these examples, some sentences could be considered plagiarism despite looking like a paraphrased version of sources.** 

**What’s so special about this?**

**Many educational institutions do not accept papers containing 10% or even 5% similarity, not even AI-generated papers. Even if an educational institution does not have an AI detector to check if a piece was generated by AI, a student still can be in trouble because of possible accusations of plagiarism when submitting a paper generated by Bard.**

**To sum up, this can cause a lot of trouble to users, not only because many schools consider AI cheating to be academic misconduct. For all that, a student can receive possible accusations of plagiarism with indicated sources in the report.** 

**However, as a human being is a prominent judge of a report, the matches should be checked carefully: we have just seen the cases where the similarity is obvious. If you check the matches in text generated by Bard, the real similarity score will be far below 35%.** "

I won't deny that we've had a few quarrels over the years, especially after our school trip in which an argument between us almost led me to return back home by myself but I think its unfair that shes started to become continuously strict and unfair with my grading. My latest 10 assignments,, in which I would've usually scored quite high on, started lowering gradually, with remarks such as, ""did you really write this?"" written multiple times on each paper, even in physical assignments in supervised areas. I thought for a while that maybe it was my fault, i did use chatgpt for inspiration and sometimes even a format but doesn't everyone? ive stopped or tried to start using google as an alternative lately as my lowering scores started bothering me and for this work, which is a large part of my grade, i didnt even use chatgpt at all, not even for inspiration. With that being said, she marked the work really low, as in the lowest score I had ever gotten, with almost the whole thing highlighted as, ""written by chatgpt, you did not write this"", so I got pissed off and sent her multiple screenshots of the text going into GPTZero, asking chatgpt itself if it wrote my work, and even comapring gptzero scores with other of my classmates she trusted. I even started to compile testimonies from multiple teachers whom were familiar with my writing style, yet despite all my attempts to reach out to her, she's ignored me and continuously graded my work really low. I think this is ridiculous as in my latest work, of which i worked my ass off (i spent the whole car ride to school writing), a failing grade. I was aware that my work was rushed but I knew my capabilities and this wasnt fair so with everything I had, I asked other english teachers and even talented students what they thought about my work and they all personally marked it quite high so I dont think i was in the wrong or I dont think it was my fault that my work was marked so low. At this moment, I think its obvious what I should do, which is, of course, go talk to her personally. But before that, i'd like some advice on what I should do in this situation, was i in the wrong? What is the best thing I can do? Should i just bite my tongue and switch schools?"
16uho2z,1,2023-09-28,AI and Robotics - ChatGPT and Large Language Models,u/umgawa2,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/16uho2z/ai_and_robotics_chatgpt_and_large_language_models/,"The Rocky Mountain AI Interest Group (RMAIIG) held a hybrid in-person/online meeting on Sep 11, 2023 on the topic of ""AI and Robotics.""  I'm sharing the videos of two different presentations and talk summaries from three robotics professionals, in case they are of interest.  


We discussed how generative AI and robotics are increasingly being integrated to create more efficient, versatile, and intelligent systems. The two fields are converging with applications covering areas such as Autonomous Operation, Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

The meeting includes a demo of the Boston Dynamics 'Spot' platform.  


Video links below and talk summaries at the bottom.  


1. **Full meeting video (both speakers)**: **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbec1W3KRyE (2 hrs)**  


2. First speaker: Jacob Korniak works as a Business development representative and University research liaison for Furhat and Misty Robotics in Boulder, CO.  Morgan Bell leads the engineering and product teams at Furhat Robotics, and previously led the engineering team at Misty Robotics.  
**Jacob and Morgan's talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB9oWcArZBw (25 mins)**  


3. Second speaker: Harel Biggie is a fourth-year Ph.D. student in computer science at the University of Colorado Boulder, specializing in robotics. He works in the Autonomous Robotics and Perception group advised by Christoffer Heckman.  
**Harel Biggie's talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3p69rk5MGA (20 mins)**  


Talk summaries below.  (long)  


**Summary of Jacob Korniak and Morgan Bell's talk**: The talk focused on the evolution and current state of robotics. He began by highlighting society's expectations for a robotic revolution, where self-aware robots would dominate, contrasting it with the reality: while robots haven't become overlords, their influence has grown significantly over the decades.  
Jacob discussed the progression of robot development, referencing significant milestones. He mentioned the ""Wabat Robot"" from 1973, a Japanese invention that was groundbreaking at its time. Although it had many capabilities, its functions were manual, and it lacked efficiency in many tasks. The ""Kismet Robot"" from MIT in 1990 marked the dawn of social robots, emphasizing interaction over multitasking. These robots were designed with conversational abilities, enabling them to engage in basic interactions and show rudimentary emotions.  


He went on to mention more modern robots, such as the ""Atlas Robot"" from Boston Dynamics, which can perform acrobatics, and ""Sophia the Robot,"" a humanoid robot emphasizing social interaction. However, Jacob pointed out that despite these advancements, robots are not omnipresent in our daily lives. He used a French ad as an example to show that past generations had lofty expectations for the year 2000, which have not been met.  


The talk also highlighted challenges in robotics. The need for vast amounts of data to train robots and the unpredictability of robot behavior were primary concerns. Issues like inappropriate responses and the sheer speed of developments in the sector make it hard to keep up with the latest technologies.  


**Summary of Harel Biggie's talk:** The presentation revolved around the application of foundational models in robot navigation, with specific emphasis on the Boston Dynamics' Spot robot. The speaker reflected on their participation in the DARPA Subterranean Challenge, where robots were deployed in simulated search and rescue scenarios. These robots, such as the Spot and ClearPath Husky, autonomously explored challenging terrains to detect signs of human presence. The scenarios mirrored real-life catastrophes, like mine collapses or earthquakes, where sending humans might endanger more lives.  


DARPA's challenge aimed to enhance situational awareness by sending robots first, ensuring the safety of human rescue teams. These robots navigated complex terrains such as underground tunnels, caves, and even foggy areas that hampered vision. While the speaker's team achieved third place competing against world-renowned institutions like NASA's JPL, they acknowledged there's room for improvement. One primary enhancement avenue explored was incorporating large language models like ChatGPT to streamline human-robot interaction. Using natural language prompts, robots can be directed efficiently, saving crucial time in rescue missions.  


A significant challenge highlighted was ""language grounding,"" where robots must decipher and act upon ambiguous language commands. For example, interpreting what ""chair on your left"" means can vary based on context. The team's innovative approach leverages ChatGPT for code generation, effectively converting commands into actionable codes, such as navigating to a chair where one can watch a movie. In a live demo, a Spot robot was directed to navigate towards specific items, demonstrating the practical application of this research. The talk culminated in acknowledging collaborators and emphasizing the potential of combining AI and robotics for life-saving applications."

16ulgun,1,2023-09-28,Please grade my issue essay :) Let's compare to ChatGPT,u/le_vent,GRE,https://www.reddit.com/r/GRE/comments/16ulgun/please_grade_my_issue_essay_lets_compare_to/,"Hi All! I've been working on my issue essay practice using this incredible platform linked at the bottom.  


So far I've been using ChatGPT to grade my essays but would love some human input too :) I'll let you know what score the AI gave me as well so we can explore how useful of a tool it is!  


I've mostly been struggling with time constraints, so any tips are appreciated! I also know that the GRE format just changed, is there anything new to be considered when writing an essay now? Hereby my essay:  


&#x200B;

  
**Prompt:** ""Claim: When planning courses, educators should take into account the interests and suggestions of their students.   Reason: Students are more motivated to learn when they are interested in what they are studying.

Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.""

**Essay:** ""Teachers have the responisibility to prepare their students for the challanges they might face after completing their course study. I mostly disagree with the statement that teachers should take student interest into account when planning courses in order to increase motivation. While it is important to evoke passion in students, the experience of teachers places them in a better position to select what topics are essential to the flourishing of the pupil.    


Passion in a topic is a great fuel for learning. When something catches a student's eye as worth understanding, they oftentimes seek out ways to learn it on their own. In these cases, teachers have to do little to convey a topic to the pupil and the teaching job might feel delightfully easy. Einstein, for example, is said to have sought out philosophical writings on the nature of time during his early studies without being prompted to do so by his instructors. He then went on to take the understanding of time in physics beyond anything anyone had ever done. Einstein taught himself a topic he had a proclivity for on his own, and with minimal instruction - a teacher's dream.    


Sadly, important topics do not always attract interest from students. Many subjects rely on a range of foundational fields in order to be understood. In math for example, you cannot learn calculus without haveing understood algebra. Furthermore, calculus is foundational to the understanding of newtonian physics. Einstein, as a physicist, was notoriously bad at math. One can imagine him grinding his teeth when working through his algebra and calculus exercises as a young pupil. But if he would have never engaged with, and integrated, the fundamentals of math, he would have been unable to understand physics in a way that allowed him to revolutionize it.     


Moreover, students lack sufficient in-depth understanding of a topic in order to fully understand whether or not they would find it interesting. Many students picture a wet-lab filled world of microscopes when hearing the word ""biology,"" yet it must not always be so! Biology, like many other fields, is a vast realm of knowledgethat encompasses the study of life at a range of scales. Even if a student might feel repulsed by the squishy cell tissues in a sterilized lab, they might be fascinated by the complex causal relationships that allow oceanic ecosystems to flourish when studying marine biology. A student view on a vast subject before engaging with it is oftentimes too limited to allow for a thorough understanding of potentially intersesting pockets of knowledge.  T  


eachers need to balance student interest in course content with their responsibility to prepare for the challanges that might face after the course ends. While it is essential to maintain interest by cultivating passion, teachers should take students suggestions with regards to planning courses to limited extent. The teacher, with years of life and practicing experience, is in a better position to decide what topics will best engage, prepare and even pleasantly surprise their pupils.""

16ushyy,1,2023-09-28,Indeed's CEO says college students might be learning skills that could go 'obsolete' once they graduate,u/saffronfan,ArtificialInteligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16ushyy/indeeds_ceo_says_college_students_might_be/,"The CEO of job site Indeed warns that the pace of AI advancement means graduates may find their newly acquired skills outdated by the time they finish school. ([Source](https://www.businessinsider.com/indeed-ceo-ai-chatgpt-could-make-college-skills-obsolete-2023-9))

**AI's Accelerating Impact**

* Compares current pace to the rapid disruption of past tech revolutions.
* Believes AI could master white-collar skills faster than students can learn them.
* Research shows software developer roles are most exposed to generative AI.

**Cause for Concern**

* College may not provide the skills to compete as AI evolves.
* Degrees could become outdated in the 4 years it takes to earn them.
* Echoes fears that AI could automate many current jobs.

**Balancing Innovation and Risks**

* Notes AI like Indeed's helps people find jobs now.
* But it warns that its job-replacing potential requires urgent attention.
* Says we must focus on addressing AI's downsides.

**TL;DR:** The CEO of Indeed warns that the pace of AI threatens to make college degrees obsolete before students even graduate, underscoring concerns about AI's potential impact.

16uszyk,1,2023-09-28,The Immense Lore behind Luna Part 2 of idk how many: Growing Pains + A detail I forgot to put in the previous post.,u/PokeTrainerCr,OriginalCharacter,https://www.reddit.com/r/OriginalCharacter/comments/16uszyk/the_immense_lore_behind_luna_part_2_of_idk_how/,"Hello again! I believe we left off with Luna's first instance of amnesia. Well, it appears I had a little too last time as I forgot an important detail which will return later in this post. So, instead of going forward, we will be going back to when she was 9. Again, this is *after* her reincarnation. The first post is pinned on my profile if you would like to go back and read that. Now, WITHOUT FURTHER ADO:

***Summer Camp***

In the summer of 2010, Luna (9) convinced her parents to send her to a summer camp in Maine, where she met a ten-year-old boy named Carter, who was being bullied. She stood up to the bullies, and became fast friends with timid boy.  
(Ps: Just worked out birthdays. Luna's birthday is in October, so they were born the same year, just his birthday is earlier)  
Over the summer, they got to know each other and became best friends. Had they gotten more time together, they may have become even more than that, but as the summer ended, Luna had to return her hometown in Washington, and say goodbye to Carter. She promised him she would return to camp, but she never did. Carter went back to camp until about 2014, when he finally gave up waiting.

***Confusion and Adventure***

This is where I originally began the story when I was six. I played it out with Beanie Boos, hence the large talking animals.  
To begin, I will give some background on what happened just BEFORE Luna's arrival.

The were three groups of animals:  
The Cat Colony  
The Unicorn Tribe  
And The Dragon Missionaries.  
The Cat Colony was just kinda there and didn't really interact.  
The Dragon Prince, Legend, was overseeing his Kingdom's new colony *himself*, by request of his father, the King.  
They kept to themselves, and probably always would have if not for that day... when lies collapsed.  
(I wrote this part down and am now typing in what I wrote which is why the tone changes here)  
The youngest of the Unicorn Tribe, Blitz, was the only in a long time to develop powers before her coming-of-age; a ritual occurring for as long as anyone remembered, during the sunset of their 20th birthday. The eldest unicorn, Rora, was finally ready for her ceremony as she stood on the hill beside Lana the llamacorn, and head of the tribe.  
In silence, they watched the setting sun 'til it was finally time, and touched horns for the power to awaken. It didn't. Instead, Blitz watched in shock as a spark ran across Rora's horn and into Lana's!  
*That's not supposed to happen!* She thought in panic. The spark would represent the flow of magic into the reciever, but it was not supposed to go into Lana! Could she be stealing their magic? Blitz found herself racing back to the field where Melody sat under a shady tree, awaiting nightfall. She immediately blurted out her concerns, but Melody just laughed, waving it off as a silly dream. She told the filly she should just find a nice place to sleep for the night, but she wouldn't be having it. She snuck off to the cliffs where the dragons had resided for the past five years. Blitz explained her problem to the prince, Legend the 3rd. He agreed to help, and began to fly home, but Blitz stopped him.  
She'd focused all her power to teleport to him. They fell through the air, landing in an empty, desolate field. Their argument was cut short as a groan sounded from behind. (and now I stray from what I previously wrote)  
Behind them lay Luna, unconscious. Blitz and Legend stood over her, arguing farther, but with a new topic now.  
""What is it?"" The prince asked  
""*She*."" Blitz insisted.  
""*Sorry*. *She*.""  
Another groan, and Luna woke up. Clearly, she was confused. A talking unicorn and dragon? What?  
Blitz asked if she was ok, and Legend asked what she was. She matter-of-factly said she was human, to which Legend stated ""I've heard of those. Never heard of them having *wings*, though.""  
This startled, Luna, as she looked over her should to see large bat-like wings protruding from her back. She stood, slightly unbalanced by the extra weight.  
Some filler later, Luna agreed to help them with their problem, and the flew back home, Legend reluctantly helping her learn to fly.  
It was soon evident that Luna had great fighting prowess, and they won easily. Lana was banished, and Luna became great friends with the strange animals here. She helped them all settled into a town together, the Unicorn Tribe, Cat Colony, and even the Dragon Missionaries all became one group.  
The story became legend in their world, passed down to the descendants. Over time, the town grew more and more, welcoming all species in. Luna left one day to explore the world, but when she returned, she found a hundred years had passed and all her friends were now gone. But their descendants lived on, and she found them telling the story around a campfire one night. As they debated her existence, a mischievous grin crossed her face, and she proved just how real she was. Unfortunately, before she could have much fun, or even talk to them much, something else caught her attention, something no one else noticed. She sensed something strange, and it led her to her first portal. She entered never to be seen by them again.

***Cursed Existence***

On the other side, she found a world filled with humans and dragons, where she discovered her second form. This is also where she discovered the curse. While never documented, it appears the bat dragons briefly visited this world after being cursed, for in a cave there sat a stone engraved with a warning to all who might see it:

Beware this species thorough  
For the curse nearly did destroy  
This world and more  
Until the......  
......curse fell dormant.....

She'd seen enough. But if only she read further she would have known her destiny, for it read:  
'Til come the day  
A girl is chosen  
To lift the curse  
And revive her species  
From the darkness past  
And bring about a brighter future  
For all whom suffered

&#x200B;

She was mortified, and absentmindedly flew through another portal to a village in the clouds.  
A small village, sure, and most medieval in nature, but what came next was horrible nonetheless.  
Screaming. First from her. An agonized scream filled the air as she blacked out. Her stress had finally given the curse the strength it needed to subdue her conscious and control her body.  
Though it was only for a short time, when Luna awoke, the village was in ruins and flames. The villagers angrily drove her out, pitchforks and torches and all.  
She flew away, now determined to avoid people. She didn't want to hurt anyone!

***Depression and Considered Suicide***

This is where things get particularly dark. Not much description as it would mostly be filler, but she spent about, I wanna say, 200+ years like this, maybe?  
Bat Dragons are pack animals, plus Luna as an individual is an extrovert. This led her to became rather depressed as she would not allow herself social interaction. On many occasions she considered killing herself, as that way she would theoretically be unable to harm anyone further, but there was this small feeling that always told her to push on. She didn't know it then, but it was her memories of Carter. Though she couldn't pull them to the front of her mind, they were still there in her subconscious brain, and a part of her was determined to finally fulfil her promise to see him again. And see him again she would. At the end of this slump, she ran into a vampire hunter, who mistook her for some weird day-vampire (vampire immune to sunlight). This is also why she vaguely dislikes vampires and becomes annoyed whenever they are brought up.  
He chased her to a cliff, when a pyrokinetic wolf she had befriended prior got in the way, creating a wall of fire between them. He would not give up, so he threw his wooden stake with all his might through the fire and it unfortunately pierced Luna's flesh. But, the curse does have *some* benefits. The curse mixed with her dragon blood (which is acidic and can burn through any non-organic/living substances) protected her from the full force of the flaming stake, and allowed her to survive. It was agonizing, however. (so much agony. sheesh) She stumbled backwards off the cliff and fell through a portal.

***Regaining Passion***

As she fell through the sky of this new world, her wings subconsciously (I will use this word a lot) wrapped around her to protect from the impact. The stake has at this point disintegrated into ashes. When she crashes, her wings slowly unfold as an older man walks up to the small crater she created. When she awakes, she is startled to find herself in a bed with her fresh wounds wrapped in bandages. The man comes in and she becomes defensive, but it is quickly evident that he merely wants to help. This man taught her much about fighting and became a sort of mentor to her. Unfortunately, nothing good can last forever, which seems especially true for heroes. After a year, men came marching to the empty field where the man had built his house. He insisted she go, they had come for him, and there was no reason for her to get caught up in it. Reluctantly, she did. She watched sadly as the men watched closer, before leaving through another conveniently timed portal.  
Finally, she returns to her world of origin, though she doesn't know it.  
She landed in Wolf Woods, a forest near the small town Woodfal MIA. (PS: it is also on a mountain)  
For several days she stayed in the forest, thinking over everything that had happened up 'til that point. To her annoyance, her thoughts would soon be interrupted. One day, Carter was in a clearing near the edge of the forest (in the forest), looking down at the miles of woodland at the base of the mountain. He was now 17. He wore a big coat in the midst of Winter, and snow covered the forest. As she began to walk away and head to school, he heard a thump behind him. Luna had fallen out of a tree (she was sleeping). He was startled. Sure, a strange girl falling out of a tree would surprise anyone, but what really caught Carter's attention was *who* had fallen. As soon as their eyes met, he recognized her. She looked so different from the free-spirited girl he'd met at camp. He was saddened to see she didn't recognize him, but still he thought back to that last day. ""I'll get my parents to send me back next year! And then, when we're older, I'll come here myself, and we can meet up! And I can see where you live!""  
She had promised to return. And here she was. Soon, the bell rang and he suddenly took Luna's hand, much to her distress, and dragged her to the school. She reluctantly went along with it as a 'transfer student', though she wasn't entirely sure why. They full truth is, she did remember him. Sort of. When they had met before, something sparked, but they were separated before it could grow. Now Luna felt it again. She loved him, but that's exactly why she wanted to avoid him. She was beginning to feel that everyone she ever cared about would always get hurt one or way or another.

This brings us to the end of the post, but I will continue this VERY soon.  
PS: Town names are still up for debate, so if you have any critique for them, I'd be happy to hear it!"

* No FWH influence yet.

1997 (95 - 100% SWM, 0 - 5% FWH):

* First to enter elementary school after 9/11. 9/11 is often seen as the end of the ""end of history"", since many events that have occurred since may have never happened if 9/11 never happened.
* Oldest at high school when Gamergate happened. In my opinion, this event was the start of what was to come (like Trump winning 2016).

1998 (87.5 - 95% SWM, 5 - 12.5% FWH):

* First to enter elementary school after the start of the Iraq War, an event that started because the US believed that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. This would eventually lead to the demise of Saddam Hussein. Despite being hanged in 2006, the war would go on for another five years.
* Oldest at elementary school when the Great Recession happened, which was the largest financial crisis since 1929 and resulted in a large number of people that were unemployed.
* Oldest in middle school when the Iraq War ended.
* Oldest in middle school when the Trayvon Martin killing happened.
* Oldest at high school when gay marriage was legalized. This would eventually make people more accepting towards gay marriage.
* Oldest at college when Covid started becoming a major worldwide issue (can apply to another birthyear). This would lead to need for masks, vaccines, remote learning, and remote work.

1999 (80 - 87.5% SWM, 12.5 - 20% FWH):

* First to enter elementary school after the releases of MySpace and Facebook, which ushered in the first bits of the Social Media Age.
* Oldest at middle school when the Sandy Hook shooting occurred.
* Oldest at high school when Trump got elected.
* Oldest at college when the January 6 Capitol attack occurred (can apply to another birthyear). This was the first major attack on the US Capitol since 1812.

2000 (65 - 80% SWM, 20 - 35% FWH):

* Born after the Y2K hysteria (did not happen).
* First to enter elementary school after the release of YouTube, which further brought us into the Social Media Age.
* Oldest at elementary school when Osama bin Laden was killed, which I thought was a turning point in the War on Terror because he was the mastermind of 9/11.
* Oldest at high school when the Marjory Stoneman Douglas shooting happened. This event was what made people know more about Generation Z's identity.

2001 (50 - 65% SWM, 35 - 50% FWH):

* Born after Bush 43 got elected in the controversial 2000 election against Al Gore.
* First to be born in the third millennium. Some people argue that the third millennium began on Jan 1, 2000, but there is no year zero. Thus, it actually began on Jan 1, 2001.
* First to enter elementary school after Hurricane Katrina. This event affected \~15 million people in the United States and arguably started the rise in gas prices ever since.
* Oldest in elementary school when the Iraq War ended.
* Oldest in elementary school when the Trayvon Martin killing occurred. This was arguably the starting point for modern racial tensions, and quite possibly Gamergate, the outcome of the 2016 election, etc.
* Oldest in middle school when Gamergate happened.
* Oldest in college when Queen Elizabeth II died at age 96. This made Charles III become King of England. Even though this was a UK event, events like this do not occur very often (this can apply to another birthyear).
* Oldest in college when ChatGPT was released. This would usher in the rise of artificial intelligence (this can apply to another birthyear).
* Oldest in college when Covid no longer became a public health emergency of international concern on May 5, 2023 (this can apply to another birthyear).

2002 (35 - 50% SWM, 50 - 65% FWH):

* First to be born after 9/11.
* Born in the center of the analog/digital and VHS/DVD transition. Analog technology and VHS tapes were commonly used in the 80s and 90s, while digital technology and DVDs are commonly associated with the 21st century.
* First to start elementary school after the iPhone release. Although this is not really a historical marker, I thought that this ushered in the smartphone age.
* Oldest at elementary school when the Sandy Hook shooting occurred. On Dec 14, 2012, Adam Lanza shot and killed 26 students at Sandy Hook elementary school. He also killed his mother before the shooting and eventually killed himself. Although Sandy Hook elementary school only went up to fourth grade, most elementary schools go up to fifth grade. Like Columbine, this was another event that led to children being more sheltered and was probably another turning point for the parenting system.
* Oldest at middle school when gay marriage was legalized.
* Oldest at high school when Covid became a major worldwide issue.

2003 (20 - 35% SWM, 65 - 80% FWH):

* First to be born after the establishment of Homeland Security, which was made to improve the US's security for multiple things, such as customs and immigration.
* First to be born after the start of the Iraq War.
* Actual oldest at Sandy Hook elementary school when the Sandy Hook shooting occurred.
* Oldest in high school when the January 6 Capitol attack happened.

2004 (12.5 - 20% SWM, 80 - 87.5% FWH):

* First to start elementary school after the Great Recession.
* Oldest in elementary school when Gamergate happened.
* Oldest in middle school when the Marjory Stoneman Douglas shooting happened.
* Oldest in high school when the Russian invasion of Ukraine started. This was where Vladimir Putin escalated the Russo-Ukrainian War that started in 2014.

2005 (5 - 12.5% SWM, 87.5 - 95% FWH):

* First to not be considered Millennials even by Strauss and Howe's generational theory.
* Oldest in elementary school when gay marriage was legalized.
* Oldest in high school when Queen Elizabeth II died.
* Oldest in high school when ChatGPT was released.
* Oldest in high school when Covid was no longer was a public health emergency of international concern.

2006 (0 - 5% SWM, 95 - 100% FWH):

* First to start elementary school after the killing of Osama bin Laden.
* Oldest at elementary school when Trump got elected.
* Oldest in middle school when Covid became a major worldwide issue.

2007:

* All SWM influence gone.

So, how should we deal with that? – answers the AI Detection SaaS team.",u/Only-Entertainer-992,Plagiarism_Is_Bad,https://www.reddit.com/r/Plagiarism_Is_Bad/comments/16vclyk/why_is_it_challenging_for_ai_detectors_to_be_100/,"AI-generated text detection might feel like a struggle against an invisible villain, but at the AI-detection developers team, everything is based on structured algorithms and rigorous testing. Bringing field expertise and experience, our team is here to cover all the rising questions regarding AI detection in texts.

* A plagiarism checker is an algorithm that finds similarities in what is available on the Internet.
* An AI detector is a model that was trained on specific human-written and AI-generated texts.

A model is created by machine learning of AI on the examples of human-written and AI-generated text. To put it broadly, programmers instruct the model: “Here are texts generated by AI, and these are human-written. Go and learn what is in common in human texts and what is in common in machine ones”. After learning, the machine is ready to work with other texts.

The main problem is that people can create texts with the same perplexity – both predictability and randomness – as AI bots. The main challenges as of now are:

* Short sentences.
* Text creators that are non-native speakers. For this reason, their writing is more predictable, close to AI patterns, which is one of the false-positive parameters.

In the English-speaking Internet, experts argue that ChatGPT is discriminatory against non-natives, but it may flag not only English texts but Japanese, French, or others written by non-natives.

* AI bots are constantly learning and improving to generate a more diverse predictability. This may cause false negatives (when the detector doesn’t indicate the text written by AI as basically AI). 
* Students can take an AI-generated text and change the wording to synonyms or rephrase them manually, which will cause a mix of AI and human texts, thus complicating the detection.

Reading this, one might despair of ever finding an effective solution,

but we are here with answers.

The reality is that new models of AI bots generate more sophisticated writing, and students come up with more and more sophisticated ways to cheat.

But AI detector development teams love sophisticated things; they are fully aware of these difficulties and can share some tips on how to deal with them.

Here are some non-technological ways to check if you suspect any misconduct:

* Most importantly, the human is here to judge the AI detector’s report. If the checker marked single simple sentences, most likely it’s not AI cheating. If big chunks are marked as AI, you may start to be concerned.
* One of the ways to check if a student is AI-cheated is to interview a student about this exact idea in the parts flagged as AI and ask for all the records and proof of work.
* Another sign of cheating is when a student’s writing quality and style improve significantly right in the highlighted chunk of text.

Some teachers say it's not that hard to distinguish whether the text was written by a student, especially when it’s not the first assignment to check, but we still understand that it's challenging.

Technological advice:

* A suitable proof is to have a history of creating the document. This might be a concern if some paragraphs in the text appear in whole pieces out of nowhere. If your students write assignments in Google Docs, you can easily see cheating attempts by using activity reports in the existing Google Docs add-ons for AI detection. It will show editing sessions and editing duration, contributors, and allow comparing versions with a final document to find pasted chunks that can be plagiarism or AI.
* Double-check one assignment in two detectors. Suppose your institution already has a plagiarism checker with an AI detector. In that case, for the second detector, you can use free АІ Chrome Extensions, which helps to check the content right in the browser window, for example, on the page of your LMS. If you are unsure and need to check, this second checker will come in handy even if you already use another service for plagiarism and AI checks. 

Treat AI detectors as tools that don’t give exact answers — but rather flag patterns found in a text. This means these sentences match the patterns the AI detector’s model knows about AI writing. For this, use the following logic:

1. When the AI detector flags random simple sentences — the chances are very high that this was not cheating, as it doesn't make any sense to generate random sentences with AI when you want to cheat.
2. When the AI detector flags paragraphs — a sign of a higher chance that a student used AI to help in writing an assignment, although paragraphs also can be just matches with AI patterns, it depends on how many such paragraphs you see in a paper.
3. AI detector flags 50% or more — there is a very high chance that an assignment was AI-generated. However, if not a native speaker wrote an assignment, it would be reasonable to double-check with a student. As mentioned, AI detectors treat writing probability as the primary AI trait, which is also typical for non-native speakers' writing styles.

 **Conclusion:** The forever-evolving AI sphere may evoke confusion, but this doesn’t mean the situation is out of control. Academia continues adapting to AI's ever-evolving features."
16vcmf3,1,2023-09-29,⚠️ This is a big one guys ⚠️ Seems like Kenny & Co. are going after the SEC - and we have a limited window to do something about it. Time to roll up our sleeves and kick some short hedge fund ass. 🚨 Don’t Let Congress Defund Market Structure Reform! 🚨,u/kibblepigeon,Superstonk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/16vcmf3/this_is_a_big_one_guys_seems_like_kenny_co_are/,"🚨 This is not a drill 🚨

You apes remember the most excellent and **hugely successful** ""The Big Four"" SEC rules and regulation proposal campaign we finished about 6 months ago:

https://preview.redd.it/7lrvi9y3e2rb1.png?width=1240&format=png&auto=webp&s=8546b4c1f7791bd3621f5c023b70c5eb925ae060

""The Big Four"" rule proposals campaign outlined the opportunity for fairer, equal markets - where 'market makers"" like Citadel, would no longer have an unfair advantage over the markets resulting in them losing a lot of revenue and income.

Not only would this mean better opportunities within the markets for investors like ourselves, but it would also mean **Game Over** for Short Hedge Funds, like Ol' Kenny Griffin.

Here's a little recap of what we advocated for and what's got them so worried:

# File No. S7-31-22; Release No. 34-96495: Order Competition Rule (aka ""The Big One"")

>The current rule allows brokers to send orders directly to Citadel's internal systems, giving Citadel control over the price. However, the new rule states that Citadel cannot be the first to receive orders; instead, orders must go to a public auction where everyone, including pension funds, has an equal opportunity to fill the order.  
>  
>The one we advocated for gives other market participants the chance to offer better prices, without taking a cut of the trade. As a result, Citadel may lose a significant amount of money, data, and influence. Overall, this rule aims to create a fairer and more transparent market.

# File No. S7-30-22; Release No. 34-96494; Regulation NMS: Minimum Pricing Increments, Access Fees, and Transparency of Better Priced Orders (aka - The Tick Size Rule)

>The reason Citadel has an advantage is that they can trade at sub-penny intervals on their single-dealer platform, while everyone else is limited to trading in penny increments. This allows them to fill retail orders at slightly higher prices and makes them appear more skilled than other exchanges. The proposed rule would level the playing field by allowing everyone to trade at sub-penny intervals, eliminating this unfair advantage.  
>  
>This rule would also reduce the rebates that can be paid, making payment for order flow much less useful. Although the rule wouldn't ban payment for order flow altogether, it would significantly minimise its impact.

# File No. S7-32-22; Release No. 34-96496· Regulation Best Execution

>The proposed rule wants to make the stock market fairer and more transparent by promoting competition among different places where stocks are bought and sold.  
>  
>So, say a company's stock is being sold on two different trading platforms. The proposed rule would make sure that both platforms have the same rules about how much the stock price can change at a time, so that neither platform has an unfair advantage over the other.  
>  
>The rule also wants to make sure that brokers and wholesalers are being honest and transparent when they help people buy and sell stocks. For instance, if a broker has a deal with a particular trading platform, they might be more likely to send their customers to that platform, even if it's not the best place to get the best price. The proposed rule would try to stop that from happening.

>Citadel and Viru utilise a ""price improvement scheme"" to attract order flow by claiming to offer the best trades in the market. While their performance statistics seem to support this, they often do not provide the best price available, but rather a slightly better price. This allows them to gain order flow without needing to pay for order flow.  
>  
>There is a suspicion that they selectively apply the price improvement to benefit themselves. The new rules aim to enforce legal requirements that should have already been in place and mandate more transparent disclosure of their practices to prevent deception. This will help to expose any unethical behaviour and prevent them from taking advantage of the market.

# WOAH!

Pretty cool, right? 

And could you imagine the ***unbelievable*** pressure market makers - who are short on GME (OUCH!) - would face if they were suddenly faced with the terrifying realisation that household investors (like *you*) were about to cost them billions, if not **TRILLIONS** in revenue?

All because of simply levelling out the playing field and affording equal opportunities to everyone, everywhere.

Well ladies, gentlemen and apes - you'll be very glad to know that our efforts were so successful within that campaign that when we were done, even Gary Gensler was getting in on the hype:

https://preview.redd.it/icpfw17co2rb1.png?width=1244&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ea5998e18c1b44f73df83fb42de2136395e2e1e

So is it any surprise to anyone that Short Sellers are now going after the SEC?

Let's deep dive into what that means in real terms:

https://preview.redd.it/oj3nos2f37rb1.png?width=2624&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2e1b2096790f80978e67cb0743c1cefafb2783b

For note - much of the below is inspired by Dave Lauer (from We The Investors) excellent post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/16vadrb/dont\_let\_congress\_defund\_market\_structure\_reform/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/16vadrb/dont_let_congress_defund_market_structure_reform/?share_id=bk0lejtQ0MYlK_q7zjL4W&utm_name=ioscss)

So you might be asking yourself, how do Wall Street intend to stop the SEC from doing their job? 

Well it appears that a number of **bad actors (aka, short sellers etc)** have invested **a lot of fucking money** into ensuring they've got enough people in Congress to do their dirty work for them by fighting against the best interests of YOU - the taxpayer.

Which is pretty coincidental - because yesterday, this guy just put himself on our radar: 

**Rep Byron Donalds (R-FL)** 

[https:\/\/contactgovernors.com\/florida\/donalds-byron\/](https://preview.redd.it/bbnlwes367rb1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d55f64ab7f96dc03a73c28a293b60f38c7f18dc9)

Oh yeah, you read that right. 

He said this **YESTERDAY** at the House Financial Services hearing, when he [called into question](https://twitter.com/dlauer/status/1707097629455249734) the legitimacy - **nay, the very existence** \- of any number of you who submitted a comment or letter to the SEC in recent months.

Must have missed the memo where none of us are ""real"". 

https://preview.redd.it/zupwl95g67rb1.jpg?width=666&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=42715e8d21f37340e3a25fad133fa00c27fa8da6

And as such - him, and I'm sure ***all*** those who funded his donation campaign, are pushing to not only discredit all the submission and comments we have left to fight for market reform, but actively defund the SEC too. 

# 🌈 FUN ACTIVITY! 

# Any internet sleuths out there wanna check out who paid for Rep Byron Donalds (R-FL) campaign donations? I bet I can hazard a mayo-chomping guess who it was!

So here's the full issue in short: 

https://preview.redd.it/qiqeriru67rb1.png?width=1996&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d3b5bd7ea44a32080b2e0c45756260fdb6e0d68

To help you understand my crayon loving ape - 

**A House appropriations bill** is a legislative proposal introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives that specifies how the federal government will allocate funds for various government programs and agencies. 

And taking a closer look at the Bill. It includes the following language:

>SEC. 552. **None of the funds** made available by this Act **may be used to finalize, implement, or enforce** the **rulemaking** entitled ‘‘Regulation Best Execution’’, ‘‘Order Competition Rule’’, and ‘‘Regulation NMS: Minimum Pricing Increments, Access Fees, and Transparency of Better Priced Order’’.

As such - Wall Street is trying to take away funding from the SEC's on the new market structure rules by changing this bill.

https://preview.redd.it/vgie30cp77rb1.jpg?width=888&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98c8d640eb698b875e6e395d790f84c772294bcc

I know usually call to actions often have people around here a little cautious - and rightly so- but this really is a pressing matter and we have very little time to do something about it. 

And think of it this way - what's the worst thing to come of engaging with Congress to advocate and preserve the necessity of the funding for the SEC so they can FINALLY enforce much needed market reform and structure rules? 

It's what we should be doing anyways - so please, get involved now - because it matters, and every voice counts.

Remember - this is only happening because WE'RE winning. OUR comments and OUR fight for regulation and reform is **working.**

Don't give up now. Don't give Wall Street the satisfaction of your inaction. 

Use your voice, fight for fairer markets. We want transparency, equality and accountability.

Remember apes, we're all in this together.

The SEC may indeed be an American federal agency, but it's our responsibility to help from ALL OVER THE WORLD to protect shareholder rights.

Let's take back out markets, and protect the SEC.

**🚨 TL:DR 🚨** 

* Ken Griffin of Citadel has been busy making a whole LOAD of campaign donations so he can have full control over a bunch of GOP members of Congress.
* They're using that power to try to *sneak* in a provision into a House appropriations (funding) bill that would defund any SEC work on the new market structure rules.
* Meaning that the new proposed rules which would result in more equality, transparency and accountability within our markets 
* ⚠️  He is trying to sabotage the SEC - rendering them unable to protect us, and our markets. ⚠️ 
* Our engagement and comments are HURTING him. So we must continue to support the SEC - and vocalise how we WANT better rules. 

You can get involved by: 

* Using the Template as above - re word this and fashion it into a comment ready to send to member of congress."
16vnyyf,1,2023-09-29,ROScribe is now autogenerating both ROS1 and ROS2,u/RoboCoachTech,computervision,https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/16vnyyf/roscribe_is_now_autogenerating_both_ros1_and_ros2/,"We are pleased to announce that we have released a new version of ROScribe that supports ROS2 and well as ROS1.

**ROScribe**  
[ROScribe](https://github.com/RoboCoachTechnologies/ROScribe) is an open source project that uses human language interface to capture the details of your robotic project and creates the entire ROS packages for you.

**ROScribe motivates you to learn ROS**  
Learning ROS might feel intimidating for robotic enthusiasts, college students, or professional engineers who are using it for the first time. Sometimes this skill barrier forces them to give up on ROS altogether and opt out for non-standard options. We believe ROScribe helps students to better learn ROS and encourages them to adopt it for their projects.  
ROScribe eliminates the skill barrier for beginners, and saves time and hassle for skilled engineers.

**Using LLM to generate ROS**  
[ROScribe](https://github.com/RoboCoachTechnologies/ROScribe) combines the power and flexibility of large language models (LLMs) with prompt tuning techniques to capture the details of your robotic design and to automatically create an entire ROS package for your project. As of now, ROScribe supports both ROS1 and ROS2.

**Keeping human in the loop**  
Inspired by [GPT-Synthesizer](https://github.com/RoboCoachTechnologies/GPT-Synthesizer), the design philosophy of [ROScribe](https://github.com/RoboCoachTechnologies/ROScribe) is rooted in the core belief that a single prompt is not enough to capture the details of a complex design. Attempting to include every bit of detail in a single prompt, if not impossible, would cause losing efficiency of the LLM engine. Powered by LangChain, ROScribe captures the design specification, step by step, through an AI-directed interview that explores the design space with the user in a top-down approach. We believe that keeping human in the loop is crucial for creating a high quality output.

**Code generation and visualization**  
After capturing the design specification, ROScribe helps you with the following steps:

1. Creating a list of ROS nodes and topics, based on your application and deployment (e.g. simulation vs. real-world)
2. Visualizing your project in an RQT-style graph
3. Generating code for each ROS node
4. Writing launch file and installation scripts

**Source code and demo**  
For further detail of how to install and use ROScribe, please refer to our Github and watch our demo:  
[ROScribe open source repository](https://github.com/RoboCoachTechnologies/ROScribe)   
[TurtleSim demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2QaeelkReU) 

**Version v0.0.3 release notes**  
ROS2 integration:

* Now ROScribe supports both ROS1 and ROS2.
* Code generation for ROS2 uses rclpy instead of rospy
* Installation scripts for ROS2 use setup.py and setup.cfg instead of CMakeLists.txt.

**Roadmap**  
ROScribe supports both ROS1 and ROS2 with Python code generation. We plan to support the following features in the upcoming releases:

1. C++ code generation
2. ROS1 to ROS2 automated codebase migration
3. ROS-Industrial support
4. Verification of an already existing codebase
5. Graphic User Interface
6. Enabling and integrating other robotic tools

**Call for contributions**  
ROScribe is a free and open source software. We encourage all of you to try it out and let us know what you think. We have a lot of plans for this project and we intend to support and maintain it regularly. we welcome all robotics enthusiasts to contribute to ROScribe. During each release, we will announce the list of new contributors."

The company is developing a large language model that can generate realistic and engaging conversations. Character AI's technology is based on a transformer architecture, which is the same type of architecture that is used by GPT-3 and other large language models.

However, Character AI's model is specifically trained on dialogue data, which means that it is better at generating natural and engaging conversations than other large language models.

# Character AI has a number of potential applications, including:

* **Customer service:** Character AI's technology can be used to create chatbots that can provide customer service in a more natural and engaging way.
* **Education:** Character AI's technology can be used to create virtual tutors that can provide personalized instruction to students.
* **Entertainment:** Character AI's technology can be used to create video games, movies, and TV shows with more realistic and engaging characters.

Character AI is still in its early stages of development, but the company has already raised a significant amount of money from investors. The company's latest funding round will help it to accelerate the development of its technology and expand into new markets.

Here are some of the investors who participated in Character AI's latest funding round:

* Andreessen Horowitz
* Sequoia Capital
* YC Continuity
* Gradient Ventures
* General Catalyst

I am excited to see what the future holds for Character AI. The company has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with computers."

**Quick Prototyping**

Businesses can reap the benefits of developing new ideas and concepts by using the quick prototyping features of ChatGPT making them save time and resources for exploring novel ideas for their growth and advancement and boosting theri strength in the competitive business landscape. 

By utilizing and making use of the advantages of ChatGPT businesses can strategically improve their strategies and amplify their productivity. 

## Disadvantages of ChatGPT

ChatGPT is known to offer transformative power across industries and it is also challenged with several limitations. Knowing the disadvantages of ChatGPT will give us a broad understanding of using it efficiently. 

**Lacks Genuine Understanding**

ChatGPT only operates by relying on pattern recognition and fails to understand the context making it a limited tool when it comes to taking critical decisions. Businesses will find it irrelevant to rely on ChatGPT for such decisions that require a critical thought process. This is one of the biggest challenges and disadvantages of ChatGPT.

**Challenged with Ambiguity**

Another significant disadvantage of ChatGPT is its inability to comprehend ambiguous prompts for which they may come up with irrelevant answers that are seemingly plausible and accurate. 

**Issues of Ethical Concerns and Biases**

This again is one of the major disadvantages of ChatGPT. Implementing ChatGPT will also require constant monitoring of the outputs produced by the tool. ChatGPT is trained on a humungous number of data and datasets and their quality of being good and accurate relies on the quality of the data, Hence it is not a given that the data will be free of errors or bias. ChatGPT is only as good as the fuel - Data it is trained on. 

**Lacks Human Emotions**

ChatGPT being only a technology is devoid of sensing human emotions. It cannot understand emotions and feelings embedded in the text and prompts offered to the tool. Hence, it may result in offering insensitive responses. It lacks empathy and sensitivity to the user. 

These are the pros and cons of ChatGPT that characterise ChatGPT. Having an in-depth knowledge of this will help in a more informed usage.

16w5fif,1,2023-09-30,My take on the Second Wave Millennials/First Wave Homelanders gradient from a US perspective,u/GhostLocksmith,generationsdiscussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/generationsdiscussion/comments/16w5fif/my_take_on_the_second_wave_millennialsfirst_wave/,"This is my take on the SWM/FWH transition gradient. It may not have everything, as I generally do not put the starts/ends of pop cultural trends and the airings of shows in generational discussions. I also do not include preschool, since it is optional. College is also optional, but anyone of any age can attend and graduate college. This is the reason I put ""can apply to another birthyear"" next to a college-related ""first.""

1996:

* No FWH influence yet.

1997 (95 - 100% SWM, 0 - 5% FWH):

* First to enter elementary school after 9/11. 9/11 is often seen as the end of the ""end of history"", since many events that have occurred since may have never happened if 9/11 never happened.
* Oldest at high school when Gamergate happened. In my opinion, this event was the start of what was to come (like Trump winning 2016).

1998 (87.5 - 95% SWM, 5 - 12.5% FWH):

* First to enter elementary school after the start of the Iraq War, an event that started because the US believed that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. This would eventually lead to the demise of Saddam Hussein. Despite being hanged in 2006, the war would go on for another five years.
* Oldest at elementary school when the Great Recession happened, which was the largest financial crisis since 1929 and resulted in a large number of people that were unemployed.
* Oldest in middle school when the Iraq War ended.
* Oldest in middle school when the Trayvon Martin killing happened.
* Oldest at high school when gay marriage was legalized. This would eventually make people more accepting towards gay marriage.
* Oldest at college when Covid started becoming a major worldwide issue (can apply to another birthyear). This would lead to need for masks, vaccines, remote learning, and remote work.

1999 (80 - 87.5% SWM, 12.5 - 20% FWH):

* First to be born after Google is launched, which would forever change searching things on the Internet.
* First to enter elementary school after the releases of MySpace and Facebook, which ushered in the first bits of the Social Media Age.
* Oldest at middle school when the Sandy Hook shooting occurred.
* Oldest at high school when Trump got elected.
* Oldest at college when the January 6 Capitol attack occurred (can apply to another birthyear). This was the first major attack on the US Capitol since 1812.

2000 (65 - 80% SWM, 20 - 35% FWH):

* Born after the Y2K hysteria (did not happen).
* First to enter elementary school after the release of YouTube, which further brought us into the Social Media Age.
* Oldest at elementary school when Osama bin Laden was killed, which I thought was a turning point in the War on Terror because he was the mastermind of 9/11.
* Oldest at high school when the Marjory Stoneman Douglas shooting happened. This event was what made people know more about Generation Z's identity.

2001 (50 - 65% SWM, 35 - 50% FWH):

* Born after Bush 43 got elected in the controversial 2000 election against Al Gore.
* First to be born in the third millennium. Some people argue that the third millennium began on Jan 1, 2000, but there is no year zero. Thus, it actually began on Jan 1, 2001.
* First to enter elementary school after Hurricane Katrina. This event affected \~15 million people in the United States and arguably started the rise in gas prices ever since.
* Oldest in elementary school when the Iraq War ended.
* Oldest in elementary school when the Trayvon Martin killing occurred. This was arguably the starting point for modern racial tensions, and quite possibly Gamergate, the outcome of the 2016 election, etc.
* Oldest in middle school when Gamergate happened.
* Oldest in college when Queen Elizabeth II died at age 96. This made Charles III become King of England. Even though this was a UK event, events like this do not occur very often (this can apply to another birthyear).
* Oldest in college when ChatGPT was released. This would usher in the rise of artificial intelligence (this can apply to another birthyear).

\- Oldest in college when Covid no longer became a public health emergency of international concern on May 5, 2023 (this can apply to another birthyear).

2002 (35 - 50% SWM, 50 - 65% FWH):

* First to be born after 9/11.
* Born in the center of the analog/digital and VHS/DVD transition. Analog technology and VHS tapes were commonly used in the 80s and 90s, while digital technology and DVDs are commonly associated with the 21st century.
* First to be born when more than half of the US used the Internet (49.1% of the US used the Internet in 2001 and 58.8% of the US used it in 2002).
* First to start elementary school after the iPhone release. Although this is not really a historical marker, I thought that this ushered in the smartphone age.
* Oldest at elementary school when the Sandy Hook shooting occurred. On Dec 14, 2012, a gunman shot and killed 26 students at Sandy Hook elementary school. He also killed his mother before the shooting and eventually killed himself. Although Sandy Hook elementary school only went up to fourth grade, most elementary schools go up to fifth grade. Like Columbine, this was another event that led to children being more sheltered and was probably another turning point for the parenting system.
* Oldest at middle school when gay marriage was legalized.
* Oldest at high school when Covid became a major worldwide issue.

2003 (20 - 35% SWM, 65 - 80% FWH):

* First to be born after the establishment of Homeland Security, which was made to improve the US's security for multiple things, such as customs and immigration.
* First to be born after the start of the Iraq War.
* Actual oldest at Sandy Hook elementary school when the Sandy Hook shooting occurred.
* Oldest in high school when the January 6 Capitol attack happened.

2004 (12.5 - 20% SWM, 80 - 87.5% FWH):

* First to start elementary school after the Great Recession.
* Oldest in elementary school when Gamergate happened.
* Oldest in middle school when the Marjory Stoneman Douglas shooting happened.
* Oldest in high school when the Russian invasion of Ukraine started. This was where Vladimir Putin escalated the Russo-Ukrainian War that started in 2014.

2005 (5 - 12.5% SWM, 87.5 - 95% FWH):

* Oldest in elementary school when gay marriage was legalized.
* Oldest in high school when Queen Elizabeth II died.
* Oldest in high school when ChatGPT was released.
* Oldest in high school when Covid was no longer was a public health emergency of international concern.

2006 (0 - 5% SWM, 95 - 100% FWH):

* First to not be considered Millennials even by Strauss and Howe's generational theory.
* First to start elementary school after the killing of Osama bin Laden.
* Oldest at elementary school when Trump got elected.
* Oldest in middle school when Covid became a major worldwide issue.

2007:

* All SWM influence gone."

I'm not sure if this topic is related to social phenomena or issues in any way. According to ChatGPT (I know), it said it could be considered as one. I don't trust this, of course, so I really need the help of humans to advice me. Please. Thank you."
16wbc0p,1,2023-09-30,Is it bad to have more than one friend?,u/KamisamaDaiskette,AITAH,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/16wbc0p/is_it_bad_to_have_more_than_one_friend/,"(I used chatgpt to summarize it)

I always had a hard time making friends. High school was tough; I was bullied so relentlessly that I became scared to interact with anyone. College wasn't much different in my first year. I isolated myself, but in the second year, a girl (I'm also a girl) tried to befriend me. At first, I ignored her, but eventually, we became close friends as she shared my interests.

However, she became possessive, always getting aggressive when she saw me with other girls from my class. She'd criticize them, saying they were no good for me. To avoid conflict, I distanced myself from these classmates. While we shared interests, our financial situations differed, with her family struggling financially, and I lived with my parents, granting me more freedom.

As my communication skills improved, I started making more friends, sometimes with her and sometimes without. This change bothered her immensely. She'd get annoyed when I spent time with others and even left me abruptly during a film festival outing, causing me embarrassment.

Things took a darker turn when I noticed she started copying me in various aspects of life. She mimicked my music tastes, joined social media platforms I used, and even showed interest in starting a small business, mirroring my pursuits.

The breaking point came when I invited her to my home during a vacation, and she offended my mother. I took her side, leading to a conflict with my mom. My new well-paid job, combined with my studies and small business, left me exhausted. I befriended another classmate who also juggled part-time jobs, and we shared advice and made plans. This further upset my best friend, who believed she should be my only friend.

Her resentment grew, leading her to complain to our teacher about me copying her assignment. She even let me fall asleep during roll call, resulting in punishment. Worse yet, she attempted to frame me multiple times to tarnish my reputation. Fed up, I asked her not to talk to me, which infuriated her.

She called and texted relentlessly, even complaining to my mom, who was furious. I blocked her, thinking it was over, but upon returning from another vacation, I discovered that dorm students and even some off-campus students were ignoring me. My few close friends revealed that my former best friend had spread rumors about me.

My campus life became a nightmare. She had even manipulated the dorm's housekeeper to report false information to the department authorities. I'm left confused, wondering if it's really wrong to have more than one friend."
16wjik6,1,2023-09-30,Can I get some advice on my Statement of Purpose? Applying for SF State for Spring 2024 for Data Science and Machine Learning and the deadline is tomorrow,u/tehsexyone,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/16wjik6/can_i_get_some_advice_on_my_statement_of_purpose/,"With the recent rise in accessibility to Artificial Intelligence based systems, it’s now more important than ever to be prepared for how it will affect everyone’s daily lives. It is for this reason that I’m applying to the Data Science and Machine Learning program at San Francisco State University for the Spring semester of 2024. Through the experience and knowledge I’ve acquired from my undergraduate education until present day, I believe I have a skillset that will not only allow me to prepare for the changes to come, but develop AI with the purpose of helping others prepare as well. I see Artificial Intelligence as a tool that will allow people to do things they couldn’t do before, but a tool that’s still in development and one that requires careful facilitation before it can be used in an effective and ethical manner. 

I graduated from UC Santa Barbara with a Bachelor’s of Science in Physics and a Minor in Mathematics. Ever since High School, I’ve had a fascination with the nature and underlying patterns of mathematics. In 10th grade, I developed a method of interpolating polynomials given a set of numbers by observing the set of differences between each number. In college I opted to expand my knowledge in Math by taking upper division classes such as Numerical Analysis. It was in this class that I learned the language Python and discovered how I could implement my skillset in math to solving computer science problems. During my senior year I took a class on Linear Programming where I worked with partners to solve optimization problems using the program LINGO. Through this experience I got a taste of what it’s like to collaborate on solving math and coding problems in a group setting.

In my time since graduating, I’ve stayed persistent at fostering my skill in math by self studying books on topics I’m interested in. I’ve also worked on independent projects in Python such as one that can solve Ken Ken puzzles using elimination techniques. I believe the ability to translate human thinking into computational logic will be important to have for the Data Science and Machine Learning program. In working on Python projects, I’ve seen what kind of challenges I’ll face when I enter workforce. I’ve also worked as a Math Tutor at Sylvan Learning Center of San Francisco to help students develop the mathematical understanding they will need as developing members of society. In this experience I’ve seen first hand how younger people today are affected by the advent of artificial intelligence, especially in the industry of education.

In the future, I wish to bridge the gap between what computers are able to do and what humans are able to do. One of the biggest limitations I’ve noticed in programs such as ChatGPT and Midjourney is how un-human the creative works tend to be. Humans are good at generating ideas, and computers are good at executing them. I’ve always had a desire to express myself creatively, and I believe that other people are the same. Through getting a Master’s of Science in Machine Learning and entering the workforce, I wish to develop Artificial Intelligence in such a way that it allows people to generate creative ideas that computers can execute on. As AI takes over the job market, more and more focus will have to be put on jobs that require human ideas such as storytelling, which is a personal aspiration of mine. I want to develop tools that will allow people to easily bring their creative ideas to life and share them with people."
